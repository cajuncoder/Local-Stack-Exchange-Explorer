"Is there a standard height and depth for stairs?","521917","","<p>Is there a standard (or a standard range for) the height and depth of each step in a flight of stairs?</p>

<p>If your answer refers to your building code, please say where you live.</p>
","<p>The general rule (in the US) is 7-11 (a 7 inch rise and 11 inch run).  More exactly, no more than 7 3/4 inches for the riser (vertical) and a minimum of 10 inches for the tread (horizontal or step).

"How can I remove a really stuck screw?","443842","","<p>I often come across screws that just won't budge with a manual screwdriver or even a driver bit in a drill.  They are of different screw types and heads in a variety of different materials. What are some techniques I can use to try and remove them?</p>
","<h1>Twist in the proper direction</h1>

<p>Are you turning the right way?  Remember, <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=righty%20tighty%20lefty%20loosy"" rel=""noreferrer"">""<em>Righty tighty, Lefty loosy</em>""</a> (which never made sense to me). Most screws are right-handed threads, so you'll turn them anti(counter)-clockwise to remove them.  In some situations left-hand thread screws are used (usually to prevent screws from loosening due to rotational forces), so you'll actually have to turn the screw clock-wise to loosen it.  </p>

<p>Sometimes tightening the screw very, very slightly, can loosen it up enough that it can be removed.</p>

<h1>Muscle</h1>

<p>The first thing to try, is simply to apply more inward force while turning.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iI0x6.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<ul>
<li>Use a screwdriver with a head that fits snugly in the screw head.</li>
<li>Put the palm of one hand on the back side of the screwdriver handle, and wrap your other hand around the handle ready to twist.</li>
<li>Push the screwdriver as hard as you can with your back hand into the screw, and twist with your other hand.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using a screwdriver with a hexagonal or square shaft, you can grip the shaft of the screwdriver with an adjustable spanner (wrench) or vise grips. This will allow you to exert more torque, and may put you in a better position to push the screwdriver harder into the screw head.</p>

<h1>Lube</h1>

<p>Sometimes screws seize up due to rust, or other debris.  Soaking the area with penetrating oil, may free up the screw enough for you to remove it.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TOcCE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ul>
<li>Apply a liberal amount of penetrating oil to the area.</li>
<li>Allow the oil to soak in for 5-10 minutes.</li>
<li>Try to remove the screw (by conventional means, and using the technique above).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Rapping, Tapping, and Banging</h1>

<p>If both methods above have not worked, giving the area a sharp tap with a hammer might break the screw free.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jl8h6.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ul>
<li>Hit the screw and surrounding area with a series of sharp taps with your hammer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, you're not trying to knock the screw into next week, you just want to loosen it up (though there are situations where you'll have to give the piece a healthy whack).</p>

<h1>Impact Driver</h1>

<p>For really stuck screws, you can use a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_driver"" rel=""noreferrer"">manual impact driver</a>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GuCYk.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ul>
<li>Attach a bit that fits snugly in the screw slot</li>
<li>Set the driver to spin in the proper direction (this process varies from tool to tool, but most commonly, you'll compress the driver and twist).</li>
<li>Place the driver on the screw, and hold the driver as straight as possible (keep you hands away from both ends of the tool).</li>
<li>Give the back side of the driver a whack with a hammer (a rubber mallet or non-marring hammer is good for this).</li>
<li>Repeat until the screw starts to twist (most impact drivers have to be ""reset"" between strikes, so don't forget to reset the driver before whacking it again).</li>
<li>Once the screw is freed up, use a regular screwdriver to remove it. </li>
</ul>

<p>This may not always be the best tool when working with sensitive electronics or delicate equipment, but it's very useful for removing stuck screws. </p>

<h1>Drilling</h1>

<p>If you still cannot remove the screw, as a last resort you can drill the screw out.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0SDxG.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ul>
<li>Select a drill bit that is just smaller than the shaft of the screw you want to remove (you may have to guess if you can't see the whole screw, but you can always go bigger later so start small).</li>
<li>Place the bit in a drill.</li>
<li>Place the tip of the bit in the center of the head of the screw.</li>
<li>Drill until the screw comes free, or until you think you are deep enough.</li>
<li>If the screw did not come free, switch to a slightly larger bit and drill again.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a last-ditch effort, and will destroy the screw (and possibly the threads in the hole, if not done correctly).  Use this technique only as your last resort.</p>

<h1>Explosives</h1>

<p>Remove the screw, and everything else in a 20ft. radius.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5wGga.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ul>
<li>Place the charge on the screw.</li>
<li>Light the fuse.</li>
<li>Run like hell.</li>
<li>Cover your ears.</li>
<li>Bask in destructive glory.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's a good idea to film the explosion using a high-speed camera, so you can <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_urLWPrONI"" rel=""noreferrer"">watch it over and over again in super slow-mo</a>. </p>

"How can I add a ""C"" wire to my thermostat?","413792","","<p>So, the spiffy new wi-fi thermostats want power on the C wire from thermostat, but the old thermostat doesn't have a C wire at it.  What's the easiest way to add the C wire/24 volt to the thermostat location?</p>
","<h1>More than you've ever wanted to know about the <code>C</code> wire:</h1>

<p>Lets start by explaining what the <code>C</code> wire is, and why it's needed.</p>

<h1>Ye olde thermostat</h1>

<p>In the olden days thermostats were simple switch devices, that used <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_switch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mercury Switches</a> to complete the circuit and turn on the heat/AC.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mercury switches were commonly used in bimetal thermostats. The weight
  of the movable mercury drop provided some hysteresis by moving the
  bimetal spring slightly beyond the point it would normally assume,
  thereby holding the thermostat off slightly longer before flipping to
  the on state and then holding the thermostat on slightly longer before
  flipping back to the off state. The mercury also provided a very
  positive on/off switching action and could withstand millions of
  cycles without degradation of the contacts.
  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_switch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of this, there was no reason to run a return wire to the thermostat. For example a thermostat that only controlled heat, would only require 2 wires.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/psCg3.png"" alt=""Thermostat wiring without a C wire""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2iRIE.gif"" alt=""Thermostat wiring without a C wire showing electricity""></p>

<h1>Welcome to the future</h1>

<p>Newer thermostats that offer clocks, backlit displays, WiFi, etc. are controlled using circuit boards and integrated circuits.  These new circuits require a path for electricity to return to the source, and so require an extra wire.  This new wire is known as the <code>C</code> wire, or <code>Common</code> wire.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVtTf.png"" alt=""Thermostat wiring with a C wire""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Htu7d.gif"" alt=""Thermostat wiring with a C wire showing electricity""></p>

<h1>How do I get a <code>C</code> wire?</h1>

<p>If you're lucky when you upgrade to a newer thermostat that requires this connection, there will be an extra (unused) wire in the cable at the thermostat.  If you're not, you'll have to run new cable to the thermostat.</p>

<p>If you have heat and AC, you'll have to pull an 18/5 cable. If you have just heat you can get away with pulling 18/3 cable, but you may want to pull 18/5 anyway to make adding AC in the future easier.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YcvAH.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h1>What do all these wires do anyway?</h1>

<p>There are no standards for wire color, so any wire <em>could</em> be used for any purpose.  The most common color code would be (<em>note: this is for forced air furnaces, heat pumps and other systems may be different</em>). </p>

<ul>
<li>Red - <code>R</code> - 24VAC</li>
<li>Red - <code>Rh</code> - 24VAC (dedicated to heat call)</li>
<li>Red - <code>Rc</code> - 24VAC (dedicated to cooling call)</li>
<li>Green - <code>G</code> - Fan on</li>
<li>White - <code>W</code> - Heat call</li>
<li>Yellow - <code>Y</code> - Cool call</li>
<li>Blue or Black - <code>C</code> - Common</li>
</ul>

<h1>Alternative Solution</h1>

<h1>A bit more about transformers and <code>C</code> wires.</h1>

<p>A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">transformer</a> uses coils of wire, magnetism, and a bit of magic to transfer energy from the <strong>primary</strong> side of the transformer to the <strong>secondary</strong> side of the transformer.  Usually during the transfer, the voltage is either increased or decreased. In the case of our furnace we're likely talking about taking 120VAC, and transforming it into 24VAC. Once the voltage has been reduced, we can use the lower voltage and a thermostat to control the furnace.</p>

<p>Now that you know even less about transformers than you did before, lets look at a diagram.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QeZbQ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QeZbQ.png"" alt=""Highlighted Furnace Wiring Diagram""></a></p>

<p>This is an actual wiring diagram from a furnace, but you'll notice I've highlighted a few things.  First, in red I've highlighted the 120V primary side of the transformer. I've also highlighted the secondary side of the transformer in a couple shades of blue. This was done to illustrate that one side of the transformers secondary winding (light blue), is attached to the <code>R</code> or power terminal. While the other side of the secondary winding (dark blue), is attached to the <code>C</code> or ""neutral"" terminal.</p>

<h2>Locating transformers</h2>

<h3>On a schematic</h3>

<p>On a schematic or wiring diagram, a transformer will look something like this.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GE99S.png"" alt=""Transformer Symbol""></p>

<p>Often you'll see a number written on each side, which denotes the expected voltages on each side of the transformer. Notice in the schematic above that the top side lists 120V (120 volts), while the bottom lists 24V (24 volts).</p>

<h3>In the real world</h3>

<p>When actually digging through HVAC equipment, a transformer will look something like this.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9W0eRm.jpg"" alt=""Transformer"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dveiMm.png"" alt=""Transformer""></p>

<p>Notice the rectangular middle section, flanked by a bulge on each side. These are the typical physical characteristics of a transformer. </p>

<h2>Volt-Amperes</h2>

<p>Transformers typically have a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt-ampere"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">volt-ampere (VA)</a> rating, which can be used to determine the amount of current that can safely flow through the transformers coil wires.  To determine the maximum current, simply divide the VA value by the voltage.  </p>

<p>For example, a 120V/24V 40 VA transformer would be capable of 1.66667 amperes on the secondary.</p>

<p><code>40VA / 24V = 1.66667A</code></p>

<p>and .3333 amperes on the primary</p>

<p><code>40VA / 120V = .3333A</code></p>

<p>Normally this is not a problem, since the only things supplied by the transformer are switches and relays. If you install a thermostat that draws more current than the transformer can carry, you're going run into problems.  So in this case, you'll have to upgrade the transformer and any fuses that protect it (since the fuses are sized based on the VA rating).</p>

"Why does my toilet randomly start running?","382606","","<p>Sometimes my toilet starts running for a few seconds at a time, like it's just finishing filling up the tank.</p>

<p>Usually this happens when the bathtub is being drained, or when I turn on the facets in the sink, but I think it also happens sometimes when no water is being used anywhere else.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell the flapper in the tank is working fine, and I don't see any leaks anywhere.</p>
","<p>The typical toilet tank will have a flapper which seals the water in the tank. When you flush the toilet, the flapper is lifted and water is allowed to move from the tank into the bowl. Once a set amount of water has exited the tank, the flapper falls back down and re-seals the tank.</p>

<p>The most common issue with toilets randomly flushing is that the flapper has become brittle or sediment has formed on the flapper/tank which prevents the flapper making a complete seal. This will allow water to slowly drip from the tank into the bowl. If enough water is permitted to leak out of the tank, the filling mechanism will be triggered and the tank will refill. If enough water enters the toilet bowl, the self-siphonage will be triggered and the bowl will drain into the sewage system.</p>

"What is the proper procedure to apply multiple coats of Polyurethane?","344593","","<p>Polyurethane is confusing me. ;)</p>

<p>I'm finishing a table top with polyurethane. I've sanded down the original finish to bare wood down to 220 grit paper. </p>

<p>I vacuumed and wiped it all down, then did a final wipe with a rag and some mineral spirits. After drying, I then put on the first coat. </p>

<p>It's been about 2 hours, and this is where I'm stumped.</p>

<p>The can says to re-apply coats after 2 hours, but doesn't say to sand. It does say that if you wait 24 hours, then you should sand.</p>

<p>Researching on the internet, the common advice appears to be sand between every coat.</p>

<p>So, the questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>should one sand between every single coat?</li>
<li>how long should one wait before sanding?</li>
</ul>

<p>My understanding of the can label is that multiple coats are fine after 2 hours WITHOUT sanding. They're also fine after 24 hours WITH sanding. Is that correct? Any thoughts on which method is better?</p>

<p>FWIW, this is a satin finish, as I'm purposefully trying to knock down any sheen to give it the barest-of-wood look I can, so super-smooth glossy isn't a priority on this project. </p>

<p>UPDATE: BONUS QUESTION!</p>

<p>What's everyone's opinion on 'with' vs. 'cross' grain bush application? Always go with the grain? Alternate between coats? </p>
","<p>When you apply multiple coats of urethane, any dust or small flaws will be amplified with each new coat. If you want the smoothest finish possible, then wait until it is dry, very lightly sand with very fine paper (220 or finer) to remove any dust bumps, wipe it clean with a slightly damp cloth or tact rag, let it dry or buff it dry with a dry cloth, then apply the next coat. There is no reason to use mineral spirits, actually I would advise you not to use mineral spirits.</p>

<p>I see no advantage to applying successive coats with, then against the grain. As long as you apply an even coat with a good quality brush or foam brush and don't overwork it, any brush marks should disappear. The finished product should be so smooth that you couldn't tell which way you brushed the urethane on.  Also, if you are using a satin finish urethane, be sure to mix it well, stirred, not shaken. The dulling agents tend to fall to the bottom, so it is important to mix it well. No matter how many coats you apply, it should not become ""glossy"".  </p>

"What's the most common cause of A/C refrigerant lines freezing?","340711","","<p>I noticed my house wasn't getting under 75°F this weekend when I had the thermostat set for 70°F. Since I'd done a lot of drywall sanding inside recently, my first idea was to replace the filthy air filter. </p>

<ul>
<li>My first indication that the air filter wasn't the root cause was when the return didn't have enough suction to hold the air filter in place while I was replacing it.</li>
<li>I went outside to look at the compressor unit and discovered the exposed portion of the refrigerant line running into the house was frozen, but the fan was still running.</li>
<li>The evaporator drain line still had a steady stream of water coming out of it.</li>
<li>After turning everything off and waiting for the line to thaw, I turned the thermostat back on. Cooler air came out of the vents, but it didn't seem to be blowing with much force, and it wasn't as cool as it should be.</li>
<li>I went back outside and discovered the refrigerant line was already frosting up again. At this point it was already dark, so I turned everything back off and slept with the ceiling fan on. :/</li>
</ul>

<p>Other random notes that may or may not play a factor:</p>

<ul>
<li>The AC unit had been sitting idle the past 3 days since we had nice weather in the mid-70's last week.</li>
<li>I mowed the lawn next to the condenser unit the day I noticed it stopped working. However, I was bagging the grass clippings, so nothing should have been blown into the unit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any ideas on the root cause of the icing <em>and</em> lower air flow? I wouldn't think the two would be connected normally. Is it something as simple as low refrigerant levels? I plan on going to look more closely at it after work today. What are some other things I should pay attention to?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I checked the system after work today and decided to give it one more chance after I couldn't find anything wrong with it. After a few hours, it had brought the inside temperature down from 80°F to 75°F. I periodically checked the refrigerant line for freezing, but it never got much colder than 60ish degrees.</p>

<p>I think the root cause was the air filter, and that I didn't allow enough time for the line to thaw last night.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> Maybe I drew conclusions too soon - I just checked the refrigerant line and discovered frost on it again. The inside temperature was at 72°F while the outside was at 66°F. I think pumping warm air to a cooler outside temperature may have contributed to the icing, but I'm not completely sure. (And if you think I'm crazy for running the AC when I could just open the window, you'd think twice too if you saw how many bugs swarm my porch light and windows every night. Dozens of them somehow find their way past the screens if I open the windows.) I plan on running it again tomorrow during the day and monitoring the refrigerant line temperature every few hours. If it freezes up again, I think I'm going to cave and call a repair guy.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3:</strong>  I totally forgot to follow up on this. It froze again, so I called an HVAC repair guy. He checked the system, added refrigerant, and problem solved. I think the bill came out somewhere around $150 for the service call fee and refrigerant costs.</p>
","<p>You may be looking at the problem backwards, the freezing lines could be a symptom of the problem not the cause.  Start by looking for blockages in the system that would cause lower air flow / heat exchange.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dirty filters.</li>
<li>Clogged ducts.</li>
<li>Closed dampers.</li>
<li>Closed/Blocked vent covers.</li>
<li>Dirty coils.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically if the system cannot exchange the heat/cold, it will not function properly and could lead to over heating/cooling.</p>

<p>Frozen lines could also be caused by high or low levels of refrigerant, so you'll want to get a service person out to check the refrigerant levels. </p>

<p>Concrete does risk rotting the wood because of water build up, but that can be mitigated with proper drainage. Dirt footers can be problematic if you have very loose dirt in your yard.  Dirt requires lots of work with something heavy to compact it, concrete requires mixing and handling concrete.</p>

<p>We set ours in dirt/gravel and realized it was exactly the right choice when our fence was hit by a car 4 months after we built it. The car shattered two 4x4 posts, a gate, and several rails, a 3rd posts was pulled from the ground, and every other post along the run titled about 5 degrees including a 6x6 corner post; 10 posts had to be reset in all. Our neighbor (whose fence was also hit) had concrete footers, which were pulled from the ground, or shifted several inches but left in the ground. His footers had to be removed and replaced, and all new posts were required. We had to replace the damaged parts (2 posts, a gate and several rails), but we could reset the others. If we'd had concrete I suspect more would have broken, and we would have been unable easily reset any that had titled (granted fewer might have tilted but that energy had to go somewhere, hence the assumption about more broken posts).</p>

"Understanding US Screw Sizes","303219","","<p>I'm going to be building a workbench, so I've been 'screw shopping.'  I need some explanation on the sizing of screws when they are advertised as (example) 6 x 3/4"".  I know that 3/4"" is the length of the screw, but what does the 6 mean?</p>
","<p>""6"" is a #6-size screw. Screw gauges are a measure of the head size and shaft size, and are roughly linear but not quite a 1:1 relationship (a #8 screw is a little less than twice the diameter of a #4 screw). There isn't a good system for converting gauge to a calibrated measurement, so you're best off consulting a table like this: <a href=""http://hingedummy.info/screwinfopage2.htm"">http://hingedummy.info/screwinfopage2.htm</a></p>

<p>Screws have three basic measurements: gauge, threads per inch, and shaft length in inches. So, you may also see a measurement like 6-32 x 1 1/2"". This means it's a #6 diameter, with 32 threads per inch (almost double the normal thread count as a standard wood screw) and an inch and a half long. When the middle number is absent (6 x 1 1/2""), the screw has the ""normal"" number of threads per inch for that size and type of screw (for #6 wood screws that's 18).</p>

"How long should I wait before plugging in a new refrigerator?","280926","","<p>Today I received my new refrigerator, and I've been told not to plug it in until a couple of hours have gone by. Some people told me a couple of hours was enough, but others have told me up to 12 hours. I understand the reasons as to why do this (although there's probably more to it than what I know).</p>

<p>How long should I really wait? Is there some science into this?</p>
","<p>The short answer is to check with the manufacturer.  That way you can be sure to stay within warranty guidelines. </p>

<p>The longer answer is that it varies from model to model.  When a refrigerator is placed in a non-standard position (for example on its side), compressor oil can run out of the compressor and up refrigerant lines.  So if you don't stand it upright and wait, the compressor will pump without sufficient oil -- not good.  </p>

"What are the pros and cons of a whole house humidifier?","256473","","<p>In the winter, my house (~2500 sqft) becomes unbearably dry.  Last winter, my wife and I used a tiny humidifier for the master bedroom to keep us from completely drying out, but since then I have been exploring a whole-house solution, complete with humidistat.  It seems well within my ability to install it.</p>

<p>The trouble is, everywhere I've read that a whole house humidifier should not be needed.  Normal humidity, they say, should be maintained simply by normal activity (showering, cooking, etc.).  If the house is dry, it's far more likely to be that I have leaks (say, around my recessed lighting), and then adding a humidifier would risk mold issues.</p>

<p>So this is my dilemma: in order to find air leaks, everything I've read is that I'd need to have an HVAC guy come out with a blower door, which is very <strong>not</strong> DIY.  So, expensive.  Or, I could go boldly forth and just install the humidifier, in spite of the fact that I might not need it.</p>

<p>So, what should I do? Any guidance would be most helpful here.</p>
","<p>I went though a similar debate last year and ended up getting a whole house humidifier.  I never remember reading that you should be able to get the humidity level to normal levels though normal means (shower, cooking, etc).  In a big house, that is most likely not possible.  Do you have a humidistat now, or does your stand alone unit give you a reading?  I would recommend you getting one of those first to see how bad it truly is. If I remember correctly, if your humidity is below 30%, you could actually be causing harm to yourself and your home. </p>

<p>Our house approached 25%, which is dangerously low.  Some of the driest deserts in the world don't get that low.  For example, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity#Most_humid_places_on_Earth"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Las Vegas ranges from 21%-39%</a>.  You may be living in conditions that are way too dry.</p>

<p>All that being said, I knew we needed to do something.  You mentioned worrying about mold, sure this could happen if you raise your humidity very high, but think about it, in the summer your home probably approaches 80%-90%.  With humidity that hight, and the warm temperatures, that natural condition is more likely to produce mold than your 70 degree house in the winter.  Plus, you will find just increasing your humidity to like 35%-40% with your whole house humidifier makes it very comfortable.  AT that level, mold is unlikely an issue.  The added bonus us that the more humid the house is, the warmer it feels.  Again, just like in the summer, a humid 90 degrees is much warmer than a dry 90 degrees.    We found we were able to decrease the temp of the house simply by adding a little humidity.  Used to be 72 degrees at about 25-30% humidity, we now keep it at 70 and 35-40%.  So we save heating costs there.</p>

<p>Ok, so what kind to buy?  I researched the various types of whole house humidifiers, and it comes down to three types.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Drum</strong> - These are the least expensive and easy to install.  They install on your cold air return line, and use a motor and belt to essentially lift cold water from a drum into the the air and let evaporation and the passing air movement to pick up the moisture.  These require considerable maintenance it has standing water and risk of mold due to the standing water.  You have to replace the belt frequently.  I opted to not get this one due to the standing water and maintenance issues.</li>
<li><strong>Flow Through</strong> - These can be installed on return or supply line.  These are the middle of the road in cost and performance.  Again, they also use evaporation, but you do not have standing water.  There is a filter that water flows through (drip) and the air blows through the filter.  The water however, needs to be drained, and new water is always trickling though.  Since it always uses new water, the risk of mold is almost none.  Uses no electricity, but does requires a water line and is always using new water.</li>
<li><strong>Mist / Steam</strong> - The most expensive, but most effective.  They actually produce steam, rather than relying on evaporation.  Because of this, you can more easily control the desired humidity.  Can come in cold and hot water forms, injecting hot or cold steam into your supply line.  Requires both electricity and a water supply line.  Risk of mold is low due to no standing water, but the hot steam could cause issue in your ducts if you run it too often and too high I imagine.</li>
</ol>

<p>I opted for the steam model, mainly because of the low maintenance and ability to control the desired humidity more easily.  I installed it in an afternoon, it was easy to do.  Most of them come with high end humidistat / thermostat, that would replace your existing house thermostat.  Then the system knows how to control the furnace to optimize the output.  I went with the <a href=""https://forwardthinking.honeywell.com/products/humidification/steam-systems/steam_humidification.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Honeywell TrueSTEAM series</a> and it has worked great.

"What direction should laminate flooring be placed in?","254973","","<p>I'm thinking of installing laminate flooring and have a question: If I'm installing laminate throughout the house, should ALL of it be going in the same direction? </p>

<p>Say for example, let's say I have a hallway that is perpendicular to a large living room.  </p>

<pre><code>---------------
|             |
|             |
|             |
|             |--------------------

|
|             |-------------------- 
|             |
|             |
---------------
</code></pre>

<p>In the layout above, would all of the laminate be installed ""left to right"" for both the living room and hallway? Or could it be installed in one direction for one room and installed in a different direction for the other room?</p>
","<p>Strip flooring can be installed in any direction in any room, however the convention is to run <strong>parallel with the longest wall</strong> in most situations. Rarely is this type of flooring run perpendicular to walls in a hallway. Not only does it tend to make a hallway look narrower than it actually is, but can cause a lot of waste of material when installing. Don't be afraid of changing directions from the room to the hallway if your using a good wood product that can be cut cleanly on a table or chop saw. You simply need to make a very straight and slightly back angled edge (maybe 2 degrees) so the adjoining 90 degree slats are tight with no open gaps. This is extremely difficult to do with cheap laminate, but not so much with a good wood product. </p>

<p>There are transition pieces available for both styles, but they usually involve a change of floor level like a threshold and are not a good idea to use on open flooring, as they can create a tripping hazard, however they are fine to use in doorways etc.  If you really want to have different directions between spaces, consider using a darker color ""frame"" around the room. This can make a very attractive transition to a large hallway or separate use area in an open design. </p>

<hr>

<p>Let me add that I am NOT a fan of laminate flooring. Laminate flooring comes in a wide variety of quality levels, from extremely poor to fairly good, but share a common trait. They are always a ""picture"" of wood on some pressed paper or synthetic backing. They can be miserable to work with, easily damaged and almost impossible to repair after installation. Consider an engineered wood ""click lock"" instead. Pricing is very close and the engineered products usually are much more stable due to having a solid plywood backing, and somewhat refinish-able with a true hardwood veneer. They also handle the occasional water spill much better than most laminates that usually swell, bubble and blister at the site of water! </p>

<p>Another serious consideration is what type of flooring to use in a large high traffic area vs a smaller room. Laminates are almost always floating and will invariably sound hollow and creak as the temperature changes. For instances, walking across a cold laminate floor first thing in the morning can be like entering a haunted house at a fun park! Seriously investigate the advantages of a better quality engineered product.</p>

","<p>Water heaters have a dip tube on the cold water side that puts the cold water into the bottom of the tank. If water pressure is lost on the cold water side, the tank can siphon down through the cold water inlet till it reaches the bottom of the dip tube. Then since there's no water in the tank to absorb heat, the dip tube can melt and the tank can be damaged.</p>

<p>It would be best to at least set the heater so it is on pilot only.</p>

","<p>Yes, in most US residential construction they are 16"" center to center. Most of your standard tape measures have every 16th inch noted in red or some other way. Some internal walls may also be spaced 24"" on center.</p>

"How do you know when and where it is safe to drill into a wall? ","225549","","<p>Lots of home projects involve cutting or drilling through walls (everything from nails, screws, or hooks to mount things to cutting through drywall and drilling through studs to run wire).</p>

<p>In general, how do you know what's safe to break through and what isn't? In other words, when can you just start drilling through a wall and when do you need to be worried about hitting electrical lines, plumbing, etc.</p>
","<p>Electrical wires typically run either vertically, up and down the side of a stud (with staples), in order to reach receptacles, ceiling lights/fans, etc., and horizontally in order to get across the room(s).  The vertical wires are typically pretty easy to avoid: avoid drilling/nailing above a receptacle or light switch, or, if you have to, avoid missing on the side that the receptacle is nailed to.  The horizontal runs should have enough play in them to avoid most damage, unless you drill/nail into the hole in the stud (called a nipple) that they pass through.</p>

<p>I don't think that it's required that you put any metal plate on the stud in order to protect the Romex/cable/conduit, but rather that it is only required if you drill the nipple too close to one side of the stud, at which point a metal brace is needed in order to ensure structural strength.  Outside of drilling/nailing into an unprotected nipple, or very near it, there is little to worry about when it comes to the electrical.</p>

<p>When it comes to pipe, you should be able to tell if you hit copper pipe.  Even though it might be one of the softer metals, it's still going to offer a substantial amount of resistance, and unless you hit it where it passes through a stud, your nail/drillbit will probably deflect off of the curved surface of the copper pipe.  With PVC or ABS, however, yeah, you're most likely going to have a leak if you hit it squarely with a drillbit, maybe even a nail.</p>

<p>When it comes to cutting large holes in drywall, cut horizontally first -- if there's a stud or vertical pipe, it's better for you to find it immediately, at which point you might decide it's better to make a new hole on the other side of the stud, rather than later, after you've already made a long vertical cut in the drywall.</p>

"Why do my LED lights stay on, even when the switch is off?","224612","","<p>I have two LED lamps in my corridor, and when I switch them off, they keep emitting light (not very strong, but it's annoying at night).</p>

<p>What can it be? How can I fix it?</p>
","<p>Some light switches run a small amount of current through the bulbs even when off, usually to power small devices at the switch like a timer, motion sensor, or night light. Do your switches have either of those features, or something else like that?</p>

<p>The way those devices work is instead of having a hot/neutral pair powering the switch, they just sit inline with the hot wire and draw a very small amount of power. Old fashioned incandescent bulbs won't light up if there's only a small amount of electricity running through them, so you would never notice this current, but LEDs are much more efficient and apparently are getting enough power to run.</p>

<p>If that is the cause of the problem, there are a few solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Swap out the light switches for regular ones. You'll lose whatever additional functionality they have.</li>
<li>Upgrade your switches to ones that have both a neutral and a hot wire, instead of just the hot wire. This may be relatively straightforward or extremely difficult, depending on whether the neutral for the light goes through the same box as the switch. (Note that even if you do have a neutral at the box it may be a little tricky to wire it up, since you might have to cut it and then add a pigtail or two.)</li>

"What is a GFI outlet used for, and where should I install them?","223783","","<p>What purpose does a GFI serve?  Where should they be used?  </p>
","<p>A GFI, or GFCI - Ground Fault Circuit Interupter device protects us from receiving electric shocks from faults in the electrical devices we use in our home. It works by comparing the input current on the hot side to the output current on the neutral side. If there's the slightest difference in current, on the order of a few milliamps, then there is current leaking out somewhere, possibly through somebody's body. To protect us in this situation, the device very quickly cuts off the power supply to the leaking device, within 20-30 milliseconds, greatly reducing any possible human tissue damage from errant current.</p>

<p>GFCI proctection should be provided anywhere there is a receptacle installed in an area subject to moisture, as the presence of moisture greatly increases the danger of accidental shock. The National Electric Code specifies many such areas in residential dwelling units, such as, but not limited to: Bathrooms; Garages and accessory buildings; All exterior receptacles; Crawl spaces; Unfinished basements; Kitchens; Laundry, Utility, Wet Bar Sink Areas; and Boathouses. Local building authorities may have additional requirements. The list of areas requiring GFCI protection has increased with every code revision. They were initially only required around pool areas in the '70s. Now they seem to be required nearly everywhere. You should question your local building authority for the latest, complete requirements.</p>

<p>GFCI protection can be provided either at the outlet by the now familiar outlet with the test and reset buttons, or at the distribution panel by way of a GFCI circuit breaker, which protects all outlets on the circuit it controls. Additional outlets can be protected downstream of the local outlet type with push buttons by wiring the added outlets to the LOAD side of the local GFCI device.</p>

<p>Thus, it is not possible to tell if a receptacle is GFCI protected or not by just looking at it. If any particular outlet doesn't seem to be providing power, not only should you check the circuit breakers, but also check any GFCI outlets with push buttons in the area.</p>

"When should pipe dope vs thread tape be used?","217030","","<p>For threaded plumbing connections, you typically use pipe dope or thread tape (aka teflon tape). Are there situations when one is preferred over another? Does the size of the pipe, type of pipe, part being connected, or other variable make a difference in the selection?</p>

<p>Note, this assumes you aren't using <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/q/21066/2196"">both at the same time</a>.</p>
","<p>Whether dope is required at all, is dependent on the type of threads. The type of thread is determined by the tap or die used to create the threads, and should be labeled on the pipe or fitting.</p>

<h1>Thread Standards</h1>

<h2>National Pipe Thread (NPT)</h2>

<p>This type of thread when mated, may contain slight gaps between the major and minor diameter of the threads. Because of this, a thread seal agent <em>may</em> be required. However, this type of thread is tapered at a rate of 1/16 (3/4""/foot), which often allows a seal to be made without a sealing agent.</p>

<p><em>May be listed as MNPT or FNPT, for male and female threads respectively.</em></p>

<h2>National Pipe Thread Fuel (NPTF)</h2>

<p>NPTF threads are designed so that when the threads are mated, they actually deform to create a mechanical seal. Since the seal is created by the threads themselves, a thread seal agent is not required (though may be used as a lubricant).</p>

<p><em>May be listed as MNPTF or FNPTF, for male and female threads respectively.</em></p>

<h2>National Pipe Straight (NPS)</h2>

<p>This type of thread is similar to NPT, except that the thread does not have a taper. A thread seal agent is required, but should be selected differently due to the lack of taper.</p>

<p><em>May be listed as MNPS or FNPS, for male and female threads respectively.</em></p>

<h2>National Pipe Straight Fuel (NPSF)</h2>

<p>NPSF like NPTF creates a mechanical seal due to the deformation of the threads, however, unlike NPTF NPSF threads are not tapered.</p>

<p><em>May be listed as MNPSF or FNPSF, for male and female threads respectively.</em></p>

<h1>Selecting Dope</h1>

<p>Which form of dope you choose is often based on who you learned from, personal preference, what's on hand, what type of pipe you're working with, etc. The following are my personal guidelines. </p>

<h2>Water</h2>

<h3>Plastic, Soft Metals, Unreactive Metals</h3>

<p>In this situation I'll reach for PTFE tape, since it's not likely I'll require long term corrosion protection.  I'm just looking to lubricate the joint, so I can tighten it to create a leak free joint.</p>

<h3>Steel, Reactive Metals</h3>

<p>Because I don't want the threads to rust or react negatively, in this situation I'll use paste dope. The paste dope will give me the lube I need to get the pipes properly joined, while at the same time providing corrosion protection.  The paste dope will never harden or flake off, so I know the threads will be protected for a long time.</p>

<h3>Large Diameter Pipe</h3>

<p>If I'm working with water pipe of any material larger than ~1"", I'll always use paste dope.  I don't really have any particular reason for this, it's just the way I was taught.</p>

<h2>Fuel Gas</h2>

<p>When working with fuel gas pipes of any kind, I always use a paste dope labeled for this use. This is especially true when working with ""black"" pipe, since I want some corrosion protection in these joints.</p>

<h2>Tapered VS. Straight Threads</h2>

<h3>Tapered Threads</h3>

<p>For pipes and fittings with tapered threads, I'll simply follow the guidelines mentioned above.</p>

<h3>Straight Threads</h3>

<p>When working with fittings with straight threads, paste dope should <strong>always</strong> be used.  Tape dope is too thick, and can actually prevent a good seal in straight thread joints. Paste dope will spread and be pushed out of the way, and will not prevent the threads from properly engaging. </p>

","<p>There are several kinds of drywall anchors and they each have their own weight rating. Some work by drilling a small hole and tapping in a plastic sleeve and others work by drilling a bigger hole and screwing a plastic sleeve and there are others where you drill a hole and the metal butterfly expands behind the drywall know as molly bolts (thanks comments!).

<li>The light fixture comes with a metal bracket for attaching to the electrical box that has a green screw</li>
<li>The light fixture has black, white and copper wires.</li>
</ul>

<p>The instructions supplied with the fixture dont give me an example of how to wire it up if there is an existing ground wire coming from supply.

Do I need to connect both of them together with the green grounding screw on the light fixture as well, or would that only be if the electrical box was metal?</p>
","<p>The instructions for the fixture are only correct for a metal box.  If a metal box was used, the box itself would (should) be grounded.  The bracket that holds the light would then be connected to the box, which would make the bracket grounded.  Finally the ground wire from the fixture would attach to the bracket, grounding the fixture.</p>

<p>In the case of a plastic box, the box is not grounded.  All ground connections must be made by connecting the ground wires together. So in your situation you are correct, you'll connect the ground from the supply to the ground from the fixture using a twist-on connector (or other approved connection).</p>

Silver conductor is grounded (neutral), copper conductor is ungrounded (hot).</p>

<p>Grounded (neutral) goes to the threaded shell of the lamp and is wired direct without break to the wide blade of a polarized 2 prong plug or in the case of a suspended lamp, to the grounded (neutral) white wire. Switching goes in the ungrounded (hot) side. You never want the thread shell to be hot (switch in off position in the neutral side with intact filament).</p>

<p>If the <strong>conductors</strong> are both the same color, the <strong>insulation</strong> is a single color and the printing is on one conductor's insulation only without rib (feel it with your fingers) or stripe, then that will be your continuous marker and grounded (neutral) indicator. The whole idea on zipcord is that you have some definite identifier as to what is grounded (neutral) to keep a continuous connection and wire properly to the lamp socket and wall plug.</p>

"Is it ok to have mixed grounds and neutrals on bars in a breaker box?","208836","","<p>So to continue my line of electrical questioning (and perhaps narrow down my <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/1692/bathroom-electrical-issues-flickering-lights-gfci-tripping-mysteriously-schem"">flickering light problem</a>), I took a look through the two panels in this house.  There is a 200amp main service in the basement, which then feeds up to a 100amp sub-panel for the main floor.  This 100amp sub feeds a kitchen (fridge, microwave, dishwasher, gas range), a bathroom, 3 bedrooms, and a living room.  The 200amp main feeds the 100amp sub, 2 bedrooms, a living room, a washer/dryer (gas dryer), a utility room (well pump, pressure tank, gas water heater, gas furnace), and an A/C.</p>

<p>My first concern is that the main service panel has the bare ground and neutral wires mixed on the two bus bars.  Reading around, some say this is OK, other's say it is bad.  Any thoughts?  The sub-panel is wired with grounds and neutrals on separate bars.</p>

<p>My second concern- is a 100amp sub sufficient for the main floor?  </p>

  <strong>(A) System Grounding Connections.</strong> A premises wiring system supplied by a grounded ac service shall have a grounding electrode conductor connected to the grounded service conductor, at each service, in accordance with 250.24(A)(1) through (A)(5).</p>
  
  <p><strong>(1) General.</strong> The grounding electrode conductor connection shall be made at any accessible point from the load end of the overhead service conductors, service drop, underground service conductors, or service lateral to and including the terminal or bus to which the grounded service conductor is connected at the service disconnecting means.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that the grounded (neutral) from the service must be connected to ground, and that the connection can be made by bonding the neutral bus bar to the grounding electrode. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>(5) Load-Side Grounding Connections.</strong> A grounded conductor shall not be connected to normally non–current carrying metal parts of equipment, to equipment grounding conductor(s), or be reconnected to ground on the load side of the service disconnecting means except as otherwise permitted in this article.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that the grounded (neutral) conductors should only be grounded at the main service disconnnect.</p>

<p>If the main service panel happens to be the same place that the grounded (neutral) conductor is bonded to the grounding electrode, then there is no problem mixing grounds and neutrals on the same bus bar (as long as there is an appropriate number of conductors terminated under each lug).  If the two bus bars are not connected; as would be the case anywhere other than the main disconnect (<em>exceptions exist</em>), then you cannot mix them.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bQQWf.png"" alt=""Service Wiring""></p>

<p>Notice how the grounded, and grounding bus bars are connected in the main service panel. This means that; electrically speaking, they can be considered a single bus bar.  Which means that both grounded (neutral), and equipment grounding conductors can be terminated on either bus bar.  </p>

<p>In the subpanel, the bus bars are kept separate. So grounded (neutral), and equipment grounding conductors cannot be mixed.  </p>

"What wire gauge should I use with a 30 amp breaker for a 220V welder?","208659","","<p>I am installing an outlet in my garage for a 220v mig welder. The welder specs call for 30A breaker.</p>

<p>The outlet for the welder is only 2 feet from the garage sub panel. The wiring refernece charts I've seen say I can use 12 gauge copper wire for this short of a distance. Does this make sense? I would have expected it to say that 10 gauge copper wire was the smallest acceptable wire to use. </p>

<p>The reason I'm even asking is that I am also wiring the garage for an air compressor and an air conditioner. Both will be on their own 220V 20A breakers. They will be located about 30 wire feet (one way) from the sub panel. This will require enough wire that it makes financial sense to buy the smallest gauge that will work safely and meet code.</p>

","<p>The calculator you referenced is only appropriate for voltage drop and makes the disclaimer that the results of the calculation do not account for current specs or NEC. Any circuit fused for 30 amps must use a minimum of 10 ga copper or 8 ga alu. Longer runs may require an upgrade of wire size.  In your case, use at least 10 copper for your welder regardless how far it is from the breaker panel.

"When installing hardwood floors, should I use rosin paper, roofing felt, or nothing underneath? Why?","197551","","<p>I've installed hardwood floors, over top of OSB subfloor with a layer of roofing felt in between.  I copied this from the hardwood floor contractor who did a kitchen in my home once. He'd been in business for 20 years so I trusted him.  I think he said it was to prevent squeaks. </p>

<p>Is this true? </p>

<p>Does roofing felt used in this way also provide a vapor barrier, and if so, why is that important under hardwood?  I can understand why it would be useful on a roof.  I can understand why it would be useful for housewrap.  Under a floor? </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.hardwoodinstaller.com/hardwoodinstaller/underlayment-rosin-felt-paper.htm"">I read elswhere</a> that rosin paper was originally used to keep floors clean (protect from the dust from drywall finishing, for example), and make it easy to slide floorboards. That seems pretty minimally valuable. Do I care if my OSB gets dusty?  I usually shop-vac the OSB before laying down the floorboards, so is this really a benefit?  And using rosin paper to ease sliding boards during install?  Really?  I never noticed a problem sliding the boards. Is this because I'm really strong?  (not likely).  Maybe it's because I'm using OSB as a subfloor which is a pretty smooth surface? I can imagine using plywood as a subfloor, in the days before OSB, might/could cause hitches when sliding boards during installation. </p>

<p>Do either of these layers provide sound-deadening or anti-squeak qualities?  I figured the lack of squeaks was from using a sound, level subfloor, and installing the T&amp;G tightly.  </p>

<p>This question gets asked a lot in various DIY or even <a href=""http://www.contractortalk.com/f10/rosin-paper-roofing-felt-6372/"">contrator forums</a>.  The problem is, there doesn't seem to be a general convergence to a single answer.  </p>
","<p>OK here we go. First of all, the most common reasons for squeaky hardwood floors are age and installation over uneven subfloors, where any movement of wood on wood makes the sounds. Age becomes a factor when the subfloor ages, shrinks a bit making the nails holding the hardwood a bit loose. Adding either a layer of felt or rosin paper isolates the wood layers and helps to minimize squeaking  wood to wood. A lot of the squeaking on older floors are actually the nails moving in the subfloor, so today we use threaded nails, and for the most part and that solves that problem.  So in your case, it certainly can't hurt to use some paper.  Good luck.</p>

"How can I test whether my furnace issue is the limit switch or the thermostat?","196240","","<p>I suspected this issue during the winter and confirmed it now in the summer. Regardless of the temp in my home, the blower motor runs non-stop.
In the winter this must have been causing my home to got through a permanent heat/cool cycle as the blower would bring cool air in after the home was at the right temp. Then the temp would get low, the furnace would kick in to heat the home and on and on.</p>

<p>In the summer now it seems to be doing the same thing but with the A/C. Once the home is cool enough, the blower keeps bringing in outside air with the A/C off now. This causes the home to heat up and on and on. The adverse effect at night is it's making my home too cold since the outside air is already quite cool. </p>

<p>I check this question. 
<a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/10333/why-wont-my-furnace-turn-off"">Why won&#39;t my furnace turn off?</a></p>

<p>I can manually turn off the limit switch and the blower stops. </p>

<p>How can I test whether the problem is the limit switch or the thermostat? </p>
","<p>If the high limit switch was bad, the furnace should not fire. When the high limit switch trips, the flame/heating element will be shut off and the blower will continue to run to clear the heat. The blower will continue to run until either the system is reset, or the limit switch closes.</p>

<p>I believe high limit switches are normally closed, and they should always fail open. Which means when they go bad, or the temperature gets too high they open the circuit. To test a limit switch, you'll want to check continuity to determine what state the switch is in.</p>

<ul>
<li>If there is a serviceman switch, turn it off. If not, shut the power off at the breaker panel.</li>
<li>Open the access panel and locate the high limit switch. It should be somewhere on the hot box.</li>
<li>Disconnect the wires from the switch (don't forget which goes where).</li>
<li>Using a multimeter, test for continuity between the leads on the switch.</li>
</ul>

<p><sub><em>There is an easier test to check limit switches, but it should only be performed by HVAC techs. So I will not discuss it here.</em></sub></p>

<p>If the circuit is open, you'll want to replace the limit switch.</p>

<p>If the limit switch is adjustable, make sure it is set properly according to the manufactures specifications.</p>

<p>If the limit switch tests OK; or you've replaced it and still have the issue, you'll want to focus on the thermostat.</p>

<p>From your description, it sounds more like a problem with the thermostat.  Most safety mechanisms in furnaces do not let the furnace fire if there's a fault, so if you're getting flame I would not suspect a limit switch. I would suspect either the thermostat has gone bad, or it is miswired. If the fan is always on I would suspect either the fan switch has failed closed (is always in the ON position), or the fan wire was incorrectly bonded to the voltage feed line. </p>

<p>Thermostats are basically switch boxes. They'll have one live wire [<code>R</code>] (usually 24v in the US, or line voltage in other parts of the world), one heat call wire [<code>W</code>], one blower fan call wire [<code>G</code>], and optionally a cool call [<code>Y</code>], and/or <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/a/10527/33""><code>C</code> wire</a>. When the thermostat wants to warm up, it will connect the <code>R</code> to <code>W</code> and <code>G</code> which tells the furnace the thermostat is cold and needs heat. If it's hot it connects the <code>R</code> to <code>Y</code> and <code>G</code>, to tell the furnace it's hot and wants to be cooled down. If you have a <code>FAN</code> control and you turn it to <code>ON</code>, the thermostat connects <code>R</code> to <code>G</code> and the blower fan turns on.</p>

<p>The easiest way to rule out the thermostat, is to replace it.  Troubleshooting thermostats is a pain in the ass, so it's much easier to simply switch it out.</p>

<p>If you've changed the thermostat and you're still having the problem, call an HVAC tech.  </p>

"How much load can a (wood) board support, if it is supported only at the ends?","195587","","<p>How much load can a board support, if it is supported only at the ends?</p>

<p>At the moment my specific problem is hanging a tire swing between two trees, and depending on which trees I choose they could be 10, 12, or 14 feet apart (center to center).  If I securely attach a 2x4 to the trees and hang the swing from the middle, would it be at risk of breaking from 2 children playing on it (so I'd guess around 300lbs max with them bouncing and jumping onto it)</p>

<p>But my bigger question is the general case: how do you calculate (or where do you look up) what kind of loads can be supported by the wood in question?  (other examples would be a 1x10 shelf with supports 24"" apart, or 1/2"" plywood on a 2' x 4' frame).

<p>As @Ian points out, the problem is not a simple one and is best solved by simply using what's worked for other people in the past. Go take a look at the swings at your local park and use the same size of beam, provided the span is comparable.</p>

<p>Also, if you're really worried, you could always make the rope into a 'Y' to eliminate bending stress on the beam, leaving it solely in shear. This way, the beam is bearing the compression load from the lateral tension on the 'Y', which will keep the trees from bowing toward each other.</p>

"Can I backfeed a portable generator into my house's electrical system?","194911","","<p>Is there a safe way to power my house using a portable generator? The power rating for the generator is 6kW, and I want to run my electric water heater (4.5kW) and my refrigerator (0.5kW) and possibly a few lights.</p>

<p>The water heater is the main priority, but it's wired directly to the house so I can't just unplug an outlet and plug it into the generator.</p>

<p>The method I've heard used most often is to backfeed into the dryer outlet after turning off the main breaker. I'm aware that if I don't turn off the main breaker, I could shock a worker or destroy the generator when the power comes pack on. I also know enough that I have to use a power line rated for the Amperage I'll be drawing. Are there any other dangers I need to look out for?</p>

<p>I had a friend suggest that I deactivate one of the heating elements and thereby reduce the amount of power that the water heater will draw. I'm guessing I'd still need 240V rather than 120, but I'm not sure. It would be awesome if I could just use a 12 or 14 gauge extension cord instead of a really expensive 10 gauge, but I don't want to do anything that will catch my house on fire.</p>

<p>Also, can anyone give me a detailed explanation of steps I need to take for this whole process?</p>

<p>(Any advice would be greatly appreciated. It's been eight days since we've been without power, and possibly 3-4 more until it's restored.)</p>
","<p>You've got the big one covered, turning off the main breaker.  Without that, the voltage from the generator goes back out the power lines, into the transformer, where instead of getting stepped down to your house voltage will get stepped up to the line voltage, plus make previously dead wires, live.</p>

<p>Given the options, using a dryer style plug for 220v is the way I would do it in your situation.  Back feeding 110v power will only send current down half of the breakers, and it would be easy to swap the neutral and the hot in this situation (with 220v you have two hots, and ground and neutral are effectively the same wire).  That said, the proper way is with a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=553544"">transfer switch</a> that would prevent power from back feeding into the power mains and also a plug that doesn't allow for live exposed prongs.  These can be installed, but the time to do so isn't when you've been out of power for days.  Just realize that using the dryer plug is almost certainly out of code compliance in your state.</p>

<p>Words of caution include checking the amperage of your wiring (the breaker on the dryer will have the number going to the plug) and then avoid overloading the generator.  I wouldn't open up more breakers to major appliances than you have amperage to cover (e.g. if the breaker to the hot water say 20 and the dryer breaker says the same, then run that device by itself unless you have a good understanding of how many amps it actually pulls).  You can use the breakers to power one device at a time, fridge for a few hours, then the hot water, etc.  And when the water is hot and fridge is cold, shutoff the generator to save gas and leave the fridge closed to keep it cool.</p>

<p>Only other piece of advice I can think of is to make sure the exhaust is properly vented.  Far too many people don't think and run these indoors, giving themselves carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>

"How should I rewire a miswired 3-way switch?","194431","","<p>I have a 3 way switch that was wired incorrectly when the switches were replaced with a different color switch.  Is there a methodical way for me to identify which wires represent which piece of the system so I can correct the bad wiring?</p>

<p>Currently if switch 1 is on, switch 2 can turn light on or off.  If switch 1 is off, then switch 2 does nothing.</p>
","<p>I had this EXACT issue when I moved into my new (to me) house. The original owner was a bit of a handyman and had done several small (and big) projects all over. In many cases regarding electrical work he'd done, I had to go back in and clean up.</p>

<p>Here's a fail-safe process to fix a three way setup that isn't working:</p>

<ol>
<li>Turn off the breaker controlling this light. You may also need to cut additional breakers if either or both of the 3-ways are in ""multi-gang"" boxes with other switches on different circuits. Use a non-contact voltage tester to ensure all of the screws on the side of all the switches in both boxes are dead before pulling out any switches.</li>
<li>Disconnect all wires from both of the 3-way switches (but do not unwrap or un-nut any of the twisted wire bundles, or disassemble any other switches). Pull these wires out of the box and separate them so there is no bare copper touching any other metal.</li>
<li>Turn the panel breaker back on. From this moment until step 5, the second you are not extremely cautious around every bit of bare metal in that box, you will pay for it.</li>
<li>Probe all the wires you disconnected and separated one at a time with your non-contact voltage tester, being extremely careful not to touch any of the other wires with the tester or any part of you. You will find one loose black wire in one of the two boxes that is live, and all other wires should be dead. The live wire is your panel hot; remember it.</li>
<li>Turn off the breaker at the panel again.</li>
<li>Back at the box with the wire you identified as the panel hot, connect the hot wire to the ""common"" terminal of the 3-way switch for that box. Looking at the body of a three-way switch, the common terminal is the terminal that has another terminal screw on the switch body facing the same way, but <em>doesn't</em> have a screw directly <em>across</em> the switch body facing the <em>other</em> way. A picture's worth a thousand words; see below.</li>
<li>The other two insulated wires you removed from the switch are the ""traveler"" wires. One will be black, and the other red, and they should both be a part of the same ""trunk"" of Romex wire. Connect the black to one of the remaining terminals other than the grounding terminal, and the red to the other terminal.</li>
<li>Both of the two wire ""trunks"" should have white and bare wires in addition to the black and/or red; ALL the white wires in the box should be twisted into a bundle with a wire nut, and all bares should be twisted in a bundle with or without a nut.</li>
<li>Screw the terminals down firmly, attach the ground wire to the green grounding terminal screw if one was connected (bathrooms require a bare wire ground to be connected to the switch, most other rooms don't), cover all the switch terminals with a layer or two of electrical tape, and, being careful not to short out any wires, push the wires and switch back into the J-box and screw it down.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/l2T4n.jpg"" alt=""A three-way switch, with terminals identified""></p>

<ol start=""10"">
<li>Now, go to the other switch box. Examine the loose wires which you disconnected from the switch (there should be two black and one red). The black wire that doesn't go into the same outer insulation conduit as the red wire is the hot lead to the light. The other two wires are the other ends of your traveler line. Both these ""trunks"" should have white and bare wires in addition to the black and/or red; the white wires should be twisted into a bundle with a wire nut, and bares should be twisted in a bundle with or without a nut.</li>
<li>Connect the light's hot wire to the switch's common terminal.</li>
<li>One note; if you connect the black wire from the traveler to the same side of the second switch that you connected the black traveler wire to on the first switch, the switches must be set opposite each other (one up and one down) for the light to be off. Personally, I prefer to be able to turn every light in the house off by pushing all the light switches down. If you're like me, then swap the red and black wires of the traveler pair, connecting the black wire to the opposite traveler terminal from the one you used on the first switch. This will result in the circuit being off when the switches are set the same way (both down or up).</li>
<li>Connect the traveler wires to the other switch terminals in the manner you choose, and connect the ground if you have one. Wrap the terminals in electrical tape, and put the switch back in the wall box.</li>
<li>Turn the panel breaker(s) back on. Have another person stand at one switch, while you stand at the other. If the light is on, flip one of the switches. Now, have the other person flip their switch; the light goes on. Flip yours (light off). Flip theirs again (light on), then flip yours again (light off). You've now gone through all four combinations of light positions, and verified that either switch can turn the light on or off.</li>
<li>If something still doesn't work, turn off the panel and take the switches out of the box (but don't disconnect them). Make sure none of the terminals are shorting out against any other piece of metal in the box (including the box itself, if it's conductive). If it STILL doesn't work, replace one or both switches (they're about $3 a pop). if it <strong>STILL</strong> doesn't work, I'd call an electrician; there may be a break in the wires of this circuit, or there may have been a mix-up involving multiple switches in the boxes; pretty much any way you slice it it could be dangerous or expensive for you to continue to try to fix it.</li>
<li>Once the switches are working to your satisfaction, put the switch plate back on over the box (make sure before you start screwing in plate screws that ALL the holes line up), and enjoy your repaired three-way circuit.</li>

Is there anything else that I could try before I just replace the whole toilet? It seems like the toilet is young enough that it shouldn't have too much build up in it, but I also know that we have rather hard water based off of how fast we see mineral build up in our shower that we didn't see in our previous house.</p>
","<p>If the problem is mineral clogging of the under-rim channels on the toilet, and this does produce the symptoms you describe, then neither CLR no vinegar may be enough to clear up the blockage. The traditional treatment is a cup or two of muriatic acid (HCl 36%, from the hardware store) down the overflow hole in the tank. That goes directly to the rim vents. Pour the stuff in, wait an hour, and flush.
Gloves and eye protection are recommmended, and a funnel so as to avoid spillage and corroding the metal parts in your tank. This looks like  decent writeup of the method: <a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Fix-a-Slow-Toilet"">How to Fix a Slow Toilet</a></p>

  <p><em>""<strong>What is considered an acceptable angle for a roof to ensure that there will be sufficient run-off during rain conditions?</strong>""</em></p>

<p>Generally, minimum slope for water to run off is 1% (1/8"" per 1').
However, minimum slope for a <strong>flat roof</strong> by building code here is 2%. (1/4"" per 1').</p>

<p>You have more than enough slope for your roof, however you will likely need some sort of membrane roofing since it is very low slope.</p>

<p>There are profiled metal roof cladding systems specifically designed for low-slope application.

","<p>Put the drill in reverse, firmly grip the chuck (the part you were calling the head) and gently squeeze the trigger up the point that you cannot hold on.

"How to detect whether there is a signal on TV cable","183471","","<p>I'm not receiving TV in my room and the cable guy has determined that there is no signal on my coax outlet in the wall. There is a signal in other rooms, so there must be a broken or disconnected cable somewhere in the house.</p>

<p>Now the owner and I are going to go around the house and try to find it, but how can we measure whether there is a signal / potential on a cable without connecting a TV to it?</p>

<p>I've read that you need a spectrum analyzer to measure signal strength, but I don't need that, I just need to know if there's any signal at all.
I've also read that you can check cables with a multimeter, but you need both ends for that, and they are impossible to bring close together in our case (the cables are in walls etc.)</p>

<p>(This is in the Netherlands, in case they have different standards there than e.g. the US)</p>
","<p>You do not need to know if there is a 'signal' you just need to know if there is a connection.</p>

<p>A basic tool that can tell you evetrything and costs a few bucks/quid at local hardware store. <strong>Multimeter</strong></p>

<p>Never in my life did i have to use a tone generator, a oscilloscope to test if my CCTV, Satellite or TV connection is giving me good enough signal.. <code>LOL</code></p>

<p>You use that type of equipment for digital/analogue testing where you control several if not hundred outcomes, synchronization and high speed data transfer. </p>

<p>You just need to use a few simple free (brainpower) tricks.</p>

<p><code>Point A</code> being nearest to your TV and <code>Point B</code> being the other end of the cable.</p>

<ol>
<li>Disconnect all TVs</li>
<li>Short point B (so connect the signal and shield with a wire)</li>
<li>Test point A with a multimeter set at Ohm</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Results</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>~0Ohm or very close to - Woohoo you have a nice connection from a to b!</li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>0Ohm More than dead short - You have a bad connection somewhere</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>No reading - Cable form Point A to Point B has no connection</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no need to analyse the signal or test for a signal because you know you have a signal in the other TVs (assuming the coax is connected to the same place)</p>

<p><strong>Alternatives</strong></p>

<p>If you know the coax for all the TVs is the same cable you, you can leave Point B terminated - which is most likely closest to the antenna or after the junction. Test Point C,D...Z respectively to make sure there is a good connection.</p>

<p>Take your TV and connect it to a working plug to make sure the TV is not broke - or as pointed out use TV that works and plug it into your outlet - same difference I think? (but does not eliminate double jeopardy - your TV might still be knackered as well as the signal be broke :) )</p>

<p><strong>Alternative 2</strong></p>

<p>Also requires for all plugs to be disconnected from all TVs. Connect a 9 volt battery to one end and test all the ends for a voltage. If you get ~9 volts then the route is good. If you get a &lt;9V then you have an issue on the route (micro short?) if you have 0V then there's no connection</p>

"Why Do 240V Circuits Not Require Neutral?","182483","","<p>Someone told me that a 240V circuit does not require a neutral wire in the cable.  Can anyone explain this phenomenon from the electricity perspective and generally explain why circuits do and do not need a neutral wire?</p>
","<p>In a 120/240V single split phase system, the two ungrounded (hot) legs are actually connected to the secondary winding of the distribution transformer. The transformer actually steps down the voltage to 240 volts, so the two legs are a complete 240 volt circuit.</p>

<p>The grounded (neutral) conductor is connected to the center of the coil (center tap), which is why it provides half the voltage.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tRo7E.png"" alt=""split phase transformer""></p>

<p>Therefore, if a device requires only 240V, only two ungrounded (hot) conductors are required to supply the device.  If a device runs on 120V, one ungrounded (hot) conductor and one grounded (neutral) conductor are needed. If a device needs both 120V and 240V, then two ungrounded (hot) conductors and one grounded (neutral) conductor must be used.</p>

<p>If you connect a load between the two ungrounded legs of the circuit, you can see how you have a complete circuit through the coil.</p>

"Why won't my A/C turn on after I replaced the thermostat batteries?","179464","","<p>Our thermostat died yesterday, but after replacing the dead batteries with fresh batteries, and confirming the LCD screen was operable, our AC no longer turns on.</p>

<p>I have attempted a factory reset on the thermostat, and I do hear a quiet but definitive ""click"" when I believe it is attempting to activate the HVAC unit, but that's as far as it gets.</p>

<p>One theory I have is that the batteries were long dead, and the thermostat was getting it's power from the wiring directly, which means it could be the HVAC unit that died. However, it's one of the first times I've had to deal with a HVAC unit personally, so I'm guessing. I reset the breaker a couple times to see if that would do it, but it's a no go (it is clearly marked on my panel with a aluminum bridge between both breakers).</p>

","<p>Sounds like you may not have power from the transformer. You can check this using a multimeter, by testing the voltage between the red <code>R</code> wire and the blue <code>C</code> wire.  You should read somewhere around 24VAC, though depending on the system it could be anywhere from about 6VAC to 30VAC.</p>

<p>Most thermostats only use the batteries to power the thermostat itself, LED display, programming, date/time, etc.  Thermostats with a <code>C</code> wire (like yours seems to have), sometimes only use the batteries to remember your settings during a power outage.  The actual power for signalling heat/cool, is supplied by a transformer in the furnace itself (the red <code>R</code> wire). If there is no power on the <code>R</code> wire, the thermostat has no way to call for heat/cool.  In this case you'll have to have an HVAC tech troubleshoot, and possibly replace the transformer.</p>

<p>You could use your multimeter to verify the furnace itself is getting power, though this is slightly more dangerous since you'll have to open the service panel on the furnace. This could put you in danger of electrocution, and should be avoided if you are not familiar with HVAC systems.</p>

<p>The only other thing I can think for you to check, is to look for a serviceman switch and make sure it's in the ON position.  A serviceman switch is a switch on the feed line to the furnace, that allows servicemen to turn the power off to the furnace to service it.  It should be located very close to the furnace, and within line of site of the furnaces service panel. <em>If there is line of sight from the furnace service panel to the breaker panel that feed the furnace; or this is an old installation, you may not have a serviceman's switch.</em></p>

<p>Your best bet, is to simply call in an HVAC technician to service the furnace.</p>

<li>wash the wall to remove any grease.</li>

<ul>
<li>Use one switch on the wall to turn on/off the light</li>
<li>Use the other switch on the wall to turn on/off the fan</li>
</ul>

<p>The new fan came with a remote and the remote and the chains are the only way I can turn the fan and the light on and off.  This ONLY works, however, when one particular wall switches is on.  </p>

<p>During the installation, coming from my ceiling I had a black, white, and red wire.  My instructions didn't include anything about connecting the red wire, so I just put a wire tie on it and proceeded.  I now think this was connected to the wall switches.</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I have ignored the red wire?</li>
<li>What is the red wire for and why was it left out of the instructions?</li>
<li>Why did I loose functionality with a newer fan (i.e. why can't I turn the lights and fan on/off via the switches on the wall?)</li>
<li>When I turn on the lights, why does it make an brief buzz sound?  </li>
<li>If I turn on the light from the chain I cannot turn it on/off because the light will turn off immediately.  I can only turn on and off via the remote.  Why?</li>
</ul>

<p>Sorry for all the questions, but I'm a complete noob at this.  </p>
","<p>The red wire is the ungrounded (hot) conductor from one switch, while the black wire is the ungrounded (hot) conductor from the other switch.  In the original installation one switch would energize the red wire causing the fan to come on, while the other would energize the black turning on the light.  </p>

<p>With the new fixture, both the fan and light functionality are controlled by the remote. Because of this, the fixture only requires a single ungrounded (hot) conductor to operate.  These types of fixtures are good for situations where a switch is not present/desired, but may be awkward when a switch is present.  As you've noticed, the fixture only operates when the switch is in the <code>on</code> position. The other switch in this situation would do nothing, since nothing is connected to the wire that it energizes.  </p>

<p>With this fixture you only require a single ungrounded (hot) conductor, because the remote routes power to either the fan, the light, or both depending on the setting.  The additional wire can be capped using a twist-on wire connector, or other approved method.</p>

<p>If you'd like to get the functionality you previously had, you'll likely have to bypass the remote on the fixture.  However, this is an atypical installation, and requires special knowledge.  This type of installation should only be performed by an experienced DIYer. </p>

","<p>The first problem is that you may be using the wrong cable and breakers.  NEC calls for 2 20Amp small appliance circuits in the kitchen, to accomplish this you'll need to switch to 20Amp breakers and #12 wire.</p>

<p>The next problem. You'll have to pull new wire anyway, if you want to hook up GFCI receptacles. GFCI receptacles will not work properly with a shared neutral, you'll end up with nuisance tripping with a shared neutral.  GFCI receptacles work by monitoring the balance between hot and neutral, so if the neutral is shared the GFCI will not work properly. </p>

<p>To wire up the kitchen properly, you'll have to pull 2 new 12/2 cables from the breaker to the kitchen (all #14 wire on that circuit will have to be replaced). Then install 2 20Amp breakers, to supply the kitchen.  You'll install the GFCI's as the first receptacle on each circuit, which will protect all downstream receptacles.</p>

<p>You can share a neutral between 2 GFCI receptacles.  The catch is you'll have to pigtail the neutral to the receptacles, not use the neutral from the load side of the first GFCI to feed the second.</p>

<p>So you <em>should</em> be able to do something like this...</p>

"Whats the easiest way to fix sticky painted furniture so that it's no longer sticky?","160795","","<p>I sanded and painted a dresser with several coats of 100% acrylic paint, namely, these paints:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xfUqw.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">  <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ubryy.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The paint job turned out good, with one issue. After 4-6 weeks of drying, the paint is still slightly tacky. That is a problem, because when I put a significantly weighted object on top of the dresser and leave it on for a while, it 'peels' off. If I leave it for long enough, I am sure the paint will completely peel off along with the object.</p>

<p>The reason for the tackiness could be for a variety of reasons (I probably didn't allow enough time to dry between coats, and I probably put the coats on too thick) but I am more concerned about how to fix it so that the top of the dresser is not sticky anymore. <strong>Short of restripping it and starting over,</strong> what are my options? </p>
","<p>It's called ""blocking"" and often happens w/latex paints - especially if the 1st coat wasn't allowed to dry fully before the second coat was applied. It's not much of an issue on walls, but horizontal surfaces are a different story. </p>

<p>The ultimate solution is time - possibly a few months. The inner coat's moisture is blocked from evaporating by to outer coat. It will slowly wick through the surface over several weeks. </p>

<p>You <em>might</em> be able to reduce the stickiness by spreading some fine talcum powder on the surface, then lightly vacuuming it off - but TEST in an unobtrusive area, first, because if it's too sticky, you could end up with permanent, visible, dust built into your paint job.</p>

<p>You may be able to speed the process by blowing warm (not hot) air across the surface for several days (hot air can cause the paint to peel). This can open the pores in the paint to allow slightly more rapid evaporation, but a lot depends on what paint you used, how much moisture is trapped in the undercoat, etc.</p>

"How do I remove a flush mounted ceiling light fixture dome?","159813","","<p>My bedroom has a very nice looking flush mounted ceiling light with a glass dome. However, all the bulbs have gone out and I cannot get the glass out to replace them. I'm 5'4"" and standing on the bottom corner of my bed I can reach up with my arms fully extended and handle the glass on the bottom and along the very small lip / edge of the glass dome but it doesn't slide or move in either direction. According to a messageboard post I found, the glass dome type of light fixture should move 1/8 of the way counter-clockwise to be removed but I can't get it to budge in either direction. I am at my wits end; HOW can I get this glass dome out? The glass has thus far ignored my curses and yells.</p>

<p>Also my room is pretty small, I can't move my bed anywhere else to get on a stepladder beneath the fixture.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of a similar model: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8OCZ2.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>ETA: I have tried both gloves and exerting sideways turning pressure instead of upward turning pressure. I need to borrow or buy a larger stepladder, but I don't know how much it will help since I think I am getting as much traction and leverage I am going to get with my hand strength. Someone suggested I superglue something to the glass to use as a handle, so I guess I will try that next. </p>

<p>FINAL EDIT: My roommate (who has 6 inches and probably 50 pounds on me) was able to remove the glass after about 5 diffucult minutes of loosening the dome while wearing texturized rubber gloves. His hands are bigger and doubtlessly stronger than mine, which was mostly what granted him victory over the light. I'm glad I didn't have to glue handles to it, but still frustrated by what I maintain is a terrible design for a light fixture. My hands might be on the small side, but it shouldn't be impossible to change lightbulbs if you're on the smaller end of the human spectrum.</p>
","<p>I had a very similar light, and the key was this:</p>

<p><strong>Any upward pressure exerted from grabbing the glass created friction that made it not turn.</strong>  </p>

<p>You want to touch as lightly as you can, near the edges, and try to apply rotational energy only, with no pushing up. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, that is roughly impossible to do if you're reaching so high that you need to press up on the glass to maintain balance. So, you still need to solve the problem of getting higher (and you should NOT climb on anything placed on a bed unless it's highly stable).  But if you can get a bit closer, try less pressure, rather than more. </p>

<p>It feels very counter intuitive, but it helped me in a similar circumstance.</p>

<p>One other thing that may help, suggested by none other than <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/156/joel-spolsky"">@Joel Spolsky</a>, was to try using rubber or latex gloves to allow you to produce more friction without more pressure.</p>

"How many CFM for a range hood do I REALLY need?","159180","","<p>I like to cook. I would like to put in a fairly powerful range (nothing huge, though; I don't need six burners and a griddle), and will need a hood that can carry smoke, heat, steam, grease, etc. from cooking out of the house. The trend seems to be huge hoods with, e.g., 1200 CFM, and a lot of people say you ""don't need that"", but then I do know that a lot of people don't actually COOK in their kitchen. I'm not convinced that I have any need for 1200 CFM, but I'm also not convinced that something like 350 CFM will be sufficient. Assume I'll have a 30"" Wolf all-gas range (not sold on Wolf, but most of what I'm looking at is in that ballpark in terms of BTUs, so it's a good comparison), and be using two or three burners on the stove five or six nights a week, the oven three or four nights a week, and cooking things that may produce large volumes of steam and/or smoke and grease vapor (boiling/simmering large pots of water, stir fries, roasting meat, pan-searing steak) at least half of that. I don't want all that going out into my house, and I certainly don't want it clogging up the filters/core of an HRV, so I need a hood that can exhaust it. How do I size hood CFM appropriately for both the amount of gas that will be combusted, and the amount/scale of my cooking? I don't want absurd overkill, but I don't want my smoke detectors going off when I roast a chicken.</p>

<p>NOTE: I've split the second question I asked out <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/11118/hrvs-and-range-hoods-make-up-air"">into this question</a>.</p>
","<p>When calculating the minimum size of a range hood, there are three things you should consider. The size of the cooking surface, the amount of heat produced by the cooking surface, and the volume of the kitchen.</p>

<p>If the range hood is attached to a wall, you should have 100 cubic feet per minute(cfm) per linear foot. So if you have a 30"" wide range, you should have a hood rated at 250 cfm ((30/12)*100 =250).  If the hood is over an island, you'll use 150 cfm/linear foot. In this case that same 30"" cook top, would require 375 cfm ((30/12)*150 = 375).</p>

<p>Next we'll determine the minimum capacity based on British thermal units(BTU)/hour, by dividing the BTU/hour by 100. For example, if we had a cooktop that produced 40,000 BTUs, we would need 400 cfm. If you are using an electric range (measured in watts), simply multiply watts by 3.41214163 to determine BTU/hr.</p>

<p>The final calculation, will be based on the size of the kitchen. The air in the kitchen should be cycled 15 times per hour, so our formula will be ft³/4. If we have a 10ft x 10ft x 8ft kitchen, (10 X 10 X 8)/4 = 200 cfm.</p>

<p>We'll then choose the largest from these three calculations, and that will be the <strong>minimum</strong> size hood we need.  If you are doing more cooking than the average person, or just want a little more air movement. You can always get a larger hood, this is just the <strong>minimum</strong> size you should consider.</p>

<p>International Residential Code (IRC), says the minimum intermittent exhaust rate for a kitchen is 100 cfm, while the minimum continuous exhaust rate is 25 cfm.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>M1507.4 Local exhaust rates.</strong> Local exhaust systems shall be designed to have the capacity to exhaust the minimum air flow rate
  determined in accordance with Table M1507.4.</p>
  
  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/d3WQx.png"" alt=""Table M1507.4""></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you'll want to make sure the hood is at least capable of achieving these flow rates. </p>

<p>Also, if anyone has any recommendations for application other than foam brushes, I wouldn't mind hearing them.</p>

"When would one use an impact driver versus a regular drill?","147091","","<p>Or vice-versa.  As best as I can tell, the impact driver is very good for most any type of screw going through wood.  When would you use a drill (with screw bit) instead?  </p>
","<p>Drills and impact drivers are similar in that they're both rotating power tools and they have some overlap in usage, but they work differently and have different strengths.</p>

<p><strong>Drills</strong> apply a constant torque and tend to have good control across a range of speeds and clutch settings. They're good for work that requires care or precision, like drilling a hole or driving a a smaller screw.</p>

<p><strong>Impact drivers</strong> provide much higher torque but in rapid bursts–very much like a hammer provides bursts of linear force. This makes them good for heavy-duty jobs like driving long lag bolts (you can even take the lug nuts off your car wheels with most impact drivers), but the banging action makes them a little bit difficult to control. They're also not good for driving into something very soft–between the hammer strikes there's no torque applied and the bit can actually rotate backwards. You can see this by holding the chuck with your hands while the driver is on; you'll feel the pulsing of the strikes but chuck won't actually rotate. Finally, some impact drivers don't have a clutch, which means you need to be very careful if you're driving something that could be over-tightened or broken by the high torque.</p>

<p>Besides the higher torque, impact drivers have another huge advantage in that you don't have to hold them tightly to provide the torque. The momentum of the rotating striker inside is what provides the rotation force, so even when you're driving something very tough it's quite easy to hold the tool. Drills on the other hand provide a constant torque and require the user to provide the reaction and prevent the tool from spinning.</p>

<p>If you have to pick a single all-purpose tool for general DIY use, a drill is much easier to control and is useful in a wider range of situations.</p>

<p>How do I know whether to get the standard ring or the thick ring? I really don't like the idea of trial and error. </p>

<p>2) the marginal increase in price for the thicker ring is so small as to make the cost of my time the overwhelming factor (is it safe to always use the thick ring?)</p>
","<p>How tall the ring is depends on how close the toilet's outlet horn is to the flange. Under ideal conditions, the standard ring is just a bit too tall so that it compresses just enough to form a good seal without squeezing out into the drainage path and causing an obstruction.</p>

<p>Toilets with more than normal spacing will need a taller ring to achieve a proper seal. But if you use a tall ring without the flange on a properly spaced toilet installation, excess wax will be squeezed into the drainage path, causing an undesirable obstruction. This is why double height rings are often sold with flanges, the flange keeps the wax out of the drainage path.</p>

<p>But the flange itself is a bit smaller than the outlet pipe, so it forms a bit of an obstruction itself. Thus, it's not something you want to use unless there's a good chance you'll need it.</p>

<p>You can estimate which height ring is needed and if a flange is a good idea or not by placing a straight edge along the base of the inverted toilet and measuring from the straight edge to the ceiling of the toilet base. Adjust this measurement by how high or low the floor flange surface is from finished floor. The wax ring should be compressed around 1/2 to 3/4 it's initial height once installed. If it will compress less, you need a taller ring. If it will compress more, consider getting one with a flange to limit wax extrusion into the drainage path. </p>

<p>There are caveats with both routes. When using tandem breakers on a 120 volt system (i.e. with a neutral present), you want to avoid something that is called a multifeed. This is, two circuits on the same phase sharing the same neutral. When using tandem breakers, its <em>very</em> easy to inadvertently do this.</p>

<p>If you are in the US, you will see two feeders from the meter, one of them probably has some red tape on it, the other is black. These are your phases.

<p>Only issue with Durham's is sanding is more of a chore.  But this is more about practice.  Applying it right took me a few times.

"Is using 15 amp components on a 20 amp breaker against code?","133913","","<p>I have noticed in a few different houses in Oklahoma that 20 amp breakers are used, but all of the outlets and switches only seem to be rated for 15 amps. This goes against everything I know to be proper and safe. The wire used is 12 gauge, so at least that is fine.</p>

<p>I have started to replace all of the switches and outlets with the decorative switches (the rectangular ones) and have found it very difficult to find switches that are rated for 20 amps. As for the outlets, I have can find them rated for 20 amps, but not in the 10 packs that I see for the 15 amp versions. To be clear I am not speaking about the shape of the plug, rather I am talking about the rating of the internal components of the outlet.</p>

<p>Is there something about electrical code that I am missing?</p>
","<p>NEC 2008</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>210.21 Outlet Devices.</strong> Outlet devices shall have an ampere rating that is not less than the load to be served and shall comply with
  210.21(A) and (B).</p>
  
  <p><strong>(B) Receptacles</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>(1) Single Receptacle on an Individual Branch Circuit.</strong> A single receptacle installed on an individual branch circuit shall have an
  ampere rating not less than that of the branch circuit.</p>

  430.81(B).</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Exception No. 2: A receptacle installed exclusively for the use of a cord-and-plug-connected arc welder shall be permitted to have an
  ampere rating not less than the minimum branch-circuit conductor
  ampacity determined by 630.11(A) for arc welders.</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>(2) Total Cord-and-Plug-Connected Load.</strong> Where connected to a branch circuit supplying two or more receptacles or outlets, a

  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ASE8S.png"" alt=""Table 210.21(B)(2) Maximum Cord-and-Plug-Connected Load to Receptacle""></p>
  
  <p><strong>(3) Receptacle Ratings.</strong> Where connected to a branch circuit supplying two or more receptacles or outlets, receptacle ratings shall
  conform to the values listed in Table 210.21(B)(3), or where larger
  than 50 amperes, the receptacle rating shall not be less than the
  branch-circuit rating.</p>
  
  <p><em>Exception No. 1: Receptacles for one or more cord-andplug-connected arc welders shall be permitted to have ampere ratings not less than
  the minimum branch-circuit conductor ampacity permitted by 630.11(A)
  or (B) as applicable for arc welders.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Exception No. 2: The ampere rating of a receptacle installed for electric discharge lighting shall be permitted to be based on

  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fdRU1.png"" alt=""Table 210.21(B)(3) Receptacle Ratings for Various Size Circuits""></p>
  
  <p><strong>(4) Range Receptacle Rating.</strong> The ampere rating of a range receptacle shall be permitted to be based on a single range demand
  load as speciﬁed in Table 220.55.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it is a single receptacle on a 20 Amp circuit, it must be a 20 Amp receptacle (aside from the 2 exceptions).  If there are multiple receptacles on a 20 Amp circuit, the receptacles can be either 15 or 20 Amp (aside from the exceptions).  </p>

<p>This is to allow You to have multiple devices plugged in drawing less than 15 Amps each, but the total draw on the circuit may be greater than 15 Amps.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong><br>
Keep in mind that NEC defines a receptacle as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Receptacle.</strong> A receptacle is a contact device installed at the outlet for the connection of an attachment plug. A single receptacle
  is a single contact device with no other contact device on the same
  yoke. A multiple receptacle is two or more contact devices on the same
  yoke.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So a duplex receptacle would be considered two receptacles, according to this definition. Which means you can install a single 15 Amp duplex receptacle on a 20 ampere circuit, without violating this code.</p>

"Why does my washing machine leak only during the spin cycle?","132524","","<p>For the second time in a month, I found that my washing machine had flooded the kitchen floor (and part of the basement via the hole for the water line to the fridge).  </p>

<p>The first time, I only noticed it at the end of the wash.  This time, I know it happened during the spin cycle because I had just been in the kitchen a few minutes earlier and hadn't seen anything out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>The washer is a Maytag LAT9706AAE and is at least eight years old (I bought it with the house) but has been reliable until this.  The load size was set between medium and large (it's on a continuous slider); <em>Extra Rinse</em> (which uses more water in the rinse cycle) was turned off and <em>Extra Spin</em> (which causes it to spin for longer) was turned on.</p>

<p>Why would it leak only during the spin cycle?  Is this something I could repair easily, or is it time for a new washer?</p>
","<p>You have a crack somewhere in the drainage system. The most likely reason that it's leaking on the spin cycle is the vibration caused by the spin cycle is opening the crack to let the leaking occur. </p>

"What are the pros and cons of medium-density fibreboard (MDF)?","130900","","<p>I heard mixed opinions about making cupboards and beds from MDF. Some said it doesn't matter, MDF is as durable as whole tree or sandwich boards. Some said that MDF is weak, and will not last for years if you move the MDF-beds often.</p>

<p>I'll be glad to hear your experiences about the durability of the MDF.</p>
","<p>I have used MDF for a number of furniture building applications. Shelving, cupboards, cabinets (body and doors). </p>

<ol>
<li>It is easy to work into interesting shapes, you can cut curves using a jigsaw and sand it easily.</li>
<li>If you sand off any of the surface, and on the cut ends, you get a very different finish than on the front/back surfaces. If you want to get a smooth uniform finish I suggest using an undercoat of acrylic or PVA. If you are careful and get the undercoat right you can get a very smooth (almost plastic looking) finish.</li>
<li>Best to avoid damaging or removing the surface, as the surface is quite different to the inside and may contribute to the strength (not sure).</li>
<li>I usually sand over and round any exposed edges to prevent then from getting damaged. I always finish MDF with some kind of paint, so the texture differences are hidden.</li>
<li>MDF is very dimensionally stable, I have had no real issues with it changing size due to temperature or moisture</li>
<li>Basic MDF is not very good at handling high moisture levels. I always try and seal it as far as possible using a paint with relatively high moisture retardation (couple of coats of gloss paint for example). I have not so far experienced any serious moisture damage to my MDF even in places I have used it as an experiment in my kitchen where it is exposed to humidity (replacing chipboard which was being damaged by the humidity). However, it has only been a few years so I will see how it is in another 10.</li>
<li>Use exterior grade MDF if your application is likely to be exposed to high levels of moisture.</li>
<li>I often fix it with wood glue and dowels, but screws will work fine as long as you drill a pilot hole.</li>
<li>MDF is not as strong as plywood, if you are using it for shelving/load bearing you will have to increase the thickness compared to plywood or use some other method. For the sides of cabinets, etc, I have sometimes used two pieces attached face to face. </li>
<li>the dust from working it is a bit horrible, so wear as mask/use extraction</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, it has some advantages and some disadvantages. I think it is rarely the best material, but probably good enough for a number of furniture building applications. And for some things (like cutting into shapes with a jigsaw) it is very handy (no grain). I have not so far had any serious durability issues, but I do always take the above precautions.</p>

"How can I fix electrical outlets that don't ""hold"" plugs that are plugged in to them?","129850","","<p>In short, most of the outlets in my house have one working receptacle and one that any cord plugged in will immediately slip out of. Some of my outlets don't have any working receptacles (I hope I'm using the right terminology here).</p>

<p>Is there any way I can repair these, or am I going to have to go through and replace every outlet in my house?</p>
","<p>You will need to replace them (or get an electrician to replace them).</p>

<p>Replacing sockets is a straightforward job:</p>

<ol>
<li>Turn off the power to the receptacle.</li>
<li>Verify that power is off at the receptacle.</li>
<li>Unscrew the old socket from the box.</li>
<li>Make a note of which wires go where.</li>
<li>Remove the wires from the old socket.</li>
<li>Wire up the new socket - double checking that live -> live, neutral -> neutral and earth -> earth.</li>
<li>Screw the new socket onto the box.</li>
<li>Turn the power back on.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is still a job a householder can do in the UK. However, if you are uncertain about any of the above steps or you think there might be something more serious wrong with the electrics then get an electrician in.</p>

<p>If the plugs aren't holding in the sockets then the sockets are potentially dangerous.</p>

"How can I fix a stripped hole in an aluminum piece?","129666","","<p>I have a tripod head that is made of aluminum. In the head there is a small hole that houses a small screw that secures a quick-release plate. After some time the hole stripped and the screw no longer holds. I suspect that there is no simple way to fix it, but in case there is, I wanted to see what you guys think!</p>
","<p>Depends on the size of the screw and how much material you have to work with. If this is a clamp bolt, cheap tripods use screws going directly into the casting. Quality units either use a captured nut, Nyloc nut and eccentric toggle or a tee-head bolt with threaded knob.</p>

<p>If this is a plate with a fair amount of metal surrounding the hole and it's deep enough, I would get a <strong>Heli-Coil</strong> kit. With this kit, you drill the hole oversize with the supplied drill, use the supplied tap and then the tool to install the helical insert.</p>

<p>Another thread repair is <strong>Keensert</strong> which, if you have yet more metal because it's a larger device, a locking insert that doesn't require delicate use of Red Loctite to keep it in place.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sPZae.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>All the above probably are not recommended in the case that the threaded hole is in a casting that doesn't have spare metal, so the previous recommendations of drilling oversize and tapping for a larger bolt might be the best.

","<p>I am not sure what kind of fireplace you have.  But there is definately a legal clearance limit around the opening for combustable materials.  Check with your local building codes or manufacturer if you have one of those ""insert"" types of fireplaces.</p>

<p>A wood mantle will act a heat shield.  Even though wood burns it still acts as an insulator so it should be sufficent to block most of the heat.  But it also have to be a certain distance away from the opening.</p>

<p>I am not sure if you have a masonry or ""insert"" type, depending on type will determine how far away from the opening the mantle will need to be.</p>

<p>You might have to move the TV higher after the mantle is installed, do some measuring first before making a decision because the TV may end up very close to the ceiling, or may not fit at all.</p>

<p>Overall I think the TV is too close to the opening, so consider a relocation if possible.</p>

"Why does this toilet clog so often?","123656","","<p>My inlaws have one toilet in their house that regularly clogs. They have two more toilets that don't seem to clog at all. They live in a suburb with full plumbing (not a septic tank). The toilet isn't low-flow. They had a plumber come look at it, plumber says there's nothing wrong.</p>

<p>But every third time we visit, my husband clogs it. Or I do. Other guests seem to clog it, too. The residents don't clog it. My husband and I don't usually clog toilets. We do eat more meat, less fiber while visiting, but we travel tons and put up with drastic dietary changes and new plumbing all the time, and we don't clog toilets. Just this one. </p>

<p>What makes this one exceptional is that we often have to snake it when it does clog. Just plunging never releases the clog. </p>

<p>Is the plumber nuts? Is there something else going on here?</p>
","<p>Troubleshooting steps/questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Has this toilet always had this problem, or was there ever anything installed in this location that didn't clog like this? If the toilet has always had this problem then it's likely some issue with the initial installation; the drain pipe diameter may be too small, or there may be insufficient venting which is causing slow drainage in the wall because there's no ""air behind water"".</p></li>
<li><p>If it didn't always have this problem, then something has changed. Would that be anything obvious like a remodel, or something more gradual like build-up accumulation? If the toilet was replaced at some point, either as its own job or as part of a larger remodel, then most likely something was done during construction/installation that is causing an obstruction. If not, then mineral or organic build-up is the most likely culprit.</p></li>
<li><p>From the comments, what DID the plumber do, if he didn't scope the drain, lift the throne, and/or inspect the vent stack from the roof? Anything he did do, besides flush a toilet with nothing but clean water in it, may help to eliminate or diagnose potential problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Does the toilet always seem to drain slowly, even if it doesn't clog outright? Slow drainage of the bowl in all circumstances would point to an obstruction of the pipe diameter itself, such as an improper flange installation, a defect in the toilet, or blockage in the piping. Fast flow in a ""normal"" flush, but easy clogging, generally points to a foreign object blocking the pipe in such a way as to trap solids as they go down the drain, but allowing water without any solids to pass by normally.</p></li>
<li><p>Are there small children in the house? A child could have flushed a pencil, pen or other long, stiff object which is now caught in a turn in the plumbing and is trapping solid matter to form clogs. Scoping the drain will identify this blockage, and a professional snake will clear it (the homeowners'-variety snake with a coiled end won't do anything; you'll need a snake with bladed ends designed to chew into or through solid blockages, which require some knowhow to use without further damaging your drains).</p></li>

"What's the practical difference between ""latex"" and ""acrylic"" water dispersion paint?","122990","","<p>I see lots of water dispersion paints in shops and they usually come in two flavors - ""latex"" and ""acrylic"". The application range and procedure seem the same, they are all relatively safe, don't emit anything toxic while drying, prices are more or less the same.</p>

<p>What's the practical difference and how do I choose?</p>
","<p>There actually is no difference between latex and acrylic paints because there is no latex in latex paints. Let me explain. All water based paints today are referred to as ""latex"", even though there is absolutely no latex rubber in the formula. Latex has become a generic label. The stain, water resistance and covering capabilities are achieved by using acrylic resins or vinyl . Better quality paints have more acrylic resins than vinyl.  Paints with a higher percentage of acrylic resin cost more. Vinyl is much cheaper than acrylic and is often used to mix with the acrylic to keep the cost of the paint lower. If you have special needs that may require a superior or better adapted product, the best advise is to go to a professional paint store and discuss your situation with someone that can explain the chemistry and applications of better products.</p>

"How do I fix a door frame that my dog chewed?","122625","","<p>My dog chewed the bottom part of the doorframe to my bedroom.  I live in a rented apartment, so this is not OK.</p>

<p>Is there any way to fix it and make it look somewhat presentable (doesn't have to be perfect)?</p>

<p>How do I find a matching frame?  How do I match the paint?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ac0IR.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Just wanted to thank everyone for their help!</p>

<p>@XOPJ: Thanks, that is useful to know.  Actually, I don't think she actually chewed it, but simply scratched at it when I left her in the room for a while (she's got separation anxiety).  So my description was not quite accurate to begin with!</p>

<p>Regarding replacing the trim, I think that's just too much work for someone like me who doesn't know much about DIY projects.  I considered this initially before coming to this forum, but there doesn't seem to be an easy way to remove the trim, and I'm afraid I'd knock a huge chunk out that I'm not supposed to if I tried to pry it off!</p>

<p>My filler experiment has been a half-success:  I had one big chunk which I managed to glue back in place, and I filled in the rest with wood filler and painted over it.  Since it's near the bottom of the door, you don't notice it unless you're looking for it.  However, I think I'll try to touch it up at some point in the future.</p>
","<p><strong>Edit:  Thanks for posting the photo, answer updated (see below).</strong></p>

<p>Here is some general advice.</p>

<p>Since larger chunks of wood are missing, use <a href=""http://www.elmers.com/product/detail/E887?filterPath=wood-filler"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>wood filler</strong></a> to fill it in (found at any home improvement store).  Use a putty knife to match the shape of the trim as closely as possible.  After the filler cures, use sand paper to round it out.  </p>

<p>You will also need to paint over the filler.  Get a chip of the wood trim and take it with you to the home improvement store and get them to color-match the paint (you may also be able to pull a piece of the trim off the wall).</p>

<p>The other option would be to find similar trim at the store and replace the damaged piece.  Some fancy trims can be tough to match, but what you have looks pretty basic.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, in the last place we rented, our rabbit used to gnaw on the door trim in our bedroom.  We eventually trained the rabbit not to do that, but it took a while, and the damage got pretty bad.  We repaired the trim using the above methods.  We got our full security deposit back.</p>

"What actually happens if I vary proportions of cement and sand in mortar?","121738","","<p>When preparing cement mortar proportions of sand and cement can AFAIK be varied. I've always been using the ""default recommended"" 1-to-3 (one volume of cement for every three volumes of sand) proportion.</p>

<p>What actually happens if I alter the proportion - how will it affect mortar and why would I want that?</p>
","<p>Codes and other guides provide nominal mix combinations that perform fairly in general conditions. </p>

<p>In general, a 1:2 mix will give better strength than a 1:3 mix. But it is quite possible that a 1:0.5 mix might perform worse. Strength comes from inter-particle force transfer between sand grains and also from shear resistance provided by cement acting as adhesive. Thus codes provide known balanced combinations that are satisfactory.</p>

<p>To gain complete control over the properties of a mortar/concrete mix, you must consider the following criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Cement Amount:</strong> As a thumb rule, increasing the cement increases the strength. Beyond a certain point, it also acts negatively. Since major force transfer in a concrete/mortar matrix is from sand-sand interaction, excess cement will turn the mortar very brittle since cement particles cannot transfer normal contact force - they are good at providing shear strength. Since cement is expensive, in low-strength applications like roads the amount of cement is less to optimize on the cost.</li>
<li><strong>Water Amount:</strong> Generally water content ranging from 20% - 35% (w/w cement) is considering a safe operable range. Lower water content gives low strength and less manoeuvrable mix for flat conditions like road laying. Higher water content is generally used in specific conditions like laying out pile using tremie - where the free flowing nature of mix is necessary. Although high-water also leads to lower strength, there are other workarounds (mentioned ahead).</li>
<li><strong>Sand Amount:</strong> A very high amount of sand will make your mix very brittle and weak against all kinds of forces. For M20, M25 etc, general proportion is 1:3. However, for High-strength mix (M35+) its better to go with 1:2 and somewhere about that.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregate Amount:</strong> Aggregates have two reasons to be there - economy and strength. They are cheap and provide as a good filler. Very high and very low amounts of aggregate give poor strength but a varied economic solution. A moderate amount is good enough.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregate shape:</strong> Generally, increasing crookedness of the aggregate particle gives increasing strength as it gives a higher contact area and better inter-lock capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Air Entrainment:</strong> A high air-content in the mix leads to lower strength. That's why high-strength concrete is vibrated before laying to expel the small air-pockets. A low air content gives low manoeuvrability, so sometimes, 'air-entrainers' (chemical additives) are used to give the desired flowing nature without compromising on changing the water content and consequently the strength.</li>
<li><strong>Additives:</strong> Physical additives like 'fine-silica-powder', 'fly-ash' allow cement reduction and provide economy. fine-silica is ... very fine so it goes into the smallest of voids and provides good contact strength by reducing the air content. Fly-ash comes as a general replacement for cement. It is a by-product from thermal power stations and is very cheap. Upto 15% cement can be replaced by fine-silica and upto ~40% by fly-ash. Chemical additives like super-plasticizers do provide a effective workability increase, or even a water reduction at similar workability - thus giving a higher strength mix.</li>

"How to fix stinky bathroom sink?","120880","","<p>It smells like really musty water, but the water itself does not smell or taste bad at all. Only happens when I run the water, so it doesn't make the room smell, just when you fill something up or wash your hands. </p>

<p>I tried drain-o and it didn't do anything and there's GREAT flow so it's not clogged at all anyway. </p>

<p>Only thing that has worked (temporarily) is pouring pretty much everything I could think of into it. Lemon juice, draino, bleach, etc. </p>
","<p>I'll echo the comment and say that you should make sure you have a proper P-trap installed under the sink. This trap holds water and provides a seal against sewer gases getting up into the bathroom. Without one, gases will leak in constantly, and will be displaced by water down the drain which can force the gases up into the bathroom even if normally it's not detectable.</p>

<p>I'll also ask if there is a proper vent for this sink. Even with a P-trap, if there's nowhere for back-flowing gases to go, they'll bubble up past the trap.</p>

<p>One more thing it could be is the overflow drain. Depending on the design of sink, the overflow can hold a small amount of water at the bottom where it tees in to the main drain, which can become stagnant. Run water down the drain and you'll force some air up the overflow (to make way for the water coming down), which will have that stagnant smell. To diagnose this, plug the sink and begin filling it; you shouldn't get any musty smell at first because there's no air movement. Once the water level hits the overflow drain, you will start smelling the musty smell for a while because the water is displacing the gas, which wants to rise above the water and so will move up into the bathroom. If this is the problem, you can ameliorate it with some foaming pipe snake; pour it down the overflow drain and it will clean out any caked-on gunk which contributes to the smell, and which may be trapping the water. The real fix is to make sure there's no ""damming"" effect of construction defects at the bottom of the overflow drain (a lip of porcelain, issues where the overflow meets the metal drain downpipe, etc).</p>

"How do you secure wood framing to a concrete basement floor?","117932","","<p>I'm using Pressure treated lumber for the bottom plate in a basement finishing project.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What should I use to seperate the wood from the concrete?</p></li>
<li><p>What are ways to secure the bottom plate to the floor?</p></li>
</ul>
","<p>pressure treated ""PT"" lumber is made for damp areas, where there's moister and direct contact to concrete or earth. Make sure to use the proper coated anchors for Pressure treated lumber. such as hot-dipped galvanized or stainless steel fasteners. there's more detail about this below.. keep in mind pressure treated is not only a preservative it is also a poison to prevent termites..  </p>

<p>An alternative you can consider using fir or pine as your bottom plates, if on concrete you can't have direct contact. lumber will take the moister from concrete and either cause dry rot. To prevent that from happening lay down sill gasket a foam like material in a roll.. made for this reason.. and can be found in most home hardware locations..  </p>

<p>Commencing in early 2004, the pressure treated wood industry ceased producing CCA treated wood for many residential uses.
 A number of replacements have been developed including Copper Azole (CA), Alkaline Copper Quaternary (ACQ) and Sodium Borate (SBX).</p>

<p>With the change, ACQ and CA will almost certainly be the preservatives used in generically designated “pressure treated” sawn lumber 
in use in building construction. SBX treated lumber is available but would need to be specified as such. </p>

<p>Practices and customs that were adequate with CCA treated lumber may not be appropriate for use with the new products.</p>

<p>Some of these “next generation” wood preservatives are significantly more corrosive to metal than was CCA treated wood. 
Current information suggests that this increase in corrosion particularly applies to CA (and ACQ but not to SBX) </p>

<p>The use of hot-dipped galvanized or stainless steel fasteners with the pressure treated wood, and avoidance of 
contact of aluminum with pressure treated wood have been long standing recommendations; although, in practice,these 
have frequently been overlooked with no serious consequences (other than pitted aluminum flashings). 
With the new preservatives these recommendations should no longer be ignored. Thus it is important to specify and 
obtain appropriate corrosion resistant materials to ensure adequate service life for fasteners and connectors.</p>

<p>Aluminum should not be used in contact with pressure treated wood. Spacer materials or other physical barriers are 
recommended to prevent direct contact of pressure treated wood with aluminum products.</p>

"Do the breaker amp readings sum up to dictate my current panels total / possible amperage?","116895","","<p>So I know practically nothing about houses having rented for many years, just bought a house and was told by my inspector the panel is only a 70 amp panel and will need to be upgraded before I go to install AC.</p>

<p>I took him at his word, and had one AC consult, mentioning this to the guy he looked at my panel and agreed it needed an upgrade.</p>

<p>He gave a terrible quote ($5500 for a 3 ton goodman AC install without the electrical work, no ducting work necessary), so I got somebody else to give me a quote.</p>

<p>Now here's the problem: Fellow comes over and says I have a 150 amp panel and there's room (which I can see) for a couple more breakers on it, and gives me a considerably better AC quote (3500 for a lennox 3 ton 14 seer, all the same bells and whistles).</p>

<p>So now I'm thinking, considering how terrible the quote was from the first consult, perhaps he was just trying to squeeze even more money out of me? Why did my inspector tell me it was a 70 amp panel?</p>

<p>I look at the panel and there's like 6 or 8 15/20 amp breakers on it as well as a 30 amp double-breaker thingy (not sure if this is 30 per or 30 total) and a 50 amp double-breaker thingy.</p>

<p>I'll get a picture when I get home to post here, but off hand my question is:</p>

<p><strong>Is it accurate to say I definitely have over a 70 amp panel due to the sum of amps on breakers in there right now? Is the sum of those little labels on the breakers make up my panels current amperage?</strong></p>

<p>I look online for 70 amp panel and it's this tiny dinky thing with 3 breakers on it..</p>

<p>Edit:
Here are the pictures, if this is not a 70 amp can anybody identify the amps?</p>

<p>Appearances to me are the diagram on the box does not match the actual panel, as the panel has 20 breaker spots (as I read it) while the diagram shows 14. And yes, I realize it's missing a main breaker, so I included the other two pieces I understand identify the max amp load; the conduit and the meter.</p>

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZlYB3.jpg"" alt=""Meter""></p>
","<p>I've labeled your photo, which might help you understand what's going on.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sKjfQ.jpg"" alt=""Labeled Panel""></p>

<h1>The Panel Rating</h1>

<p>The panel is rated to support 125 amperes, when connected to a 120/240 volt 3 wire system. This means that 125 amperes can flow through each of the upper bus bars and each main lug, without anything melting or catching fire.</p>

<h1>The Upper Section</h1>

<p>The top two double pole breakers are before the ""main"" disconnect, which means they will always have power when the wires feeding the panel have power. I'm guessing there is a disconnect ahead of this panel, maybe at the meter or as a standalone disconnect. Based on their size, I'm guessing one (50A) is for an electric stove, electric heater, or maybe a subpanel. The other (30A) is likely for a dryer, water heater, subpanel, or some other appliance.</p>

<h1>The Lower Section</h1>

<p>The next double pole breaker (50A) controls the flow of electricity to the lower section of the panel. Unlike the double pole breakers above, this one should not have any terminals where wires can connect. The lower section is rated for a maximum of 100 amperes, so the breaker protecting it must be 100 amp or less (50A in your case).</p>

<h2>Branch Circuit Section</h2>

<p>The lower section (highlighted in purple) is where the branch circuit breakers connect, and has a maximum breaker size of 70 amperes.  This means the largest breaker that can be connected in this section, is a 70A breaker. </p>

<h1>Upgrade Required?</h1>

<p>Since there is only a single available slot (3), it's not likely a central A/C system could be connected without moving things around (at the very least). Upgrading the panel might be your only option, but it would depend on the existence (or lack thereof) of a sub panel, and the existing service provided to the building (and availability of services in the area).</p>

<p>A subpanel <em>may</em> be an option, however, it would require more information than you have provided here.</p>

<p>Depending on the service provided to the building, upgrading the panel may include an upgrade to the service.  Installing a new 125A panel is useless, if you don't also have the service upgraded to support 125 amperes. </p>

<p>To determine if an upgrade is required, contact a local licensed Electrician to do a load calculation on the building.</p>

<h1>Breakers Protect Downstream Wiring</h1>

<p>Short-circuit and/or overcurrent protection devices (breakers, fuses, etc.), are designed to protect the wiring downstream (after them in the circuit). For example. If your panel did have a main breaker, it would be sized to protect the panel wiring. The breaker would <strong>not</strong> be sized to protect the wiring feeding the panel or anything before the breaker, only the wiring after the breaker.</p>

<h1>Summing Up Breaker Ratings Means Nothing</h1>

<p>If you total up the rating of the breakers in the branch circuit sub-section, you'll find that you have 85A on leg A, and 105A on leg B.  Which means... Well, absolutely nothing.  The only limitations here are that there can only be as many breakers as will physically fit, and no one breaker can be larger than 70A.  </p>

<p>If more than 15 amperes flow through the breaker in slot 4 , that breaker will trip (open). This protects the wiring connected to that breaker.  If more than 50 amperes flow through any combination of breakers on either leg A or B in the branch circuit sub-section, the sub- section breaker will trip (open).  This protects the wiring between the sub-section breaker, and the branch circuit breakers.  </p>

<p>You could theoretically. have breakers totaling 1,000,000A. It still wouldn't matter, as long as you have proper overcurrent protection.  </p>

This room is on the ground floor of a colonial two-story, so there is no attic access into the ceiling; my work space is limited to ""within the room itself.""</p>

<p>I have an existing switch on the wall, which toggles a wall outlet in the corner of the room.  I would like this switch to also control the new ceiling light.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it better to branch the electrical wire to the ceiling from the wall outlet, or from the light-switch?  Why is one a better option than the other?</li>
<li>How should I go about running the electrical wire to the center of the ceiling, from the corner of the room, with no attic access?  Should I cut a long thin strip out of the ceiling and cut a notch out of each crossbeam on the way?  Or is there a better strategy?</li>
</ol>
","<p>The easiest option would be to run a new cable directly from the switch, up to the ceiling fixture. You'll want to either install a larger box and a new switch, or a double switch, so the light can be controlled independently.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cgYjz.jpg"" alt=""Double Switch""></p>

<p>If you're working in a home constructed of solid wood framing, you should be able to run the new cable fairly easily. Since you didn't mention where the switch is, or which way the joist run, I'll cover a few scenarios.</p>

<h2>Wall adjacent to joists</h2>

<p>If the switch is in the middle(ish) of the wall, and the joists are adjacent to the wall. You might get lucky, and simply going up the wall will land you in the proper joist bay.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MA9It.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In this situation, you'll simply have to drill a hole through the top plate, then run your cable.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/clzO3.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If you're not so lucky, and the switch box does not line up with the joist bay.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0UPo7.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You'll have to bore some holes through the joists to reach the ceiling box.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UKKsp.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In this case you'll want to consult local building codes, to figure out where and how to bore the holes.</p>

<h2>Wall parallel to joists</h2>

<p>If the wall runs parallel to the joists, there's no getting around it, you're going to have to bore through the joists.</p>

<p>In this case it doesn't matter if you're near the middle of the wall, or to one side or the other. The procedure will be the same.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6YBX8.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wmrSW.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MQqXA.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sGf3X.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h1>Boring the holes</h1>

<p>To get from the switch box to the ceiling box, you're going to have to drill through at least one structural member. However, if you have the proper tools, the damage can be minimized.  To do this with the least amount of damage possible, you're going to want a flexible drill bit, extensions, and an alignment tool.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BVLDs.png"" alt=""Flexible Bit Kit""></p>

<h2>Through the top plate</h2>

<p>To drill through the top plate, you'll need to make a hole in the finished wall. Cut a hole in the wall above the switch box, near the ceiling. Cut the hole far enough from the ceiling, so you have room to position the flexible drill bit. </p>

<p>Use the alignment tool to position the bit, and drill up through the top plate. Depending on the construction style, this could be a double top plate.  </p>

<h2>Through the joists</h2>

<p>To get through the joists, you can take advantage of the hole you've cut for the ceiling box. Again use the alignment tool to position the flexible drill bit, and start drilling in a straight(ish) line towards the wall with the switch box.  Add extensions as you go, to extend your reach.</p>

<h1>Pulling the cable</h1>

<p>Now that you have a clear path from the switch box to the ceiling fixture, you'll have to pull the cable through the wall/ceiling.  Depending on how things line up, you might have to cut a few hand holes in the finished wall/ceiling to help you maneuver the cable. A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_tape"">fish tape</a> might come in handy.</p>

<h1>Future proofing and other considerations</h1>

<p>Ceiling fans are a common upgrade, so it might be worth a little added expense now. Installing a braced ceiling box, will allow you to install a ceiling fan in the future.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gkPpK.jpg"" alt=""Ceiling fan bracket""></p>

<p>Ceiling fans often come with light kits, and it's common for folks to want to control the fan and light(s) independently. Instead of installing #/2 with ground cable, you might want to install #/3 with ground. This will allow you to install one switch for the fan, and one for the light kit.</p>

<h2>Boring vs. Notching</h2>

<p>While you may, or may not be able to notch the joists to run the cable. Boring holes can be done with less damage to the finished material, and won't make structural engineers cringe.</p>

<hr>

<h1><strong><em>WARNINGS:</em></strong></h1>

<p><em>Consult your local government regarding any permits that might be required. And always follow all manufacturers installations instructions, and all local building codes.</em></p>

<p><em>If you're working in a home that does not have solid wood members, consult local building codes for appropriate course of action.</em></p>

<p><em>If you try to notch the joist, you could end up with your second floor on your first floor.</em></p>

","<p>Solatube Daylighting Systems come in 2 sizes, the 160 DS (10"" in diameter) and the 290 DS (14"").  The 160 DS produces up to 4600 lumens, while the 290 DS produces up to 9100 lumens.  I have no idea what any other brand's lumen output is however, you will most always get more light with a Solatube brand due the fact that their tubing is made with Spectralight tubing (its patented) with 99.7% reflectivity. This means each time the light ""bounces"" down the tube, Solatube loses .3% of the light. With 5 ""bounces"" Solatube only loses 1.5%. If the tubing is less reflective - even by a couple of % points you potentially lose far more light.</p>

<p>Bottom line is you get much more pure light with a smaller opening.  Not to mention the technology in the dome itself to capture more light in dawn and dusk hours and winter months.</p>

"How do I run wires for a wall-mount flatscreen TV?","114768","","<p>Like a lot of you, we have several wall-mounted LCD HDTVs in the house. The TVs have two wires -- power and HDMI -- running down the wall to the power outlet and cable box.</p>

<p>I've historically been too timid to try to run the wiring inside the drywall and too cheap to pay someone to do it... and I'm hoping diy.stackexchange.com can come to the rescue.</p>

<p>What is the <strong>easiest</strong> and <strong>least-destrictive</strong> way to run cables from behind the TV (about 4-6 feet high, depending) to the electrical junction boxes on the floor (usually about 3-4 inches high).</p>

<p>Solutions that are too hard/destructive for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Removing and then patching large swaths of drywall. I would like to keep any drywall holes to a size that can be repaired with a small drywall patch kit.</li>
<li>Installing an electrical junction box behind the TV. I'm not an electrician and this scares me. Also, it doesn't help with the HDMI table.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is this possible for a novice DIYer, or do I need to call in a professional?</p>
","<p>@Jeremy has a good solution, but if you're willing to do a little more work, there is a little better-looking answer. Since you're running an HDMI cable, I assume you have some kind of small stand/table in front of the outlet that your cable box sits in or on.</p>

<p>With a drywall knife, punch out a hole behind the TV and install a plastic ""old-work"" 1-gang box. Don't worry, we're not going to install electrics here; just a plastic box that has a couple of ""ears"" on it so it can slide into existing drywall. Do the same thing at the bottom of the wall, above your electrical outlet. You can now run the cables easily through the wall without patching any drywall. If everything's laid out correctly, both will be hidden (one by the TV, one by the stand/table that holds your cable box).</p>

","<p>Because you are replacing the switch, not installing a new switch, you can get away without a ground. You should install a nonconducting, noncombustible faceplate though.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NEC 2008</strong><br>
  <strong>404.9 (B) <em>Exception.</em></strong>  <em>Where no means exists within the snapswitch enclosure for connecting to the equipment grounding
  conductor or where the wiring method does not include or provide an
  equipment grounding conductor, a snap switch without a connection to
  an equipment grounding conductor shall be permitted for replacement
  purposes only. A snap switch wired under the provisions of this
  exception and located within reach of earth, grade, conducting floors,
  or other conducting surfaces shall be provided with a faceplate of
  nonconducting, noncombustible material or shall be protected by a
  ground-fault circuit interrupter.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you were installing a new switch, you would be required to provide an equipment grounding conductor at the outlet. And the switch would have to be properly grounded, in accordance with the National Electrical Code (NEC).</p>

<p>There was a time when an equipment grounding conductor was not required at each outlet, so it's fairly common to come across this situation (especially when working in older homes).  You'll often see exceptions like this written into codes, so as not to require a full rewire just to replace a switch.</p>

<h1>New info, Better answer</h1>

<p>If you are <strong>replacing</strong> a switch a ground is not required, as per the above exception. However, if you're installing a switch; replacement or otherwise, into a metal box that is grounded. The switch will be ground via the devices yoke and mounting screws. So if the metal box is grounded, the switch is also grounded.</p>

<p>If the box is nonmetallic, and there are other grounded devices within the same enclosure. You can ground the new switch using a jumper between the switches grounding screw, and the other devices grounding screw.  Just keep in mind, that you can't terminate two conductors under a single screw terminal. So if you do this, you'll have to use pigtails to make the connection between the devices.</p>

"Three dead power outlets, no tripped breakers","113661","","<p>A few days ago I was using a multimeter to check for current to the thermostat on my garage refrigerator. I wasn't thinking and did something wrong (wrong HOT, I believe) and power to the refrigerator died. Believing I'd tripped the circuit breaker, I checked the panel but there were no tripped breakers. The multimeter shows no current to the outlet. The refrigerator functions when plugged into a different outlet (via extension cord so it's not an actual workaround).</p>

<p>I've tested all other outlets in the house and there is one that appears like it could be on the same circuit (given proximity and common sense, an unsafe criterion for sure), but there is also an outdoor outlet that is not functional. I can follow the circuit from that outlet for a bit and it does not seem to be on the same circuit (though who knows if that's true or not). I've also reset all breakers in the panel and no change. Additionally, I've walked through the house and tested/reset all GFCI outlets that I could find.</p>

","<p>We are talking about garage and outdoor receptacles. These are both required to be GFCI protected. It is extremely easy to trip a GFI if you are working on the circuit live. Simply touching the neutral to ground, or even testing from hot to ground can trip them.</p>

"How can I prevent or remedy ""bio slime"" accumulation in a sink drain?","112302","","<p>The drain in the sink which we use for mouthwash consistently gets clogged by a very  repugnant slime. I've tried all the common drain unclogging products (Drano, Liquid Plumber) as well as some non-standard remedies (e.g., boiling water, vinegar + baking soda), but none of them seem to help. Which means that once a year I have to disassemble the entire drain/trap assembly and manually scrub out the pipes. Can anyone offer another remedy?</p>

<p>(Note: as I've mentioned, this only happens to the sink where we use our morning mouth wash. We tried using a different sink -- to confirm the theory -- and sure enough, the bio-slime began to build-up in that sink instead. It is apparently caused by the bacterial discharge that is expectorated with the mouthwash.)</p>

<p>UPDATE: I've discovered that the slime only seems to grow in the presence of water. So my initial habit of running the faucet after spitting was actually counter-productive. I now resist the urge to rinse out the mouthwash and it seems to have solved the problem.</p>
","<p>Well, I tried all the suggested solutions and nothing helped. So I removed all the pipes and cleaned it out the hard way (paper towels, etc). </p>

<p>BUT, I was determined to prevent this from happening again, so I tried an experiment: for the last year I have stored a bottle of household disinfectant (Lysol, or generic/organic alternatives) conveniently near the sink. Now every time I use mouthwash at the sink, I chase it down with a few squirts of the disinfectant (and NO water). It has been nearly a year of daily use, and so far, no slime, no sluggish drain. I can live with that</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
Its been a few years, so I thought I would add an update. I found a preventative solution that has been working perfectly: NEVER USE WATER to rinse after spitting. I stopped water-rinsing a few years ago and <em>haven't had to clean the drain since</em>. (And I no longer use any disinfectant, either.) It was something about the moist environment that the water provided that led to the build-up. No water, no slime.</p>

","<p>Yes, NM cable can be in conduit. In fact. NEC calls for it to be in conduit, when protection from physical damage is required.</p>

"Should I remove baseboards prior to installing laminate or wood floors?","110747","","<p>I recently bought around 650sft of laminate floors, to replace around 570sft of carpeted floors in our MN home. These will go in on the main floor, right above an unfinished basement.</p>

<p>I'm planning on installing these myself in the next 3 or 4 weeks, and am in the process of getting my act together (I strongly believe that planning is more critical than the actual execution of a project).</p>

<p>Being paranoid about doing an excellent job, I'm debating whether to remove and re-install the existing baseboard molding, or leave the baseboard in place and install quarter-round (or shoe, depending on what looks better) molding after the laminate is laid.</p>

<p>The laminate floor (with its attached pad) is about as tall as the carpet is now, and adjusting for an 1/8"" gap in the vertical dimension, the baseboard will stay at the same height.</p>

<p>So, which is better?</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't touch the baseboard, install laminate 1/4"" from the baseboard and use quarter-round to cover the gap?</li>
<li>Remove baseboard, install laminate, and put the baseboard back.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not averse to doing extra work to make sure this looks as professional as possible.</p>
","<p>It depends on a couple of things.  How much time you want to invest, how your current baseboards are installed, size of current baseboards, and what you want everything to look like.</p>

<p>As long as it isn't a HUGE deal to take baseboards out I would almost always go with removing them.</p>

<ol>
<li>Your finish will look better.  No quarter round looks way more professional.  Also I hate the process of do you make your quarter round the color of trim or floor - I always vote trim.</li>
<li>It is cheaper.  Quarter round costs money.  So does staining/painting it.</li>
<li>It saves time.  If you have the right tools taking your baseboards out is easy.  And when you put them back - well they fit.  Try to position your tools so that if you gouge the wall it is hidden under the baseboard.  This is easy with practice.  Who cares if the drywall has some nicks under the baseboard.  Cutting your quarter round to fit will take a lot of time.  Also what do you do between a set of doors where you need to put in 10 inches of quarter round?  Well you will be back on this board asking!</li>
</ol>

<p>Take the baseboards out, freshen them up while you are at it, install floor, pop baseboards back.  Touch up paint and caulk where needed.   Not taking them out starts the job faster but then after your install there will be quarter round regret (because of point #1).</p>

<p>I'm not sure what to look at to address this problem. It doesn't strike me as a clog because if it was the sink would drain poorly.</p>
","<p>There is a very simple answer to your question.  Your dishwasher is draining into the side drain adapter on your garbage disposer. this was a common practice for many years. All the water draining from your dishwasher is being pumped into the upper basin side of the disposer. Solids from the dishwasher are blocking the drain in the disposer, so when you turn on the disposer, it grinds the waste and drains the water. This is actually the way it is suppose to work. Current codes require a separate trap for the dishwasher and not plumbed into the disposer. If you look at the side of your disposer, you will see the hose from the washer attached there.  Only fix is to install a new separate trap and drain for the washer.  Good luck.</p>

"What causes tub drain to gurgle when toilet flushed?","108891","","<p>Recently, the drain in my second floor tub makes a gurgling sound when I flush the toilet, which is located right next to the tub.  They are obviously on the same drain line. I know that there is a vent line going up from the bathroom through the attic, but I am not sure of the exact configuration.</p>

<p>In all other respects, both toilet and tub seem to drain normally.</p>

<p>What could be causing the gurgling?</p>
","<p>Two options. Air is going in, or air is coming out.</p>

<p>""Gurgle"" is caused by air being forced through the water in a fixture's trap. It's similar to the ""glug"" generated when you pour milk quickly from the milk jug.  It's air being forced through liquid, in an attempt to equalize pressures.</p>

<h1>Air in</h1>

<p>Vents placed strategically throughout the plumbing system, typically provide an adequate amount  of air. If the vent(s) get clogged/blocked/restricted, pressure differences inside and outside the system will develop.  If these differences in pressure are large enough, air will be forced through fixture traps in an attempt to equalize the pressure.</p>

<p>In this case, clearing vents; or adding additional vents in the case of improper venting, will usually resolve the issue.</p>

<h1>Air out</h1>

<p>If a large enough object (liquid and solid waste) is moved through the system fast enough; in such a way that the object blocks the entire internal pipe diameter, a high pressure zone can be generated on the front side of the object.  This high pressure zone may be able to force air out through fixture traps, as the object travels through the system. Think of it like the plunger of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_gun"" rel=""nofollow"">pop gun</a>.</p>

"Can I vent a portable air conditioner inside?","108424","","<p>I recently bought a portable air conditioner and was wondering if it is absolutely necessary to vent it to the outside. I plan on using it in a room that doesn't have a window as was wondering if I could vent it to another room in the house without doing any damage (eg mold growing in the house). I understand the air coming out of the AC will be warm and would warm up the room it was venting into.</p>
","<p>It's possible but it will be creating a situation where your a/c is fighting against itself, because you'll simply be redistributing the heat inside your house, instead of putting it on the outside.</p>

<p>Why?  Because the warm air will creep back into the room you were cooling, so the a/c will be acting like a big do-nothing machine - to a degree anyway.</p>

<p>Mold isn't going to be too concerning, however, because you won't be taking moisture out of the one room and putting it into the other - the moisture in the air in the warm room may increase a little (because warm air can hold more water vapor than cold air, so if moisture is there, it'll get picked up) but not to the degree it would if you were, say, venting a dryer into that room, where you'd be introducing lots of NEW moisture. </p>

<p>All that said - I do not recommend this idea.  Better to create a vent/opening (properly, of course, but that's a different question) in the outside wall to allow the warm air to go where it is supposed to.</p>

"How do you plan capacity for electrical circuits?","108359","","<p>I'm finishing a section of my basement, which currently only has one bulb for bare light.  In planning the electrical arrangement of things, how do I estimate the load of light fixtures or electrical outlets so I know if I need heavier gauge wire, or additional circuits?</p>

<p>Yes, I could read the labels of the light fixtures and appliances I plan to install/use.  But that doesn't allow for potential fixture changes or room re-utilization in the future.  I'm thinking there must be a rule of thumb for ""lights fixtures are this many watts, outlets are that many watts.""  I've just no idea how many.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT - Follow up question</strong></p>

<p>I'm seeing a lot of commentary which seems to imply 15 amp circuits are the norm (including other questions on diy.se).  I know there are a few 15 amp circuits in my house, but most of them are 20.  Why would you prefer one size circuit over the other?  When would you use a 20 amp circuit?</p>
","<h1>Minimum receptacle spacing.</h1>

<p>NEC Article 210.52(A)-(H) tells us that, the maximum distance (measured horizontally along the wall) to a receptacle should be no more than 6'.  There are two important exceptions to this rule. doors, fire places, and other openings do not count as wall space. Also any wall less than 2' wide, does not count as wall space.  The idea here is that if you have a lamp with a 6' cord, no matter where you put it (along the wall) you should always be able to plug it in.</p>

<p>Lets take this 20x20 room for example.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rbPtN.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>We'll need a minimum of 6 receptacles, in this room to meet code.  You'll notice the wall with the door and closet, only has 1 receptacle.  This is because the doors, and the 1' 11"" wall between them do not count as wall space.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, however, this is a <em>minimum</em> code. You can always install more receptacles, if you want to.</p>

<h1>Calculating loads</h1>

<p>Once you've determined where your lights and receptacles will be placed, you'll have to determine how many and what size circuits you'll need. For this, we can reference NEC Article 220.</p>

<p><strong>Lights</strong></p>

<p>For dwelling units, we'll use 3 Volt-Amperes/ft² to figure out how much lighting we might want.  When measuring area we must measure from outside to outside, so we'll have to include the wall thickness in our calculations.
So if we have a 20'x20' room, with 2x4 walls and 5/8"" drywall on each side we'll get.</p>

<p>3 1/2"" + 5/8"" + 5/8"" = 4 3/4""</p>

<p>20' + 4 3/4"" = 244 3/4"" = 20.4'</p>

<p>20.4' * 20.4' = 416.16 ft².</p>

<p>416.16 ft². * 3VA = <strong>1248.48VA</strong></p>

<p>We know that a 15A circuit will be 1800VA (15A * 120V = 1800VA), so we can see we'll only need one 15A circuit for lights.</p>

<p><strong>Receptacles</strong></p>

<p>When calculating loads for receptacles, we'll use 180VA per receptacle. Using this value, we can determine that we can have 10 receptacles on a 15A circuit.</p>

<p>15A * 120V = 1800VA</p>

<p>1800VA / 180VA = <strong>10</strong></p>

<p>For each 20A circuit, we can have 13 receptacles.</p>

<p>20A * 120 = 2400VA</p>

<p>2400VA / 180VA = <strong>13.3333333333</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>It's a good idea when wiring up a new room, to keep the lights and receptacles on different circuits.  This is not required, but it does make practical sense to do so if you can.  As an example, lets say you have the lights and receptacles on the same circuit. Every time you vacuum the lights dim, then the breaker finally trips. Now you're left standing in a dark room, trying to get to the door without stubbing your toe.  If the lights were on a separate circuit, you wouldn't stub your toe.</p>

<p>∴ lights + receptacles on same circuit = stubbed toes.</p>

<p>Now I'm not saying you should have a bunch of circuits with a single light on them, just that it's a good idea to have receptacles and lights on different circuits.  You could always share a light circuit across a few rooms, to decrease the number of circuits required.</p>

<p>The best way to figure out how many, and what size circuits you need for a room. Is to plan out how many consumers you'll have first.  Decide how many lights and receptacles you <em>want</em>, then determine what size/type of wiring you'll <em>need</em>.</p>

"What are the pros and cons of installing a roof heating cable?","107911","","<p>Had some roof work done last year after mother nature abused my house by way of an errant tree branch. I had always suspected my roof had poor ventilation, most notably when I wound up with a 200 lb chunk of ice going from roof to ground (about 20 feet or so), so when the roofing contractor repaired the roof I had him install a ridge vent and ventilation system along the back wall (for some reason, my back wall has no soffits).</p>

<p>Anywho to make a long story even longer, it's winter here and I've got some ice dams in the gutters and icicles hanging off the roof. When spring rolls around I'm considering putting up a roof heating wire along (or possibly IN) the gutter and up the first 5-6 feet of roof on both sides of the house. I've heard various pros and cons from friends and family about these heating wires and just wanted to get opinions from the fine folk here as to what they think of this system.</p>

<p>I live in the ""snow belt"" region of Ohio (for those who live outside of the country, ""snow belt"" just means we get hit with severe lake effect snow often accumulating to several feet over the course of a day or so). So if you live in a similar area or know someone who does I'd love to hear your point of view.</p>
","<p>I'm a contractor in Maine and we certainly have a lot of experience with ice dams. An ice dam can be the quickest way to force water under the roof shingles even on a roof in good shape. </p>

<p>I have had mixed results with heat tapes. When they are used properly, they can be somewhat effective. Most folks expect to see a nice bare zig zag pattern along the edge of the roof with the ice gone around the tape. Not how it works! </p>

<p>If you carefully read all the directions on many of the competing brand heat tapes out there, you will see that they do not claim to remove ice dams. They are designed only to create a small open tunnel under the ice dam to allow water that is trapped above the dam to drain off the roof. This is great in theory but here is where the reality sets in.  If the tape does not extend slightly beyond or below the drip edge of the roof, it won't work. If the top edge of the tape does not extend above the ice dam, they will not work. If the gutters fill with ice and bridge the ice to the roof, they won't work. </p>

<p>Many of the tapes instruct you to only operate them when outdoor temps are 30 degrees and above. I have found that they are ineffective in temps much below 20 degrees. They also caution not to let them run continuously. </p>

<p>Running them in the bottom of a gutter is almost a complete waste of time and money. Since they only are capable of melting a small area around the tape, a gutter full of ice will stay full of ice! If the downspout is blocked with ice, forget it!  </p>

<p>What I have also found is that folks get a false sense of security when they have them installed and neglect to remove the snow from the bottom 3 to 6 feet of their roofs, figuring the tape is a substitute for roof shoveling. Obviously, when they are installed, shoveling or using a roof rake gets a little tricky, so as not to rip the tape right off the roof. </p>

<p>I guess you can tell I am not a fan of these heat tapes. One method I have found to be extremely effective with dealing with an ice damn are nylon stockings or pantyhose (cut into two sections) filled with salt, calcium chloride or potassium chloride placed over the dam. They last several days and melt slowly and make a nice wide valley in the ice. I have seen hundreds of gallons of water pour off from behind an ice dam using them. Chopping the ice dam can damage the shingles and can be dangerous, but the filled stockings are fairly quick and easy.  </p>

<p>If you have plants below or are concerned about salt staining your roof or  siding etc, I highly recommend Potassium Chloride which will not harm plants, grass etc. You can usually find potassium chloride at your local hardware store. </p>

<p>I can't take credit for discovering this method, but thankfully I learned it from a tip on This Old House many years ago.  I usually make up dozens of them in advance, so I am ready for all the calls from folks who wait too long and call to see if I can come fix the water leaking through their ceilings!</p>

"Should I insulate air conditioner coolant pipes?","107648","","<p>I recently replaced some rotted insulation on the coolant pipe that runs out of my AC unit and into the evaporator in my house. When cleaning inside the actual AC unit itself I noticed that the coolant pipe running out of what I believe is the condenser (has a insulation blanket over it) is not insulated. Is there any reason not to insulate this coolant pipe? I traced the line and made sure that it is the same pipe that is insulated once it gets outside the AC unit.</p>
","<p>This is the answer to your actual question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""insulating the coolant pipe inside the actual AC unit itself.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you correctly observed, if the outside pipe ""should"" be insulated (it should), then the inside pipe ""should"" also be insulated for all the same reasons everyone pointed out.  However, the key is ""should"" vs ""must."" For argument's sake, say the outside pipe is 99 ft long and the inside pipe is 1 ft.  Then the 99 ft pipe will absorb 99 times more heat from the outside air.  So it's very important to insulate the outside pipe because it will absorb a lot of heat.  It's not so important to insulate the inside pipe because it's so short it doesn't absorb much heat.  Your AC would be slightly more efficient if you insulated the inside pipe -- but you get 99% of the benefit from insulating the outside, and only 1% of the benefit from insulating the inside pipe.  Practically speaking, it's not enough benefit to make a difference. </p>

"How to remove floor adhesive from concrete?","107113","","<p>The problem is aggravated by the presence of underlayment. When engineered hadrwood flooring was removed, some underlayment was removed with it, and some stayed glued to the floor.</p>

<p>What is the best way to remove all this mess? And should I use any solvent or adhesive remover?</p>
","<p>I found the answer by talking to a team of professional contractors who are removing the floor in the apartment next door. There are several steps.</p>

<p>After the flooring is removed:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pour adhesive remover on top of the underlayment, let it soak a few hours. There will be many holes in the underlayment from removing the flooring, so the solvent will slowly seep in. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/optxJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p>Scrape underlayment with a sharp scraping tool. The underlayment should now be easy to scrape off. If not, pierce more holes in it and let it soak a bit longer. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jZqAZ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p>When the underlayment has been scraped off, there will be still a layer of adhesive on concrete. Pour liberal amount of adhesive remover and let it soak overnight. <strong>Warning</strong>: I am not certain if now is the time to scrape again, or proceed to the next step. You may want to try over a small area to see what works best.</p></li>
<li><p>Spread sweeping compound on top of the floor. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kX5N3.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p>Sweep the floor using a heavy duty broom. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QD0Vm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
</ol>

<p>The floor is now completely cleaned of glue -- just bare concrete, smooth, clean, and nice to look at. Unfortunately, the job is very messy. And the vapors from adhesive remover are toxic. So if you are doing a small patch, you might be better off with scraping it manually using a reciprocating saw with a scraping attachment. Very labor intensive, and does not remove all glue completely, but a lot cleaner.</p>

"Why is my air conditioner tripping the circuit breaker?","106806","","<p>Our air conditioner recently stopped blowing out cold air.  When I went to check on it, I noticed that the outside unit wasn't coming on.  We had had problems with ants in the contacter in the past, and so I went to take off the lid and check it out. I noticed that the circuit breaker marked ""AC"" was tripped. Like a good DIYer, I turned it all the way off and back on. It immediately tripped again.  In an effort to isolate the problem, I went to the outside unit and pulled the safety connection to disconnect the main power of the outside unit.  When I went back and reset the circuit breaker as before, the breaker didn't trip. Reconnecting the outside safety switch caused the breaker to immediately trip again.  Later, we tried turning off the air conditioning in the house, resetting the circuit breaker, and turning the AC back on. The circuit breaker didn't trip as soon as it was reset, but when the AC was turned back on inside, it immediately tripped as before.</p>

<p>My question is what should I check in this situation?  This seems like it can't be an uncommon problem, so I'm sure HVAC professionals encounter this frequently and have a checklist of things to try.  What are the possible causes, remedies, and safety precautions I should consider in this situation?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Answers to some comments:  No, I didn't see any obvious damage to the wiring near the outside unit.  I did look pretty carefully, since I had already taken the panel off to check for ants in the contacter.  I didn't try to spin the fan with my hand, and I'm not in a place that I can try this right now.  I will try it later today; perhaps in the meantime that could be a step in the diagnosis of the problem if anyone gives an answer between now and then?  Likely, future readers of this question will encounter the same problem and some will have a fan that spins by hand and some will have one that is stuck.</p>
","<h1>Disconnect the power</h1>

<p>Start by turning off the breaker, and pulling the serviceman disconnect, which will typically look something like this.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8aMRPm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This will insure no electricity is flowing to the condenser unit while you're working. </p>

<h1>Open the unit</h1>

<p>Next you'll want to disassemble the unit, to allow access to the electrical parts. This will vary from unit to unit, so check the owners manual for the procedure for your unit.  Once you have the unit opened up, make sure to discharge the capacitors.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z7UKYm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>These things store enough power to kill you, so you don't want them to discharge accidentally. </p>

<h1>Resistance is not futile</h1>

<p>Once the power is completely removed from the unit, it's safe to start poking around (electrically speaking, don't go busting the refrigerant lines). Start by tracing the wires from the condenser fan motor, back to where they connect in the electrical box.  There should be 3 or 4 wires.  In my unit, I had Black, White, Brown, and Brown with a White stripe (your model may vary).  To determine if the motor is good, you'll measure the resistance across each coil.  To do this, you'll have to disconnect the wires, so the motor is no longer part of the circuit (make note of where the wires connected).  </p>

<p>Typically you'll have 3 wires, start, run, and common (we'll ignore my 4th wire in this answer). Set your multimeter to measure <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ohms</a>, and start measuring.  You're going to measure the resistance between each combination of two wires to determine what each wire is, and if the motor is still good. Let's start with Black and White...</p>

<p>Black -> White = 15.9<br>
Black -> Brown = 35.4<br>
Brown -> White = 51.2</p>

<p>Knowing that...</p>

<p>Common -> Run = Lowest resistance<br>
Common -> Start = Medium resistance<br>
Start -> Run = Highest resistance  </p>

<p>We can determine that...</p>

<p>Black = Common<br>
White = Run<br>
Brown = Start  </p>

<p>If we also know that the two lower readings should always add up to the larger reading, we can safely say this motor is still good. If you measure 0 or infinity between any pair, that means you have a shorted or an open winding and the motor should be replaced.</p>

<p>Repeat the same procedure for the compressor motor.</p>

<h1>Shorts on the ground</h1>

<p>The other thing you'll want to check for, is shorts to ground.  Set your multimeter up to test impedance.  Put one probe on the equipment grounding conductor of the feeder, and the use the other to find a solid ground on the motor.  You may have to scratch some of the paint off, especially on the compressor.  Once you've found a solid ground, measure from each motor wire to your ground spot.  If the meter beeps or give a low resistance reading, you have a short to ground. As with the resistance test above, the motor should be isolated from the circuit when doing this test (once a solid ground is located).</p>

"How can I dog-proof a chain link fence?","106649","","<p>I have a dog who has recently discovered that she can squeeze under a portion of the chain-link fence we installed in order to keep her on our property.</p>

<p>Is there any effective, but reasonably attractive way I can reinforce the bottom of the fence?  I attempted to tent-peg that section of fence down to the ground, but as I discovered this morning, she can just easily push the steel pegs I used out.</p>

<p>I can't really afford to mess around with any ineffective solutions; I live right next to an elementary school, and as I discovered this morning it takes less than 5 minutes to go from her going missing to me receiving a hefty fine, despite her being a very friendly/well tempered German Shepherd/Rottweiler cross.</p>
","<p>The best solution is to add a dig-out guard to your fence or dog run:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Head to the home improvement store and pick up some galvanized sheet metal about 2 feet wide (corrugated or straight is fine; the stuff they use for roofing and sheathing outbuildings is perfect)</p></li>
<li><p>With snips, a hacksaw or a Sawzall, cut the metal to workable lengths, maybe 3-4'. If it's corrugated, you want the curves to be perpendicular to the long dimension of each piece, so that when it goes into the ground the curves are vertical. You may, for appearances, paint the ""top"" edge of the metal a pleasing color of oil-based enamel; then it just looks like edging. But, being galvanized, the metal will be weather-resistant.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a shovel (as straight-bladed as possible) to cut down through the topsoil at least a foot and a half (or as deep as possible) along the line of the chain-link fence. You shouldn't have to really dig much; just push down and then wiggle the shovel to widen the cut.</p></li>
<li><p>With a block of wood and a rubber mallet, pound the sheet metal down into the cut you made until there's about 6"" of the sheet metal remaining above ground. Press any loose earth/grass down firmly against the sheet metal on both sides. Repeat around the entire length of the fence.</p></li>
<li><p>With a drill and a metal-cutting bit, drill two holes a couple inches down from the top of the metal and on opposite sides of your chain links, at regular intervals along each piece and where two pieces meet (each set of holes should probably be no more than the width of your dog's shoulders or the maximum diameter of his body).</p></li>
<li><p>With linesman's pliers, cut a length of annealed wire, pass it through the holes from the inside of the fenced area, then twist it into place around a chain-link wire on the outside (bored dogs will chew, and you don't want them chewing on metal wire).</p></li>
<li><p>Annealed wire will rust over a period of years if given the opportunity (the idea is usually that it's cheap to replace); you can mitigate this with a shot of clear acrylic or polyurethane spray, or you can just keep an eye on the wires and replace them. They do make galvanized wire specifically for use with chain-link, but it's stiffer stuff for a given gauge and so is harder to work with.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You now have an anchored piece of metal that the dog will have to dig more than a foot down to get under (or will hit impenetrable rock before he gets there), that is attached firmly to the chain-link so the dog won't be able to squeeze between them. This should be far more effective than your tent stakes at preventing him getting under the fence.</p>

","<p>To answer your first question, no it's not permitted to have a 3 prong receptacle without the ground wire being attached.

I believe the short answer is that it should be a 2 prong receptacle (which will be difficult to find and only to be used in grandfathered situations) or you could use a GFCI with a ""no equipment ground"" label.</p>

<p>If you use your neutral as a ground, then a neutral fault (a break in the neutral connection somewhere in the circuit) will result in the exterior of every device on the far side of that fault being an electrocution risk.

","<p>In the short term, you could waterproof the foundation with some sealant paint like <a href=""http://www.ugl.com/drylokMasonry/masonryWaterproofer/latex.php"">Drylok</a>.</p>

<p>Longer term, you need to fix the problem by directing water away from the house.  Is there cracking where the patio meets the house? That would indicate subsidence at that side of the patio, at which point I would definitely call in the professionals.</p>

<p>The next question is how much of a slope there is, and how much you would need to build up the house side of the patio.  A thin layer of concrete is easy to apply; you just need to get it thick enough that it won't flow so much that it levels itself out before setting.  Getting it looking good is more difficult, but can be done with care, but again you're balancing time to do that versus the concrete setting as you're working with it.  If this is someplace that people will use a lot, so you want it to look good, you might still want to pay someone to do it.</p>

"Why do the burners on my stove turn on and off while in use?","105080","","<p>I've got a Whirlpool RF378LXPB0.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zs2bY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<p>The two front burners (that can heat a smaller, inner burner, or both the small and larger around it) do not heat up all the way. When turning them on HI, the elements heat up red but then turn off after a few seconds. Once they cool down a bit they'll turn back on and heat up a bit until shutting off once again. I'm not mechanically or electrically inclined, and am not sure where to even start looking.</p>
","<p>The ""burners"" on an electric range have TWO settings - off and on. There is no in between. So they turn on and off to maintain a goal.</p>

<p>With the burner set to high, normally they stay on almost all the time, heating the pot on top of it to boil water. With the heat control set to an intermediate value, the burner will kick on and off repeatedly to maintain a goal temperature. However, if you leave a pot off of the burner, they will overheat if they stay on permanently. The temperature sensor recognizes this fact, and that there is no need to leave the burner on.</p>

<p>All of this is different for a gas range, where it is the amount of gas that is fed to the burner to control the heat.</p>

<p>Note that an electric range will cook more slowly than a gas range. So you may think the stove is not working properly, when it actually is working as it is designed. One other important point - a smooth top range like this cooks most efficiently with flat bottomed pots. You need good contact over the bottoms to get good heat transfer, and good heat transfer is essential for cooking. Check this fact by taking one of your pots and hold a ruler across the diameter (underneath the pot). Or take the pot and touch the edge of your counter top. Sight along that straight edge. Most pots tend to have a bit of a dish to them, so the center of the pot may stand off by as much as 1/4 inch. Those pots will perform poorly. (Sorry, but they will.)</p>

<p>That concave pot bottom is fine for a gas range. But it will hurt you with a smooth top electric range.</p>

<p>What can I do to make the doors in our home open more quietly without this sticking sound?</p>

<p>Should I somehow lubricate the frame (I'm worried that it'll collect dust or other particles and look bad)? Maybe use sandpaper to rough the paint up so it's less likely to stick? </p>
","<p>By what you're describing, I assume you have paint on the outer edges of the door and the inside of the door frame. Paint doesn't make a good lubricant. And the door may not have been fitted to have the clearance for a coat of paint, or three coats if its an older house. And then when its humid and the door expands a bit, the paint rubs catches against the paint on the other surface.</p>

<p>If that is true, you could sand down or strip the offending parts until they clear each other without touching (and possibly repaint with a single coat if you need to). I'd expect sanding only to ""rough it up"" to increase the friction, not make it better.</p>

<p>The old fixture on my wall has 3 holes for wiring, labeled <strong>N</strong>, <strong>Loop</strong>, and <strong>A</strong>.</p>

<p>I live in Queensland, Australia. </p>
","<p>Warning: Contains Dangerous Discussion.  Call an Electrician.</p>

<p>I did a quick search on Australian wiring, and found out that A is ""Active"", which would be considered HOT in other countries.  N is Neutral, and Loop is for carrying on to other outlets or switches.</p>

<p>This link <a href=""https://www.dlsweb.rmit.edu.au/toolbox/electrotech/toolbox1204/resources/04diagrams/04lighting/05loops.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dlsweb.rmit.edu.au/toolbox/electrotech/toolbox1204/resources/04diagrams/04lighting/05loops.htm</a> shows loop being used, in two different instances, on both the neutral and the Active sides of the circuits.  So in your situation, the best answer can only be: It Depends.</p>

<p>My suspicion is that there is another light connected to this one -- Did two lights turn on at the switch under the old install?  If so, you need to pigtail (See below) the Loop wire to either the A or N wire (But we don't know which!!!) to carry on the circuit to the other light.  </p>

<p>My starting assumption would be that the Loop should be pigtailed to the A, but it's dangerous just to go ahead and try that.  You have a 50% chance of being right, and a 50% chance of shorting out the circuit.  Hopefully, this would result in a breaker tripping, but it could result in a fire.  So call an electrician.</p>

<p>Pigtails - Two wires in a circuit twisted together with a small (4-5 inch) length of wire. Typically this is used to both carry on the wiring to another device, with the small length being used as a tap, feeding the local device.  All three wires are twisted together with the appropriately sized wire nut.   <a href=""http://electrical.about.com/od/wiringcircuitry/ht/pigtailwireconn.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electrical.about.com/od/wiringcircuitry/ht/pigtailwireconn.htm</a></p>

<p>I hadn't seen this before, but I guess it makes sense. I suppose it's an alternative to pig tailing the wires in the box. Is there an argument to choose one method over the other? Or are they both perfectly valid option?</p>
","<p>I rarely see pigtails to join the outlet line/load connections in any of the renovation work I've done. I think it's just easier for the electrician to wire both parts of the outlet, rather than getting a small piece of wire, twist, affix nut, and attach to the outlet. It also takes up less space in the j-box.</p>

<p>Of course the line/load are pigtailed in other j-boxes (e.g. lighting fixtures and switches) since they don't have two screw terminals. And you would pigtail the lines before a GFCI if the next device shouldn't be protected by that GFCI outlet, but otherwise you would always use the line/load terminals in a GFCI.</p>

<p>Here's what it looks like: <img src=""https://imgur.com/9F8wM.jpg"" alt=""here&#39;s""></p>
","<p>There's several ways to fix this, depending on a few things.</p>

<p>The best thing to do is avoid drywall anchors, and screw directly into a stud. If there's one close enough that it looks okay, you should do that. You'll have to patch up these holes, which may be a bit of a pain to do with the textured walls, but it's doable.</p>

<hr>

<p>The next best option is probably to use a toggle bolt anchor. These are bolts that expand when you put them in the wall:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XBzUa.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.naturalhandyman.com/iip/inffastener/infanchor/infanchor.html"">This site</a> has some good info on them, including a sizing chart:</p>

3/16"" toggle  1/2"" drill
1/4"" toggle   5/8"" drill
5/16"" toggle  7/8"" drill
3/8"" toggle   7/8 drill
1/2"" toggle   1 1/4"" drill

<p>This option has the advantage that you can probably use the existing holes (just use a large enough toggle bolt), and bolts are reasonably strong so hopefully this won't happen again. </p>

<p>It's hard to tell from the picture, but if the curtain hardware doesn't totally cover the holes you'll need to do some cosmetic work. Keep in mind though that if you patch these holes with compound, they still won't be as strong as regular drywall, so you won't be able to put the same size anchor back in and expect it to hold. </p>

","<h1>Where to find the specifications</h1>

<h3>Listed on the furnace</h3>

<p>Somewhere inside the service panel of the furnace, there should be a schematic for the furnace.  This may list the electrical specifications of the blower motor.  If not, the blower motor itself will have a label on it.  It should list the voltage, amperage, horsepower, etc.</p>

<h3>Using an Ammeter</h3>

<p>An <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammeter"" rel=""noreferrer"">ammeter</a> is used to measure the amount of current flowing through an electrical circuit. You can use a clamp on ammeter to measure the amount of current being used by the blower motor while it's running.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tDCuw.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tDCuwm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Simply set the meter to measure current (A in the pictured meter), and clamp it on the hot wire feeding the motor.<br>
<sub><em>This method may require working on or near live wires, please use caution and/or consult an expert to take the readings</em></sub></p>

<h1>Calculate Usage</h1>

<p>With the above information and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm&#39;s_law"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ohm's law</a>, it's easy to determine how much power the motor will use over a given time period.  </p>

<p>Ohm's law says that <code>Power (P)</code> = <code>Voltage (V)</code> x <code>Current (I)</code>, so we can determine how much power the motor uses at a single instant in time.</p>

<p>ex.  </p>

<pre><code>P = 115V * 5.2A
P = 598 Watts  
</code></pre>

<p>Next we have to determine how many kilowatt hours the motor will use, which we do by dividing by 1000.</p>

<pre><code>P = 598 W / 1000
P = 0.598 kWh
</code></pre>

<p>So for every hour the motor runs, it will use 0.943 kilowatts of power.</p>

<pre><code>Total power/day = 0.598kWh * 24h
Total power/day = 14.352kWh
Total power/month = 14.352Kwh * 30
Total power/month = 430.56kWh
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, if you multiply this number by the amount you pay per kilowatt hour. You'll see just about how much it costs to run the motor constantly. </p>

<pre><code>Cost = 430.56kWh * $0.07
Cost = $30.14 per month
</code></pre>

"How can I improve the water pressure in my shower?","98296","","<p>I recently purchased my first home. It has two bathrooms and the water pressure in both is less than ideal. What are some steps I can take to increase the pressure?</p>
","<p>This is an effective trick a plumbing contractor once told me.</p>

<p>Go to your local home improvement store and buy a cheap shower head (the one I picked up cost $1.50). If you look down inside of the showerhead you'll see a washer which constricts the water flow. If you take a drill and enlarge the hole, thereby increasing flow, the water pressure will increase. I didn't think it would work but it did!!</p>

<p>If you want to go the expensive route, there are pumps you can purchase that will attach to the piping and add pressure to the water. I've heard of such a thing but never looked for one.</p>

"Why energy saving bulb flashes when the switch is off?","98223","","<p>I have a energy saving spiral light bulb in my kitchen. In exactly every 27 seconds, the first segment of the bulb faintly flashes when the switch is off. And not once, repeatedly every 27 seconds. This weird situation occurs for more than half and a year. What can be causing these flashes? How can I prevent it if it spends energy or has safety risks?</p>

<p>PS: A new spiral bulb does the same thing. And the bulb doesn't flash when I remove from socket.</p>
","<p>For this to happen there must be some voltage to the light socket. It may not be noticeable with a standard incandescent bulb because it apparently is not the full voltage and current. If you are comfortable in what you are doing, you could measure the voltage across the two wires and ground to see what you get. Incorrect wiring could be the problem, such as an improper shared neutral leg, or the neutral being switch instead of the hot leg. This can be found using a voltmeter and referencing to a known ground. If your not sure, leave it to an electrician. Wiring is not a hobby, and can be lethal!</p>

"Why is GFCI tripping on refrigerator circuit?","98116","","<p>My refrigerator is tripping the GFCI on the socket into which it is plugged.  Searching about this topic seems to indicate that this is a reasonably common complaint.  However, I can't find any concrete information about general causes or potential solutions other than suggestions to replace everything and hope for the best; this seems unsatisfying.</p>

<p>This is a new fridge and all new electrical work by licensed professionals.  I believe that the electrical is installed correctly and grounded, and that there is no damage to the fridge. I believe this is a dedicated circuit from the breaker panel to the outlet for the fridge. Nothing else is on this circuit and nothing else is plugged into the other socket. Low humidity. Kitchen installation. No water, no ice-maker. This has never happened before, but now it trips the GFCI immediately after reset.</p>

<p>I've done the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reset the GFCI, then re-plugged the fridge; GFCI tripped again.</li>
<li>Plugged other things (alone) into the fridge's GFCI outlet: they work fine and GFCI does not trip.</li>
<li>Plugged refrigerator into other GFCI-protected outlet with nothing else on it; <em>this</em> GFCI outlet also tripped.</li>
<li>Plugged refrigerator into other non-GFCI outlet; works and doesn't trip the breaker.</li>
<li>Tested the socket wiring (using 3-lamp receptacle tester) -- it's correct.</li>
<li>Measured resistance between prongs on the refrigerator's electrical cord; ~300 kOhms between hot and neutral; no continuity to ground from either.  This all seems reasonable.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> per comment below, I should also note that I called the service line for the manufacturer: they said only that, if the appliance works when plugged into a non-GFCI outlet, that there's nothing more they can do.</p>

<p>To me, this seems to suggest the fridge is broken -- but it's brand new!  <strong>Why would my fridge be tripping the GFCI? Is this to be expected for a refrigerator?</strong> Should I just plug it into non-GFCI and ignore it ""like any normal person""? ;-)</p>

<p>Several other questions on this site suggest solutions for other GFCI issues, but I don't see any about refrigerators and GFCI.  <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/a/33227/28171"">This answer</a> seems to suggest that refrigerators shouldn't be on GFCI in the first place.

<p>Other topics about humidity, garages, other stuff, wiring, etc. don't seem to apply here.</p>
","<h1>Residential Kitchen</h1>

<p>In a dwelling unit (residential), GFCI protection is only required for kitchen receptacles that serve the coutertop surfaces. There's no requirement to GFCI protect receptacles that serve a refrigerator. Unless the fridge is plugged into a coutertop receptacle.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>National Electrical Code 2014</h1>
  
  <h2>Chapter 2 Wiring and Protection</h2>
  
  <h3>Article 210 Branch Circuits</h3>
  
  <h3><em>I. General Provisions</em></h3>
  
  <p><strong>210.8 Ground-Fault Circuit-Interrupter Protection for Personnel.</strong> Ground-fault circuit-interrupter protection for personnel shall be provided as required in 210.8(A) through (C). The ground-fault circuit-interrupter shall be installed in a readily accessible location.</p>

  <p>(6) Kitchens— where the receptacles are installed to serve the countertop surfaces.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Garages, Unfinished Basement, and Other Locations</h1>

<p>If the refrigerator is in a garage, boathouse, or unfinished basement. All the receptacles are required to be GFCI protected, so the fridge will have to be plugged into a GFCI protected receptacle.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Why does the fridge trip the GFCI?</h1>

<p>Any inductive load when switched off, can produce <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_interference"">electromagnetic interference (EMI)</a>. This interference can, and often does, trip GFCI devices. Most vapor compression refrigerators have a few inductive loads, any of which could cause the trip.</p>

<h1>Is there anything that can be done?</h1>

<p>There are devices called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snubber"">snubbers</a> that can be used to reduce, or eliminate the effects of EMI. Installing one between the fridge and the GFCI device, <em>could</em> prevent nuisance trips. The best solution though, is to connect the fridge to a non-GFCI protected circuit.</p>

<h1>If that's all it takes, why isn't there already one built in?</h1>

<p>While most (all) manufacturers are aware that refrigerators can cause nuisance tripping of GFCI devices, most (none) seem willing to provide a solution. It would be complete speculation for me to try and tell you why they don't care, so of course I'll go through a few possibilities.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cost.<br>
Plain and simple, it costs money to implement a solution.  </li>
<li>Warranties and Operating Conditions.<br>
Most refrigerators are designed to operate in a kitchen. Running them in dusty, dirty garages and basements could lead to more warranty covered repairs. </li>

"How do I connect a dryer with a four prong plug to a three prong socket?","97802","","<p>I've just moved house and my clothes dryer has a four prong plug but on the wall there's a three prong socket. Do adapters exist for this? Or do I need to get a new cord for my dryer? Or is there another solution?</p>
","<p>You could replace the cord on the dryer, but you'd have to bond the chassis of the dryer to make that acceptable to current NEC codes (Article 250.140). This can be a safety hazard if done incorrectly, and it may or may not void the warranty on the dryer. </p>

<p>Since your dryer is set up to use a 4 prong receptacle, the optimal solution would be to update the receptacle to a 4 prong (NEMA 14-30R if I remember correctly).  However, this will require you to run new cable to the receptacle, since you'll need a cable with a ground. Depending on the draw of the dryer and the length of the run, you'll either have to pull new 10-3 /w ground or 8-3 /w ground cable.</p>

<h3>EDIT:</h3>

<p>As @TheEvilGreebo pointed out, you <strong><em>may</em></strong> be able to simply swap out the cord on the dryer for a 3 prong version. Check the manufacturers documentation to verify the procedure, and to make sure your model supports this.</p>

<p>As for woodpeckers, there are typically two possible reasons they've decided to decimate your house. First is insects. This was our main problem, we had a bad carpenter bee problem in our fascia and the woodpeckers were burrowing to get the bees. Take care of the insects and eventually the woodpeckers will go away. Secondly, woodpeckers might have decided to call your house their home, if this is the case usually using deterrents can make them decide to call somewhere else home. The best thing I've found is aluminum foil. As they start to peck on a spot on your house, tape some aluminum foil over top the spot they were pecking. You'll probably only have to do this once or twice and they'll move on if there aren't insects. I have a cedar home and battled the little guys the first 3 years of owning it. </p>

<p>Is there a risk of damaging any circuitry in doing this?</p>

<p>Is there a way of finding out what the HVAC current condition is, based only on the wiring voltages?(cooling and heating)</p>
","<p>A thermostat basically just energizes the individual circuits (G (fan), W (heat), Y(cool) ) which in turn (via the furnace controller) powers a relay which provides line voltage to the actual units (like the fan or A/C.  In the case of heat, it instructs your furnace to open the valve supplying gas).</p>

<p>R (or Rh  and Rc) provides the 24VAC power.  To turn on the fan, you'd connect R and G.  To turn on the fan and AC, you'd connect R and Y (or R, G, and Y on systems where the thermostat controls the fan).  To turn on the fan and heat (as you asked), you'd connect R and W together (or R, G, and W if you have say an electric furnace where the thermostat controls the fan).</p>

<p>If you make a mistake you could potentially fry your furnace controller.</p>

<p>As for finding out what is running - yes there should be 24VAC on the circuit if they are turned on.  However note that this is just instructing the logic board in your furnace to turn on the other components; your furnaces controller might not always obey this. For example, some units will keep the fan running for a few minutes after the A/C or heat is turned off (sometimes this is implemented in the thermostat too).</p>

<p>One other thing I will add based on your comment is about the C line.  This is essentially the neutral back to the transformer (or furnace), so you can use it to power your device (most thermostats use this these days).  You should have 24VAC between R and C.</p>

<p>Never connect R and C, this will either blow the fuse on your board or fry the board all together.</p>

"How do I seal the sink basin opening?","96745","","<p>I purchased a new bathroom sink and faucet and set everything up according to instructions. The faucet instructions told me to use silicone for the drain lip (the border thing around the stopper in the bottom of the inside of the sink, flange?).</p>

<p>Anyways, underneath where the pipe comes out is a rubber gasket and I've used the plastic screw on the drain pipe to seal the gasket against the underside of the sink, but when I put a little bit of water in it, some water leaks out from between the gasket and the sink. I've tried tightening it as much as I can and it still leaks.</p>

<p>Should I be putting silicone or plumbers putty between the gasket and the sink?  If possible, I'd like to avoid taking the drain lip off because I've already sealed it there. What should I do?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qd75O.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>UPDATE: It turns out (haha) that the problem was that the rubber ""washer"" was actually threaded itself. I'm not sure if they are always like this, but I didn't realize that it was threaded when I was assembling everything. So I assume that what was happening originally is that when I didn't have the rubber washer close enough to the basin when I started tightening the nut (blue) that it was moving the the threads out of alignment or something and not making a good seal. Once I turned the washer a few turns upwards, then tightened the blue nut, it made a proper seal. All without using a bunch of putter or silicone.</p>

<p>UPDATE2: So it has been 10 months and it hasn't leaked. Problem solved.</p>
","<p>It should not be necessary to try to goop some type of sealer around the lower neck of the sink drain. Such solution may work but it is not the desirable approach when you consider that someday this assembly will need to come apart for repairs. </p>

<p>In looking at the assembly that you have I wonder if one or more things are at play here.</p>

<p>1) If the drain pipe tail was not centered in the neck of the sink drain and then had lateral force on it due to the down stream goose neck trap it could be forcing the gasket open on one side. Check that there is no undue large amount of sideways pressure on the lower part of this pipe assembly.</p>

<p>2) It looks like the gasket directly contacts with the face of the capture nut around the drain pipe. It is possible that by tightening the capture nut that it is putting a twisting force on the gasket that may cause it to ""fold away"" from the sealing edge of the sink neck.</p>

<p>3) It is possible that there could be a small crack or pitted area on the sink neck that makes keeps the rubber gasket from engaging 100% with the sink neck.</p>

<p>4) Sometimes the ""rubber"" used in this type gasket is made of a plastic material that is anything but rubber. Check at the local hardware store to see if they have another gasket that is more pliable.</p>

","<p>You can try replacing the wax ring.  Usually, that will fix the type of leak you describe.</p>

<li>Disconnect the flexible water pipe from the shutoff valve</li>

<li>Loosen the bolts on either side of the bowl (These may be corroded or completely stuck.  You may have to hacksaw these off)</li>
<li>Gently rock the bowl side to side to release the seal, and then move the toilet off of the drain</li>
<li>Invert the bowl, exposing the seal on the bottom of the toilet.
<br><br></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Install a new wax ring</strong>
<ul>
<li>Remove the old wax material from both the bowl and the flange with a putty knife (you will likely also find a plastic ""funnel"", which can be removed as well)</li>
<li>Take your new wax ring, and install it on the bottom of the bowl (the rounded portion will be facing up towards the bowl.</li>
<li>If you were forced to hacksaw the bolts from the flange, install the replacement bolts to the same position on the flange.
<br><br></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reinstall the toilet</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lift the toilet back up, and thread the bolts through the holes on the side of the bowl (do not let the wax ring touch the ground until you are ready to drop it in its final position).</li>
<li>When the bowl is in its final resting position, sit on the bowl to seat it in place.  Rock back and forth <em>gently</em> to squeeze the wax ring.  The base of the toilet should now be resting on the ground around the entire base.</li>
<li>Reinstall the washer and bolts holding down the toilet.  Be careful when tightening these bolts (do a little at a time, switching between the 2 as you go).  You do not want to break the flange or the bowl.</li>
<li>Trim up the bolts with a hacksaw to adjust the length (if necessary). Reinstall the plastic caps over the bolts.</li>

","<p>Here is a good article that sounds easy and fairly cheap (you can get a 5 gal bucket of compound for about $15).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Method One: <strong>The Roller Sheetrock
  Texturing Method</strong></p>
  
  <p>This is the easiest of the two wall
  and ceiling texturing methods outlined
  in this tutorial. You’ll need:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Paint roller handle with cover and</li>
  <li>extension pole Paint roller pan</li>
  <li>Electric drill </li>
  <li>Ribbon mixer (found in
  drywall taping tool area of the home

  <li>Drop cloths </li>
  <li>5 gallon bucket(s) of sheetrock mud
  (drywall compound)or powder</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Begin by thinning out the mud with
  water. Transfer half the mud to a
  sturdy plastic bucket. Add a cup of
  water to the remaining mud and mix it
  in well using the ribbon mixer with
  your electric drill. You might have to
  add some more water or mud. Ideally,
  it should have a consistency of a milk
  shake.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Apply the Texture</strong></p>
  
  <p>First, spread out the drop cloths in
  the work zone. Pour some thinned mud
  in the roller pan. There are two
  factors that determine how pronounced
  the finished texture will be — the nap
  of the roller used and the speed with
  which you roll the wall.</p>
  
  <p>Play around with this with the first
  area before it dries until you get it
  where you like it.</p>
  
  <p>As you roll the nap will lift the mud
  off the wall in peaks. The slower you
  go, the higher the peaks will be.</p>
  
  <p>Start rolling up and down in one
  corner and work your way around the
  room. For a more erratic pattern, roll
  back over it at random angles. Set
  your internal artist free!</p>

So what should I do? I am thinking of scrubbing some loose grout and refilling. But should I use grout again or should I use caulk this time? If caulk, then what kind of caulk should I use?</p>
","<p>In all the shower installs I overseen, the company I worked for maintained that caulk is to be used in any inside corners except where excessive/standing water is. For example, caulk corners where tub and walls meet, and vertical inside corners where the walls come together. DO NOT caulk where the floor and walls meet, I personally seen caulk creep out of the joint after a week of use in a residence I worked on while I was finishing up the punch list.</p>

<p>Find a reputed mold/mildewcide to clean the joint after you clear all the old grout then allow to dry as long as possible and use a color matched caulk. This is available at Home Depot or at tile supply houses. It is available in sanded or unsanded.</p>

<p>In theory, it may trap moisture, but when the tile is installed and the grout sealed, which should be the case, between the tile being water impervious and the grout has been sealed from moisture infiltration, the amount of water getting past both those points is very minor in my opinion, I read this is so elsewhere.</p>

<p>11-30-2013 addition</p>

<p>To clean the joint of old grout, protect the tub with blue painters tape, maybe a few layers and use a razor knife to begin to V cut the grout out, again be careful the side of the razor knife will be rubbing very hard on the tub/tape and can wear through readily. There is a grout saw available at hardware stores, but they will cut a joint about 1/8"" wide, most tile is set closer. If you use this, use a metal shield of some sort to protect the surface of the tub. A large drywall knife (12"") would work or a section of very thin gauge metal purchased from a hardware store where they sell small pieces of flat metal. Careful with this, it must be kept secure from moving or the metal will deposit gray marks on the acrylic. Tape it to the tub at the ends and let the metal go up to the face of the tile so any scratches is covered by the new caulk.</p>

<p>To caulk, first the joint MUST be clean and dry, cut the tip to the size of the joint, and apply caulk. Look as the caulk is exiting the tip to ensure the caulk is going INTO the joint, this is where the work is done by the caulk, This why it must be clean. Yes there will be caulk EVERYWHERE to a degree. This is why I keep a 5 gal. bucket handy half filled with water and a rounded edge sponge to clean the surface. Paper towels won't last in the cleaning process, and it may gouge out the caulk if a folded corner of the paper towel goes awry.</p>

<p>To clean the excess caulk, with the wetted sponge, squeezed the daylights out of it to get most of the water out of it. It is imperative you are not depositing too much water on the surface of the tile, it will weaken the caulk. You can clean the caulk from the surface completely leaving the caulk only in the joint and with the color matched caulk, it will look like the other joints on the wall. These caulks are specified to tubs and showers.</p>

"When does an under the sink P-Trap assembly need venting?","95482","","<p>In the realm of second homeowner woes, I had a P-Trap assembly under the bathroom sink. It was a straight connection to the pipe connected to the main sewer line. (least I think that was the case). It was <strong>not vented</strong> and it worked just fine. But after dealing with a clog the corroded bottom of the P-Trap (which was made of chrome plated metal) broke and left a 1/2 inch long hole in it.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, I had to replace the entire assembly. As with most projects, more pieces needs replacing. I replaced the sink flange and tail pipe and the P-Trap now made of plastic.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/sirsuki/8150583617"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8468/8150583617_7746e98ba6_n.jpg"" alt=""new p-trap assembly""></a></p>

<p>As you can see in the image above that I used the original back plastic pipe leading down the wall.</p>

<p>When water drains now it backs up and eventually gurgles. Also when it backs up it leaks where the tail pipe and the P-Trap meet. My research tells me this is because this assembly is <em>not properly vented</em>. Is this true?</p>

<p>I ask only because the former assembly did not have venting problems. Is it possible that the former parts were venting through bad seals?</p>

<p>When does an under the sink P-Trap assembly need venting?</p>
","<p>All traps need venting in all cases. Without a vent, the water seal in the trap gets sucked out and sewer gases can enter the room. There's also all sorts of examples where someone thought they were providing venting, but done in such a way that clearing the water seal was still a possibility. Some of these methods even used to be accepted practice, such as S traps. There's still several appropriate ways to achieve proper venting. For example, in island sink situations, a loop or foot vent is acceptable.</p>

<p>It's hard to say why the previous installation worked without venting. For sure, one way or another, the siphon action was disturbed by the entrance of air somehow, either from oversized pipe or leaking fittings. Regardless, where do you go from here? The downward facing ell in wall needs to be replaced with a sanitary tee for starters. The top of the new tee needs to tie into a vent somewhere, without travelling downwards. Is there a vent pipe nearby, such as from a toilet or shower? Or a pipe could perhaps be extended up into the attic, where it should be much easier to make a run to a vent pipe?</p>

<p>If all that sounds like too much, get a mechanical vent such as jberger suggested. They are not accepted by many codes, but they do work. Just be sure it's attached to a long enough pipe so that the valve is above the flood level of the sink. No doubt this all sounds like a real PITA right now. Once it's all done, you can take pride and sleep well knowing you have a properly functioning and completely sanitary sink drainage.</p>

"How much weight can I hang from a drywall ceiling?","94628","","<p>I have a potted plant (approx 5kg/10lbs) that I wish to hang from a drywall ceiling of a window aisle.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have no idea about what specific kind of drywall plate it is or how it was attached; at any rate there is only a fixed place that I can hang the plant from so that it doesn't prevent me from opening window.</p>

","<p>Ideally this should be screwed/anchored into a joist for maximum support. However, if you really want to use a drywall anchor, you should use a toggle bolt or a ceiling anchor.  Instead of just screwing into the wall, these expand to several times their size which gives you a good hold, especially when the force is pulling directly down.  10lbs might be pushing it though, it will depend on the thickness of your drywall and the overall condition.  The worst case is you just have to patch the hole and repaint; drywall is pretty forgiving like that!</p>

"Although my hot water works, why won't my radiator come on?","93305","","<p>As above, the hot water works but the radiators do not come on. It's an old gas powered central heating system. We're thinking it's the wall thermostat at fault but is there anything else it might be?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
I thought I should post a follow up for the sake of future Googlers. </p>

<p>It turned out to be the pump as ChrisF had suggested. The hot water still worked because it's gravity fed from the loft (or attic if you prefer ;)), whereas the pump wasn't kicking in at all. 20 years' worth of use had clogged it up. When the system was emptied the water that came out of it started brown and quickly went black.</p>

<p>With your car you get it serviced every year. Boilers get serviced on a regular basis too but the system itself doesn't, so over the years the muck builds up and builds up and nothing gets done about it causes something to break, i.e. now. </p>
","<p>The most obvious thing that springs to mind is that you have air in your system.</p>

<p>Do the pipes between the radiators get hot, or the bottoms of the radiators but not the top?</p>

<p>If so then you need to bleed your radiators. You should have a little key with a square hole. Carefully open the valve at the top of the radiator a <strong>very small</strong> amount - you should hear a hissing sound of air escaping. Wait until water starts to dribble out - use a cloth to catch this. Repeat for all radiators.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Turn your thermostat all the way up - to make sure that it registers the current temperature as too cold - then the boiler should kick in. If not then it's the thermostat. If the boiler does kick in check the central heating return pipe - this should get hot after a few minutes. If not then there's either an airlock in the pipes themselves or the pump isn't working.</p>

<p>Can you hear the pump turning. If not there's a screw head in the centre of the pump which controls the speed of the pump (see the pictures <a href=""http://www.ultimatehandyman.co.uk/central_heating/changing_central_heating_pump.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>). Turn this clockwise. If the pump still doesn't turn you may need to replace it.</p>

<p>It could also be the electronics in the boiler not sending the signal out to the pump.</p>

"Should tile floors be cleaned with vinegar only? Is the advice against using other solutions a myth?","92920","","<p>After we had ceramic tile installed at our house, the company said we should just clean with vinegar and water mixture. However, I haven't been able to find anywhere online that says that using Pine-Sol or other cleaning solutions (like Swiffer sprayer thing) damages the tile. </p>

<p>In fact, <a href=""http://www.empireflooringtips.com/Empire-Floor-Cleaning/Empire-Ceramic-Floor"" rel=""nofollow"">this is what the company says</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Recommended “To Do’s”</strong></p>
  
  <p>• Clean your new Flooring with a damp mop once a week or more,
  depending on the amount of traffic. Heavy traffic areas should be
  mopped more often than once a week.</p>
  
  <p>• Use an all-purpose, non-oil based household or commercial cleaner.
  Ensure that the cleaner is compatible with the grout cleaner
  recommendations in the maintenance and protection section. You can
  also use a cleaning solution of one cup of white vinegar to two
  gallons of tap water.</p>
  
  <p>• Cleaning spills off of Porcelain &amp; Ceramic Flooring is generally
  easier than other types of flooring. The entire area should be cleaned
  and scrubbed with a cleansing solution using a cotton mop, cloth,
  sponge or non-metallic brush. The entire area should then be rinsed
  with clean water to remove any residue left on the Flooring from the
  cleaning solution.</p>
  
  <p>• Sweep or vacuum your tile Empire Flooring prior to mopping to remove
  any dust or debris.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Recommended “Not To Do”</strong></p>
  
  <p>•    Use a detergent or soap because it may dull the surface and
  potentially promote the growth of mildew.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Other Care Instructions</strong></p>
  
  <p>• Routine cleaners used on your Porcelain &amp; Ceramic Flooring should
  never contain acids or ammonia because they can discolor the grout
  and/or damage the grout and the glazed surface of the Flooring.</p>
  
  <p>• You should allow your new Ceramic Flooring and grout to set and dry
  for at least 72 hours after installation before damp mopping it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, the cleaning agents claim they're safe on wood and tile (we
have both), but at the same time I don't want to damage the new tile.
Anyone with tile experience actually know if the claim that using anything but vinegar and water is bogus?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Fixed question and title to better reflect original intent of the question.</p>
","<p>In the to-do section of the care instructions you posted, it suggests ""Use an all-purpose, non-oil based household or commercial cleaner.""  OR, it says, you can use vinegar/water.  </p>

<p>I think you are over-analyzing.  The normal floor mopping solutions like Pine-Sol or a Swiffer will work fine.  Just don't use anything abrasive that will scratch the tile or an aggressive bathroom ""tile/grout cleaner"" that is meant to bleach and renew grout that is stained.  </p>

<p>If you're concerned about a particular cleaner, you could always test a small section that is out of sight.  You can also apply a ""grout sealer"" solution over the grout lines.  This is tedious, but can help slow down staining of the grout.  </p>

","<p>Double sided tape has a drawback. Well, it has two drawbacks.</p>

<ul>
<li>It falls off when you least want it to do so.</li>
<li>It sticks like crazy when you want to remove it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having said that, you probably tore off more than just a layer of paint. I'll bet you actually tore off the surface layer of paper on the drywall.</p>

<p>Can you repair this by just painting over the spot? Well, it depends. Will anyone ever look at it? Sorry, but it will be painfully obvious what you did. So this depends on how critical the observer is. If I was your landlord and I saw a poorly done patch when you were moving out, I'd mutter a few obscenities under my breath, then quietly mention to you about how you just forfeited your security deposit.</p>

<p>The problem is that paint won't match that well. The color difference will be obvious. Plus, due to the hole in the surface, there will be small shadows that will be quite obvious, so you will need to fill in the surface so it is smooth, BEFORE painting. Anyway, if you tried to paint in just that small area with a brush, one would easily see the texture differences from painting with a brush compared to what was an original roller applied paint surface. </p>

<p>All of this means you really will need to spackle over the hole, feathering it out over the surface of the wall at least a few inches in each direction, and then sand smooth. Once you have done this far enough out, repainting the entire wall will make sense anyway.</p>

<p>Lessons to be learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Either don't use double sided tape,</li>
<li>or, be much more careful removing it if you do. This usually means to use a solvent that will break down the adhesive, but not the surface of your wall. They sell stuff to do this, usually called something like Goo-Gone. Another solvent that often works is rubbing alcohol. It evaporates quickly, and does not attack paint, although it will harm some surfaces like shellac. Always test any solvent on a small, inconspicuous spot before using it. And watch out for fumes, so use good ventilation.</li>

"Must I remove all mortar between tiles before grouting?","90723","","<p>I'm just getting ready to lay down the grout after successfully tiling our master bathroom. I've been told in no uncertain terms that I must remove the spacers between tiles (or else grouting over them can result in cracking of the grout). That makes sense -- however, I'm also reading on the box that I should ""clean the grout joints"". They show a tool that appears to be scraping excess mortar from the joints.</p>

<p>Do I need to be worried about scraping down the hardened mortar so that the joints can be completely filled with grout or are they talking about simply removing any loose mortar? Although none of my joints have mortar that rises above the grout, many of the tiles have some sections where the mortar is higher than others. I'm reading elsewhere that it's ideal to get rid of all excess mortar between tiles before it hardens (whoops).</p>

<p>How important is this?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>As of September, 2011, it's been 9 months since I completed this job and things have been solid. I scraped only the areas that were high (close to or slightly above the tile). From this purely anecdotal evidence, it seems logical to conclude that it isn't necessary to be too much of a purist about clearing out all mortar between tiles before laying down your grout.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>As of April, 2012 I've found only one tile that may have a slight issue. On one of the center tiles that gets a lot of traffic, I must not have put down a perfectly smooth layer underneath because I can hear an occasional slight shift. The joints along the edge still look great though.</p>
","<p>I wouldn't be too concerned unless there's mortar that is raised above the level of the grout - which you've already said there isn't.</p>

<p>Scraping the higher sections to give a reasonable depth of grout would be as far as I'd go.</p>

<p>A lot of adhesives these days are sold as tile cement and grout, though they do tend to be coarser than ""pure"" grout, so they are basically the same material. However, a pure grout does give a smoother, ""cleaner"" line.</p>

<p>Floor tile grout also tends to be coarser - I suspect to be able to cope with the higher degree of wear and tear it will receive compared to wall tile grout.</p>

"Can I accelerate caulk drying by using a fan or heater on it?","90175","","<p>From what I've found online, caulking takes 24-48 hours to dry. For my purposes, I need to apply caulking to my kitchen sink.</p>

<p>However, I am in a time crunch, so I would like to know how caulking dries. Specifically, can the dry time be sped up to less than 24 hours if I direct some fans at the caulking? Can apply a heat fan help too?</p>
","<p>The tube of caulk should include drying and curing times.  It will vary based on the product so you definitely want to go by the manufacturer's recommendation and not some general guideline on the web somewhere.</p>

<p>You are not the only person who does not want to have to wait a day or two before using their sink and bathtub and the caulk manufacturers know this. It should be easy to find caulks that dry much faster than this.  Bathroom caulks are frequently advertising their ""shower ready"" time which is how long before it can get wet.  It may take a day or two to fully cure but many caulks will be able to get wet after a few hours.</p>

<p>Like many ""fast drying"" products the downside is that you have less time to work with the product before it starts setting up.  The last time I caulked my bathtub I used a very fast drying product that claimed it was ""shower ready in 1 hour"".  I am not a perfect caulker so I kept adding more and smoothing it out; unfortunately it started ""clumping up"" after maybe 20 minutes so I ended up with lumps.  If I had used a product that took longer to dry I would have had more time to smooth it without it starting to dry and get a skin over the top.</p>

"Can I upgrade existing T12 fluorescent fixtures to T8 just by replacing the ballast and bulbs?","90061","","<p>I was going to replace the fluorescent T12 fixtures around my house with T8 fixtures, but I noticed that the T8 bulbs seem to fit just fine into the T12 fixtures.  It seems like I could save myself a few bucks and maybe some hassle if I just replace the ballasts instead of replacing the entire fixtures.  Plus, I could make sure to buy higher-efficiency or higher-quality ballasts instead of just using whatever mystery ballasts come with the fluorescent fixtures at the home improvement store.  Is there anything wrong with this plan?</p>
","<p>Replace ballast and lamps, and for extra savings, on a four tube per bay fixture, get a 3-lamp ballast and run only three tubes.</p>

<p>The extra efficiency of the smaller tube plus high-frequency electronic ballast means that three T-8 tubes can put out nearly the same light as four T-12 tubes.</p>

<p>The ballast tends to be a lot smaller, and weigh much less than the t-12 ballasts.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iej3U.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Wiring varies -- your ballast will have a wiring diagram</strong>.  But to give you an idea, here is an example of wiring for an <em>instant-start</em> electronic ballast (which are easier to wire, but tend to fail bulbs faster); and a <em>rapid-start</em> or <em>programmed-start</em> electronic ballast (which often matches the old magnetic ballasts): </p>

<p>For the smaller 18AWG solid-core wires in ballasts, don't use the common yellow/red wire nuts.  Use <em>blue</em> wire-nuts, or for instance, push-in wiring connectors such as Gardner Bender PushGard, others are available... make sure the size is correct for 18 AWG wire. </p>

<p>You can reduce number of bulbs, since T8s are brighter.  A complete building rewire from four T12 to three T8 tubes per fixture eliminated 38 tubes and at 32W each, was a savings of 1216 Watts in power reduction if you only count tube elimination and not also ballast efficiency over mangetic (est. 10-15w per ballast replaced). PLUS, NO FLICKER! For someone with fast vision, not seeing 60Hz flicker in the peripheral vision was almost worth more than the power savings.</p>

Since we don't want 7' pull-cords, the speed is stuck at full-tilt, which is no good. The fan has separate switches on the wall for lights and fan on/off, though, so I tried putting a dimmer switch on the fan. Can that do any damage to the fan's motor, or is there anything else I'm not thinking of that could be a problem? I've noticed the fan makes a little bit of a groaning noise when I have the rheostat down, but since I've never heard the fan at slow speeds, maybe that's normal.</p>
","<h1>Check the fine print</h1>

<p>To find out if the dimmer can work with the fan, you'll have to inspect the dimmer.  For this, you'll have to remove the cover plate and possibly pull the switch out of the box (in which case, make sure you shut off the power at the breaker). If you see the text ""For Incandescent Only""; or something similar, you should not use this dimmer with a motor load.</p>

<p>The other thing is that it smells even after I leave the room for months on end (for college). So it's not me. </p>

<p>They've tried to aggressively identify the source, but to no avail. </p>
","<p>Smells don't just appear out of nowhere.  Something in your room is the source of the smell (dirty laundry, rotten food, etc).  Find the source and remove it.  If you can't identify it (too used to it?), then ask your parents to look for it.</p>

<p>If the smell seems to be everywhere in the room, consider deep-cleaning the carpets.  (Buy/Rent a cleaner, or have a cleaning service come in.)</p>

<p>If you can't remove the source, all you can do is mitigate.</p>

<p>Also, consider that the source of the smell may be <strong><em>you</em></strong>.  Your parents may be trying to politely tell you something.  Do you bathe every day?  Do you wash your hair regularly (at least once every 2-3 days)?  Do you put on a fresh change of clothes every day?  Do you wear antiperspirant/deodorant?

In several places, the floor transitions to an existing tile floor.  The hardwood floor guys told me the best transition between the two is a T molding.  You simply leave a gap between the two floors, and then place down the T molding between the two floors, so it sits on both surfaces.  Sounds simple enough.</p>

<p>However, the height difference of the two floors is considerable, and the T molding does not sit flush.  What are my options?  Here is a diagram showing the dimensions.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nzHZH.jpg"" alt=""floor transition diagram""></p>

<p>NOTE:  Using the T molding is not a requirement, I could go some other route if there is a better option.</p>
","<p>I ended up taking advise from @chris's answer and making my own transition from actual flooring.  I cut away part of the flooring to make the transition piece sit flush on the floor and then on top of the tile.  I then routed a rounded edge so the piece on top of the tile flowed down more gradually.  </p>

<p>I was a little worried about the routed part and how it would look compared to the top (finished) of the flooring.  But with a little flooring varnish, and then a rub with some scotch brite to dull the finish, it was a perfect match.  This worked because the wood was not stained, and natural in color.  If it has been stained, it would have been a little harder to match.  </p>

<p>We are very happy how it turned out.  It's a smooth transition, more so than an actual transition piece like a T or reducer since it does not rise up higher than the hardwood floor or the tile.</p>

<p>The only real solution is to use something else - a straight edge held to the wall is always a good choice. However, that might not work well if the wall is uneven.</p>

<p>You could draw a line where you want to paint to and then hold a short piece of card up to this line as you paint in small sections.</p>

<p>Is this expected?  If not, what can I do about it?</p>
","<p>I had exactly the same issue with my dishwasher.  Standing water at the bottom after the wash cycle almost every time, yet the dishwasher appeared to be draining correctly.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the first thing to verify is that the dishwasher is indeed draining properly.  Start a cycle to partially fill the washer, then manually engage the drain cycle.  Does the water drain quickly and completely?   If you're so inclined, you can (carefully) leave the door open while the dishwasher is draining and hold down the door lock mechanism with a small screw driver so that you can watch the process.  Another option is to disconnect the drain from your disposal and place the end into a bucket to observe how the water is draining.  It's also a good opportunity to clean out any sludge that may have formed in drain hose.</p>

<p>If the draining appears to be functioning normally (as it was in my case) the next step is to verify the filter, food chopper blade and mesh grate that is in front of the sump pump/pump inlet housing is not clogged - this is slightly more involved, but still fairly easy to do.  Here's a video to give you the general idea of the process:  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRDbTgBOtIE"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRDbTgBOtIE</a>.  This is not for your model specifically, but it should be fairly close.  </p>

<p>In my case, the mesh grate was almost 100% clogged with debris and hard water deposits, and the food chopper blade had a piece of string wrapped around it that kept it from spinning freely (no idea how that got there).  After soaking the grate in a vinegar solution, cleaning the it with a toothpick and unwrapping the string from the blade, I haven't had any more issues with water remaining in the dishwasher.  </p>

","<p>Like Mike Powell says, I think it's against code to stable wire to the bottom of joists. Regardless of that, there are many reasons not to do that:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you ever want to put up drywall, the wires are in the way</li>
<li>It's ugly</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're running parallel to joists, staple the wire to the inside of the joist every couple feet. The wire should be at least an inch away from the bottom edge (basically, if you ever cover it with drywall or some other ceiling, you don't want people putting nails etc into the cable).</p>

<p>If you're perpendicular to the joists, drill holes (I generally use a 1/2"" spade bit for 14AWG NM), and then run the cable through those. </p>

<p>You should also have a staple within 12"" of any bend or entrance to a box. </p>

"How do I compensate for the sun confusing my garage door opener's sensors?","85507","","<p>Only during summer and only when the sun is close to the horizon the light from the sun confuses my garage door opener and in order to close the door I have to hold down the wired button which is a real pain if I'm leaving.</p>

<p>A friend suggested I use toilet paper rolls (or maybe some PVC) to shield the sensor from the sun and direct the beam to the other sensor and that's a good idea but it'll mean I have to change how the sensors are mounted to the track and move them out a bit.  Just moving them back might solve the problem (since they'll be blocked by the walls).</p>

<p>Any other suggestions? Is this a common problem?</p>
","<p>You probably only have to shield the sensor just enough to put a shadow over it (and not let the sun hit it directly).  I would think a small piece of cardboard taped to the side or top (or both) of the sensor that is getting hit with the sun should do it.  </p>

<p>Another way would be to block the sun from outside of the garage by maybe planting a shrub (test it out by putting your garbage can in line to block the sun when it is low in the sky and see if it works).</p>

"What is the process for power washing and staining a deck?","85283","","<p>I am planning to power wash my deck and stain it afterwards. But I am not quite sure the correct procedure for this process.</p>

<p>After power washing the deck, can I stain the deck immediately or should I wait some time?</p>

<p>Should I stain the deck first or apply the sealant first? Should there be any time gap between these two procedures? </p>

<p>Moreover, which kind of protective clothing should I wear when applying the stain and sealant? </p>
","<p>The first step is to clean the deck.  A very simple and inexpensive method is to wet the deck, spray or scrub on a mixture of 1 cup TSP, 1/2 gal household bleach, and 2 gal water. Scrub it with a course, stiff broom. Then either rinse with a hose or power wash off before it dries completely on the surface. this works as good it not better than expensive deck cleaners. Note: When using a power washer, use a wide spray nozzle. Be careful not to be too aggressive with a power washer as it can damage the wood and leave divots.</p>

<p>Second, let the deck dry completely. This may take a day or two depending on weather conditions.</p>

<p>Third, apply deck stain.  You can use any good oil or modified oil based deck stain. You can choose from transparent, semi transparent or solid.  The most popular for older pressure treated decks is semi or solid.  For cedar or redwoods, transparent or semi is favored. Usually one coat is enough, but on very porous or softer woods, two coats may be required for a good even finish.</p>

<p>Application hint: apply stain with a 3/8"" nap roller on a pole. Do three or four boards wide, then over-brush the area with a fairly stiff bristle brush to work the stain into the grain of the wood. You could also use a 1 or 2 gal pump sprayer to get the stain on fast, then over-brush.  A lot faster and easier than using a brush only.</p>

<p>You're done. There is no need to put a sealer over good grade stains. Never put a sealer on before you stain, as it will block the stain from penetrating and adhering to the wood. </p>

<p>Wait 24 hours before using your deck after staining.  Don't stain if there is rain or temps under 50F predicted within 12 to 24 hours. </p>

"What can I do about a room over the garage with temperature problems?","84920","","<p>I'm learning many things about our new home. This winter I learned that a room directly above a garage stays much colder than the rest of the house (up to 10+ degrees colder in our case). What options exist to eliminate or reduce this problem? Is there some way I can easily increase the insulation without having to tear floors up, or open up ceilings - or is that the best option available to me?</p>
","<p>Jonathan, your problem is very common. Do you know what is in the floor for insulation now? Assuming there is some f/G batts or something similar, it would be hard to try to add anything else, such as high density cellulose  directly into the cavities. As much as you probably don't want to hear it, the best way is going to remove the sheetrock from the garage ceiling and remove the existing insulation. With the framing completely open, be sure to seal all holes through joists and floor areas where wires or other components may pass thru with foam. The absolute best insulation would be to have a high density foam sprayed into each bay and into any voids along garage door headers etc. This would give you the maximum R value and absolutely stop any cold air infiltration to the bedroom above. The goal would be to achieve an R value of 30 or more. The alternate method for DIY would be to again, seal any air passage ways and door headers with spray foam, then carefully install the max amount of f/g blanket and cover entire field with 4 mil poly and tape all seams and edges with tuck tape before reinstalling your fire rated sheetrock. This is not the best solution as the r value of the f/g is going to be limited by the size of the joists. 2X8 for example will limit you to about an R 23.  A slightly higher R value could be achieved with blown in high density cellulose after sheetrock is installed, in place of the blanket f/g insulation.  The spray foam is definitely the best overall, but the most expensive as well.   </p>

<p>In response to Sharp Tooth's answer, too long for comment section: I have seen 2 to 4 inches of rigid foam insulation added to garage ceilings in this situation. The only drawback of this method is the problems it causes with garage door openers and suspension hardware. It also can cause issues with overhead lighting and overall head space. I hate to be a nay sayer, but I have to negatively comment on your other suggestions. Insulating a garage that does not have new style insulated, airtight doors is a total waste of money. Likewise, trying to heat a garage that is not build to be energy efficient can be extremely expensive to install and fuel, especially if a separate zone or plumbing needs to be added. This is not a viable solution as every time the garage door opens, out goes all that expensive heat. Carpeting, even over a thick foam pad will not help much either, maybe a gain of 2 to 4 ""R"", quite negligible. I hope you were not serious about heat tape under the ceiling. Other than electric or forced hot water radiant heat grids that would be installed under the floor, not under the ceiling, there is no safe product to do what you decribed. It would not work anyway, since the source of heat would be on the wrong side of the insulation and the vast majority of the heat would be wasted into the garage air. Sorry to shoot down your suggestions, but I truly believe questions should have informed, proven solutions, not wishful guesses.</p>

"Freezer is cold but not freezing at all","84896","","<p>After throwing a thermometer in my freezer, it is around 15-20 degrees Fahrenheit. Things that have been in there and frozen are staying frozen, but anything new that needs to freeze is not.</p>

<p>For example, 24 hours ago I put some of those ""colored ice pops"" in there and maybe 3 or 4 froze, the rest are just cold.</p>

The fridge is still warm, even though it is dialed to the max. The freezer is running heavy and is around 15 degrees.</p>
","<p>Freezers aren't really designed to freeze things, they're designed to keep things frozen.  To change one pound of 32&deg;F ice to 31&deg;F ice, requires the removal of .5 BTUs. To change one pound of 32&deg;F water, to 32&deg;F ice, requires 144 BTUs. Therefore, it requires far less energy to keep an item frozen, than it does to freeze the item in the first place.</p>

<p>If the back panel of the freezer is popping off, you might want to investigate what is causing it to pop off. If there is ice forming that is causing the panel to pop off, it could mean that the refrigerant in the system is low, and there may be a leak. This is probably a unlikely scenario, though it is possible. </p>

<p>The more likely cause, is poor air flow.</p>

<p>If there's not good air flow through the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condenser"" rel=""nofollow"">condenser</a>, the heat removed from the refrigerated compartments will not be removed from the refrigerant.  At the same time, if the air flow through the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporator"" rel=""nofollow"">evaporator</a> is poor, heat will not be removed from the refrigerated compartments effectively. Maintaining good air flow within the refrigerated compartments is also important. The cooled air needs to move throughout the compartment, so heat can be taken away.</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure the condenser fan is working, and there's not a lot of dust and debris obstructing the flow of air across the condenser.</li>
<li>Make sure there's good air flow across the evaporator, and that the evaporator is not icing over (this may require disassembly of part of the refrigerator).</li>

<p>Everything appears to work (and has done so for 2+ years), but I'm curious if this is kosher from a code point of view.  Should there be an individual neutral for each circuit?  If so, is there a brief explanation as to why this is OK?</p>
","<p>A multi-wire branch circuit (two hots from different phases sharing 1 neutral) is often found in the kitchen where it powers one receptacle which has the jumper connecting the upper and lower outets removed. The result is that  you get two 15amps circuits at one receptacle.  At the panel, both breakers should be bonded together so it is not possible to have one on and one off.</p>

<p>Code varies by region, but I do not think it is typically permitted in any other configuration.</p>

<p>My question is whether Federal Pacific products, as a whole, should be proactively replaced.  Does having a Federal Pacific panel mean that I certainly have FP breakers as well?</p>
","<p>Concurring mostly with Some Guy's answer here -- the reason why I take an aggressive tone in my other answers regarding FPE is because many of the OPs are coming to us because they want to do something to the breaker box, such as adding a new circuit or replacing a breaker that ""died"".</p>

<h3>Trouble Brews in the Panel</h3>

<p>I will start by linking my main source here, the <a href=""http://inspectapedia.com/fpe/FPE_Hazards_121220.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">latest revision of J. Aronstein's paper on the topic</a>.  In short, there are three main problems with the FPE Stab-Lok system:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stab-Lok breakers made prior to 1982, and possibly some substitute types, are often miscalibrated (high).</li>
<li>The FPE Stab-Lok common trip mechanism is a common <em>no-trip</em> mechanism that can jam the breaker closed if only one pole trips -- this also renders Stab-Lok GFCIs highly failure-prone.</li>
<li>Some Stab-Lok busbars use an undersized screw and post to connect the clip to the actual busbar, leading to overheating of the busbar system with its attendant fire dangers.  Stab-Lok breakers have also been said to be prone to coming loose from their busbar mounting due to their dependency on the front panel for retention.</li>
</ol>

<p>and three follow-on problems that stem from the system's obsolescence:</p>

<ol>
<li>Arc fault breakers were never developed for FPE panels, rendering it <em>impossible</em> for even a FPE panel with likely-good (post-1982) breakers and a reliable busbar design to meet the current NEC.</li>
<li>Stab-Lok breakers cannot be safely replaced AFAICT.  More on this in a bit when I talk about the history of this sordid affair.</li>
<li>Many Stab-Lok panels are ""rule of six"" or split bus, rendering a jammed two-pole branch breaker much more dangerous than it would be in a main breaker panel.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Digging into the Past</h3>

<p>Federal Pacific Electric started off making electrical switchgear; around 1949, though, a few not-so-bright sparks there came up with a circuit breaker design in order to jump on the household circuit breaker craze of the time.  FPE then proceeded to trademark the name Stab-Lok for their circuit breaker, due to its unique design which used a ""stab"" terminal on the breaker that mated with a slot in the busbar; other panel designs use a tab on the busbar that mates with a spring-clip-type contact in the breaker.  The FPE R&amp;D effort continued through the 1950s and into the early 1960s, when the Stab-Lok design went into full production.</p>

<p>However, for all its infelicities, the Stab-Lok would have not earned its infamy had it not been for the work of some even dimmer bulbs in the testing department in building an elaborate testing apparatus for the sole purpose of fooling UL into allowing them to accept breakers that were actually outside of the UL standard criteria.  This hoodwink continued for many years, until FPE itself went bankrupt and went through multiple changes of ownership, first by a holding company known as UV Industries, and then being acquired by Reliance Electric.  Reliance began to sniff around, and what they found shocked them -- causing them to suspend FPE executives without pay, and UL to start delisting the FPE Stab-Lok line.  By 1982, the Stab-Lok line was well and truly out of production in the US, and Reliance was well on their way to suing FPE/UV for their deception.</p>

<p>At about the same time, the CPSC began to investigate this issue in earnest; however, in about 1983, Reagan-induced budgetary shortages and the negative precedents from the aluminum wiring case conspired to force the CPSC to abandon their investigation before they could come to a conclusion; all that came of it was a generic press release that neither exonerated nor found any definitive fault with the FPE breaker line.  As a result of this, no recall was actually ever issued for the FPE breaker line, and there may <em>never</em> be a recall of the product, lest the aluminum wiring court debacle repeat itself.</p>

<p>After this, FPE basically was broken up -- their US switchgear plant went one way (to Westinghouse to be converted for aftermarket breaker manufacture, then possibly to Cutler-Hammer and then closed down by C-H only to be reopened by its manager as an independent company), their US breaker line formally went another way (to Challenger Electric who proceeded to sell it off to a company that eventually became American Circuit Breaker Corporation), and their Canadian breaker line went a third direction (being absorbed into Schneider Canada).  This led to some infighting between the US and Canadian sides -- as part of this, in the early 90s, the two products were acknowledged as identical and interchangeable in the course of the ensuing court case, which was settled in 2005.  Schneider Canada, of course, is not forthcoming about any of this; however, there have been sporadic recalls of Stab-Lok-type breakers that appear to be of somewhat later designs than FPE's original type NA.</p>

<p>A class-action suit was filed against the remains of FPE in 2002 in New Jersey; however, the ensuing judgement and 2008 settlement, while finding that FPE did violate state consumer fraud statutes, provided very little right of recovery for New Jersey homeowners, and no help whatsoever outside of NJ.  Finally, in 2011, the CPSC issued a clarifying note to their original 1983 press release that more explicitly stated that the CPSC had to close their investigation before they could publish findings.</p>

<h3>A Sorry State of Affairs</h3>

<p>All of the preceding history aside, here is my guide to ""I see a FPE panel, but it's otherwise apparently OK, I'm not trying to add anything to it, and this house isn't changing hands any time soon"", in it, ""as soon as feasible"" means ""as soon as you have the money to hire an electrician to come out"", not ""when I'll get around to it"" or ""oh, that'll happen when we remodel"":</p>

<ol>
<li>Are there any signs of busbar damage such as hot breakers or buzzing sounds?  If yes, then the panel is defective (trying to catch on fire) and should be replaced as soon as feasible -- continue to the next section.  If it is not, then continue to step 2.</li>
<li>Is this panel a main breaker panel, a ""rule of six"" main panel, or a subpanel?  If it is a <em>main breaker</em> panel, then go to step 3; a ""rule of six"" or ""split bus"" main panel, then go to step 5; and if it is a subpanel, then go to step 6.</li>
<li>Are there screw ends (not screw heads!) visible along the centerline of the panel (i.e. between the breakers) with the dead front removed?  (Follow all applicable safety precautions when removing the dead front.)  If so, this panel has the undersized screw-and-post busbar-to-clip connections and is likely to pose a fire hazard in the future, so it should be replaced as soon as feasible -- continue to the next section.  If not, continue to step 4.</li>
<li>The reliability of Stab-Lok <em>main circuit breakers</em> is currently unknown; there is insufficient evidence available to either implicate them as having the same dangerous design flaws and mismanufacturing as their smaller two-pole brethren or to exonerate their name from this sordid story.  However, the main circuit breaker construction provides a minimal degree of redundancy should a branch breaker jam or otherwise fail to trip.  Panel replacement in this case need not be your first priority, but would be wise -- schedule it alongside any other electrical overhaul work that needs to take place (such as aluminum wiring pigtailing, replacement of defective branch circuits, or any panel alterations that need to take place).  Continue to the next section for panel replacement options.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, the ""rule-of-six"" design, while otherwise Code-compliant, conspires with the common-trip Stab-Lok jam defect to create an extremely hazardous situation; a jammed two-pole breaker in a rule-of-six main panel is equivalent to wiring a 240VAC appliance directly to the service-entrance cable!  Replacing the ""split-bus"" or ""rule-of-six"" panel should be done as soon as feasible.</li>
<li>In the case of FPE subpanels, the main breaker panel should be examined -- if it is FPE as well, then go back to step 1 and examine the main panel.  If the main panel is not a FPE Stab-Lok type -- the feeder breaker in the main panel will provide limited protection against gross faults and jammed breakers until the subpanel can be replaced -- so you can replace it along with other electrical work.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Panel Replacement Options</h3>

<p>There are two options available for the replacement of FPE Stab-Lok electrical panels; either the panel is replaced in its entirety with a modern panel, or gutted and retrofitted using an <a href=""http://inspectapedia.com/fpe/CHRetrofitGuide.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Eaton retrofit kit</a> to convert it to a type BR or type CH panel.</p>

<p>Of the two, the retrofit kit is more costly parts-wise ($500 for a retrofit interior vs $200 for a new panel); however, if your panel is large enough to accommodate it (due to wire-bending space issues in older panels caused by the 1982 changes to the NEC), the retrofit kit can be installed in the existing enclosure, which is a significant labor savings over having to remove the enclosure entirely and install a complete new panel.  Another factor that complicates this is while BR retrofit interiors can take tandem/quadruplex type BR breakers, tandem GFCI, AFCI, and DFCI breakers don't exist due to the space required for the electronics -- this significantly restricts the utility of the retrofit kit when the wiring is not grounded, or a significant number of GFCIs, AFCIs, and/or DFCIs need to be installed to meet current Code circuit protection requirements.</p>

<h3>Why Not Replace the Breakers?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, both NOS (new old stock) and newly-manufactured type NA breakers are available on the market these days.  Some may be tempted to go ""hey, I'll just replace the crummy old breakers with new ones, and it'll be fine now!""  However, there are three problems with this approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are no Stab-Lok AFCI breakers that I know of; even if one was made, it'd suffer from the same fatal flaw as the Stab-Lok GFCI, namely common-trip jamming (the Stab-Lok GFCI is really a half-width two-pole Stab-Lok with some electronics hung off it).</li>
<li>There is no reliable evidence that NOS or newly made Stab-Lok breakers are better than the crummy old ones, with the marginal exception of post-1982, ""pink label"", Federal Pacific Electric breakers, which may have received proper testing to their UL listing.</li>
<li>Circuit breaker replacement does not address the busbar defects, which are just as dangerous as the breaker defects, <em>if not more so</em> -- there have been field failures where FPE panels overheated and ignited internally due to busbar contacts coming loose.</li>
</ol>

<h3>I want to add another circuit!  My electrician was doing something else and said it needed to be replaced!  My lights are behaving weird and the electrician is blaming the panel!</h3>

<p>In all of these three cases, or in any other case where an electrical panel alteration, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>adding breakers/branch circuits</li>
<li>removing breakers</li>
<li>replacing a breaker that is ""dead""</li>
<li>replacing a breaker with one of a different amperage rating</li>
<li>upgrading the service</li>
<li>rewiring existing branch circuits with new ""home runs""</li>
<li>or, any troubleshooting that casts fault at the breakers or panel</li>
</ul>

<p>is called for, this is a sign that the Stab-Lok panel needs to be replaced; see above for replacement advice.</p>

<h3>I'm buying/selling a house, and the inspector found a FPE panel!</h3>

<p>First off, good on the home inspector -- not all of them keep up on such esoterica as faulty electrical service equipment!  The advice from here depends on if you're the buyer or the seller.</p>

<p><strong>I'm buying a house with a FPE panel in it, what should I do?</strong></p>

<p>In this case, making replacement of the panel a condition of sale is wise -- now would be a good time for a general electrical overhaul, as well, and the best part is that it may be possible to do a bit of creative financing on the seller's side to use the proceeds from the sale to finance the electrical work at the end of the day.</p>

<p>If that's not possible, the panel should be examined by an electrician for any sign of overheating or internal arcing that poses a fire hazard, at a barest minimum.</p>

<p><strong>My house has a FPE panel in it, and I want to sell it</strong></p>

<p>Just replace the electrical panel, alright?  Electricity is different from many other household systems (such as HVAC, plumbing, or even structural) in that the system can appear to function normally (unlike a leaky pipe or a clearly bowed beam) while posing grave dangers to the house's occupants -- a shorted dryer drawing 1000A of current until the utility's fuses blow <em>will</em> catch on fire, despite everything appearing to be normal up until the moment the dryer shorted out.</p>

<p>My wife is considering refurbishing the look of the light instead of replacing it... is it okay to use the light even though it's not grounded?</p>
","<p>We live with legacy ungrounded fixtures all the time, usually without incident.  As I understand it, grounding is a backup system to give the high potential an easy path to ground (that is, a better path than YOU) if there is a short in the fixture. </p>

<p>Basically, grounding is a connection between the metal body of a fixture to a continuous ground (wire or metal shielding) that returns to the service panel and an earth ground. You could create a ground on a fixture by installing a screw in the metal body of the unit that could then take the ground wire. However, there could be more than one metal component in the fixture needing a ground, so it is by no means a sure fix.</p>

<p>The main issue is the likelihood of a user touching something metal on the fixture that could be accidentally live.  If the fixture is out of reach, the lack of a ground is probably a low risk. If it is a pull chain light, use of a string pull rather than metal is a good idea.</p>

"What can I do about a toilet flange that is 1/4"" below the finished floor?","83463","","<p>I used two wax seals to set my toilet since the flange is 1/4"" below the new tile. At first it seemed to be water tight but after a few flushes I noticed water seeping and pulled it out. As can be seen in the photo, the wax ring slid off center. I couldn't use just one ring since it protrudes about 1/4"" below the toilet so that would just barely touch the flange. I found the flange extender in another post and will try that. One of <a href=""http://www.lowes.com/ProductDisplay?partNumber=253224-138-436443&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10151&amp;productId=3798891&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;cmRelshp=req&amp;rel=nofollow&amp;cId=PDIO1"" rel=""noreferrer"">these</a> </p>

<p>So to my question. Is this the correct approach? Should the flange be level with the floor prior to installation?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: The correct height of the flange is sitting on top of the finished floor. Of course with a remodel this is almost never going to be the case after tiling. There seem to be various methods to raise the flange. Many say the double wax ring is problematic since it can collapse into the drain over time. This <a href=""http://allthumbsdiy.com/plumbing/toilet-flange-too-low-double-wax-ring-or-extender-spacer-kit"" rel=""noreferrer"">link</a> discusses a number of products to solve the problem. In summary, the set-rite (~18 + shipping) is the most expensive and apparently the only code approved product. The cheapest option is flange extenders ~$3-5. The funny thing is neither the tiler or the plumber that worked on my bathroom mentioned anything about the height problem, which leads me to believe the common solution is the double wax ring. </p>

","<p>The flange should sit on top of the finished floor, if it doesn't you'll have to modify the plumbing or find another way to achieve this.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dGwcz.png"" alt=""Proper toilet flange""></p>

<p>Notice in this image how the toilet waste pipe sits just inside the flange opening, this is the proper way for a toilet to sit on a flange. Even without a wax ring, this union is not likely to leak under normal circumstances (<em>I'm <strong>not</strong> recommending a wax ring not be used</em>).</p>

<h1>Wax as a waste pipe?</h1>

<p>Some folks recommend using a thicker wax ring, or even doubling up wax rings.  The problem with this, is that you end up with a waste pipe made from wax. Now this <em>might</em> hold up, but more than likely it's eventually going to fail, and leak.</p>

<h1>Modify the plumbing</h1>

<p>If you have access to the flange from below, you might be able to modify the plumbing to make the flange sit atop the floor. In most cases, however, this is not an option.</p>

<h1>Adapters</h1>

<p>There are adapters available, that solve this exact problem.

"What is the best way to repair a cracked bathtub?","83092","","<p>Close examination of the floor of my bathtub has revealed a long, thin crack in the bathtub itself.  The bathtub is one of the common plastic-feeling variety (though I am not sure if it is actually a plastic.)  What is the best way to patch this crack?</p>
","<p>Most bathtubs that aren't cast iron or steel are acrylic plastic.</p>

<p>If the crack is right through the tub and water is leaking though, you should replace the tub.  If it's an emergency and you need a short-term repair, I'd use a two-part epoxy.  Choose a thin epoxy (2:1 ratio) from the selection at the home center and use a putty knife to try to force it into the crack.  Let it cure for 24 hours.  This will be at best a short term solution because if tub cracked it must be because it flexed in that spot - it will flex again and the brittle epoxy repair will crack again quickly.</p>

<p>If the crack is a surface scratch, it can be repaired with a repair kit such as offered by <a href=""http://www.surface-repair.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.surface-repair.com/</a>.  The problem is color matching: your tub will have changed color over time and it will be difficult or impossible to get a good match.</p>

<p>Another approach is using fine sandpaper.  You can get very fine wet-and-dry sandpaper at an auto parts store like Napa.  Get 320, 600, 1200 and 2000 grit.  Apply some elbow grease to the scratch with the 320.  Try to keep the scratches localized and in one direction.  Use the 320 until the scratch is gone.  Then move to the 600 and keep it up until the scratches from the 320 are gone.  By the time you're done 1200 you may be satisfied, but if not you should be able to get a fairly glossy finish with the 2000.</p>

"Can I use an LED bulb in a 3-Way fixture?","83003","","<p>Is it possible to use an LED bulb in a 3-way light fixture?  Will all three work?</p>

<p>A three-way incandescent light has two filaments: dim and medium.  Each filament has a separate contact on the bulb's base.  The brightest light level is provided by energizing both simultaneously.  When energized, each filament is driven at the mains voltage, so applying that voltage to a standard LED bulb will cause it to produce its rated light output.</p>

<p>You'll probably find that (because the bulb's base is missing a contact), you'll have an ""on, off, on, off"" pattern as you rotate the switch, instead of ""dim, medium, bright, off"" like with a 3-way bulb.</p>

"Extension cord and power strip safety","82521","","<p>I've heard that there are some safety and building code issues involved with using extension cords or power strips (surge protectors) for anything other than temporary use. What are the issues, and how can extension cords be used safely?</p>
","<p>This is one of the biggest problem with power strips (surge protectors)...
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9LY6l.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Overload!</p>

<p>The average person does not think about how much power each device is drawing, or how much the system can handle, they just see an open outlet and plug stuff in.  If they can't find an open outlet... Oh yeah! they make adapters for that!  <em>I mean they sell the adapters, so they must be safe... Right?</em></p>

<p>If your power strips look like this (or worse), you better at least be checking the batteries in that smoke alarm (which is hopefully not plugged into this power strip too).</p>

<p>If you are using the power strip (or extension cord) properly (one plug per outlet, no adapters, no daisy chaining) and you inspect the power strip for damage (wear &amp; tear) regularly, you should not have much to fear.</p>

<p>Another thing to look at when using a power strip or extension cord, is the size of the wire and the voltage and amperage ratings.  If you are using things like electric heaters, power tools, vacuums, etc., make sure the wire (extension cord/power strip) is the proper size to handle the above average load of these types of devices. Overloaded wire can heat up quickly and cause a fire.</p>

<p>Basically if you use common sense, inspect the cables for obvious damage and/or wear &amp; tear regularly, and use the cables for their intended purpose, you should have no problems using extension cords and/or power strips.</p>

<p>Here is some interesting stuff from <a href=""http://www.compliance.gov/"">The Office of Compliance</a> about <a href=""http://www.compliance.gov/forms-pubs/eresources/fastfacts_daisychains.pdf"">
Power Strips and Dangerous Daisy Chains</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Problems:</strong></p>
  
  <p>OSHA regulations require that conductors  and  electrical  equipment 
  be  used  in  accordance with the conditions under which  they are
  approved by a recognized testing  organization (29 CFR 1910.303(a)). 
  Most  power strips are approved for providing power to a maximum of four or
  six individual items;  however,  when  multiple  power  strips  are 
  interconnected, the one directly connected  to  the  building  outlet 
  is  often  supplying  power  to  far  more  than  the  approved 
  number. This electrical current overload can  result in a fire or can
  cause a circuit breaker  to  trip, deenergizing computers and other 
  equipment throughout the area. The risk is  magnified when another
  outlet in the same  wall or floor receptacle is also overloaded in  a
  similar fashion.  When other outlets on  the same circuit are also
  overloaded, the risk  increases.</p>
  
  <p>Extension  cords  are  sometimes  used  to 
  energize  power  strips  in  locations  far 
  from outlets.  Because electrical resistance 
  increases with increased power cord length,
  interconnecting  cords  increases  the  total 
  resistance  and  resultant  heat  generation. 
  This creates an additional risk of equipment
  failure and fire, particularly when paper and 
  other combustible materials are in contact 
  with  the  wires.  Additionally,  OSHA’s 
  regulations allow extension cords to be used 
  only as temporary wiring for up to 90 days.
  Unfortunately,once in place, extension cords 
  tend to become permanent wiring and a fire 
  hazard.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
  
  <p>Several safe solutions exist.  In many cases, a 
  power strip energized by an extension cord or 
  another power strip can simply be replaced by 
  a power strip with a power cord of adequate
  length to reach an outlet.  Other 
  times, use of a power strip that is better able 
  to accommodate bulkier transformer plugs 
  solves the problem. 
  Several factors should be considered when 
  selecting an appropriate surge protector. Since 
  models vary in the amount of current that 
  they are rated to safely carry, it is important 
  to consider  the amperage  requirements of 
  the devices to be energized. Models vary in 
  length of power cord, typically ranging from 
  three to 15 feet. Choose one whose length is 
  most appropriate for reaching the intended 
  room outlet. Avoid having too much excess 
  cord, and make sure the surge protector is set 
  on its base. Some have swivel plugs which 
  makes them easier to connect to the outlet,
  and helps to protect the plug and cord from
  damage.  Check  each  surge  protector  to 
  make sure it is in good condition for use. </p>
  
  <p>Only power strips equipped with internal fuses are acceptable as permanent wiring.  Those
  lacking  these  fuses are equivalent to extension cords, and  therefore may not be used as
  permanent wiring.  When a power strip is installed, care must be taken to ensure that it is 
  not suspended in mid-air by its power cord or cords plugged into it, resulting in excessive 
  stress on electrical connections. </p>

"What are the pros and cons of Owens Corning shingles vs. GAF shingles?","82485","","<p>I am looking to get a new roof for my house. I have taken quotes from about 4 contractors and 3 of them are suggesting I should use GAF shingles. 1 suggests that Owens Corning is a better shingle and I should use that. I am really new in this field and not sure which material to go for? Does it matter which material I choose or are these both good shingles and which one I use does not matter?</p>
","<p>More important question: Which contractor did you feel the most comfortable with and which has the best work history in your area -- have you checked BBB and something like Angies List? Who has the best relationship with their wholesaler/supplier and can get you support if you need it in case of roof damage? </p>

<p>Owens Corning and GAF make comparable products; the Owens Corning warranty is longer, but neither warranty is good unless the installer installs it properly with the proper number of nails at the proper spacing. Specifically, the two products that you're looking at are almost identical. One difference besides the warranty is that Owens Corning has a constant bead of sealant on the backside of the shingles to seal them to the shingles underneath; if you're in an area that gets significant amounts of wind-driven rain (such as a coastal area) to the point that you will be testing the wind resistance of the shignle, you will PROBABLY want to choose the GAF shingle because the Owens Corning shingles sometimes have problems draining after water has blown up underneath them. </p>

<p>Remember that it isn't the shingle that matters; the shingle really just protects your roof. Your roof is actually the tar paper and other membrane (such as Grace Ice &amp; Water Shield) that goes on under the shingles. Those products should be of the highest quality and have perfect installations. Getting good shingles is essential, but it's almost secondary if you cheap out on the underlayments or your roofer installs it incorrectly. </p>

<p>One note that I'm suggesting all homeowners explore: If your attic is hot during the summer, look into the 'Cool Roof' shingles that both OC and GAF produce. They have a reflective substance in with the stone and will help reflect solar energy back out before it has a chance to enter your roof structure. </p>

<h2>Basic Electronics Crash Course</h2>

<ul>
<li>Volts * Amps = Watts</li>
<li>Watts / Volt = Amps</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Information</h2>

<p>These strips indeed usually come in lengths of 5 meters but you find suppliers that will give you 10/15/20 metres options also. Most only provide 5 meters because of the power they need to power up properly. So they try and sell you a cheap 12volt apadter used for each 5M strips but also the guys who sell them up to 20Metres does not mean you can use the entire length because the PCB traces might burn out caused by overloading them. You need to check with the seller how you can use them. The market is flooded with various makes and knock offs- so make sure you can get the specifications.</p>

<p>A lot of LED 5050 or 3258 each have different power ratings and usually come in 150 or 300 per 5 meters (30 / 60 per meter)</p>

<h2>Powering LED strips</h2>

<p>From the example provided earlier I will use single colour LED. The 5 meter white strip uses 24 Watts - That is 2A X 12 = 24WATTS - So using any 12v power supply with at least 2A will power that single 5 meter strip at 100%</p>

<p>I have similar strip and I joined them with a soldering iron to make a 10 meter strip and it works fine. I powered them up for 10 minutes and felt if the PCB tracks, close to the power supply because that is were the highest power draw will be, checked if they were getting warm/hot. They were cold so I left them for another 30 minutes and still cold, so  they could handle the extra power. To calculate the MAX rating of the PCB track you would need to know the material, PCB thickness and width (Which nobody supplies). Also there is no equipment to test that either.</p>

<p>So instead of buying several small 12V adapters I go to the next best thing. A computer power supply!</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PHoWT.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You can get really cheap ones like 450Watt and they can power up tens of strips with clean 12volt power, with short circuit protection and overload protection. This is a DIY Q&amp;A so there needs to be DIY involved! Using a Computer PSU you are only interested in the yellow and black wires. The rest you can cut away/discard.</p>

<p>Here is a diagram showing the pinout computer PSU connectors.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1DmZI.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You need to realize you cannot just join all the yellows and use it as one. Each yellow wire is a PHASE and each phase has a maximum amperage rating. All the phases give the power supply its maximum peak rating.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QCern.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As long as the combined amperage/wattage does not exceed that written on the label of the PSU you will be OK to combine many LED strips to a single phase. But each 5 Meter LED strip will need to be powered individually to be safe. So you need to pull wire alongside all your led strips if you're going to go more than 10M :(</p>

<p><strong>OK</strong> - Fine it seems too much faffing around with the computer PSU- but I would like you to know that paying extortionate prices for 12volt power adapters is not neccessary. LED's are not special- they do not need special 100pound adapters. Just shop around for big wattage 12volt supplies. You should find good prices.</p>

<h2>Cutting LED strips</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZXh4K.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h2>Joining LED strips</h2>

<p>Picture worth a 1000 words</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HixvG.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Just match up the pads, join them like that or use some cable. Does not matter.</p>

<h2>RGB LED's and drivers</h2>

<p>Unfortunately RGB LEDS use three 12volt channels with a controller that outputs a variation of voltages on each channel to get the LED to its desired colour. The controllers output a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation"" rel=""noreferrer"">PWM signal</a> and can only handle the maximum watts it is rated for. the only suggestion is to buy 4 of the exact same model that use infra-red remote. Put them side by side so that the remote will control all of them at the same time and pull your cables to the desired locations. Some of these controllers can store pre set colours so that could be an advantage.</p>

<p>But you can also buy a <a href=""http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/LED-Signal-Amplifier-Repeater-12V-for-RGB-SMD-Strip-/320707682261?pt=UK_Home_Garden_Night_Lights_Fairy_Lights&amp;hash=item4aabaadfd5#ht_1946wt_1186"" rel=""noreferrer"">repeater now a days from China</a>. They are basically another micro controller that sense the PWN signal and outputs the same but with the ability to power more strips.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FwNf4.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>-EDIT Nov/2014
There are allot more RGB amplifiers / repeaters on the market now and cost between 5-15USD. Search on eBay for local seller.</p>

"Are toilets supposed to be caulked to the floor?","82055","","<p>I've heard that in some cases toilets are supposed to be caulked to the floor. I replaced both toilets in the condo I moved into last week, and one was calked to the floor, and one was not. One difference was that toilet where caulk was present is on a relatively uneven tile floor, and the one where caulk was not present was on a flat linoleum floor. The instructions the toilet came with made no mention of this.</p>
","<p>This is a very controversial topic. Some plumbers swear that you <strong>must</strong> seal the toilet to the floor, while others swear that you <strong>should not</strong> seal the toilet to the floor.  Some guys never do it, some guys always do it, and some guys only do it depending on the flooring used. It also appears that some toilet manufacturers mention it in the installation instructions, and some do not.</p>

<p>I've heard it mentioned that ""<em>it's code</em>"" to seal the toilet to the floor, but I've never heard anybody cite the actual code that says it. I'm not well versed in plumbing code, but a quick look didn't reveal any obvious code sections. Though plumbing code (and most other codes), does require you to follow the manufacturer's installation instructions. So if the installation instructions say to do it, then you should do it (if you want a code compliant install).</p>

<p>In my opinion, it's a double edged sword. On the one hand, sealing the toilet can keep water and grime from going under the toilet. At the same time, it also keeps water from coming out from under the toilet.  If you develop a leak, the water will be trapped under the toilet. This could allow the leak to do much more damage, before you notice you have a leak. </p>

<p>If you flush the toilet and get wet feet, you're going to call a plumber to check the toilet. If after years of flushing the toilet you notice a strange smell, and maybe a water stain on a ceiling somewhere. You're going to start ripping things apart searching for the source of the leak.</p>

<p>To try and alleviate this negative side effect, some plumbers leave a gap in the caulk near the back of the toilet.  While this may let water from a leak out, it also allows water in. Which defeats the purpose of sealing the toilet to the floor in the first place.</p>

<p>If you're installing a toilet in a bathroom where kids are going to be bathing (splashing), it might be worth it to seal the toilet. If you're installing a toilet in a water closet, where there's not likely to be water near the base of the toilet, then maybe it's not worth it. Follow the manufacturer's installation instructions, and use your own judgment.</p>

<hr>

<p>After doing a bit more research, it does appear that codes require the toilet to be sealed.</p>

","<p>If the electricity has been turned off, and you have confirmed it's off via a non-contact tester, multi-meter, or some other method, then you don't need gloves to protect yourself from electrocution - there should be no risk if you've actually confirmed it's off. I even go as far as to put a piece of tape over the breaker so someone doesn't walk by and flip it back on.</p>

<p>I sometimes wear gloves to protect my hands from scrapes and cuts - any work glove you find comfortable for the job should work.</p>

<p>As DA01 said in a comment, a glove that would protect you from shock would likely make working with the wire/cable we find in residential difficult. They do however make insulated tools which can be used when working on live gear. Best to just turn the power off and not worry.</p>

<p>I don't want to move the upstairs thermostat because if I'm not in the basement I don't care how cold it gets and the upstairs would become inconsistent.</p>
","<p>I'm going to go ahead and say that YES, you can do as you propose, wiring the two thermostats in parallel.</p>

<p>While, as others have correctly pointed out, this will not let you achieve temperature control in both the upstairs and downstairs simultaneously, I'm going to take you at your word that you simply do not want it to be uncomfortably cold in the basement when occupying the basement, and infer that you don't care what happens upstairs during those times.</p>

<p>In this case, go for it--install the second thermostat.</p>

<p>The upstairs area of the house will in fact be over-heated when you use this basement thermostat, but you may still consider the result to be an improvement over the current situation. Just remember to reset the basement thermostat to cooler temperature before you leave to go back upstairs or you will find yourself having to make the trip back down later.</p>

<p>The ""correct"" way to solve the problem is to split your system into two zones, which requires installing baffles/valves on your heating ducts/pipes, which would allow independent control of upstairs and downstairs.</p>

<p>If you are using traditional thermostats, then adding a thermostat in parallel will change the heat anticipator function in both of them. This is a function that reduces furnace run times to improve temperature stability. If both are always connected, lower the HA settings in each to fix. </p>

"What mortar should I use for 8x10 and mosaic wall tile?","81457","","<p>I will be tiling a tub/shower area using 8x10 ceramic tile with glass mosaic tile accent rows.</p>

<p>I see about half a dozen varieties of thin-set on the market:</p>

<p>Weights:
 - 25lb 
 - 50lb</p>

<p>Types:
 - fortified
 - standard
 - flexbond </p>

<p>About every combination of the weights and types you can imagine is available.</p>

<p>What is the right thinset for my installation?</p>
","<h1>Color</h1>

<p>This is the easy one.  If you're going to use dark grout, you can use grey thin-set. If your grout is a light color, or you're installing glass tile or a porous stone, use white thin-set. If you use grey thin-set with light grout, glass, or porous stone, the color may show through.</p>

<h1>To modify, or not to modify</h1>

<p>In most cases, you'll want to use some form of modified thin-set.  Unmodified thin-sets are typically only used by professionals, and are modified at the time of mixing (using the pros secret recipe).  </p>

<h2>Standard</h2>

<p>This is the economy thin-set. It will work well in most situations, and is a bit easier on the wallet. It should not be used with impervious materials such as glass, and porcelain. </p>

<h2>Fortified</h2>

<p>A fortified thinset like <a href=""http://www.custombuildingproducts.com/products/setting-materials/polymer-modified-thin-set-mortars/versabond/versabond.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">VersaBond®</a>, is an ""all-purpose"" thin-set and an excellent choice for DIYers.  It will provide a good bond between just about any tile and substrate you can use, and it's good for floors, walls, and counter tops. </p>

<h2>Flexbond</h2>

<p>Flexbond is a polymer modified thin-set. It is a good choice when working with porcelain or glass tile, or when tiling over a plywood subfloor.  It provides a bit of extra flexibility, which can prevent cracking in some situations. </p>

<h1>How much to buy</h1>

<p>First you'll have to determine the square footage, of the area you'll be tiling.  I'll use a tub surround with 2 walls 3' wide, one wall 5' wide, and tile 6' up each wall as an example.</p>

<pre><code>The total length = 3' + 3' + 5' = 11'
height = 6'
sqft = 11' * 6' = 66 sqft.
</code></pre>

<p>I usually estimate that a 50lbs bag of thin-set will cover about 60sqft, so in my example I'll need 1 50lbs and 1 25lbs bag of thin-set.  Don't worry, if you overbuy you can always return the 25lbs bag when you're done (just don't open it, unless you need it). </p>

<h1>How much to mix</h1>

<p>The bag of thin-set should list the <strong>Pot Life</strong>, which tells you how long the thin-set is good for once it's mixed and in a bucket.  You want to mix only enough thin-set that you'll be able to use in this amount of time.  This will depend on how fast you work, so you'll have to experiment to figure out what works best for you.  </p>

<h1>How much to spread</h1>

<p>The bag should also list the <strong>Open Time</strong>, and <strong>Adjustment Time</strong>. Open time, is how long the thin-set can sit on the substrate after being troweled. Adjustment time is the amount of time after laying the tile, that the tile can be adjusted. In most cases you'll want to ignore these numbers, and simply spread only what you can use in 5-10 minutes.  Again, this will depend on how fast you work, so you'll have to figure it out as you go.</p>

<h1>Trowel Size</h1>

<p>You want to make sure you get 100% coverage under tiles, which may require back-buttering on larger tiles. You also want to use a bit thicker mortar bed when setting floor tiles, since floor tiles may be subject to more abuse.  This <a href=""http://www.jamoinc.com/documents/techbulletin/Trowel%20Guide.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">trowel guide</a> from <a href=""http://www.jamoinc.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JAMO Inc.</a>, is a good baseline for which trowel to use.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vni9Z.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Though you may find that you have to make slight adjustments, depending on the thin-set and tile you're working with.</p>

<p><a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/q/43816/2711"">What could happen if I used 4 cycle fuel in a 2 cycle engine?</a></p>

<p>2 cycle oil is used for my weed eater. There is no way I could use a whole gallon in a year.</p>

<p>Sometimes I run out of gasoline for my 4 cycle lawn mower, and that 2 cycle mix fuel is sitting there getting really old.</p>

<h2>If I run that in the lawn mower, am I simply going to create extra pollution or could the 2 cycle fuel cause any damage to the 4 cycle engine?</h2>
","<p>It will smoke badly and may indeed foul the plug(s). It will be less of a problem if you only use a SMALL amount of mix fuel in each tank, so the oil is more diluted.</p>

<p>IMHO, IME, if you use THAT little fuel in your weed whacker, you probably should sell it and buy an electric one, either corded or rechargeable.</p>

<p>If you don't want to do that, then you should invest in some good liquid measures that you will NOT use for anything else, and mix only a pint or quart of mixed fuel at one time - or purchase ""canned pre-mix"" fuel which typically comes in sealed metal quart cans - available in many places.</p>

<p>Edit WRT comments: I would personally choose an inexpensive graduated cylinder (or two) for the mixing - far less likely to be repurposed to food use by someone that does not know better than a tablespoon - also very easy to get a direct ratio in small quantity. But...2 Tbs in an ounce, 16 per cup, 32 per pint, 128 per half-gallon. So a pint of 32:1 mix is easy, but all my stuff is 50:1 mix. 256 tablespoons per gallon at 50:1 works back to one Tbs per 0.195 gallon (on a modern digital pump readout.) 40:1 is 0.156 and 32:1 is 0.125</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pwthr.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>It's possible to get the hose screwed on by hand tightly enough that it won't leak if your grip is strong enough; I think the strength required is within the normal range for an adult (mine is relatively strong though, so your mileage may vary). But before you get a wrench, there's a couple of things you should check:</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure the threads on the faucet and on the hose are clean; if they've been disconnected over the winter, they could have picked up some dirt or grit which is preventing you from getting a good seal. </li>
<li>the hose is supposed to have a rubber washer to make the seal against the end of the faucet. If it's missing, perished, or not seated correctly, then you won't get a good seal. You can get packs of washers (more than you'll ever use, probably) cheaply at the big box stores.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r5Uq5.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Once you've got those taken care of, try it with the hose screwed on hand-tight. If you're still getting leaks, you can try using a wrench, but remember that tightening is good, over-tightening is bad because you start to deform the rubber washer, which reduces its effectiveness. Get the hose hand-tight, then use the wrench to go another quarter-turn or so. If it's still leaking, it may be time to get a new hose.</p>

<p>I'm guessing there is a ""safe"" angle (a) for a ladder, regardless of the height (h). So more generally what is an easy way to calculate the length of a ladder (l) to safely reach a particular height?</p>
","<p>You have to take into account a few factors:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>extension ladders have an overlap that isn't shown in the nominal length - for example, a 16' extension ladder has two 8' sections, but fully extended is only 13' long.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>the ladder will be used at an angle (usually a four to one pitch / 75 degrees) so the top of a 16' ladder won't even be at 13' in use</p></li>
<li><p>you don't want to stand on the top few rungs</p></li>
<li><p>some tasks take more ladder than others, if you're painting, you can reach up and work a little higher than the top of the ladder, but if you have to get on a roof, you need the ladder that extends well past the edge of the roof (usually about three feet)</p></li>
</ul></li>

<p>Trig tells us the height of the top of a ladder tilted at 75 degrees will be .97 the length.  For example, a 16' extension ladder (which is really 13' long extended) set up at a 4:1 / 75 degree pitch will touch a wall at about 12'7"" (13' * .97).  </p>

"How can I level a sloped floor?","79921","","<p>I have a 10x13 first-floor room which used to be a porch but at some point was closed in by the previous owners, and sheet linoleum was glued down to the plywood subfloor. Unfortunately they didn't correct for the built in slope of the original porch when the closed it in, so the room has a consistent 1-inch slope towards the outside of the house (e.g. it's not an intermittent 'sag,' 'warp,' or 'dip,' the whole floor slopes out relatively consistently). I need to level the floor in order to put down hardwood as I will be using the space for my business. I have been advised (by 3 different people) to solve the problem in 3 different ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Screw down wire mesh straight to the existing linoleum and pour Self Leveling Compound to bring the slope level.</li>
<li>Pull up the subfloor and sister new 2x8s to the joists but leveled instead of at an angle</li>
<li>Pull up the subfloor and then attach custom-cut wedges to lay on top of the joists correcting them to level.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, option 1 has a certain amount of appeal simply because I don't have to pull up the linoleum, rip up the subfloor, or engage in any cutting, nailing, bolting, screwing, gluing, or replacing of subfloor to accomplish the leveling task. On the other hand, the notion of a large quantity of self leveling compound drying on me as I'm desperately attempting to mix it, pour it, feather it, etc. makes me nervous (a 10x13 room with a constant slope- thus the entire 130 sq. ft. floor will end up with at least <em>some</em> SLC on it- 1 inch deep on one side of the room, and feathered to nearly nothing on the other). So my questions are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Am I missing any major options for leveling my floor?</li>
<li>Are any of the options above not realistically viable (e.g. I have a friend who doesn't know what they're talking about in recommending one or more of the above options)</li>
<li>Is SLC really 'a breeze' to use (as I have been told it is), or are my fears of not being able to get the entire 10x13 room poured and feathered inside of the ~20 minute setting window well founded? I will have volunteer help, but there will be no 'pros,' so if it's not <em>actually</em> a 'breeze' this could be an issue...</li>
<li>Which option would you choose, and why?</li>
</ul>
","<p>I'm really fascinated by your question and suggested solutions. I am glad to hear that you question the wisdom of some of the suggestions. There are a few factors that are important to consider before picking a solution.</p>

<p>What type of hardwood flooring are you thinking of using?  Nail down, staple down, glue down or floating?  With any type but a floating floor, SLC is definately the wrong product to use underneath, as it will shatter when nailed, and the thinner areas will probably separate from the underlayment when glued to. I also expect SLC will not adhear well to the old vinyl flooring or even the plywood subfloor. Any flex of the plywood subfloor will result in cracks and broken chunks of concrete.</p>

<p>I would explore the possibility of jacking the lower end up one inch. This would of course depend on what type of foundation it is resting on, the roof structure, if the existing ceiling is now level, or does it also slope the same one inch, and finally, if there are any windows in the side walls, as it would effect the level of those as well if jacked. </p>

<p>Assuming jacking is not an option, the next easiest way would be to install ""purlins"" or surface shim boards every 12 to 16 inches on center across the floor in decreasing thickness and install a new 3/4 inch subfloor over these, screwing it down all the way into the old floor.</p>

<p>The most work, but successful method would be to remove the old floor completely and sister the original floor joists. Using full size sister joists would not be necessary.  2X4s or 2X6's would be fine as long as a good bond was maintained to the existing 2X8's.  The custom wedge idea would work fine, but potentially difficult to rip long lengths for each joist and have them all consistent without a good ripping template, but could be done with a little forethought and clever rip guide.</p>

"What to do about different rooms in the house being a completely different temperature?","79567","","<p>I moved into a 30 year old home last December.  There is a problem with the HVAC.</p>

<p>I have included a very crude drawing of the floor plan<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1a0NM.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The problem is that I can't maintain a comfortable temperature in the different rooms of the house.  I don't really care about the basement because I seldom use it.  The thermostat is located in the great room.  It is not in direct sunlight.</p>

<p>Suppose for the sake of discussion that I want the temperature to be 70 degrees.</p>

<p>Suppose that it's cold outside and I set my thermostat to 70 degrees.  The great room, kitchen will be about 70 degrees.  The bathroom will be warmer.  The den will feel about 65.  The upstairs will be about 75 or so, and I can break a sweat.</p>

<p>It gets late at night and the bedrooms upstairs are too hot, so I turn the thermostat down to 65 to compensate.  The air-conditioner kicks on and the temperature in the bedrooms is now about 70 (which is what I wanted), but it gets very cold downstairs.</p>

<p>When it is warm outside, I still have the problem that it is much warmer upstairs than downstairs.</p>

<hr>

<p>Why does it seem impossible to maintain a comfortable temperature throughout the house?  What do I need to do in order to maintain the same comfortable temperature in all the rooms?</p>
","<p>It's a balancing problem, fairly typical for a one-zone heating system spanning an entire house.</p>

<p>Mind you, I'm a bit concerned with a setup that kicks on the A/C in heating season - being from a primarily heating climate, we typically have a ""winter/summer"" or ""heating/off/cooling"" mode switch either on the system/boiler/furnace or on the thermostat to prevent that sort of foolishness. If it's REALLY so hot in winter or cold in in summer that we want to change the mode, WE choose to change the mode, rather than leaving it up to a machine to decide.</p>

<p>Presumably you have forced air heat, since the same system is cooling. One approach to improve balance is to run the fan more to distribute air around the house and balance temperatures even when heat is not being delivered. A more basic step is adjusting the airflow to different parts of the system for heat delivery that more closely keeps things even - but if the same system is cooling this may be difficult to get balanced in a manner that works well for both, since heat rises and cold air sinks, left to itself. </p>

<p>The system may be oversized (so it quickly heats or cools the location of the thermostat, and then shuts off the fan, rather than running a large percentage of the time when it's cold out), but all systems are prone to being somewhat oversized much of the year in order to be large enough to heat on the coldest days and cool on the warmest days.</p>

<p>A good HVAC professional may well be worth talking to in order to tune your system as best it can be tuned. Moving to continuous circulation (perhaps at a lower fan speed) seems like it might be needed in this house to reduce stratification, at a guess. The only major downside if your system is not too noisy will be the electric bill for running the fan.</p>

<p>As a quick stopgap, examine your thermostat to see if it has a ""fan"" switch, typically with two positions - Auto (blows only to heat/cool) and ""on"" or ""Continuous"" - if the switch exists and is wired correctly, that should put the fan in continuous circulation mode - but you may want to alter the system to make that quieter and/or more efficient with a lower speed or even an entirely different fan/blower. And it may still need to be balanced to work better.</p>

"What is the purpose of tape when taping and mudding drywall?","79149","","<p>Sorry if this is a stupid question, but it doesn't seem immediately obvious how a thin strip of paper tape actually helps the mudding process in drywall installation except for perhaps reducing the amount of mud needed between panels.</p>

<p>This, from eHow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Embedded in a layer of drywall joint compound, drywall tape creates a physical bond between adjacent sheets of drywall. Although the bond does not significantly contribute to the structural support of the drywall sheets, the bond reduces the movement and cracking of the sheets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wouldn't simply mudding between the joints have the same strength without the tape, albeit requiring more mud?</p>
","<p>Nope. Go ahead and try it if you don't believe me! I certainly did... </p>

<p>The problem with wood frame houses is that they shift in weird ways as the wind hits them and as the foundation settles. The 8 foot long side of a standard drywall panel has a LOT of mechanical force to it if it moves even somewhat independently of the sheet next to it, and the joint compound rapidly turns to powder without tape to back it up. The same can happen if there is too much or too little compound or the compound is the wrong type, you can also see this problem.</p>

<p>This is akin to the reason that drywall is gypsum between two sheets of paper... All you have to do to break or cut the gypsum is to disturb the paper. </p>

<p>But back to the problem of how to open it. If the garage does not have an alternative access there should be a manual cable release which disconnects the door from the opener chain so that you can manually open it.

And then there's about a 50/50 chance of it to start gurgle again.</p>

<p>We've tried unclogging it with a plunger, but it does not help. So I'm suspecting it has something to do with the septic tank.</p>

<p>What should I try to fix this?</p>

<p>EDIT: I should also note that one toilet is on a floor higher then the other.</p>
","<p>I've been a victim of this before. <strong>This is bad news.</strong></p>

<p>In my (rare) case, the roof of my apartment building drained to the middle of the building and down the sewer pipes. During phenomenal downpours (twice in five years), the flow of water coming down that pipe was faster than the flow of water leaving the building. The water backed up to the lowest point where it had an exit which was my primary bathroom. It did so with such intensity that water was violently sloshing out of the toilet bowl, the stopper on the sink was forcefully ejected, and the bathtub was backing up at the same time. The only good news in all this mess is that it was fresh water.</p>

<p>Clearly, this is not quite your case. However, it is an indication of the same similar fact: you have a flow going in the wrong direction in your sewer line. Before the astonishingly violent discharge and water flowing everywhere, the toilet would gurgle.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tbMwK.jpg"" alt=""Positive water pressure in sewer line""></p>

<p>Since it's a septic tank for you, <strong>you need that serviced now</strong>.</p>

<p>The reason the flushed water level is lower is probably that the siphon link between the bowl and the sewer line isn't being broken.</p>

"Should I use steel or wood studs for basement exterior walls?","77477","","<p>Related: <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/255/when-should-you-use-metal-studs"">When should you use metal studs?</a></p>

<p>I'm planning on finishing my basement.  (assuming all water issues are resolved)
I'll be putting up a water barrier (tar paper) on all exterior walls, Framing a stud wall, insulating, installing a vapour barrier, and dry-walling over top.</p>

<p>There will also be a fire-wall built around the furnace (obviously I'll use steel here).</p>

<p>For the exterior walls, should I use steel or wood studs?</p>

<p>If you can't answer, at least give me points to consider.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>  I plan to start this project in February.  I've just had entrenching and exterior waterproofing done on the foundation.  Parge, Aquablock, Delta board and new weepers put in.  Does this affect the vapour barrier situation?  (obviously this is cold-side waterproofing.)</p>

<p>Much later update:
Went with steel studs and spray foam.  The contractor sistered some of the studs with 2x4's to provide mount points for shelves and a wall mount TV should we decide to go that path.  Here's some in progress photos.

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LtLha.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>I did a lot of research when finishing our basement. I eventually went with a wall model recommended by building sciences corporation that, from outside in, is:</p>

<ul>
<li>existing exterior wall (concrete, concrete block, etc)</li>
<li>foam board insulation (XPS or EPS, I went with EPS)</li>
<li>stud wall</li>
<li>sheet rock (I went with a paperless product called Densarmor</li>
</ul>

<p>This is  a system that Fine Homebuilding magazine also recommends and is considered valid by the US Department of Energy. I know this because our local building codes were still using the antiquated 'fiberglass + plastic' model and I had to do a ton of research to educate the local code enforcers before they'd approve this.  </p>

<p>I went with metal studs for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>they're all perfectly straight</li>
<li>I can carry 20 of them at a time (makes it REALLY easy to haul into a basement)</li>
<li>easy to build in-place (no need to frame then tilt-up walls)</li>
<li>cut with tin-snips in a matter of seconds</li>
<li>mold can't grow on it</li>
<li>can be installed without screws (can be crimped in place)</li>
<li>at the time, were the same cost</li>
<li>wiring channels are built-in</li>
<li>you can use thinner studs (it's impossible to find straight 2x2's in wood around here)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few cons, though:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can't easily nail into them for attaching baseboard</li>
<li>you still need to frame out your doors with wood for the added strength</li>
<li>you can't mount cabinets to the wall with metal studs</li>
</ul>

<p>As for baseboard, I decided to use the new synthetic foam pre-finished trim. It looks pretty good, is super light, easy to work with and...it's not wood. So I thought it was another great product for a basement. Because it's so light, it was really easy to toe-nail it in to the sheetrock with an pneumatic trimmer. </p>

<p>As for mounting cabinets and such, on the walls where I knew I wanted to do this, I added 2x2's inside the metal studs for support. </p>

<p>The only corrosion issue that I'd be worried about is rust, and that should only be an issue if you still have a moisture issue in your basement. It'd also take a really long time for a stud to rust through and be any sort of problem. </p>

<p>Some tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>be sure to separate the floor plate from the concrete. I used 1/4 XPS for that and then power-actuated hammered them into the concrete. This thermal break will prevent moisture coming in through the concrete to condense on the metal</li>
<li>don't screw them in. I did and while it's not that big of a deal, they make crimpers just for this purpose. Invest in the crimpers as it'll make things go really fast. </li>
<li>be sure to buy plastic grommets for the electrical channels. You don't want your electrical cables rubbing up against the bare steel edges. </li>
<li>wear really good gloves</li>
</ul>

<p>As for your plan: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>barrier (tar paper) on all exterior walls, Framing a stud wall, insulating, installing a vapour barrier, and dry-walling over top</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...I STRONGLY recommend against that. </p>

<p>for starters, your plan involves two vapor barriers...that is a really bad idea. That will only trap moisture inside the walls. The modern recommendation (at least in colder climates) is to not use any vapor barrier in an old basement. Instead, use foam board for the insulation. Foam board is permeable, and the idea is that if water ever got on one side or the other, it could eventually dry to the other. </p>

<p>The other issue is that you want the insulation on the OUTSIDE of the stud wall. The foundation wall will be the coldest surface and is where moisture would condense. You want all of your framing on the inside of the conditioned space. </p>

<p>The proper way to put a water barrier in a basement is on the OUTSIDE of the foundation. Ideally, you'd have a water barrier and insulation on the outside of the concrete. But that's obviously really hard to retrofit.</p>

"What's the difference between three phase 240 V and standard household 240 V?","77336","","<p>I don't understand the difference between household 240 and 3 phase 240. Isn't household 240 just two 120 phases, making 240V two-phase? If so, wouldn't three phase just be 360v? How, then, is there 240 and 480v three phase? Does each conductor carry the full voltage?</p>
","<p>Input Phase Angle and number of transformers needed. For High-Delta, type of transformer.</p>

<p>All voltages below are expressed in RMS Average, not Peak...</p>

<p>I find it really hard to refer to Split-Phase as Residential or ""House"" Power. It is used in business where you're not running a lot of heavy motorized equipment. 240VAC Split Phase is produced off a single phase input transformer with center tapped secondary, producing for output, a single phase across the 240V outer terminals and two 120V legs with phases 180 degrees apart. Centertap is an effective ground (Neutral) at 0V potential and each leg is +120VAC and -120VAC respectively for the full voltage of 240V.</p>

<p>If you view the waveform on an oscilloscope, you will see a single sine wave (single phase) when measuring between Line 1 and Line 2 (below) at 240VAC RMS. Measuring between Line 1 and Neutral will show a single sine wave at 120VAC RMS, measuring between Line 2 and Neutral will show a single sine wave at 120VAC RMS equal and opposite to the L1-Neutral wave (180 degree phase shift)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HdUzm.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Three Phase has three separate circuits with phases 120 Degrees apart. You need three separate transformers, one for each phase. The primary on each is fed with a single phase and produces an output of a single phase on 208 (Y) or 240 (Delta) VAC. Depending on whether the circuit is Wye or Delta, you can have multiple voltages. Each phase-pair carries the full voltage. On Wye with Neutral, the voltage between the phase and Neutral will be slightly less than three-fifths of (it's one-third of the square root of 3, for electronics geeks) the voltage between each phase leg. On Delta, you only have each phase available with no Neutral.</p>

<p>If we hook up an oscilloscope to each of the line terminals, we see the following waveform, three independent power paths, 120 degrees phase shifted which when applied to a three phase motor, provide a rotating vortex magnetic field which makes 3 phase motors self-starting without the requirement of a start capacitor, start winding or other method of kludging in a phase shifted winding to provide the rotational force to start the motor spinning.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/weVBS.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Wye and Delta typically have one Pole Pig per phase (three transformers). On a Wye 480VAC system, the voltage between each phase and Neutral is 277VAC. Transformer secondary electrical schematics below to show how each transformer set is hooked up to derive the connection scheme. You can hook a single phase motor up on L1-L2, L2-L3 or L3-L1 for single phase current (balance necessary on loading between phases) or apply L1-L2-L3 to the proper therminals of a three phase motor.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VD4XX.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>On the US power grid, also is used the High-Leg Delta transformer circuit which allows for multiple voltages. Voltage between each Leg produces 240VAC, voltage between the Center Tap and the high leg gives 208VAC Single Phase and voltage between each low leg and the center tap is essentially a Split Phase circuit with 120V from each respective leg to Neutral (residential power tap - grin). High-Leg Delta power is only available in 120/208/240, and is not put in any longer as Wye circuits are preferred instead for their relative simplicity and improved load balancing</p>

"Using a 30-amp tandem circuit breaker for a 120/240v circuit?","74995","","<p>I inherited a main panel box from a homeowner that wasn't always fond of meeting the required NEC codes.  As such, there are some oddities in the panel.  One such oddity is the fact that he installed a couple of tandem circuit breakers for use in 120/240 circuits.</p>

<p>Specifically, there are two Murray MH-T 30-amp breakers.  These are tandem breakers and not ""slimline"" or ""thin"" breakers -- the two breaker switches on each are not connected in any way.  One of these breakers is used for the clothes dryer and the other for an electric water heater.</p>

<p>In the case of the dryer circuit, there's one 10/3 NM wire, with the hot black attached to one of the sides of the tandem breaker and the hot red attached to the other side.  The neutral is connected to the neutral bar.  In the water heater case, there's a 10/2, with both the white and black attached to their respective sides of the tandem breaker.</p>

<p>I want to stress that this absolutely is working.  Both the dryer and water heater were wired this way well before I moved in and it's only now, years later, that I noticed what was going on.  It's worked fine all along.</p>

<p>This seems all sorts of wrong, though.  It's still a single pole breaker, even if there are two 120v circuits coming off it.  It seems like if this was okay, that I'd hear about using a tandem breaker as a space-saving slim 220v breaker... but I've seem nothing.</p>

<p>So, what's wrong with doing this?  What's the ramifications if I don't change these two out with traditional double-pole breakers?</p>

<p>EDIT: Added photo of the breakers in question: <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ivgZF.jpg"" alt=""suspect breakers""></p>

<p>The very top is a double-pole 20-amp breaker that's fine.  The first 30-amp tandem is the dryer breaker and the second is the water heater.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: Added photo of the dryer breaker popped off the panel: <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ROldn.jpg"" alt=""Showing the buses""></p>

<p>You can clearly see the two buses and that there doesn't appear to be any shenanigans connecting the two of them.  I removed the top double-pole breaker for clarity.  The popped dryer breaker is clearly a single pole, as you can see the <em>one</em> entry slot.  It's apparently connected to the left bus and only that bus.</p>
","<p>It sounds like you may be mistaken as to how this is wired, or that perhaps I'm just not understanding your explanation. As others have mentioned, it's not possible to get 240 volts from a single pole in a 120/240V split phase system.  Each tandem breaker provides 2 120 V circuits, this is true. However, if you measure between the terminals on a single tandem breaker, you'll get 0 volts.  This is because the terminals are both powered from the same leg, and so are at the same voltage potential. If you measure from a terminal on the top tandem breaker to a terminal on the bottom one, then you'll measure 240 volts. This is because each breaker is connected to a different leg, which are each one half of a 240 volt circuit.</p>

<p>With all that said. For this setup to work, one appliance would have to be connected to both breaker. Something like this...</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AW61Y.jpg"" alt=""Labeled Breakers""> </p>

<p>Notice that each appliance circuit has one wire connected to each of the tandem breakers. In this situation, you'd need a device like Speedy Petey shows.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/p304Y.jpg"" alt=""common trip device""></p>

<p>Which ties the breaker handles together, to provide common trip characteristics.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/A9CJW.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Notice how the inner handles are tied together, and that the outer handles are also tied to each other. This way if either trip (or are turned off by the user), the entire circuit is shut off. </p>

<hr>

<p>If this is wired the way you've explained, where the dryer is connected to the top tandem and the heater is connected to the bottom. Then there's some magic going on in those breakers.</p>

<h1>Ignition Problems:</h1>

<h2>Vacuum Switch Not Closing</h2>

<p>In a high efficiency furnace, if the vacuum switch does not close after a certain timeout. The furnace will shut down, then possibly retry a few times depending on model.  If after a given number of tries the switch still does not close, the furnace will enter lock out. Once in lock out, the furnace has to be manually reset (depending on model). </p>

<p>The vacuum switch will look something like this...</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JuyoF.jpg"" alt=""Vacuum switch""></p>

<p>And will have a rubber tube connecting it to the draft inducer. This part cannot be repaired, and must be replaced if it's faulty.  </p>

<h2>Pilot Not Igniting</h2>

<p>If the pilot does not light, you'll first want to check to make sure there is something trying to ignite it.  Typically a spark or glow ignitor is used, so first you'll want to determine which is being used.</p>

<h3>Glow Ignitor</h3>

<p>A glow ignitor looks similar to this, though may not be visible without further disassembly.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/m3OVd.jpg"" alt=""Glow ignitor""></p>

<p>It works by passing a current through it, causing it to heat up and glow. It should heat up enough to ignite the pilot gas. If it doesn't heat up, it should be replaced.</p>

<h3>Spark Ignitor</h3>

<p>A spark ignitor looks like this.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KugBz.jpg"" alt=""Spark Ignitor""></p>

<p>Take notice of the thick, often orange or red wire that is typically used to connect the ignitor to the ignition control module.  This device works by generating an electrical arc between the two probes, causing the pilot gas to ignite.  If there is no spark, you'll have to replace the ignition control module and/or the ignitor itself.  If the <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/q/32529/33"">ignitor is not igniting the gas</a>, but there is a spark. You can try cleaning the electrodes with fine steel wool, to remove any carbon buildup. </p>

<h2>Pilot Not Proving</h2>

<p>For a pilot to ""prove"", it simply means that the flame sensor has sensed the pilot flame.  If there is no pilot or the sensor doesn't detect it, the furnace will often purge the system and then try again. Furnaces will often try a set number of times, before entering lock out.</p>

<p>If you can see the pilot flame, but the sensor is not detecting it. Try gently cleaning the sensor with fine steel wool, to remove any built up carbon. Also make sure the sensor is in the proper location with respect to the flame (Check the owners manual for proper placement), and adjust as necessary.  If that doesn't work, replace the sensor.</p>

<h2>Main Burner Not Proving</h2>

<p>If the main burner ignites, but the furnace shuts down before the blower starts.  You'll want to check the main flame (or rollout, high limit, etc) sensor(s).  If your furnace has error code indicators, check those and compare to the owners manual for translation.  In this case, you'll want to test and/or replace each sensor and/or contact an HVAC technician </p>

"How can I fix a garage door motor that runs but doesn't move the chain?","74347","","<p>I have a Craftsman 1/2 HP garage door opener. It's always been a little finicky, but tonight it stopped working. In the middle of going up as tonight, the door halted, leaving a gap between the door and the ground. I got out of the car, squeezed under the door and realized the motor was still running. My wife pushed the door opener a few more times, but the door wouldn't move despite the motor responding. I pulled the release on the door and opened it all the way. I realized parking the car in the garage would be a hassle, since I would have the open the door manually again. So I just closed the garage with the chain disengaged.</p>

<p>The motor will start and stop in response to button pushes like it is supposed to - normally the first push starts it in one direction, the 2nd reverses the direction and the 3rd will stop the motor. However, the chain has completely stopped moving (and by extension, so has the door). This causes the motor to run for an extensive period of time before it seems to timeout and give up. The chain and door connector assembly haven't budged since.</p>

<p>I've not worked on garage doors before, but I have a degree in Computer/Electrical Engineering. I've never studied to be an electrician or anything, so I'm well aware there are a lot of things I don't know about this. But generally speaking, is this the type of thing I could potentially fix myself? Or is it more likely the whole unit is shot and I should just call a repairman up front?</p>

<p>I know I have the manual around here somewhere, I'll keep looking for it and list exact part numbers if I find it.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I popped the sprocket protector off just like in the video form Steven's answer and the chain is still firmly attached. When the motor is running, you can clearly see the shaft and sprocket are not moving at all, not even jerking when starting or stopping, like something had locked up the shaft.</p>
","<p>I ended up having to have this replaced. I got a repairman out on a 'free housecall' who quoted me a price for the parts &amp; labor. The price was less than a replacement, but the fellow warned me no one would warranty a repair on a 15 year old unit beyond 30 or 60 days. The unit originally had a 10 year warranty and was installed in 1999 (<a href=""http://www.craftsman.com/cswarranty/nb-100000000227082#point27"" rel=""nofollow"">Craftsman garage door opener warranty page</a>, for reference).</p>

<p>It's possible that the fellow really needed to sell a unit and was underselling the feasibility of the repair. But I'll never know because I sprang for a replacement unit with a lifetime warranty through both the installation company and the manufacturer.</p>

","<p>You can use a few methods.</p>

<p>I would recommend using fibre glass firstly and then maybe some sort of epoxy /putty.</p>

<p><strong>FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT</strong></p>

<p>You will need to clean the areas that you are going to work with. And i do not mean like wipe with a tissue. </p>

<ul>
<li>I mean take some sand paper and lightly scratch the surfaces so it scores it to give better grip to the adhesive.</li>
<li>You can do the same around the steel pipes you want to bond, but you will have to be more vigorous in making scratches in the metal.. this will help very much in bonding! It will not stick to flat surface very well.</li>
<li>Try to work with gloves and avoid touching the area you are working with. Your fingers leave oily substance and can cause the bond to be weak.</li>
<li>Using a clean cloth, spirits /alcohol  (cannot be oily) clean the and blow out any dust residue, any particles from sanding, and wipe it clean with alcohol  /spirits before you start to apply any methods.</li>
<li>Make sure that during the cleaning and curing (drying period of at least 48hours) there is no water leaking in the affected area.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fibreglass</strong></p>

<p>You can buy fibre glass sheets pretty cheap, they are used in the boating industry, car body shops and some building supplies.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vv8OW.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You will now clean the are and apply the fibre glass sheets in single layers, fold and mould them to the shape you desire.
During this process you will apply resin (it is very sticky so use gloves again) and dont be shy.. use plenty of it per layer.. let it dry a bit, come back and add another layer and expand over the bottom one. Maximise surface area.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/24PKH.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wYedJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Here is an example on PVC pipe, patching up a leak. ON a steel pipe you need to wind it wider out to maximise the bonding surface, especially if its under pressure.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9KP5p.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Epoxy / Putty</strong></p>

<p>Using a strong putty, usual called steel putty, or putty with steel, you will mix 2 compounds, or some tubs are air activated. So open them take what you need and close it.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yEpzi.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yf2z0.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You will mould the putty to the area you need.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uyrOc.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>And you let it dry for the recommended period of time.</p>

<p><strong>Pros / Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Because you are working with two different materials it is difficult to bond them. They both expand/contract in different ways and do not bond in the same way. Using either of the methods maximise the bonding effect.. while taking into consideration differential surface tension.</p>

<ul>
<li>These methods will bond and seal the two parts.. so if you ever need to get access to the pipes, maintenance  or disassembly, you will most likely have to cut the steel pipe off with a grinder after the bondage leaving ample space for a connector later on.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>It is possible that areas around the new bond might start to take the extra ware and tare.. monitor this and apply more fibre glass in areas that look like that might start to fail.</p></li>

"What type of tile should I install in a bath/shower surround?","73408","","<p>I am about to remodel our bathroom. Currently the tub/shower is all tiled but the backing is not secure/stable so there is cracking in the grout and I know water is getting behind. I prefer the look of tile over the plastic surrounds and we have a window in the shower that is current tiled over but I would like to expose it again.</p>

<p>I have not done tiling before so I am just starting my research and I am looking for some advice regarding the type of tile to use. Budget is flexible but I am not real interested in the ""glamour bath look"" of marble and granite as I don't think it will match the rest of the house.</p>

<p>What are the pros/cons of ceramic and porcelain tile? How about other alternatives (slate, etc.)? Do I need to use anything special on the flat horizontal surfaces at the window sill (that is in the shower) or any shelves I build into the shower wall?</p>
","<p>If your tile is not secure, then the backer is not secure either. You will need to gut it to the studs and install water proof membrane, concrete board or heavy hardy-backer to tile over. The window frame must also be carefully water-proofed as well and trimmed out with a moisture resistant material. Get some professional advise on this one, a new tile job is not cheap or easy and be a shame to have a leaky, grout dropping job when you're done.</p>

<p>As far as the type of tile, ceramic or porcelain are similar products, difference being the hardness grade and the type of glazing. Porcelain is always a better choice in my view as the surface glaze is smoother, easier to keep clean and usually a harder grade.(3 to 7) prices can vary wildly, usually again because of the glazing and hardness factors. Designer patterns also effect the cost as well. </p>

"What exactly is a PAR type LED lamp, how does it differ from R/BR type LED & CFL lamps?","72265","","<p>I am in the process of replacing my incandescent bulbs with more efficient alternatives. My home is about 14 years old, I've owned it for a little over three years. It seems most of the bulbs that it ""came with"" are original, and since I purchased the house almost every tungsten bulb in a built-in fixture ended up burning out. In particular were the R40 ceiling floods, of which I have 16 in total in the interior. I'd ignored many of them, as I rarely turned most of them on, however when three in my kitchen burned out within a weeks period, I up and replaced the whole lot with EcoSmart (made by Lighting Science) R30 CFL's that offer around 800 lumens.</p>

<p>The initial difference was HUGE. The 14 year old bulbs were extremely dim and VERY orange in color. The CFLs, when fully warmed up, are very nice and bright. I chose cooler colors (3500k and 5000k) which light the place much more naturally (at least to my eyes). The caveat with CFL, as I am learning, is they do not perform well in cooler temperatures. I try to use my heater as little as possible in the winter, generally only heating when the interior temperature drops below 60-64 degrees. All of the CFL R30s I purchased have a common problem, which seems to be common across brands as I've tried TCP, Phillips, and others: Very long warmup time, very low lumens during warmup, and an extreme magenta hue during warmup. The bulbs also do not seem to reach full brightness, and the way the reflectors are designed, the shape of the spiral inside the R30 ""can"" is clearly visible and appears rather dark.</p>

<p>I've decided to switch to LED, despite the cost. In trying out a few from the local store, they seem far superior to CFL. They start instantly, always produce the same color, are fully dimmable (and seem to dim smoothly unlike CFL), and don't seem to be affected by temperature. I've only ever used R or BR type, however all of the ones at the local store in the color temperatures I prefer are PAR type. The BR type LED floods seem to produce similar quality and diffused light to the CFL's, but the only color I can find are 2700K. What exactly is the difference between an R/BR type flood and a PAR type flood? Additionally, what are the differences between PAR30, PAR38, etc? Are PAR type good for indoor use (in the past, I'd only ever seen a few mentions that PAR type were required for outdoor scenarios, indicating they were better sealed against weather)?</p>
","<p>Due to the lack of adequate answers, I decided to research the differences myself and provide an answer to the benefit of the community. </p>

<p><strong>PAR Type Lamps</strong></p>

<p>From a build quality and light control standpoint, PAR type lamps are generally considered superior. The explicit parabolic nature of the reflector means light is more <em>precisely reflected</em> directly out of the bulb cavity, with less dispersion, than an R or BR type lens. PAR type lamps, thanks to the design of the lens in front of the actual light emitting element (which is usually a given with home lighting...PAR in general can referr to a very wide variety of lighting which may or may not have a front lens, including high powered stage lighting). The lens is often fresnel in nature, are often additionally capable of focusing the more accurately reflected light into a brighter, narrower spot. The fact that they have a more precisely crafted lens means they are capable of being designed to emit beams of varying angular degrees wide (anywhere from 12° to 70°), with high intensity narrow beams or more diffuse wider beams, makes them highly flexible.</p>

<p>PAR type lamps are also frequently designed in such a way that makes them viable for outdoor use. Not all PAR type lamps are properly sealed for use in humid climates or areas where rain or other water could intrude upon the bulb, but many PAR type lamps are. This is a key difference between PAR and R or BR type lamps.</p>

<p>In terms of nomenclature, PAR lamps are usually designated with a number. The number of a PAR lamp, such as PAR38, gives the diameter of the lamp in inches. In the case of a PAR38, the diameter would be 4.75"" (4 3/4""), or <em>""thirty eight eighths of an inch.""</em> Common PAR lamp sizes for home are PAR20, PAR30, PAR38, with the latter being most common.</p>

<p><strong>R Type Lamps</strong></p>

<p>One of the more common types of flood light lamps for use indoors, the R-type lamp is a more cheaply constructed ""reflector"" type lamp. They are not particularly efficient in any key respect, their design is roughly defined and there are no strict rules or guidelines regarding the reflector. As such, R-type lamps generally produce a highly diffuse light with a broad angle.</p>

<p>They use a similar nomenclature as PAR type bulbs. For example, an R40 is a bulb 40/8ths of an inch in diameter, or 5"". The two most common R-type lamp sizes are R40 and R30.</p>

<p><strong>BR Type Lamps</strong></p>

<p>Preceding the CFL and LED age of high efficiency lighting, the BR-type lamp was an attempt to produce a more efficient indoor-use only replacement for R-type lamps. Standing for ""bulbous reflector"", the design of a BR-type lamp is more strict. The reflector is designed in such a way as to more efficiently reflect light. They still produce fairly soft, diffuse light, however it is reflected in a narrower beam, thus more efficiently utilizing light produced by the internal emitter (filament, LED, or CFL spiral.)</p>

<p>They too use the same eighth-inch nomenclature as PAR and R type lamps. The most common sizes are BR40 and BR30.</p>

<p><strong>CFL and LED R, BR, and PAR type lamps</strong></p>

<p>While the core design of these types of lamps was implemented in the days of tungsten-filament (incandescent and halogen) bulbs, the design is still used for CFL and LED lamps. In the case of CFLs, the actual reflector efficiency is likely suspect (at least in the case of a PAR type lamp), as the design of a PAR lamp, and thus it's efficiency in utilizing light, is dependent on the size and location of the internal emitters. CFL spirals are usually used in CFL-based flood lamps, and CFL spirals are a very different kind of emitter than a filament or LED. LED based flood lamps probably resemble classic filament based flood lamps better than CFLs do. </p>

<p><strong>LED and CFL Light Quality</strong></p>

<p>In some experimentation of my own, LED-based PAR type lamps definitely seem to direct a far greater quantity of their light downward, where as CFL spiral-based lamps still generally produce a more diffused output. Depending on the type of lens in front of the emitter, the quality and shape of the projected light for both CFL and LED PAR type lamps can vary greatly, from caustic refraction to fairly diffuse. CFL R/BR type lamps nicely simulate their incandescent predecessors. LED R/BR type lamps do not seem to diffuse quite as well as CFLs, so if you are looking for diffuse flood lighting, CFL generally has a more pleasing diffusion. </p>

<p>LED PAR lamps definitely produce a greater amount of directed illumination, so if you need to brightly light anything, LED is probably the best choice. LED flood lamps are also usually fully dimmable, ""instant"" on (sometimes ""instant"" really means up to a half-second delay before light is actually emitted), and produce far greater consistency of color (CFL color consistency is often rather poor, and during cooler or cold days, CFL floods will frequently brighten, dim to a deep magenta, then slowly normalize as they warm). LED lamps, of all designs, are usually fully dimmable these days as well. Dimmable LED flood lamps are usually dimmable down to 10% illumination, with some from the better manufacturers (such as Lighting Science) often dimmable down to 5%. Dimming quality, smoothness, minimum output and consistency is vastly superior on LED compared to CFL, with no flicker, popping, blinking, or inconsistent dropout as is frequent with dimmable CFL lamps.</p>

<p>In terms of the quality of projected light, BR-type CFL lamps definitely produce a smoothly diffuse light with little visible pattern directly underneath each bulb. PAR type lamps, either CFL or LED, but more so in the case of LED, produce visible refraction patterns under each bulb. I believe this has a lot to do with the design of the lens, and when multiple flood lamps are used along a hall or in a kitchen, diffusion improves. LED PAR type lamps can be very bright, which is nice when you need light. </p>

<p><strong>My Choice and Recommendation</strong></p>

<p>I have chosen to refurnish my kitchen, and eventually my hallways, with Lighting Science 5000k and 3000k (or possibly 4000k) Dimmable PAR38 LED lamps. These puppies are about $34 each, however they have twice the lifetime rating of comparable lamps from all other manufacturers (50,000 hours @ 6hrs per day vs. 25,000 hours @3-6hrs per day). The light is not as diffuse as your standard R-type incandescent, but the color quality is far superior for those who have never much liked the deep orange color of a classic incandescent (the 3000k versions are closer to a halogen in color, and the 5000k produce a nice, clean, crisp neutral white.)</p>

<p>For the highest quality, I recommend the following. Since LED lamps are dimmable, it is recommended to use a dimming switch wherever you use high lumen LED PAR lamps (i.e. 800 lumen or brighter). Personally I use Lutron HED-certified digital dimmers with dimming setting memory. One push of the button and the lights fade up over about a 1.5 seconds to your pre-set brightness level. Another push of the button, and the lights fade to minimum brightness then off over several seconds. With 800 lumen bulbs, setting a Lutron digital dimmer one or two notches down from maximum brightness produces very pleasing illumination, with the added bonus that if you need more light, or wish to add light during the daytime to fully illuminate areas that might generally be in shadow, you have the ability to crank up the illumination beyond that pleasing level. </p>

"How to set metal fence posts?","72242","","<p>I am getting ready to build a 6' tall 80' long wooden fence, but instead of 4x4 wooden posts I am going to use metal fence posts. The fence will have 1 walk through gate and a larger gate that can be driven through. It will be attached to another fence on either side (one is sturdy, and another well is not so sturdy and I will probably replace it within a year). I think I remember reading before that I should put gravel at the bottom of the hole of each post to allow water to drain from the post.</p>

<p>I want to make sure the new fence I put up is done right, and that it will hold over time.
So how deep should I set the metal posts, and if I should put gravel at the bottom of the hole, how much?</p>
","<p>How tall are your posts to start with?  A 6 foot above ground post should have at least 2 feet in the ground in your area.  I would be setting them in concrete so you have a good solid base and good ballast. A metal post in concrete won't rust as long as you dome the top of the concrete so water runs away from the post.  </p>

<p>I'll share a clever trick that works well and is very fast.  After digging your hole for the post, set one or two bricks in the bottom of the hole to set your post on. You will of course have to adjust for height and plumb the post. Then simply pour an 80 pound bag of Sacrete premixed concrete mix around the post dry, right from the bag.  Now just pour apx 2 gallons of water on top of the mix and leave it alone for 24 hours.  You will have a solid concrete base for your posts without having to mix concrete.  Mixing concrete is good, even better, but this little trick is fast and easy.</p>

"When painting a house exterior, do you need to scrape and sand the entire house or just the peeling parts?","72000","","<p>I'm repainting my house and everything I've read on the subject suggests scraping the old paint before applying new, but it isn't clear if you're only supposed to scrape just the peeling parts or the entire house.  My wife thinks I'm crazy for planning to scrape and sand the entire house, and after more than 6 hours of work and probably less than 1/3 of the house scraped and sanded, I'm starting to think she might be right.</p>

<p>On the one hand, there are some areas where the paint looked more or less okay but it's coming off, but on the other hand, not much paint is coming off in most areas.  Do I really need to scrape the entire house, or just the areas which are peeling?</p>
","<p>In my experience in painting my own house over 50 years I only sand when necessary, that is when the paint is loose, or, the surface is glossy. I just repainted some trim on my house that has Semi-Gloss paint. And, I sanded it first. I did this to improve the adhesion of the new paint. But, most of my house has flat paint, and I never sand it unless I'm blending an area where I had to remove some loose paint.</p>

<p>Update, 11/14/13: I re-read this today, including all the posts. It's interesting to see the different opinions about this subject. No wonder you had a question after searching the net.</p>

<p>My take on this is that if you are a perfectionist, you'll decide to remove it all. If you're just painting to resell, you'll scrape the loose off and paint. If you're going to keep it and use common sense, you'll scrape, sand where you need to feather edges for aesthetics, and paint. That's assuming its flat paint. For glossy finishes, you really better sand it to ensure the new paint sticks permanently. Incidentally, I always clean before scraping with Tide and bleach solution and brush hooked to expandable pole, and sometimes with a power washer to quickly knock off loose paint. Also, after sanding, I blow off the sanded surfaces with a blower, or brush it with a big paintbrush, or wipe it with rubbing alcohol or water.</p>

<p>Recently I used the tool below to ""sand"" the loose paint off my deck before repainting and was very impressed with it's efficiency. I like how it gets down into the cracks between the paint and wood and smooths out the ridges, as well as how quickly its use is. You might want to pick one of these up and give it a try.</p>

<p>Finally, one last tip. You can always do a test by painting a small area, waiting several days, then trying to scrape it off. That's how I learned how important sanding is for glossy paint.<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tt4a7.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>only the green (ground) cable is colored.</p>

<p>Does this mean that when I connect the cord to the appliance, the black and white wires are in fact interchangeable?</p>

<p>Is this because it is AC?</p>
","<p>Look for another identifier besides color such as a <strong>stripe</strong> or <strong>rib</strong> on one of the two other wires. That will be the <strong>Neutral</strong> wire. Make sure it connects to the <strong>Wide</strong> blade on the plug.</p>

<p><em>Is this because it is AC?</em> No, if it isn't so identified, you are dealing with a cheap knockoff pigtail that probably belongs in the waste bin. In the 120V single phase world, Neutral is effectively at ground potential, therefore if you touch it, you shouldn't get shocked. Hot while alternating isn't at ground potential and so the voltage is alternating between +120V and -120V (RMS, actual voltage peak ±170V), making you the conductor if you connect the hot wire to the dishwasher chassis and you touch it and ground. If the neutral connects to ground in the dishwasher, you've just connected up a dead short.</p>

<p>As this is for a dishwasher, neutral must connect to neutral and hot to hot, any mess-up here is going to be ugly. The only other method is to use an ohmmeter to trace which wire is attached to which blade. Normally narrow blade hot, wide blade neutral and ground pin to ground. If there is no difference in blade widths, then use the socket chart below to figure out which blade is Hot and Neutral from its position and attach the wire to the appropriate terminal in the appliance.</p>

<p>There is only one instance where the connections could be considered even remotely ""interchangeable"" and that is on a double insulated device where neutral is totally and completely isolated from ground.</p>

"Why does the shower get cold when I flush, and how can I prevent it?","71360","","<p>When the shower is running and someone flushes a toilet, why does the shower get cold (or sometimes hot) in some houses, but not others?</p>

<p>More importantly, would fixing that require replacing the water heater, or re-doing the piping in the entire house?  Or is there some cheap/easy way to fix it?</p>
","<h1>Why you get burned</h1>

<p>One of the most common plumbing configurations, is a trunk and branch system.  This is where a larger diameter pipe runs from one end of the building to the other, and smaller diameter pipes branch off to supply rooms or individual fixtures. If any of the branches demands water (you flush the toilet), there is less water available to all the other branches. </p>

<p>Since the toilet only uses cold water, there is less cold water available to your shower when the toilet is filling.  This causes the water in the shower to be warmer, because there is less cold water mixing with the hot water.</p>

<h1>How to stay comfortable</h1>

<p>There are a few ways to reduce, or eliminate this burning feeling. Probably the cheapest, is to reduce the amount of water going to the toilet.</p>

<h2>Reducing toilet water</h2>

<p>You can reduce how quickly the toilet uses water, by simply closing the supply valve slightly.  This means the toilet will take longer to fill, but will reduce the temperature fluctuation in the shower.  Adjusting the supply valve can also have negative side affects, such as increased fill times, and noise.</p>

<p>You can also reduce the overall amount of water the toilet needs.  You can accomplish this by either buying a low flow toilet, or placing a brick, jug of water, or other object in the tank.  However, this method will reduce the amount of water available for each flush, so you may encounter difficulty clearing solids from the bowl.</p>

<h2>Smarter mixing</h2>

<p>Installing a new mixing valve in the shower, can reduce or eliminate the temperature fluctuations. Thermostatic mixing valves automatically balance the amount of hot and cold water being mixed, which will prevent drastic fluctuations in shower temperature. If the cold water flow is reduced (due to a toilet flush), the valve automatically adjusts the amount of hot water being mixed. This keeps the shower temperature more consistent, even when other fixtures are using water. </p>

<h2>Increasing available water</h2>

<p>Increasing the amount of water available in the system can alleviate the problem, but will likely require a major change to the plumbing.  </p>

<p>If you have a trunk and branch system, increasing the trunk pipe diameter and/or the branch pipe diameter (if the branch feeds the entire room) will increase the amount of water available to the fixtures.  </p>

<h2>Distributing water evenly</h2>

<p>A more drastic solution, would be to install a manifold with home runs.  This would likely require a major plumbing renovation, with almost all of the plumbing changed. </p>

<p>In this type of system, there is a central load balancing manifold.  Then for each fixture in the house, a dedicated pipe is run between the fixture and the manifold. </p>

<h1>Supply and Demand</h1>

<p>In the end, it's all about supply and demand.  If the demand is greater than the supply, you end up with a burnt butt. The only way to avoid uncomfortable showers is to reduce demand or increase supply.</p>

","<p>Installing hardwood flooring over concrete is generally not advisable for multiple reasons.  Two of these reasons are:  1) oftentimes the concrete is moisture permeable, which means that any solid wood floor installed directly to the floor will buckle irreversibly; 2) typically solid wood floors are nailed to the substrate, which is not an option with concrete.  One can install 1.5"" sleepers on top of the slab to provide this nailing substrate, but this affects significantly things like ceiling height, door height, countertop height, etc.  So this is generally not done as a remodel project unless you're remodeling the whole thing.  One thing I would recommend as a compromise is finding some way to seal the slab, say with an epoxy paint, and then gluing an engineered wood floor to it.</p>

","<p>I have done quite a few bathrooms from start to finish.  You don't always have to do things in a certain order but I can tell you generally how to do things the easiest.</p>

<ol>
<li>You start with your shower pan and/or tub in the bathroom.  These are specific sizes.  You don't want to have to find something that fits exactly what you need - unless you plan on making your own cement based pan.</li>
<li>Make sure framing fits your choice of tub/shower.  If not adjust/make walls.</li>

<li>Do exit plumbing and install tub/shower.</li>
<li>Make sure that you have bought vanity and any other fixed pieces (mirrors/medicine cabinets/whatever) for the bathroom at this point.  It is important to know the height of new vanity, height of backsplash pieces and other things so that electric/plumbing considerations can be taken.  For instance with taller vanity you might need to bump the GFCIs up a few inches too.  If you have a vanity with drawers sometimes your exit plumbing hangs to one side or your faucet water needs to come from the middle.  </li>

"How do I determine if a wall is load bearing?","70615","","<p>I'm considering removing a wall in my master bathroom but I can't tell if it is a load bearing wall or not. I've done a fair amount of research. I don't have the house blueprints, and it's difficult to get above this area in the attic. The house was built in 2007. The joists are East and West, parallel with this wall. I felt pretty confident removing this wall until I cut a small hole for further examination and found several stacked two by fours at the top. Is it common to do this on non load bearing walls or am I right to be concerned? Here is a picture for reference:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rqozyl.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I removed some more drywall and checked in the attic. Here you can see there is a brace resting on a 2x6(?). I've never moved something like that before. Are there DIY options to continue with this project, or should I abandon hope?</p>

","<p>OK normally load bearing walls will have 2 plates on top.  But having 2 plates means nothing.  </p>

<p>People frame however they learned to or want.  Checking door header also means nothing.  Some people flip all door headers - doesn't make the wall load bearing.  You can never get into the head of the guy who framed your house.  I worked for a construction company in college... the owner taught everyone to basically frame every wall like it was load bearing - 2 top plates and headers flipped was a minimum.  I asked him one day why we were doing this and he basically said - Well it might cost an extra $10 on some walls but we never have to worry or redo anything.  </p>

<p>You told me this wall goes in same direction as attic joists...  That is a good sign.  You need to get into the attic and see what it is attached to.  If it isn't supporting a joist it isn't load bearing.  If this wall is just floating between 2 joists - even with a few 2x4s for cross bracing - it is not load bearing.  </p>

<p>However if there is structural bracing in the attic it is/could be load bearing.  Or if it is directly under a joist.  </p>

<p>You have two choices to figure this out.  Get up in the attic or tear down enough drywall to figure out what you have.  If you are a gambler and want this wall down just tear out the drywall - you will have to remove it to the joist on each side to redrywall anyway.  </p>

"How do weather conditions affect pouring a concrete foundation?","70564","","<p>I'd like to understand how weather conditions affect pouring a concrete foundation.  </p>

<p>Are there concerns about pouring a foundation during cold, snowy, rainy, or otherwise inclement weather?  Is it safe to do so, and can it affect the longevity of the concrete?  Are there other considerations?  Extra cost?</p>

<p>What precautions should I request in a contract to ensure the foundation is poured effectively?  Are there tests that can be performed prior to pouring and/or temperature limits that should be maintained?</p>
","<p>Reportedly, it costs substantially more to pour a foundation because of additives and other precautions used to keep the concrete from freezing. </p>

<p><a href=""http://construction.about.com/od/Specifications/a/Cold-Weather-Concrete-Tips-To-Pour-Concrete-In-Cold-Weather.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">This page</a> lists extensive guidelines and recommendations from the American Concrete Institute.   </p>

<ul>
<li>Never pour concrete on frozen ground, snow, or ice.</li>
<li>Concrete in cold weather is recommended to have low slump, and minimal water to cement ratio, to reduce bleeding and decreases setting time.</li>
<li>Use insulation blankets or heated enclosures to maintain concrete temperatures above 50° degrees Fahrenheit for three to seven days.  Maintain the concrete temperature above 40° degrees Fahrenheit for at least four more days after the use of the insulation blankets or heated enclosures.</li>
<li>Fresh concrete frozen during the first 24 hours can lose 50% of its
potential 28 day strength.</li>
<li>Keep concrete warm, over 5 degrees Celsius, for the first 48 hours, where concrete strength development is critical. When concrete is being placed below 5 degrees, but is not below freezing point, concrete will take longer to develop the required strength. Note that removing formwork when concrete is too cold or hasn’t reached desired strength, could damage concrete strength and surfaces and concrete might collapse.</li>
<li>Concrete in cold weather is recommended to have low slump, and minimal water to cement ratio, to reduce bleeding and decreases setting time.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""http://www.jonestownship.com/permits/cold_weather_concrete_pours.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">This page</a> also offers a number of other useful considerations, effects, and construction guidelines during cold weather including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chlorine-based additives can have a corrosive effect on metal re-bar
and shouldn't be used.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""http://www.bobvila.com/posts/38313-pouring-a-foundation-during-the-winter"" rel=""nofollow"">This thread</a> contains a lot of good information about pouring foundations in cold winter weather.</p>

<p>Other notable points from Glenn Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is recommended to keep concrete above 40 degrees. With the proper
  insulation covering all areas exposed to the cold it will maintain
  this temperature in most cases. Keep in mind that this insulation must
  extend below the frost line as well. Rigid polystyrene foam insulation
  board can be used below the grade and left in place. The warmer the
  weather the less insulation required.</p>
  
  <p>You may also want to try to keep track of is the amount of water in
  the concrete and the time it is poured. Concrete should be placed
  within 1 hour after it leaves the plant. The ""slump"" test is used to
  determine the amount of liquid in the concrete. Concrete should not be
  poured over a 4"" slump. The lower the slump the less water in the mix
  and the stronger the concrete will be. Excess amounts of water cause
  the concrete to shrink more as it cures and as a result stress cracks
  will begin to form and weaken it.</p>
  
  <p>Another item I should mention is the addition of calcium to the mix.
  This is often used in cold weather pours to accelerate the curing time
  and prevent freezing. The one major draw back with using calcium (and
  many other accelerators) is they have a tendency to deteriorate or
  oxidize (rust) the reinforcing steel that is used in the concrete.
  Chances are you will have steel rebar in your foundation and I would
  advise you do not permit the use of accelerators in the concrete mix.
  This will mean they will HAVE to use insulation to protect the
  concrete from freezing but you will get a stronger product that will
  last longer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.foundationsakc.com/process/concrete-construction"" rel=""nofollow"">This site</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Temperature extremes make it difficult to properly cure concrete. On
  hot days, newly placed concrete losses too much water through
  evaporation. If the temperature drops too close to freezing, hydration
  slows to nearly a standstill. Under these conditions, concrete ceases
  to gain strength and other desirable properties. In general, the
  temperature of new concrete should not be allowed to fall below 50°F
  (10°C) during the curing period.</p>
  
  <p>Cold weather concreting is a common and necessary practice; every cold
  weather application must be considered carefully to accommodate its
  unique requirements. The current American Concrete Institute
  definition of cold-weather concreting, as stated in ACI 306 is, “a
  period when for more than 3 successive days the average daily air
  temperature drops below 5°C (40°F) and stays below 10°C (50°F) for
  more than one-half of any 24 hour period.” </p>
  
  <p>Rule number ONE is that ALL concrete must be protected from freezing
  until it has reached a minimum strength of 3.5MPa (500psi), which
  typically happens within the first 24 hours. In addition, whenever air
  temperature at the time of concrete placement is below 5°C (40°F) and
  freezing temperatures within the first 24 hours after placement are
  expected, the following general issues should be considered: </p>
  
  <p>(1) Adjustment of construction schedule regarding loads imposed on the
  new concrete structure </p>
  
  <p>(2) Placing and curing temperatures to produce
  quality concrete </p>
  
  <p>The exposure of concrete to cold weather will extend the time required
  for it to gain strength. In structures that will carry large loads at
  an early age, concrete must be maintained at a minimum of 10°C (50°F)
  to accommodate stripping of forms and shoring and to permit loading of
  the structure. In many cases, achieving the required durability will
  require a protection period of more than 24 hours. This may not be an
  issue with residential applications where applied loads are typically
  small and may be applied in small increments over several days or
  weeks. </p>
  
  <p>In no case should concrete be allowed to freeze during the first 24
  hours after it has been placed. Since cement hydration is an
  exothermic reaction, the concrete mixture produces some heat on its
  own. Protecting that heat from escaping the system may be all that is
  required for good concrete quality, while more severe temperatures may
  require supplemental heat.</p>

"Why does my toilet make a high pitched whine when it refills?","70358","","<p>When my toilet is refilling with water,it makes a very high pitched whine.  Any suggestions on how to resolve?</p>
","<p>Depending on the age of the toilet mechanism, you may have an easy fix. If it is a partially clogged valve (as suggested in the comment by <em>ratchet freak</em>) and if it is one of the newer type units, the upper part of the valve can be easily accessed.</p>

<p>Many toilet filler valves look something like <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/Fluidmaster-Universal-Fill-Valve-400ARP25/100554467#.UjX7OMaKIuc"" rel=""noreferrer"">this one</a></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zhp5n.jpg"" alt=""toilet valve""></p>

<p>The top cap comes off these valves, usually by pressing down slightly with your palm and rotating counterclockwise. Immediately below the cap is usualy a strainer filter that can get clogged. Cleaning this out usually solves the problem. Then you just reinstall the cap.</p>

<p>If you have a different type of valve, you need to ascertain whether that is where the noise is coming from. Witht he lid off the tank, you may be able to confirm the source of the sound. If it is the valve, you may be able to determine what part of the mechanism is causing the obstruction.</p>

<p>If the cause is the valve, but the cure is not readily apparent, it probably is worth changing the mechanism, which is cheap and fairly easily done. The repair kits have complete instructions and basically involve</p>

<ul>
<li>turning off the water supply</li>
<li>draining the tank</li>
<li>uncoupling the supply line from the bottom of the mechanism</li>
<li>unscrewing the nut that holds the mechanism on (from the outside bottom of the tank)</li>
<li>inserting the new mechanism in the hole and attaching the nut</li>
<li>reattaching the supply line</li>
<li>turning on the water supply</li>
<li>adjusting the max fill level</li>
</ul>

<p>Not too hard for even an amateur DIYer. Just be ready to quickly turn off the shutoff valve if there are any leaks (even a drop), and patiently redo any joints that are not absolutely watertight (the instructions will explain about teflon tape, etc.)</p>

<li>go back to the roller tray more often.  FWIW, I generally do four to five strokes with the roller between dunks, and do three overlapping sections over the height of the wall, so maybe 10-15 sq.ft. per dunk.</li>

"What is code for installing a dishwasher in the U.S.?","70218","","<p>I will be replacing my dishwasher and I am curious what is the current code for the wiring of the dishwasher.</p>
","<p>Assuming you're in the US (though I can't imagine it being much different elsewhere, but do check!) ...</p>

<p>Be sure to check the label, but most dishwashers run perfectly happy on a 15A circuit. If a dedicated circuit to the dishwasher isn't possible, you can come out of a general receptacle circuit that isn't otherwise utilized in the kitchen, depending on the rating of the dishwasher. What you want to avoid is a mixer and toaster <em>and</em> dishwasher using the same circuit at once. You may have to do some investigating. Go for the dedicated circuit if that's possible.</p>

<p>If the dishwasher has a cord and cap, you should have an <em>appliance receptacle</em> installed where it can be reached. An appliance receptacle is an outlet with only one place to plug something in. Since your dishwasher can not be on a GFCI circuit, this ensures that someone won't try to plug something else into the non-GFCI protected outlet while near ground potential (within six feet of anything wet, e.g the sink). Even if the plug is somewhat hidden or inaccessible, you want to be sure nothing else uses it. Be sure the receptacle is rated properly, they come in 15 and 20 amp varieties.</p>

<p>If the dishwasher has a place to just terminate a cable, purchase the appropriate connector for the type of cable you're using (likely ROMEX (non-metallic + bonded)) to go into the 1/2"" opening, secure the connector properly and make the connections using wire nuts.</p>

<p>Be kind to your future self, or anyone else that has to pull the dishwasher out in the future to service it by leaving enough cable to be able to pull it out and off to the side. Make sure the cable is secured properly wherever it is fed, and protected anywhere that it may be exposed on its path to the dishwasher. </p>

Unfortunately its right where the metal of the fireplace meets the wooden framing/molding of the fireplace on the inside. This seems like something I should be able to take care of. Its a rather sizable gap (maybe 3/4 of an inch). I didn't think I could caulk such a large gap. I wanted to use some kind of spray insulation such as ""Great Stuff"", but the label indicates that its flamable (not to mention highly toxic and needs to be covered). </p>

<p>What should I do to cover this gap and prevent air flow in a way that's safe and effective?</p>

<p>He suggested sealing the crack on the inside as the most cost effective way to improve the comfort in this room. When he came and used his IR camera, the spot on the floor next to this gap was in the 30's in temperature. </p>

<p>There's a gap between black slate(?) of fireplace and white wooden fireplace frame.</p>
","<p>I assume your gap is on the indoors side?</p>

<p>Regardless, if air is filtering through into the living space, there must be a gap outdoors ( external chimney) as well as indoors.</p>

<p>I recommend you check out the caulking along the chimney to the exterior siding as well as addressing the interior gap. Since this gap inside is directly adjacent to wood trim, I also have to assume that excessive heat is not a factor. Is the metal you are referring to an insert trim of some type?  A pic would be a big help here.</p>

<p>If the assumption are right and the gap is 3/4 inch wide, I would use a caulking backer in the gap before using a good grade painter's or acrylic caulk as a topper.  The caulking backer is a round foam solid tube that can be cut to length, inserted into the gap to seal it and hold the caulk. After the caulk has cured, it can be painted to match the trim. If for some reason you are concerned about high heat in this area, there is a fire rated caulk made especially for gaps in fire or common walls. Readily available at any box or hardware store from a number of manufactures.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ok after reading your comments, and learning that the black vertical sides are slate, I would still do similar to above. Perhaps after injecting larger amounts of fire rated caulk as deep into void as possible, then use the solid, tube style caulking backer to fill the majority of the larger, deeper gaps, followed by using some paint-able silicon/acrylic mix caulk.</p>

<p>Before you apply the finish caulk, run a nice straight line of painter's tape up the front of the slate even with the edge of the wood trim. When you fill over the foam backer with the caulk, use a small putty knife to draw the caulk smooth and flat. Immediately remove the tape while caulk is fresh. This should result in a nice crisp straight line.  Let the caulk cure for 24 hours. If there is some shrinking or cracks, no problem, simply repeat the process with new tape and another coat of caulk.</p>

<p>Alternately, you could also use a setting type drywall mud, such as durabond 30 or 45 to fill the deeper gaps etc. Then again use a second coat to create a smooth straight extension of the wood trim to the slate.</p>

<p>Either method will result in a neat, easy to paint fill that should stop your air infiltration problem and make the finish look nice.    </p>

I want to make sure this is not unsafe.</p>
","<p>Standing water in the bottom of the dish washer after a cleaning cycle is complete is NOT normal. After the wash/rinse cycle and the pump out your dishwasher not have water in it. </p>

<p>Standing water could be due to number of problems. I'll list out some of the things to check on.</p>

<p>1) There is a possibility that the filter screen in the bottom of your washer is mostly plugged up and not allowing the water to drain down into the pump. Clean it and try another wash.</p>

<p>2) Many dishwashers are installed with an air gap assembly at the kitchen counter level. These are designed to keep the sink drain from siphoning or draining back down into the dishwasher. Sometimes things from the dishwasher can get up into the air-gap and plug it and thus impeded the drainage of the dishwasher.</p>

<p>3) Your washer could be old and tired from washing countless loads of dishes. The pump unit in the bottom that drains the water out can sometimes fail and need replacement.</p>

<p>4) With some older style dishwashers that have the rotary timer knob it is possible that some electrical contacts in the timer mechanism get burned and make certain parts of the wash cycle not work correctly. This could be causing the drain pump to not be running when it is supposed to. Replacement of the timer would be the fix for this. </p>

","<p>You may have a deadlocking latch bolt, which in addition to a normal door latch has a plunger.

  <h3>II. 600 Volts, Nominal, or Less</h3>
  
  <p><strong>110.26 Spaces About Electrical Equipment.</strong> Sufficient access and working space shall be provided and maintained about all electrical
  equipment to permit ready and safe operation and maintenance of such
  equipment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>110.26(A)(1) Depth of Working Space.</strong><br>
This section says the depth of Working Space must be between 3 and 4 feet, ""<em>measured from the exposed live parts or from the enclosure or opening if the live parts are enclosed</em>"".  In a typical residential situation, the depth of Working Space will be 3'.</p>

<p><strong>110.26(A)(2) Width of Working Space.</strong><br>
This section says the width of Working Space must be the width of the equipment or 30"", whichever is greater. And that there should be enough Working Space to allow the equipment door to open 90 degrees.</p>

<p><strong>110.26(A)(3) Height of Working Space.</strong><br>
The Working Space must be clear from ""<em>the grade, floor, or platform</em>"" to the height of 6 1/2', or the height of the equipment whichever is greater. There is an exception to this which says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>In existing dwelling units, service equipment or panelboards that do not exceed 200 amperes shall be permitted in spaces where the headroom
  is less than 2.0 m (61⁄2 ft).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This section also says that any other equipment associated with the electrical installation""located above or below the equipment, cannot extend more than 6"" beyond the front of the equipment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>110.26(B) Clear Spaces.</strong> Working space required by this section shall not be used for storage. When normally enclosed live parts are
  exposed for inspection or servicing, the working space, if in a
  passageway or general open space, shall be suitably guarded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which means the equipment can be in an area used for storage, but the <strong>Working Space</strong> cannot be used for storage. The basic idea is if you draw a box on the floor in front of the equipment 30"" wide and 36"" deep, and then extend that box up 6 1/2', you'll have your ""Working Space"". As long as you keep this Working Space clear, you should have no problems.  However, there are a few more things to consider.</p>

<p><strong>110.26(C) Entrance to and Egress from Working Space.</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>110.26(C)(1) Minimum Required.</strong> At least one entrance of sufficient area shall be provided to give access to and egress from working space
  about electrical equipment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You'll have to check local building codes to determine what the ""<em>sufficient area</em>"" is, and then make sure you keep this area clear too. </p>

<p>Another important consideration is lighting.</p>

<p><strong>110.26(D) Illumination.</strong><br>
This is a section that is often overlooked in residential situations, and is often satisfied simply by having lights in the room where the service panel is installed.  Personally, I take this section seriously.  I recommend installing a dedicated circuit, consisting of a single switch and a single luminaire. Then installing it just above the equipment, as to provide adequate light for anybody working on the equipment.  Putting the luminaire on a dedicated circuit allows you to deenergize other circuits, while maintaining good lighting while servicing the equipment.</p>

<p>It's a good idea (though a bit overkill), to also provide emergency lighting near the equipment.  Installing a simple fixture like this near the equipment, ensures that you won't have to fumble in the dark to flip breakers if the power ever goes out.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rpa3z.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This unit can be installed on the same dedicated equipment luminaire circuit. That way even if you have to switch off the whole panel to do work, you'll still have light.</p>

<hr>

<h1>tl;dr</h1>

<ul>
<li>Keep an area 30"" wide, 36"" deep, and 6 1/2' high in front of the equipment clear (Working Space).</li>
<li>Provide ""<em>sufficient area</em>"" for entrance to and egress from the equipment (see local building codes to determine ""<em>sufficient area</em>"").</li>
<li>Make sure the area has enough lighting.</li>

"Can a ½ inch water pipe supply enough pressure for a shower head and body sprayers?","69242","","<p>I have a ½"" water supply feeding my shower currently.  We're currently doing a remodel and would like to install a shower system (shower head and three body sprayers).</p>

<p>Can I use the current supply to feed it?  Or would I need a larger supply for branching to two different sets of controls?  As a reference, we're considering the following <a href=""http://www.faucetdirect.com/delta-dryden-monitor-17-series-shower-system-with-thermostatic-trim-diverter-trim-diverter-rough-in-valve-and-3-body-sprays/p1957892"">system</a>.</p>

<p>For a little more detail, this shower is on the second floor with a 3/4 inch to ½ inch conversion in the crawlspace right before it goes up the wall to the shower.  And this ½ supply is solely dedicated to the shower.</p>
","<p>For copper pipe, hot (~50 C) water should only flow at approx 5 ft/second. Flow of less than one or two ft/sec can also be a problem. Based on the diameter of the pipe (1/2 in type L), 0.72 gpm flows at 1.0 ft/second, so this would suggest a maximum of 3.6 gpm for the pipe (assuming 5 ft/second). Also, you must worry about the pressure drop. Use table 6 of <a href=""http://www.copper.org/publications/pub_list/pdf/copper_tube_handbook.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">The copper Handbook</a>, at 5 gpm, the pressure loss is 0.161 psi/ft. Assuming your supply is 50 psi, and you need 35 psi to be delivered to the shower head, you can have a maximum pipe length of (50-35)/.161=93 ft. Figure 7 shows how fittings should be counted due to their larger pressure drop. A 90 degree fitting counts as one foot. Additionally, water pressure will decrease with elevation by approximately 0.433 psi/foot.</p>

<p>As long as you meet these two restrictions, you're fine. Since you need 4.5 gpm, and your pipe is likely less than 93 feet, things should work fine.</p>

"How to properly wire a ceiling light fixture?","68658","","<p>I rent an apartment and a tenant installed ceiling fan that was not well secured to the ceiling.  I removed the fan and attempted to re-install the original light fixture after he moved out.</p>

<p>I am having issues with the wiring.  There are 2 black wires and 2 white wires in the ceiling.  On the fixture itself there are 2 black wires and 2 white wires as well as a small ground wire.</p>

<p>I try to wire it white to white and black to black.  When I turn the power back on, the light switch is off but the light comes on.  If I turn the switch on it's blows the breaker?</p>

<p>Should I have 4 connections 2 x black to black and 2 x white to white or should I have two connections - all black together under 1 cap and all white together under 1 cap?</p>

<p>What am I missing?  How should this be properly wired?  Or is there something else going wrong (maybe an issue with the fixture)?</p>
","<p>The power (from the breaker) is likely at the light fixture.  When you hook black to black and white to white, the light is powered directly from the breaker. In this configuration, when you flip the switch <code>on</code> you create a short through the switch.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jT3uR.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>What you need to do is hook it up like this.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nIJ8Y.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Notice the white wire that runs between the switch and the light has a black stripe on it (in above image), that lets anybody that works on this light in the future know that the wire is switched. You can mark the wire using a bit of electrical tape, or a marker.</p>

<p>Figuring out which wires come from the breaker, and which go to the switch will require some tools.  First Turn off the breaker, and verify the power is off using a non-contact voltage tester.  Now pick one set of wires to work with first (one black and one white from the same cable). Turn the switch to the <code>on</code> position, and use a multimeter to check continuity between the two wires. If the wires are connected (low resistance), these are the switched wires. If not (infinite resistance), check the other set of wires. If neither pair pass the test, contact an electrician.</p>

<p>If at any time you don't feel comfortable doing this work, or you don't have the proper tools to complete the task. Contact a local licensed electrician.</p>

"How can I tell if a circuit breaker is worn out?","68480","","<p>I was installing a light and tripped the breaker (in retrospect, should have turned the breaker off before starting).  When I finished installing it I reset the breaker and tried the light switch.  The light still had a short, however, instead of the same breaker tripping it ended up tripping the main breaker.  </p>

<p>I disconnected the light, turned off all breakers, reset the main breaker, and turned the local breakers back on.  Everything is now humming along perfectly.  My current belief is that the local breaker must have been busted by the first short and failed to catch the second short.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does this diagnosis seem correct (broken local breaker)?</li>
<li>Does this mean I should have the main breaker replaced, could it be worn out now?</li>
<li>Is there any way to test breakers other than making a short?</li>
<li>Is it a good idea to replace breakers when buying a house (not a new one of course)?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Breakers are supposed to be good for a fairly large number of triggers, and they are supposed to fail open when they fail. Is there a chance that you were running at a heavier overall load when the second incident occurred? I'm thinking that if you were say within 10 amps of max on the main breaker just due to normal load (air conditioners, perhaps?), and caused a short on the secondary (a 15 amp circuit, perhaps), you might have triggered the main to trip first by simply overloading it, before the secondary could draw enough to trip.</p>

<p>If you really think the secondary might be bad, then by all means replace it, but no, you don't have to replace the main just because it tripped. As long as it feels normal when you move it back into position (flip some other breakers to see how they feel - there shouldn't be any slop in the movement), you'll be fine. </p>

<p>The last several times I've seen breakers fail they've all failed open.</p>

"Can I replace this receptacle that has four wires connected to it?","68397","","<p>I'm in the process of replacing all of the electrical outlets in our kitchen to match the color of a new backsplash. Three of them were straightforward. The fourth and fifth, however, were wired differently. Everything I've read talks about two wires plus a ground per outlet. The two remaining outlets, however, have two white, two black and a ground. They look like this. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ipqjh.jpg"" alt=""Four wire outlet to be replaced""></p>

<p>My question is whether I should have any special concerns about patching them into, respectively, a) a basic outlet similar to the one picture above or b) a new outlet that also contains two USB charging ports. The latter uses wire nuts rather than the normal screw in type (see below). </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dniBb.jpg"" alt=""New USB charging outlet""></p>

<p>I can easily wire the new basic outlet as the one it's replacing, pictured above. But I'm not sure if I should. Nor am I sure that I should wire three wires per wirenut for the second outlet pictured.</p>

<p>Anybody have any thoughts? </p>
","<p>There should be no problem doing what you want. </p>

<p>One set of conductors brings power from an upstream device or outlet, while the other takes power to a downstream device or outlet. The two black conductors are electrically bonded through the receptacle, as are the two white conductors.  You'll notice that the bonding tab on the side of the receptacle is still in place, which means that the two receptacles are connected together.</p>

<h1>Replacing with a similar receptacle</h1>

<p>If you're simply replacing the existing receptacle, with an identical (or similar) receptacle of a different color.  Simply connect the new receptacle exactly as the original is connected.</p>

<ol>
<li>Disconnect the power by switching off the breaker, or removing the fuse.</li>
<li>Connect the bare grounding conductor to the green grounding screw terminal.</li>
<li>Connect the two white conductors to the silver colored screw terminals (one per terminal).</li>
<li>Connect the two black conductors to the brass colored screw terminals (one per terminal).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>NOTE:</strong> When terminating conductors at a screw terminal, always wrap the conductor in a clockwise direction.  This will cause the conductor to be pulled in tight, when the screw is tightened down.</em></p>

<h1>Installing a new fancy device without screw terminals</h1>

<p>I'm not sure what conductor combinations the supplied twist-on wire connectors are rated for, so I'm going to assume they're only rated for 2 #14 conductors (check the documentation). So before you start, you'll want to pick up a couple Ideal <a href=""http://www.idealindustries.com/prodDetail.do?prodId=30-074"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">yellow twist-on wire connectors</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Disconnect the power by switching off the breaker, or removing the fuse.</li>

<li>Connect all the white conductors using a yellow twist-on wire connector.</li>
<li>Connect all the black conductors using a yellow twist-on wire connector.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>If this was a ground-fault circuit interruption (GFCI) receptacle (which it is not), the procedure would be different. </li>

"What kind of mortar should I use to point a fieldstone foundation?","68217","","<p>What kind of mortar should I use to point a fieldstone foundation?</p>

<p>The old mortar is crumbling, and sandy mortar is falling out onto the basement floor.  I plan to remove the crumbling mortar (see <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/2811/how-to-remove-crumbling-mortar-from-fieldstone-foundation"">related question on how to remove</a>), then point the foundation with new mortar.  But what kind of mortar should I use?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NGnA7.jpg"" alt=""crumbling mortar""></p>

<p>I have had a hard time finding definite answers about fieldstone foundations on the Internet, but I'll include some of what I've found here.  First, <a href=""http://activerain.com/blogsview/122670/foundation-maintenance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">David Valley</a> has this to say about fieldstone foundations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most fieldstone foundations have, or had at some time, a thin mortar coating on the face of the stone. The purpose of this coating was to assist in holding the stones in place. This thin mortar coating will inevitably flake off from any moisture migration, revealing the surface of the stones. As this coating continues to erode, the mortar between the stones will begin to crumble and the soft, sandy mortar begins to slowly fall out onto the basement floor. It looks like a small pile of sand at the base of the foundation. When this occurs, tuck pointing is needed to refill the voids where the old mortar has fallen out. It's very important that you scrape away or chip away the crumbling mortar (in between the stones) in order to establish a small cavity or key way which can hold the new mortar that is being applied. Never apply new mortar over any old crumbling mortar, as this is a temporary fix and it will only last a couple years. All crumbling mortar must be removed in order for the newly applied surface to bond properly. While upgrading your field-stone foundation, only work on a section at a time. Do not remove the old mortar throughout the entire basement all at once. Complete all removal, tuck pointing and parging one section at a time. </p>
  
  <p>To avoid annual tuck pointing, you should finish the foundation with a complete top coating of mortar. Be sure it is lime based. This top coat does not have to look like a stone artisan's creation: It merely has to serve the purpose of keeping the newly installed mortar in place. It's sort of like applying a frosting to a cake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.graymont.com/applications_mortar_mix_designs.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This page</a> seems to suggest that I should be using not straight type-S hydrated lime, but type-S <em>mortar</em>, which consists of one part Portland cement, ¼ to ½ part lime, and an amount of sand equal to 2¼ to 3 times the total volume of cement and lime.</p>

<p>Do I need to analyze the existing mortar to make sure that the new mortar has the same lime content, as <a href=""http://www.tractorbynet.com/forums/rural-living/35838-fieldstone-foundation-pointing-mortar.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">suggested by some</a>?</p>

<p>Should I expect the new mortar to start crumbling and releasing dust soon, or should it stay solid and dust-free for many years?</p>
","<p>It is not so much about mortar as it is about the working process. You should clean out the old crumbling mortar to make place for the new one. Remove the old mortar so that all parts are firm and nothing is crumbling - you can even scratch out a bit of the old mortar. The very important part is to wash the wall properly with water so that all parts hold firm and there is no dust - otherwise the new mortar would just fall out. Than press the new mortar in the joints and fill them, make them smooth on surface.</p>

<p>As for the mortar the lime content should not be important for the lifetime, but you can add a bit for better workability. Generally there should be no or very little lime in a stone wall. The new mortar should consist of 1 part of portland cement and <strong>2</strong>-3 parts of sand. </p>

<p>If you do it properly (well prepared surface, good mortar), the new mortar should not crumble or dust for tens of years. </p>

<p>A personal experience: it is a very time consuming monotonous work, but the result can be very good if done with care. </p>

","<h1>Wiring Diagrams</h1>

<h2>Locate the schematic</h2>

<p>In most cases, a wiring diagram can be located inside the HVAC unit. Typically, it will be on the inside of the access cover.</p>

<h2>Find the transformer on the schematic</h2>

<p>Once you've located the diagram, you'll want to look for this symbol.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dErp6.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Or the actual text that says ""Transformer"", which may be labeling a crudely drawn transformer, or simply a rectangle.</p>

<h2>Primary or secondary?</h2>

<p>After finding the transformer in the diagram, you'll have to determine which wires are connected to the primary coil, and which are connected to the secondary coil.  Check the diagram for a key, which will give you a hint.  On some diagrams a thicker (bold) line denotes line voltage wiring, while a thinner line represents low voltage wiring. Others may list the voltage and frequency on each side of the transformer.</p>

<h2>Trace the wires</h2>

<p>Now that you know where the transformer is on the diagram, and which side is the secondary. The next step is to follow the lines, and see where they go.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QeZbQ.png"" alt=""Example diagram""></p>

<p>In this example diagram, you can see that one leg of the secondary connects to the <code>R</code> terminal on the control board, and the other leg connects to the <code>C</code> terminal.  In this example there's actually a <code>C</code> terminal present, but that will not always be the case (especially in old models). However, even if there isn't a dedicated <code>C</code> terminal, that doesn't change what the <code>C</code> wire is.  Which is simply the other side of the secondary coil.</p>

<h1>In Real Life</h1>

<p>Now that you've located the transformer in the diagram, or maybe you don't have a diagram.  Either way, you'll have to locate the actual transformer inside the HVAC unit. You'll be looking for something that looks similar to this...</p>

<sup>An action shot of the actual transformer in my furnace</sup></p>

<h2>Primary or secondary?</h2>

<p>Once again, you'll have to determine which is the primary wiring and which is the secondary.  If you had a wiring diagram with the wire colors labeled, this is simple.  If you don't, you'll have to figure it out.  </p>

<h3>Wire color</h3>

<p>In the US, typically the ungrounded (hot) conductor will be black, and the grounded (neutral) conductor will be white.  It's common for this color code to follow through to the primary side of the transformer, so a set of black and white wires is likely the primary side.  The secondary could be any color, though commonly the <code>R</code> wire will be red.</p>

<h3>Wire size</h3>

<p>You may also be able to determine which is which, based on the size of the wires connected.  The primary wires will typically be either 12 AWG or 14 AWG, whereas the secondary may be smaller.</p>

<h3>Measure.</h3>

<p>If all else fails, pull out your voltage meter an measure.  The primary side will be line voltage, and the secondary will be low voltage (commonly around 24V).</p>

<h2>Trace the wires</h2>

<p>Now that you know which wires are connected to the secondary coil, simply follow them to their termination.  One of the wires will be connected to the <code>R</code> terminal, the other may or may not be connected to a terminal that is labeled.  But even if it's not labeled, it's still <code>C</code>.</p>

<li>Cope with a big range of input voltage including part formed sine waves, which isn't easy for the control logic.</li>
<li>Detect from the input voltage the light level that the user wants, then give that light level.</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be a lot better if a dimmer switch could send a digital signal (radio, or over the main wiring) to the lamp, so that the lamp could know what was required without reverse engineering the voltage back to the user's wishes.   However this would need a new standard to be used by all switch and lamp vendors, so may take a little time-:)</p>

"Safe way to close gaps around copper pipes?","67121","","<p>I have baseboard heaters in my main living space.  I can't see for sure without taking the covers off (which I haven't done yet) but it appears 2 copper pips come up from the basement (through the hard wood floor) to power them and the holes cut seem to be WAY too big around the pipes (fingers could absolutely fit in the spaces).  To prevent rodents from coming up from the basement and to just have a tighter living area altogether, I'd like to close these gaps safely.  I know there is foam out there and steel wool is also an option, but are those really safe for use around what I assume would be hot pipes?  I also read about something called an escutcheon ring but for some reason, I'm seeing those as being $10+ piece and I'd likely have to 10-15 of them (maybe I was looking at the wrong thing).  Any suggestions would be great!  Thanks.</p>
","<p>A metal escutcheon ring might be sufficient for your purpose. I would fill the hole with steel wool to stop the mice, then cover with silicone to prevent a draft. The steel wool might be unnecessary, as I don't think mice will gnaw though silicone. However, if the hole is large, the steel wool would make it easier to fill it with silicone without having it fall into the basement.</p>

<p>Don't use spray foam such as Great Stuff around heat sources: it will melt and produce toxic fumes.</p>

<p>BTW, the reason the holes are so big is probably because there used to be three-inch pipes there. Such pipes were used for steam systems and for pump-less hot-water systems where the water was circulated by gravity (convection).</p>

Thanks,</p>
","<p>Well, you either have: </p>

<ul>
<li>No connection at the box despite appearing to have one (quite
possible with aluminum wiring if the appropriate methods are not
followed, from what I understand - but I have limited personal experience there)</li>
</ul>

<p>or </p>

<ul>
<li>the ground wire to those boxes is broken or not connected somewhere
<strong>between</strong> those boxes and the main panel. Which actually makes lots of sense if you have two boxes in this state; probably one is connected to the other, and the wire is broken or not connected to the one that the other connects to.</li>
</ul>

<p>I trust that as an aluminum wiring house owner your new receptacles are marked as suitable for aluminum wire?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> No? Seriously?</p>

<p>As @Speedy Petey says, that really isn't an acceptable alternative to using the correct receptacles. House fires are not much fun. As for tracking down the problem, if this end is connected properly, you need to check the far end of the wire for a proper connection - you may find that you can identify which outlet is ""next in line"" by identifying the power wires feeding the probelm outlets - look there for a poor connection between the two ground wires. </p>

<p>@Chief Two Pencils seems to be failing to observe that you have aluminum romex with a ground wire - the problem is not a lack of ground wire, it's a lack of that ground wire being connected at some point.</p>

<p>You are failing to understand that the connection to the box does not ""magically ground the outlet"" - the <strong>box</strong> is being grounded (or rather, should be) by being connected to the ground wire coming from the cable. That wire is not connected all the way to the main panel ground from the two problem outlets. You, or a competent electrician (I'd really have doubts about continuing to use one that suggest that anti-ox paste is an adequate substitute for using CO/ALR or COALR marked devices) need to track down where that lack of connection is happening, and fix it, with a connector approved for use on aluminum wire (and it may well not be connected now becasue it was not connected with a suitable connector, or not properly prepared.) </p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.cpsc.gov//PageFiles/118856/516.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">US CPSC advocates a more through approach of pigtailing copper wire</a> to the ends of the aluminum wire with an approved connector to <strong>eliminate the aluminum connection fire hazard</strong> in a permanent fashion. Then you can use nice normal Cu-only connectors.</p>

"Why did I feel an electric current when touching my light switch?","65216","","<p>While reaching behind a desk in my office, I leaned against the wall and felt a pinch on my shoulder. I realized I was leaning on the lower screw of the light switch and thought it had a metal burr or something sticking out. I touched the screw with my hand and felt electric current flow through my hand. I tried it again a few minutes later and felt no current.</p>

<p>I'm going to call an electrician ASAP but was curious, what could be causing this?<br>
My house is 58 years old and the wiring is probably that old as well.</p>
","<p>There are (at least) three possibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li>Static electricity.</li>
<li>Current flow to something grounded</li>
<li>Capacitive flow.</li>
</ol>

<p>Most everyone is familiar with static electricity I think.  Sparking to a properly grounded electrical box is to be expected.  Static charge can be built up and stored on your body in many way, like rolling acrylic wheels of a desk chair across the floor.  Or walking on a carpet.  After being discharged, if you don't build up another charge, then there is nothing to discharge, so you don't feel anything.</p>

<p>For there to be current flow, there would have to be a potential.  It is possible (though unlikely) that the light switch is mis-wired and presents a potential to the screw.  If you touch it while also touching something grounded like the desk, a land-line phone, etc. then an electrical path exists through you.  If you are not grounded, like when you repeated touching the screw, there is nothing to feel.</p>

<p>A capacitive path is even less likely than the second possibility.  I am only aware of it under high voltage situations, such as this <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cx-eOUjNPE"" rel=""nofollow"">video of a flying helicopter being bonded to high voltage</a>.  It is current flowing each a.c. cycle back and forth and stored in a conductive object.  It stands to reason that if huge sparks occur at, say, 200,000 volts, that a small version could occur at 120 volts using your body as a capacitor.  If you are sensitive enough, you might be able to feel it.  However, if you use a less sensitive part of your body, then maybe you wouldn't.  Electrical sensitivity could well vary millimeter by millimeter across a fingertip.  This explanation also requires that there be an (erroneous) potential on the light switch screw.</p>

<p>If the second or third situations exist, there is a wiring fault, so it is good an electrician will be checking it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Just thought of another one:</p>

<p>A fourth possibility is that there is a strong radio transmitter near by.  The capacitance of your body is more of a factor at higher frequency.  Maybe you would feel it sometimes but not other times because the transmitter is not continuously on.  There isn't really much to do about it.</p>

"What can I do about my drains constantly getting blocked?","65183","","<p>The one thing I have tried to do about this is use those foaming and non-foaming drain unblockers regularly. That has just been money down the drain, pardon the pun.</p>

<p>I suspect that unblockers only work if the blockage is in trap (the first bendy bit that blocks smells). I suspect my blockage keeps occurring elsewhere, because when the washing machine flushes copious amounts of water, it has no problem coming out of the bathtub drain - so clearly that part isn't blocked.</p>

<p>I've also tried the plunger (which occasionally helped to unblock the pipes, and always helped get the 30 minutes daily exercise), and a snake (long bendy cable thing), which has been a complete waste.</p>

<p><strong>My questions</strong>: is there anything else I can try or is it time to call a professional? Also, does this sound like some sort of a design problem with the pipes in my flat, or is this just the way drains always are? (hope not!...)</p>

<hr>

<p>I have since learned the following things about my waste pipes, which together explain the constant blockage and glugging sounds:</p>

<ul>
<li>The pipe is far too narrow for a tub, two sinks, a dishwasher and a washing machine: only 4cm.</li>
<li>There's a very sharp 90° bend near the exit from the property, which is where a huge blockage accumulates (10cm deep solid chunk of waste). Apparently a waste plumbing no-no.</li>
<li>Most of the pipework lies flat on the floor, with zero slope. There's about 1.5m of it that is visible. Apparently against all plumbing codes and a cause of blockage.</li>
<li>There was a T-junction installed ""backwards"" (directing incoming water from a sink towards the kitchen appliances and forcing it to reverse direction in order to leave the property). There was a humongous second blockage underneath this T-junction.</li>
<li>There is no air vent (really!), explaining the noises. (update: the noises went away once the <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/a/24947/1299"">second blockage got eliminated</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, a really bad plumbing job someone did here...</p>
","<p><strong>When drain water from one fixture comes back out another fixture, it means your blockage is beyond the point where those drains meet</strong>. </p>

<p>You need to get a good look at the <strong>topology of your waste plumbing</strong>, to get some ideas about where the blockage is. Clothes washer -> bathtub is a common symptom, because the clothes washer drains a lot of water up high (it has a pump) and the tub drain is down low. </p>

<p>Snaking down a drain is really hard, because of all the curves of the P-trap. If you're lucky, you have a clean-out somewhere, like under the house or behind a wall. Otherwise, you can try <strong>removing a P-trap</strong> to get the snake in, or <strong>removing a toilet</strong>. Removing a toilet is not very hard, but can be daunting.</p>

<p>We had a similar problem in this house. There were a few clean-outs accessible in the crawlspace, and our landlord used a hand-held snake in them, but didn't have much luck. </p>

<p>They hired a professional plumber. He pulled a toilet out and ran a huge snake down the drain (not one of the handheld units, but a huge, loud, floor-standing model heavy-duty cable). After running all 75' out, he borrowed another snake from his colleague, for 150' of snaking. This is a single-story house, on a 50'-wide lot, so the snake was well in to the street!</p>

<p>He said he pulled out a lot of roots. This is apparently common in older plumbing. They develop a small leak, and nearby plants grow after the nutrient-rich water, and find their way in to the pipe. It took him about <strong>4 hours</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Plumbing is simple</strong>. There aren't a lot of rules to follow. Everything works in obvious ways. You don't need a lot of expensive, complicated tools, and if you do need something big, you can rent it. <strong>Anyone can fix plumbing</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>But it can also be unpleasant</strong>. Screw-on connections may be rusted in place - hacksawing is often easier. There's the spectre of old poop and hair. Things may be difficult to reach - in a cabinet behind a sink basin or in a muddy crawlspace full of rat droppings.</p>

<p>If the job takes a few days, and you're unaccustomed to living without plumbing, it can be a trying time. Especially if there's a whole family in the house, and they aren't sympathetic. A pro will get the job done much faster, since they arrive with the right tools, parts, and experience.</p>

<p>There's a lot of instructions out there, on the internet, at the library, at the hardware store. If you decide to get your feet wet (get it? ha ha) then you will be able to find the information you need.</p>

<p>What is the cause of this, and is there a remedy without tearing out the whole floor?</p>
","<p>The cause is generally that the flooring or subfloor is not securely attached to the joists underneath.  Usually this happens because the joist settle or bend over time and the flooring becomes loose or detached in spots.</p>

<p>If you can get underneath the floor and find the soft spots (say from the basement or crawlspace?), you'll likely see that there is a gap between the flooring and the joist.

","<p>I would guess that modifying the duct work in a 1920s masonry construction home will be prohibitively destructive and involving removing or damaging irreplaceable trim that contributes to the building's character.</p>

<p><strong>Mini split heat pumps:</strong></p>

<p>An alternative, which will not be inexpensive but may be significantly less destructive, would be investigating installing a multi head mini split ac unit with one head in each bedroom.  Such a unit costs perhaps $2500 to $5000 for the unit, installation extra and depends on the difficulty of install.  If you live in a heating climate, especially one with cheap electricity in the winter or might install solar and have sunny winters, you should likely invest in the heat pump versions.  Models are available that operate down to -13 F now (Mitsubishi M-Series) in single head.  Supposedly multi-heads that operate that low are coming out this spring.</p>

<p>Advs:</p>

<p>Individual temperature control for each bedroom
- Really high efficiency available for both heating and cooling
- Avoid destruction of interior trim</p>

<p>Disads:
- Potentially a lot of $$$
- Still a newer technology in the US (used all over Europe and Japan).  If you plan to sell soon, recovering your investment at resale could be a challenge
- Some people hate the look.</p>

<p>Other than minisplits:</p>

<p><strong>Air leakage:</strong></p>

<p>I'd suggest you have a blower door test performed. All the insulation in the world doesn't matter if you are changing over the air in the house too quickly.  If you didn't air seal the attic before filling it with cellulose, you could have this problem.  An infrared gun on a cold night can help show these leaks too.  Insulation installers will say things like seals in air but cellulose, fiberglass insulation, and mineral wool insulation are actually very air permeable.  If you find that is the problem, you could move insulation out of the way in the attic to use canned foam (get a commercial gun, much nicer job to do than with home depot cans).  If you can't move the insulation, you could install a vapor permeable sheet membrane like Tyvek or a smart vapor retarder like IntelloPlus on top of the insulation to block air movement. Do not use a vapor impermeable barrier like black plastic or visqueen (clear plastic); you could trap moisture and cause a mold problem.  Attic access hatches are also causes of large volume air leaks.  There are special hatch covers you can buy or build to address this problem.</p>

<p><strong>Duct work in unconditioned space:</strong></p>

<p>Do you have any ducts in unconditioned (uninsulated) space like an open crawl space or an unconditioned attic?  If so, you could be losing huge amounts of heat to the crawl space or attic.  If your ducts are older, they likely aren't air tight either.  You could use specialized foil tape or duct mastic to seal the joints and you could insulate this duct work, though it won't be fun work.  If your ducts are really leaky, you could get big gains in system performance from this work.</p>

<p><strong>Humidity control:</strong></p>

<p>Have you measured your humidity when your system is running?  If your humidity is high in the winter or summer, you will feel colder or hotter.  Your humidity could be high in the house for many reasons (improper shower venting) but dirt crawl spaces are a big source in the summer (not in the winter so much).  Seal off the dirt crawl space to eliminate humidity, mold spores, radon, etc. from getting in the house.  A radon membrane company, in areas with radon, might be a cost effective contractor to use.</p>

"Should I cover my air conditioner for winter?","63833","","<p>Should I cover my air conditioner for winter? It's difficult to find an appropriate cover, but finding a cover for an evaporation cooler is easy (and because they allow for air flow from the outdoors, it makes sense).</p>

<p>I don't want to let water build up inside and given my climate, it will freeze and thaw repeatedly which can be very damaging. On the other hand, I don't want to create a moisture barrier that leads to other problems.</p>

<p>Any official word on this?</p>
","<p>I have never covered mine and this article also seems to recommend not covering it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your central air conditioning unit
  consists of a compressor and
  condensing unit placed outdoors in a
  metal housing. These units, built to
  resist the weather, generally do not
  need a cover. In fact, covers can
  cause problems because they trap
  moisture and create an inviting winter
  home for small animals.</p>
  
  <p>Professionals who service the units
  tell me that most of the damage they
  see in spring was caused by rodents
  living in the units and chewing on
  wiring.</p>
  
  <p>If your air conditioner is subject to
  falling ice or other debris, you could
  cover its top with a piece of plywood,
  plastic or metal held in place by a
  weight.<br>

<p>Possible disposal methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>Throw it out.  We have a recycling/trash center in our town and for a
fee you can dispose of bulk items that the trash guys will not pick
up.  A mirror of that size would be considered a bulk item.</li>
<li>Recycle.  Check your local recycling center, some of them will
recycle mirrors at no cost.</li>
<li>Repurpose.  The mirror could be reused by someone else as is if it is
good shape.  Some advertisement may be necessary in local media, or you can use free advertising as indicated below in the comments by @Steve.</li>
<li>Donate.  A mirror or especially a broken mirror can be reused for
many arts and crafts type projects like a mosiac.  Check with

One of the legs from the secondary of the transformer will be connected to the <code>R</code> terminal, which applies a voltage to the terminal.  </p>

<p>When the thermostat wants to be warmed up or cooled down, it closes the appropriate switch, completing a circuit.  This allows current to flow from ""into"" the <code>R</code> terminal and ""out of"" the appropriate signal terminal (<code>W</code>, <code>Y</code>, etc.) of the thermostat.</p>

After turning the fuel valve to 'on' and engaging the choke, I pulled the pulled the starting cord, and pulled, and pulled. No luck.</p>

<p>The generator is fairly new -- I bought it at the end of June '12. I last started it a few months ago -- around November I think -- and since then it's been sitting in a dry shed with half a tank of treated gas and the gas cap closed tightly. The gas appears to be okay -- it's not cloudy, doesn't look separated. I get a whiff of gasoline after a few pulls, so I think there's some fuel flowing. The spark plug wire seemed firmly seated, but I pulled it and reseated it just to make sure.</p>

<p>What else should I be looking at to get this small engine started?</p>
","<p>I would replace the spark plug and remove the air filter to make sure it isn't plugged up.  Then, while the air filter is still removed, spray a little starting fluid into the carb through the hole under the air filter and start it up.  If it runs for just a couple seconds and dies, that means the gas in your carb was probably bad.  Starting it with the starting fluid a couple of times will work that out, and it should start running fine.  Keep your face and other body parts away from the hole you spray the starting fluid into so you don't get burned by a backfire.  Put the air filter back on after you get it running.  </p>

<p>Other common fixes are pinched or clogged fuel lines or a clogged fuel filter, but if you're smelling gas, that probably isn't the problem. </p>

<p>You should also check that the spark arrester in the exhaust pipe isn't clogged up with carbon. Undo small bolt adjacent to exhaust pipe and remove insert. All small holes should be clear.</p>

<li>Most <strong>machine oils</strong> are a bit thin; they'll get into crevices like in door hinges, but they're lighter-weight and more volatile, and will eventually evaporate or work their way back out. </li>
<li><strong>Silicone sprays</strong> are great for metal-on-metal, but they are incompatible with some plastics, so read the label carefully. </li>
<li>If you can take the mechanism apart without destroying it, I would recommend a <strong>silicone grease</strong> out of a tube, such as <strong>Dow-33</strong> (available under many different brand names; you'll most likely find it as a pneumatic tool lube because it doesn't hurt o-rings). It is nonreactive with virtually all construction plastics and with metals, and is a thick-ish grease which stays where it's put. A little dab'll do ya.

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Added images.  Sorry for the quality (camera phone).</p>

<p><strong>Downstairs:</strong><br>
<strong>East wall (front):</strong> Crack that starts about 3 feet from the ground and is about 6 feet long.  The crack itself is about 1mm wide.  I am not sure how deep is is.  There are some spots where there's a little bit of the wall chipping off, but the chips are not deep and are maybe 2mm wide on either side of the main crack.</p>

<p>This part of the house was added on a while before we bought it as an expansion.  The crack seems to have surfaced in close proximity to where the old wall would have ended.</p>

<li><p>Is this something for which I can perform a quality repair job (if so, how) or should I seek a professional?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>From the pictures it looks like the cracks may only be in the stucco, and the underlying structural wall may be unaffected.  It's hard to tell without actually inspecting the wall, but my guess is that these cracks are only skin deep.  However, you will want to treat them to prevent them from spreading.</p>

<p>Here is a good article about <a href=""http://www.wconline.com/Articles/Feature_Article/BNP_GUID_9-5-2006_A_10000000000000073752"" rel=""nofollow"">Cracks in stucco</a>. </p>

<p>Here are some excerpts from the article.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All buildings are subjected to a
  variety of stresses in various forms
  and this stress is often transferred
  to the plaster stucco membrane. </p>
  
  <p>Stucco
  is not and never was intended to be a
  structural material. </p>
  
  <p>Cement stucco is
  a relatively thin, brittle shell over
  a framed structure and can crack if
  the stresses are transferred and
  overcome the strength of the plaster
  membrane.</p>
  
  <p>SHRINKAGE STRESS </p>
  
  <p>All Portland cement
  shrinks as it cures. Controlling and
  minimizing that shrinkage is critical
  to minimizing cracks </p>
  
  <p>Shrinkage cracking
  tends to have a map-like cracking
  pattern. </p>
  
  <p>OUTSIDE SOURCES </p>
  
  <p>Structural loads,
  lateral force racking, thermal
  changes, wind, lumber shrinkage and
  seismic events are all examples of
  outside sources of stress. </p>
  
  <p>HOW HARMFUL IS A HAIRLINE CRACK? </p>
  
  <p>a hairline
  crack does not automatically mean the
  stucco is faulty, failing or will not
  function for the service life of the
  building. </p>
  
  <p>MAKING REPAIRS </p>
  
  <p>Once the decision is made to make
  repairs, there are several options.</p>
  
  <p>Option 1: Treat the joint with the
  same finish material. </p>
  
  <p>Option 2: Paint the wall or ceiling
  after treating the crack with an
  acrylic paint or paint designed for
  stucco. </p>
  
  <p>Option 3: An elastomeric paint
  coating. </p>
  
  <p>Option 4: Recoat the wall from
  architectural break to architectural
  break with the same finish material.</p>
  
  <p>Option 5: A new basecoat and mesh over
  the wall area. </p>

Assuming normal framing, you have two 2x4s, possibly some shims and the jamb itself, so there's plenty of wood there for a long screw to grip onto.</p></li>
<li><p>Take the hinge plate off the jamb (support the door so it doesn't pull the other hinges out of the jamb) and drill out the screw holes that are giving you problems; the hole should be as deep as the existing screw.  Glue a dowel of the same thickness as your drill bit into the hole.  Before you replace the hinge screw, drill a pilot hole to ensure that the screw goes in straight.</p></li>

Are there other reasons, and does the NEC have any requirements on one vs the other?</p>
","<p>There are no NEC guides, UL and CSA rules on or approves devices.  The reason I commented on using back wiring on GFI's, is that if you look carefully inside the holes, you will see a barbed plate that compresses on the wire when the side screw is tightened. You will also notice because the devise itself is very wide, there is little barrier space around the screws. Most manufacturers recommend using the strip gage and back wiring holes.  Just be sure to tip the device so the grab plates open before inserting the wires. Every electrician I know, uses the back connections on GFI's and side wires regular receptacles.  Also notice that there are holes for 4 pairs of wires, two pairs for line side and two pairs for load side. Again, this saves room in the box so less wirenuts and splices need to be used.</p>

<p>And will connecting the TV to a regular surge protector work, or do I need to put it on a voltage stabilizer?</p>
","<p>When the fridge turns on (some) and when (some) ovens start their capacitors pull a ton of current to start the motor/function needed.  </p>

<p>If these are on the same circuit as your TV this is a pretty big issue and the fluctuations could cause damage to your TV circuit board over time.</p>

<p>Even if these aren't on the same circuit your TV is getting a voltage fluctuation from the main circuit.  Your TV having intelligence built in probably has its own way of handling these fluctuations - with one turning off some extraneous functions... like HDMI working.  </p>

<p>HDMI cables work or don't.   If yours is showing a picture then getting a ""better"" one won't help.  </p>

<p>What I would do?  First make sure that your TV is not on the same circuit as the fridge and stove.  In some places this wouldn't meet code and it certainly isn't good for the electronics.  </p>

<p>If they are not on the same circuit then you may need to call the electric company and figure out if they have anything that is causing fluctuations on your line when something high voltage is plugged in.  They may fix the issue or offer suggestions - and a lot of times this is free.  If the electric company believes it is an issue on your side you will need to troubleshoot why you have this interference - usually a loose connection in the main box.  </p>

<p>And lastly you may need to change appliances or tv...  Not saying you have to do this but you gave a specific example.  Your TV may not handle any kind of voltage fluctuation well.  Whenever a major appliance turns on there will often be a little voltage fluctuation.  Most electronics are built to handle this.  Maybe your TV does not handle this well and your electricity issue is not really a big deal.  Or maybe your TV handles this normally and this would happen with all/most TVs.</p>

Is there a certain type of PVC that would be best to use for this, considering that it will be exposed to sun/rain/heat/cold? Lots of people seem to use ""regular"" white PVC but I didn't think that was intended for outdoor use.</p>
","<p>All PVC is subject to UV light degradation.  PVC without UV protection will eventually suffer a loss of impact resistance.  Your pipe will be whole, until impact at which it will shatter or crack instead of flex.</p>

<p>Some PVC (PVC UVR) is UV <em>resistant</em>.  The sunlight still damages the PVC pipe, but it is in a matrix of other chemicals that compete for the UV light (stealing it away from the would be damaged PVC).  PVC UVR will degrade, but at a slower rate.</p>

<p>Thicker wall pipe will take longer to fail, as the UV will be caught by upper layers before penetrating lower layers.  Painted pipe will not fail, provided that your paint blocks or reflects UV light (and nearly all paints do).</p>

<p>You are right, a lot of people use PVC pipe, but mostly it is meant to be used in buried applications (where it will be shielded from UV light); however, most of those buried applications come out of the ground at some point.  Typically the out-of-ground portions are not properly protected, which is just a timer for eventual failure.</p>

<p>Is there another product I can try that would work better than spackle?</p>
","<p>I might consider wallpaper as an option. You can surely find it in a plain paper, in your choice of colors, or any of a million patterns. First, you would need to fill in the grooves with spackle, but now you can do it very quickly. No worries there, just ensure that there are no voids behind the paper. And a plain paper would be relatively inexpensive.</p>

<p>Another choice is to use a product that is closer to a latex caulk to fill the grooves. It stays semi-flexible (so less fear of cracking) and is paintable, and you can buy it in a tub form to spread with a knife. I used a product from DAP (sold as a crack filler) once to solve a similar problem, filling cracks in a ceiling.</p>

<p>A third option is to buy battens - thin strips of wood moulding, perhaps 1/4 inch thick, and perhaps an inch wide. You can even choose the profile for the moulding if you wish to give it a custom look. Nail these vertically over the grooves, and paint it all. You might also paint the battens a different color to highlight them. This will give the wall a completely different look, rather than just looking like painted paneling, and no spackle will be required.</p>

<p>EDIT: I should note that I installed new bulbs and they didn't work until the other day... and now they've stopped again.</p>
","<ol>
<li>Confirm your wall switch is good. Bad switches can be intermittent.</li>
<li>Turn off the switch and take the tubes back out and
put them back in making sure they're fully snapped in. It's worth a
try. Don't go buy more, but if you have other new tubes try them.</li>
<li>If the lights work for a period of time and go out on their own,
that usually indicates an over-heating ballast - replace the
ballast.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the best test for a ballast is just what you did, try new
tubes. If no luck, replace the ballast.</li>
<li>While replacing the ballast, make sure all of the wires in the
sockets are well connected. Give them each a little tug. If you can't get a
wire to stay in a socket replace the socket, maybe replace all 4.</li>
<li>Fluorescent lights need to be grounded to work properly. Make sure a
ground wire is attached to the fixture. I've seen fluorescent lights, especially in old homes, where the people say they're always replacing tubes, and it's because the fixture isn't grounded.</li>
<li>If you're going to replace the ballast or the entire fixture
consider going with an electronic ballast maybe even T8 size tubes.

"How do I fix an exterior door knob that will unlock but not turn?","61537","","<p>My back door (which is only two years old) has a door knob that recently suddenly stopped turning. I can lock and unlock it, but it just won't turn. Here's a picture of the inside of the door knob:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YQmnol.jpg"" alt=""inside view of back, exterior door knob""></p>

<p>The very center bit is the lock mechanism, and I can turn it (locking and unlocking it) easily with a hex key. The half-circle immediately next to it appears to me to be the mechanism for opening the door — I could be wrong about that, though. It will not budge. The only two options I can see now are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>taking the door off its hinges so that I can completely remove the lock set and possibly replace it with a new one; or</p></li>
<li><p>calling a lock smith.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm more inclined to go with the latter than the former. Any other suggestions?</p>
","<p>In its currently disassembled state, there is nothing locking the mechanism. You are correct that the C shaped half-circle shaft is what pulls the latch back when turned.</p>

<p>If you cannot push the latch back with your finger, the anti-jimmy device has had a piece break in it.</p>

<p>I had this happen on a bathroom door latch about two weeks ago, probably made by the same manufacturer as the shape of the lock actuator rod and latch actuator are exactly the same.</p>

<p>If you look at it, the lock actuator rod (the center piece you were turning) has a taper section just where it passes through the latch pull which means that during assembly, you manually push the latch back and it passes straight through.</p>

<p>In order to get clearance so the lock actuator rod will pass through, I pried the folded piece that they pass through till I got clearance so the shafts would pull out. I then squeezed the folded piece back together and pushed the latch out. It didn't even require taking the door off the hinges.</p>

<p>Replace the whole door knob/latch assembly with new and you're back in action.</p>

"How long does paint have to dry before I can tape over it?","61492","","<p>I have painted the trim with semi-gloss latex paint. How long does it need to dry before I can mask it with blue painter's tape?</p>
","<p>We try wait at least 12 hours and use Orange core tape (delicate, low tact) and often we still get a little pull off. Don't leave the tape on any longer than you have to and pull it at an extreme angle to the wall or trim.  Obviously, the longer you can wait to tape over fresh paint the better, but we don't have a lot of time on a job to wait for the paint to cure. Trim paints tend to pull off more than wall paints, so we break the common rules and do walls first, trim second.  Also, small touch ups on egg shell or flat wall paint is easier than touch-ups on semi-gloss trim.</p>

<p>In hot humid weather and rush jobs, we use fans and dehumidifiers to speed the curing process. This helps a lot. Under optimal conditions, we can tape after maybe 4 hours and do second coats in the same day.</p>

"What's the best way to keep my garage from freezing?","61053","","<p>I live in Colorado. My 1950s house has a one-car attached garage that was built in the 2000s. The walls that are not shared with the house are not insulated: the studs and sheathing are visible from the inside. There is no ceiling, so above the joists the rafters and roof sheathing are also visible. There is a single steel overhead door, also uninsulated.</p>

<p>I'd like to keep the garage from freezing because a) I store things like paint and food in it and b) occasionally I want to work out there wearing only moderate cold-weather clothing. It's sufficient to keep the garage at 50ºF/10ºC.</p>

<p>With these goals and conditions in mind, that's the best way to install insulation in this garage? Will I have to install drywall over it? Can I use that shredded-denim insulation to avoid fiberglass countermeasures? What's the best type of heater to use?</p>
","<p>Turning a cold space into a warm space is absolutely doable, but the trick is doing it the right way to avoid creating longer term health or structural problems later.</p>

<p>The proper way to create a warm space is to create two different kinds of protections against the elements - a thermal break to hold in heat, and a moisture barrier to hold in water.</p>

<p>The thermal break is the obvious part - you want it to be warm, so you need to create a layer that doesn't conduct heat well and put it between your warm and cold spaces.</p>

<p>The moisture barrier is the less obvious and yet more important part.  Wherever warm air touches a cold surface you get condensation.  Condensation in an enclosed space - such as inside of a wall or insulated cavity - is a bad thing, because now you're getting organic materials such as wood and gypsum wet, which turns them from construction materials into mold food.  Mold being bad (read - toxic) its important to create a complete barrier that keeps moist warm air from getting into cold, closed spaces.  (Once the moisture gets into the wall it wont come out again anywhere near as fast as it got in, so it'll just keep building up).</p>

<p>The 2nd part here is you've got walls and a roof to deal with.  Since you don't have a ceiling, and since it sounds like you don't really want to install one, you can treat the two the same.  Thus I'll explain how to properly insulate your walls, and you can do the same for your roof over the garage.  But bear in mind if you install a ceiling, then the roof has to be handled differently from the walls.</p>

<p>So - how do you insulate your walls safely?</p>

<p>First - yes you can use shredded denim insulation, or fiberglass, or cellulose, or spray foam.   If cost is your primary concern, then you're going to trade off money for time. </p>

<p>The fastest but definitely not cheapest way to handle your problem is spray foam.  With spray foam (closed cell foam being preferred over open cell foam) you spray (or have someone spray) a liquid compound into the wall cavities and the liquid foams up and then solidifies.  What you get is a dense, seamless, tightly packed rigid material that has excellent insulation qualities <em>and</em> acts as a vapor barrier all on its own.  In your case you could spray the walls and roof in one day and almost instantly have a workable warm space.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2OBjC.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ItRcH.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>For any other kinds of insulation, its a bit more involved.  The installation of the insulation is pretty straight forward - its the vapor barrier that's the issue.  You can use fiberglass with paper backing, but personally I don't think that seals up as well, and I consider it a good idea to tape all the seams after they're stapled down, for extra measure... (taping seams will be covered more in a moment)</p>

<p>This is NOT how you install it:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UIkhs.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Note how its all compressed and tucked in?  That kills the insulation value (R-value).  I've heard/seen it argued that you should tuck the backing in so that drywallers can glue the drywall to the framing - they use screws.  I've <em>never</em> heard of drywallers doing this - and I don't think its worth surrendering the R-Value for drywall glue... Plus if they really do want to glue, well you install furring strips (as they did in the above pic) and glue to those...</p>

<p>IMO THIS is how you install paper backed fiberglass:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ufNfR.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Flaps folded over the studs, and stapled down.  (Then tape the seams for extra measure as well as taping any tears).  I still also don't trust paper as a vapor barrier, though often times its paper/plastic laminate in which case it'll probably be fine.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can install an unbacked style (no paper, just insulation) - and then you add the vapor barrier by adding a layer of plastic, like so:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/viYh2.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Here the plastic is hung up over top of the insulation, taped at its seams and so forth.</p>

<p>Here's the critical bit - YOU MUST NOT FAIL TO TAPE ANY SEAMS/GAPS IN THE VAPOR BARRIER.</p>

<p>A tiny pinhole in your vapor barrier can let in a whole cup of water in a season as warm moist air pushes into the cold space.  So you have to create a completely solid barrier against moisture all the way around the edges, on all the seams, and in any tears you inadvertently create.</p>

<p>Because this vapor barrier is so important, you <em>should</em> drywall or protect it in some other fashion.  (You want to create storage - consider sheets of plywood instead of drywall to create extra strong mounting surfaces for shelves ) If you leave the barrier exposed, it's gonna get damaged, and then its gonna lead to mold and rot.</p>

<p>If you spray foam, however, since its rigid and 4"" thick, you can leave it exposed.</p>

","<p>You don't really need an ""air compressor"" in the sense that you don't need something that has a tank and is designed for use with tools.  All you really need is sometimes called a ""tire inflator"", obviously it is actually an air compressor but it is very different from those listed by Jeff's answer.</p>

<p>I have seen two basic types.</p>

<p>There are 12V versions that are designed to simply plug into the cigarette lighter outlet in your car.  This is nice because you can refill the tires anywhere.  When I had a slow leak in my tire I put this thing in the trunk and drove to work, then before leaving work I would top off the tire again.  It worked fine for the day or two until I could get to the shop for a new tire.  Usually these are pretty cheap.</p>

","<p>As I said in the comments to the OP and to Aaron's answer, there are several wiring failures that could cause an NCVT (non-contact voltage tester; usually a pen-looking thing that beeps when you point it at a live electrical wire) to light up, and some that even a plug tester can miss, but that would prevent a ""real"" load from being plugged in. The first thing to do is get a 3-lamp outlet tester (preferably with GFCI testing) to supplement your NCVT. The tester will correctly diagnose most of these things:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Open Hot</strong>: the black wire is present in the box but disconnected from the plug (or otherwise not making good contact). An NCVT can still light up if the wire is close to the faceplate. However, a plug tester will diagnose the issue. The fix is to flip this outlet's breaker, open up the plate and make sure all wires are firmly connected to the proper terminals on the outlet.</li>
<li><strong>Open Neutral</strong>: the white wire is present but not properly connected to the outlet. Again, a NCVT will light up if the hot is properly connected (maybe even if it isn't), but a plug tester will properly diagnose the issue. The fix is the same as for an open hot.</li>
<li><strong>Broken/Worn/Bent Outlet Contacts</strong>: The wires are hooked up correctly, but the outlet's contacts have poor or no continuity with the plug's blades. You may hear arcing (a rough crackle) as you plug in the tester or an electrical device. <strong>A tester MAY show correct wiring at a glance</strong>, but if you jiggle the tester the lights will blink off. Replacing the outlet is the solution here.</li>
<li><strong>Neutral-Ground Swap and High-Resistance Ground</strong>: This would tend to affect an entire house's wiring, but it can be localized as well. What is happening is that the white and bare wires have been switched, and in addition, the ground (which normally ties back to the bus strip in the service panel and has full continuity with the neutral) has lost some continuity back to the service panel. There are several situations in which this can happen, most of them involving attaching grounds to house plumbing and then changing that plumbing along the way. <strong>An outlet tester may not diagnose this</strong>; the expected read is an ""open ground"" or ""open neutral"" (remember this would mainly be a problem if the neutral and ground are switched), but if there is some continuity then the tester may not show a problem.</li>
<li><strong>Poor Continuity Of Hot Or Neutral With Outlet</strong>: One or more wires is making very poor contact with the outlet terminal. <strong>A plug tester may miss this</strong>; there is enough continuity for the tester (which only draws a few milliamps for its LEDs) but even a clock radio would have issues with the load induced by the poor continuity. The solution is to rewire the outlet securely, and if the wiring is sound on the plug then to check other wires in the box (with the breaker off of course). The next most likely culprit is the ""bundle"" of neutral leads that's normally in an ""upstream"" J-box; make sure all wires are wound tight and properly secured with a wire nut and electrical tape.</li>

"Why are homes wired using solid wire rather than stranded?","59728","","<p>If stranded wire can carry more power for a given wire gauge, why are homes typically wired using solid?</p>

<p>If solid wire is less expensive to make, that provides a compelling reason why solid is used, but if an electrician or homeowner wanted to use stranded, is there any reason not to?</p>

<p><em>For this question I am mainly referring to legs of U.S. home wiring for 15 and 20 amp breakers carrying 120 volts on a single phase.</em></p>
","<p>A few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stranded wire is more expensive to make.</li>
<li>At a given wire gauge, stranded is going to be larger than solid wire (it's the cross-sectional area of conductor that counts and there are going to be some air gaps between conductors with stranded).  This could make a big difference if you have several cables in a limited space like an electrical box.</li>
<li>The main advantage of stranded is that it's more flexible.  You generally don't need this in home wiring because it's all put in place once and hidden behind walls/floors/ceilings.</li>
<li>When you screw a solid wire into a switch or receptacle, you can tell if it's secure.  I could see individual strands coming loose as you fold wires back into an electrical box.</li>

"How can I pass cables vertically through walls that contain fire blocking? ","59569","","<p>How can one pass (speaker) cables through walls from the floor to the ceiling.
I am assuming that drilling a small hole at the top, dropping the cable I want to pass through and catching it at the bottom will not work because the wire being dropped would encounter a cross-beam?</p>

<p>Are there techniques to accomplish this? I am in California, so I basically have a house made of cardboard (no bricks) but what I assume is drywall.</p>

<p>Any tips are appreciated</p>
","<p>There are a variety of methods of fishing wires through walls.  The most crude being brute force with some cable types.  Coax can often easily be pushed down walls.</p>

<p>The most common way to fish cable is a fish tape:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/300/a8/a803fb12-07be-406e-8b0c-43b35648055f_300.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fish tape http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/300/a8/a803fb12-07be-406e-8b0c-43b35648055f_300.jpg</a></p>

<p>This is a flexible steel or fiberglass line that is wound up.  You extract it by holding the reel and pushing the handle.  To wrap it back up, you do the opposite motion.</p>

<p>In some cases (most often in drop ceilings) you can use rods to pass the cable around:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/300/19/192922d1-ff25-48eb-93ee-795ac741242e_300.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rods http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/300/19/192922d1-ff25-48eb-93ee-795ac741242e_300.jpg</a></p>

<p>If it is a short distance, the cheapest and easiest thing to use is a metal coat hanger. </p>

<p>With all methods, you feed it from one area to another and then pull the wire back out.  It doesn't usually matter what direction you go, but you will find that with some routes, approaching it from one direction is easier than the other.  If the route doesn't match up with how you are feeding the wire (ie: it is coming from one side, but for whatever reason you need to fish from the other), you can pull a temporary line (nylon string) through with the fish tape, and then pull the wire back through with the temporary line.</p>

<p>Plan your routes well using a stud finder and other visual hints.  If you are lucky you will only need two holes.  In some tough scenarios you might need to cut another hole to allow you to pull the wire through.</p>

<p>A flexible drill bit can also be useful:</p>

"How do I approach new water stains on my ceiling?","59459","","<p>I am a brand new home owner with almost no experience with DIY stuff.  There was a few days of significant rain and now my wife noticed some stains on our 2nd floor ceiling that we are pretty sure weren't there before.  The stains aren't huge: probably about a half dozen spots that are between 2 and 10 inches in diameter.  They are all localized in an area of about 2 feet square.  When we bought the house a few weeks ago the inspector did not notice any problems with the roof or evidence of leaking but that was before Hurricane Irene rolled through.</p>

<p>I'm not really sure how to approach the problem.  It has stopped raining today and looking in the attic a bit I don't see any obvious place where water came through.  All of the insulation above the second floor ceiling looks dry.  Should I get up on the roof and look?  (A daunting proposition for someone of my skill level.)  Should I just call my homeowner's insurance to start a claim process?  (With $1000 deductible I'm not sure if that is the right play.)  Should I wait until it rains again and go up in the attic and look for leaks?  Should I just watch the stain to see if it gets worse?</p>
","<p>I have had several calls since Irene for similar problems on roofs that had previously had no leaks.  As most have already said, the first step is to get up in the attic for a visual inspection.  I would remove the insulation over the stained area to check for damp insulation and allow the ceiling drywall to dry completely.  Look straight up over the stain area on rafters or trussed for any signs of water staining.  You may get lucky and be able to trace a stain trail to the source of the leak. It is not uncommon that in a storm with wind driven rain for water to be forced uphill into a ridge vent, then track down a framing member. If this is the case, it was an isolated incident and no repair may be needed.  However if the winds lifted a few shingles or damaged the seals around vent pipes etc., some simple repairs may solve the problem.</p>

<p>A word of caution, if you call in a professional roofer, get more than one opinion.  It is very common in that trade to try to up sell uninformed home owners on a whole new roof at around $350 per 100 sq foot, rather than just offer a simple inexpensive repair. I would try to find a reputable general contractor in your area that will work with you as you learn more about home ownership and give you expert advise and recommend reputable tradesmen for roofing, plumbing, electrical etc., as needed. The best way to find such a resource is by referral from other homeowners or friends. Rarely will a really good GC advertise, as they are too busy already and get plenty of work from referrals from their customer base. Sometimes you can chat with a project pro at a local building materials center, even a Home Depot or Lowes and they may give up the names of a couple of good, well respected home maintenance general contractors. </p>

"Is is safe to plug a surge protector into a 2-prong outlet using a 3-to-2-prong adapter?","59437","","<p>I live in an apartment that has essentially no 3-prong electrical outlets. I need to plug in a modest amount of computer equipment (which has a mix of 2- and 3-prong plugs), and I want to plug this equipment into surge protectors. Physically, I can accomplish this using cheap 3- to 2-prong adapters, but is that safe?</p>

<p>In part, my question is, what happens when a surge protector does its thing? One plausible scenario is that it dumps the excess energy into the ground conductor, which seems like it could pose a much worse problem than damaged equipment if that ground is poor or nonexistent.</p>

<p>This is in Colorado if that matters.</p>

<p>These questions seem related but don't directly answer the surge protector safety question:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/4496/"">What to do with an apartment with only 2-pronged outlets</a></li>

<li><a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/1722/"">Is it unsafe if some three prong outlets don&#39;t properly test as grounded?</a></li>
</ul>
","<p><a href=""http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/everyday-tech/surge-protector1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">According to howstuffworks.com</a> the most common type of surge protectors contain a metal oxide varistor or a gas discharge arrestor that utilizes the grounding wire to divert extra current.</p>

<p>However, as others have commented, the neutral wire is usually also used in conjunction with the ground, and therefore, you should get some, but not full protection when bypassing the 3rd prong.</p>

<p>That said, it's never considered safe to use bypass the 3rd prong (even with 2 to 3 prong adapters) and it is likely your insurance / the manufactures insurance will not cover damages caused as a result of such use.</p>

<p>Is a circular saw DIY repairable? If so, where would I start looking?</p>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>Sorry, here is what I've tried.</p>

<ul>
<li>Verified outlet has power.</li>
<li>Removed blade and blew out all debris (doesn't work with blade out either).</li>
<li>Jiggled the cable.  :)</li>
</ul>
","<p>Here's a first-stab at a troubleshooting guide:</p>

<p><strong>With the unit unplugged and/or the battery removed:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Visually inspect the tool...</p>

<ol>
<li>Is anything potentially jamming a mechanism?</li>
<li>Are the air vents clogged?</li>
<li>Has the unit been exposed to too much dust, ash, water and/or fine sawdust?</li>
<li>Is the case discolored or cracked at any spot?  </li>
<li>On the power cord, is the insulation cracked at any point or is one or more strain-reliefs damaged or missing (especially where the cord enters the tool)?</li>
<li>Are the plug contacts reasonably straight and untarnished?</li>
<li>Is a fuse or reset button present?  Is it blown or popped out?</li>
<li>Was the tool used until it might have become too hot?  Many tools have a safety, over-temperature shutoff; wait an hour for it to reset.</li>
<li>Is the safety switch/lock, if present, installed and/or on?</li>
<li>If the unit came with a grounded plug, be sure that it's undamaged and that the power plug really is a properly wired grounded outlet.  Use one of those <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0012DHVQ0"">circuit checkers</a> you can get for $2.</li>
<li>Has an oily, greasy, or varnishy fluid dripped or oozed out of any part of of the unit?  Grease could indicate bearing failure.  Other oozings would point to catastrophic motor damage, or sometimes electronics failure or starting capacitor failure.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Does the tool rotate/reciprocate relatively normally when moved by hand?</p></li>
<li>Does the the power switch feel normal?  Usually a busted switch will feel ""off"" (Pardon the pun.)</li>
<li>If you are comfortable with an ohmmeter, you can use it to do basic checks on the cord and switch.  Note that it is possible for a circuit to look okay with the meter and still be bad under load -- or for control electronics to be bad.  </li>
</ol>

<p><br>
<strong>With the unit powered:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Does the motor hum or smoke when turned on? (Of course, Immediately switch it back off if it does this.)</li>
<li>Does a circuit breaker trip?</li>
<li>Do you feel an electric shock?</li>
<li>Does the motor arc excessively?</li>
<li>Any unusual noises? Humming, or squealing?</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>If the visual inspection is failed, it should be obvious what to do.</p>

<ol>
<li>For a damaged cord, <strong>replace it</strong>. Do not attempt to repair it.</li>
<li>If the case is plastic and is discolored anywhere, it has likely degraded to the point that the tool is either unsafe or it's just not worth repairing.  Some <em>uniform</em> case discoloration due to age and UV exposure can be okay -- as long as the case is not also cracked or brittle.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the switch feels funny and/or nothing happens when it is turned on, then it could well be a busted switch -- which is pretty common.  You can sometimes <a href=""http://www.ereplacementparts.com/skil-saw-parts-c-130_162.html"">get replacement switches</a> at a reasonable price.</p>

<p>If the motor arcs excessively (a little visible arcing is normal), the brushes may need replacing.  Do not run the tool if you suspect brushes, you can permanently damage the motor.</p>

<p>If the motor hums or smokes, it's typically one of these problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>Something is mechanically jammed.</li>
<li>Bad switch.</li>
<li>Bad power cord.</li>
<li>Bad control electronics, if any.</li>
<li>Bad, broken, or burnt internal wiring.</li>
<li>Bad brushes or damaged commutator plates.</li>
<li>Bad starting capacitor (if used).</li>
<li>Bad starting coil.</li>
<li>Improper outlet voltage and/or grounding.</li>

","<p>Probably yes.  And probably an oil based primer unless the can says otherwise.  On top of that a concrete primer if they exist.  If you don't prime then you run the risk of the paint peeling, especially since garage floors are so smooth.  Plus you might run through way more paint than you think and need to get more since concrete is so porous, it will soak it up like  a sponge. You don't have to of course, but how much is the paint vs primer? If paint is more get the primer as well.  And get an extension pole for the roller and everything will go fast.</p>

"How can I figure out why my washing machine is tripping the GFCI receptacle?","58452","","<p>I have a Kenmore 80 Series (Model No. 110.24872300) washing machine which up to this point has been working fine. Since it is near a sink, the outlet it is plugged into is a GFCI outlet. On the last load I came back after letting it run for some time to find that it had tripped the GFCI in the middle of the wash cycle - the washer was still full of soapy water. I reset the outlet and let it run again, only to come down the next morning and find it full of water still (it had tripped during the rinse cycle this time). I reset the outlet again and this time it finished the rest of the cycle.</p>

<p>My guess is that water is somehow getting onto the internal components of the washer and causing it to short - is there any way I can test this theory or fix the problem myself?</p>
","<p>(Summarizing the comments above)</p>

<p>To narrow this problem down, there are three places that could be causing the GFCI to trip, a malfunction in the washing machine, a problem with the downstream wiring (aka load side of the GFCI), or the GFCI outlet itself. If there isn't anything downstream, then plugging the washing machine into another GFCI outlet, or simply swapping out the outlet for a known good GFCI outlet, will identify if the outlet itself is faulty.</p>

<p>If the outlet trips when the washing machine isn't running and isn't even plugged in, then there's a fault in the wiring on the load side of the GFCI outlet.</p>

<p>If the issue is neither of the above, then running the washing machine and monitoring to see which step is occurring when the trip happens will isolate what part of the washing machine may be leaking current to a ground. It could be a certain water level, a motor being engaged, a transition step in the controller, etc.</p>

<li>drill a hole in the exterior wall and the header (from the attic) of the same wall</li>
<li>connect a 90° joint to Corrugated Stainless Steel Tubing (CSST), drop it through the hole drilled in the header and fish it through the hole in the exterior wall</li>
<li>connect a short piece of black pipe to the elbow, and connect it to the regulator installed by the propane supplier</li>

<ol>
<li>from what I've read CSST is the way to go, but how do you protect it from fasteners going into the wall?</li>
<li>I assumed short legs of black pipe should be used at the ends, since it probably looks better coming out of the wall, unless...is there some kind of wall plate/jack that could be used?</li>
</ol>

<p>Is this approach generally sound? Anything else I should consider?</p>
","<p>Corrugated pipe is generally intended only to be used as the last connection to an appliance, in a living space where it not vulnerable to banging or jostling (usually behind or in a space at the bottom of an appliance), but where it can be seen and accessed if work is being done.  It is not intended to be buried in a wall, where it could be pierced by a random fastener driven blindly.</p>

<p>It is also only used where an appliance needs to be moved to connect or disconnect it to the supply line. In all other cases and places, solid black pipe should be used, not corrugated. Solid should be run to the connection right before the stove, a cutoff valve should be installed at that point before attaching a short length of corrugated between the stove and the valve.</p>

<p>Having said all this, I join in the various suggestions that you engage a professional plumber (pipefitter). I know how to do it, I have done it in the past, and I would NOT do it again. The risks are <em>very</em> high, and a simple oversight (common to many a DIYer) is disastrous. The pros avoid those oversights because of long practice.</p>

<li>Type of plumbing (e.g. PEX or Copper)</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, is there a preferred technique to check the temperature of the water after adjusting it?</p>
","<p>There are two main and opposing risks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Too high, and users get scalded </li>
<li>Too low, and you risk pathogens, particularly <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legionella"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Legionella</a> bacteria, which causes <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legionellosis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">legionellosis</a> (Legionnaires' disease)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Minimum temperature</h1>

<h2>Legionella risk</h2>

<p>According to the paper <a href=""http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/emerging/legionella.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Legionella and the prevention of legionellosis,""</a> found at the World Health Organization website, temperature affects the survival of Legionella as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Above 70 °C (158 °F) - Legionella dies almost instantly</li>
<li>At 60 °C (140 °F) - 90% die in 2 minutes</li>
<li>At 50 °C (122 °F) - 90% die in 80–124 minutes, depending on strain</li>
<li>48 to 50 °C (118 to 122 °F) - Can survive but do not multiply</li>
<li>32 to 42 °C (90 to 108 °F) - Ideal growth range</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dishwashers</h2>

<p>Most current-model dishwashers have a minimum requirement of 49 °C (120 °F). Most have heaters and will heat the interior as needed. If yours is older you may want to check specifications.</p>

<p>Dishwasher detergent varies, but ""works best between 50 and 60 °C"" seems to be a fairly common statement. There is also cold-water detergent on the market that works at basically any temperature. </p>

<h1>Maximum temperature</h1>

<h2>Burn risk</h2>

<p>Setting too high can scald someone using the water. This is particularly easy because when you first open the tap, the water in the pipes has cooled down some, and so its temperature will rise (possibly dramatically) once the water from the tank reaches the point of use. </p>

<p>Young children are at higher risk because their skin is thinner. Some people, especially the elderly, are at higher risk because they may be less sensitive and slower to move away from scalding water.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recommends setting to 49 °C (120 °F) </li>
</ul>

<h1>Piping Concerns</h1>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.legionellaprevention.org/Common%20Piping%20Problems/Piping%20Problems.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LegionellaPrevention.o</a>:</p>

<h2>Dead legs</h2>

<p>Dead legs (branches that are capped off or rarely used) contain stagnant water that can be an ideal breeding ground for bacteria which can contaminate the entire system. This should not be surprising as the water in the dead leg would get warm, but never hot to the temperature of the main flow.</p>

<ul>

<p>Copper in theory would cool down faster than PEX <em>(Ed: I can't find any studies on this)</em> but given enough time (likely a couple hours), the temperature of both would cool to the ambient temperature. There's a separate question that discusses <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/q/314/157"">if it's worthwhile to insulate pipes</a>, but even with insulation, the water in the pipes will eventually cool to ambient.</p>

<h1>Conflicting Views</h1>

<p>From <a href=""https://canadasafetycouncil.org/home-safety/heated-debate-about-hot-water"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Heated Debate about Hot Water</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The country’s top experts, represented on the Canadian Commission on Building and Fire Codes (CCBFC), have rejected the lower maximum hot water tank temperature of 49 °C. In spite of this, trusted organizations are telling homeowners to lower their hot water tank temperature to 49 °C as a precaution against scalds from tap water. Some even offer tips on how to find the thermostat so you can adjust it yourself. </p>
  
  <p>The bottom line is that water must be stored at a high temperature as a precaution against bacteria. It can be delivered from the tap at a lower temperature to prevent scalds. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The article <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2094925/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Residential water heater temperature: 49 or 60 degrees Celsius?</a> published in the Canadian Journal of Infectious Diseases concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In our opinion, it is important to reduce both the risk of scalds and the risk of legionellosis associated with domestic water supplies.</p>
  
  <p>For water heaters servicing a single housing unit:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Electric water heaters should be set at 60 °C to limit the risk of Legionella contamination, and equipped with anti-scald devices to deliver water at 49 °C to the entire household.</li>
  <li>Gas or oil water heaters should be set at 49 °C, because the risk of scalding is greater with these devices. </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>For water heaters servicing multiple unit housing complexes:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>More complex water distribution systems are more likely to be contaminated, and the recommendations from the WHO should apply no matter what type of water heater is used: hot water must be stored at 60 °C inside the water heater by ensuring, at least once a day, the temperature reaches at least 60 °C in the entire tank. 
  
  <ul>
  <li>Moreover, water should reach the tap at a temperature of at least 50 °C. </li>
  <li>Taps in these buildings, especially in the bath or shower where most scalds occur, should be equipped with anti-scald devices to decrease the water temperature to 49 °C or less.</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>Absolute Ideal Scenario</h2>

<p>The best scenario seems to be to install anti-scald mixing valves at each human point of use (e.g., sinks, tubs): whether it be integrated in a shower valve, or installed under the sink.</p>

<ul>
<li>The tank gets set to the WHO-recommended 60 °C. </li>
<li>Each human point-of-use is limited to the CPSC-recommended 49 °C (120 °F)

<ul>
<li>You may even want it lower (e.g., 110 °F) in kid's bathrooms. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Other uses -- dishwasher, washing machine, humidifier -- can get the full 60 °C with no issue.</li>
</ul>

<p>The downside to this, of course, is cost: you need to install the valves on each hot water tap. For sinks, this is relatively easy to retrofit; for tubs/showers it may be more difficult. </p>

"Is it possible to use the ice maker on a refrigerator without a water supply line?","57967","","<p>Our department just moved physical locations.  We were able to bring the fridge from our previous break room, but our new location does not have a water line anywhere nearby for the ice maker.  The simple solution, of course, is to just use ice cube trays, but I would really like it to be constantly producing ice (not have to rely on coworkers to refill the trays).  </p>

<p>My thought is to get a 1-2 gallon container, and hook the water line into the bottom and then set it on top of the fridge.  This way you can refill it in large quantities at once, rather than tray by tray.  The container would be clear, to see the water level and to see if it needs to be cleaned, and with a lid to keep out dust.  With the container sitting above the fridge, gravity should provide sufficient pressure to supply the maker with water.</p>

He said 12,200 W / 240 V = 51A minimum.</p>

<p>However, I told him that the specs and installation guide state that the range only needs a 40A circuit and the manufacturer confirmed that this isn't a mistake.</p>

<p>So what gives?  Is the equation the electrician is using incorrect? </p>
","<p>One of my favorite code sections, which basically says RTFM...</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>National Electrical Code 2014</h1>
  
  <h2>Article 110 Requirements for Electrical Installations</h2>
  
  <h3>I. General</h3>
  
  <p><strong>110.3 Examination, Identification, Installation and Use of Equipment.</strong>  </p>
  
  <p><strong>(B) Installation and Use.</strong> Listed or labeled equipment shall be installed and used in accordance with any instructions included in the listing or labeling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the installation manual says that 40 ampere overcurrent protection is required, then 40 ampere overcurrent protection is all that's required.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Extra Reading.</h1>

<p>If you read further through the code, you'll get to article 422. There you'll find 422.10, which says.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Article 422 Appliances</h2>
  
  <h3>II. Installation</h3>
  
  <p><strong>422.10 Branch Circuit Rating.</strong>  </p>
  
  <p><strong>(A) Individual Circuits.</strong> ...<br>
  ... Branch circuits and branch circuit conductors for household ranges and cooking appliances shall be permitted to be in accordance with Table 220.55 and shall be sized in accordance with 210.19(A)(3).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This says that instead of simply using the rated values directly, you can use values found in these other code sections instead. If you look at Table 220.55, you'll find that if you only have 1 range, you can use 8 kW instead of the rated 12 kW.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Article 220 Branch Circuit, Feeder, and Service Calculations</h2>
  
  <h3>III. Feeder and Service Load Calculations</h3>
  
  <p><strong>220.55 Electric Ranges and Other Cooking Appliances — Dwelling Unit(s).</strong> The load for household electric ranges, wall-mounted ovens, counter-mounted cooking units, and other household cooking appliances individually rated in excess of 1 3/4 kW shall be permitted to be calculated in accordance with Table 220.55.

  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VNljd.png"" alt=""Table 220.55""></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that you'd only have a demand of 33.33 amperes.</p>

<p><code>8000 W / 240 V = 33.33 A</code>  </p>

<p>However, we also have to take 210.19(A)(3) into account, which says...</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Article 210 Branch Circuits</h2>
  
  <h3>II. Branch-Circuit Ratings</h3>
  
  <p><strong>210.19 Conductors -- Minimum Ampacity and Size.</strong> </p>

  <p><strong>(3) Household Ranges and Cooking Appliances.</strong> Branch circuit conductors supplying household ranges, wall-mounted ovens, counter-mounted cooking units, and other household cooking appliances shall have an ampacity not less than the rating of the branch circuit and not less than the maximum load to be served. For ranges of 8 3/4 kW or more rating, the minimum branch-circuit rating shall be 40 amperes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that since you have a range with a rating more than 8 3/4 kW, the minimum circuit rating is 40 amperes.  So despite the fact that you used Table 220.55 to calculate a rating of 33.33 amperes, the circuit cannot be less than 40 amperes.  Therefore, you'll install conductors rated for 40 amperes, and a 40 ampere overcurrent device.</p>

"Should we skim-coat or drywall over a textured plaster wall to smooth it out?","57625","","<p>Our new house has textured plaster walls that my wife and I don't like.  We originally wanted to skim coat the walls to smooth them out, but a contractor suggested that we could put up drywall over it instead since we have some room to give on our baseboards and trim.  He also thought it'd be cheaper and quicker to do so.</p>

<p>In addition we are going to be doing quite a bit of rewiring (removing knob and tube) and there are plenty of places where the plaster is cracking, so there is some repair work to be done beyond just skim coating the plaster in places.</p>

<p>This is somewhat related to <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/12468/can-i-drywall-over-plaster"">this question</a> but rather than being a single crack we're talking about most of the walls in a 1400 sq ft home, built in 1925.</p>

<p>Something about putting the drywall over the plaster makes me uneasy...  Which should I do, and what are the relative pros and cons of each?</p>

<p>Our ceilings are also textured and we'd like to smooth them out, but I feel better about throwing drywall up over the plaster there.  What about that?</p>
","<p>Here's my take on drywall vs skim vs full update.</p>

<h2>Skimcoat</h2>

<p>Skim coating over the plaster that is already cracking would not be a good idea.  Even if you use a harder more durable mud or plaster, it will still most likely crack because of the age of your house, and the fact that your walls are already cracking (and will probably continue to do so).  The other down side is the sanding mess. </p>

<p>I recently bought a condo that had nasty texture as well on the walls which I wanted to get rid of.  I decided for the first room that I would use a heavy 60 grit paper to remove as much of the larger chunky texture as I could.  I then skim coated with drywall mud to smooth out the walls.  It took several coats to get perfectly smooth, and a whole lot of cleaning afterward.  But, in my case, I know my drywall is sound and not cracking underneath, so I could reliable coat without having to worry about patching too much in the future.</p>

<h2>Drywall</h2>

<p>Using a thin drywall layer over the top may be a quicker and cheaper solution.  This will eliminate the cracking issues and will give you as smooth a wall as you like, with little mess in comparison to skim coating the entire wall.  </p>

<p>I would still use a 60 grit paper or paint scraper (if it will cut through your texture) and knock down as much of the heavy texture to allow the drywall to sit closer to the surface.  This will help eliminate waviness in the wall where the texture might be outrageous (like it was in my house), and allow you to use a thinner drywall.</p>

<p>A possible major downside to this is electrical boxes?  Maybe someone with more electrical knowledge can speak whether adding 1/2 inch thickness to a wall would cause issues with the electrical boxes being set further in?  If so, again, I would sand and use 1/4 inch.</p>

<h2>Full Update</h2>

<p>If I was going to be living in this house for the rest of my life, I would consider a full update, especially if I was already going to be making changes to wiring.</p>

<p>This solution is costly, time consuming, and messsssy!  But, the upside is that you can fix/update your electrical to be safer, and more suitable to modern appliances.  You can also add low voltage through the house which (if you're a tech nerd like me) may be a nice plus. This will also give you perfectly smooth walls that won't crack and a feeling that your not hiding a mess in your walls.</p>

<p>Hope this is helpful!</p>

","<p>I don't think there is ever a ""maximum"" you can have on a horizontal run.  Of course everything needs to have the required slope and you may not have enough vertical space to get it.  The required slope depends on the size of the pipe.</p>

<p>IPC table 704.1 shows that a pipe with an ID of 2.5"" or less needs 1/4"" per foot.  While a pipe that is 3"" to 6"" only needs 1/8"" per foot.</p>

<p>In your case, with 2.5"" or smaller pipe and a developed length of 35 feet you need a total drop of 8 3/4 inches (or put another way, the pipe must start 8 3/4 inches above where you will connect to the stack).  For 3 to 6 inch pipe you just need 4.375"" of drop.</p>

","<p>I'd like to write an answer on the overall methodology on how to pick where to align a floor, but I don't have the chops for that. But in your case, I do have a suggestion.</p>

<p>One of the principles of flooring installation is that it's more important to look straight than to actually be straight. For example, you have that architectural detail separating the two rooms. I think it would look more odd if the flooring did not line up with that detail than if you had a wedge shaped piece against a wall. Snap a chalk line down the middle, measure from that line to within a few inches of the starting wall, and snap a second line parallel to the first. Align your first piece with the second line. Then every couple of rows, measure to make sure you are still parallel with the first chalk line.</p>

<p>An alternative would be to snap the first chalk like as I described above and start from the middle of the room(s) and work your way out. Depending on the type of tongue and groove and nailing method, this may not be possible.</p>

","<p>There are different standards to pipes and threads. Your issue is that you are trying to mix two different threaded standards.</p>

<p>What is shown in your photo is compression fittings which have a straight or running thread. The seal is made by either a ferrule or a rubber washer.</p>

<p>They are 7.5w, and have 150 LED lights over a span of 5m and the website states that they are 12V. But I am not sure what transformer/driver to use for these lights. The QA section, below the product description mention:</p>

<p><em>"" To work out what transformer you require this is quite simple. You take the amount of LED tape you have in metres and x this by the wattage of the LED tape you have, again per metre.
For example 7m of 4.8w LED tape: 7 x 4.8w = 33.6w Therefore you would require a 60w transformer. ""</em></p>

<p>So for 5 meter of 7.5watts the calculation is 5 x 7.5 = 37.5W
The website has power transformers, but at 100W and 150W, and when I rang them they were out of stock and the prices for the transformers were about 3 times what I can see on ebay. </p>

<p>Firstly, <strong>can I use a transformer that is producing 40W which is just above the 37.5W that I need, instead of a 150W transformer that they sell and claim is compatible for this LED strip</strong>?</p>

","<p>Yes, you can use a 40w transformer to power your 37.5w load. However, given the quality of these small power supplies, running at 90%+ all the time will cause heat and premature failure probably. </p>

<p>You will need to drive the LEDs at 12v. Running them at 15-18v (or anything over 12!) is a bad idea for the life of the LED.  You will need to put a resistor on an 18v supply to bring it down.  I'd recommend simply getting the 150w 12v supply.  Wattage/amperage is different than volts, where you can use a higher powered power supply and the connected lights will only draw what they need (example: running a 12v 50w light bulb from a 12v power supply rated at 150w is fine. Running a 6v 50w bulb on the same power supply is not fine).</p>

"How should I clean and repaint a painted wooden deck?","56843","","<p>My deck appears to have been painted with just a single layer of paint, which is now peeling off.  I like the look of the paint (when it's in better condition, of course), and am uninterested in staining, especially because I'll be adding some new <a href=""http://www.ufpi.com/product/wdeck/wdeckimage/Beveled1EndBaluster2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">balusters</a> which may not necessarily match the existing wood.  I'd like to clean, prime, and repaint the entire deck, and have a few questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do I need to actually strip the existing paint?  Or can I just follow <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/a/4974/910"">this cleaning method</a> (power wash, scrub with bleach/water/TSP)?</li>
<li>Because I don't particularly care about the discoloration of the underlying wood, is the above-mentioned chemical cleaning necessary?  Or can I just pressure wash, wait to dry, then start priming?</li>
<li>Should I prime/paint/stain the underside of the deck?  While I want paint on the top, I'd be okay with staining the underside, if necessary.</li>
<li>What kind of primer/paint should I use?  This deck is in Illinois and experiences hot summers, cold winters, and plenty of moisture.</li>
</ul>

","<p>Painting a pressure treated wood deck is always tricky. Pressure treated wood does not seem to hold paint well, even with a good primer. Stain is usually a better alternative, but since your deck already has paint, it would have to be stripped completely before using stain. </p>

<p>In order for the paint to stick fairly well, the surface needs to be as clean and dry as possible. Looking at your pictures, I see a fair amount of algae in the grain of the wood. This is a very normal condition. You should however, use the pressure washer and bleach/water/TSP shrub down method to clean it up. I'd wait until April or May when temps are up in the 60's to 70's to help dry the deck and open the grain. </p>

<p>Select a high grip primer rather than a stain blocking type. Many manufactures have come out with new formulas that are designed to bond better. When you apply the primer, don't rush. Simply rolling on primer too quickly is not good. The primer needs to be brushed into the grain as deeply as possible.  Let it dry completely.  Now you can apply your deck paint as normal.  </p>

"How can I sound proof bathroom walls?","56488","","<p>I'm trying to figure out the best, least intrusive way of sound proofing the walls of a bathroom. The bathroom shares a wall with my bedroom, and my 3 yea old's bedroom. The main problem is the sound of water running (plus every bump on the counter and everything) echos loud and clear through the wall into my sons room.  I found <a href=""http://www.quietrock.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">sound deadening drywall</a> and it seems like a good choice. Another option is adding another layer fo drywall with something like <a href=""http://www.greengluecompany.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Green Glue</a> between them. But all the walls and ceilings in the house are textured. So replacing just one or two walls in a room is just not possible. </p>

<p>This is the layout of the two rooms. I've added red box around the wall with the most noise.<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ba1NQ.jpg"" alt=""house layout""></p>

<p>Is there anything else I'm missing here that I could do to dampen the noise short of tearing the bathroom apart?</p>
","<p>I wouldn't tear the bathroom wall apart... I'd tear the bedroom wall apart.  What you are experiencing is the noise traveling through mechanical connections to the wall (screwed to studs) and the noise from the water passing through thin copper pipe (probably the Type M pipe rather than the thicker Type L).  </p>

<p>The only effective way I know of is to insulate that wall with Roxul Safe and Sound.  It's an insulation designed for noise.... and noise only.  It doesn't burn.  To go the added mile, use resilient channels before hanging the drywall.  The demo is probably a DIY, the installation of the Roxul is DIY, and the drywall.... call someone.  For a few hundred bucks the repair will disappear.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:
Blown in insulation will not work... blown in is for warmth, not sound. It's the sound transfer you're trying to conquer. We once built a house and insulated the walls with thermal insulation, thinking just like you are. It didn't work. We had the type L pipe, all the plumbing was fastened with cushioned fasteners. We thought we had it knocked. Turned out, it was a waste of money.</p>

<p>If you truly want to fix it, just take down the drywall and do it the right way with the Roxul. Going into a wet wall from the bathroom side is a suicide mission. Building an offset wall will create a door opening that's 10""... with a door that has a 5"" jamb. Then there's the carpet... or other flooring surface. It sounds like a difficult job, but it's probably only one weekend.</p>

<p>Otherwise, just buy your son some foam ear plugs at Costco and call it a day.</p>

"How should I waterproof an upstairs bathroom floor?","56341","","<p>I'm adding on a bathroom upstairs.  My question is what precautions should I take to waterproof it.  I'll have new copper, PVC drains and the floor itself I'm worried about.  It's sitting half above a bedroom and the pipes will be running around the studs.</p>

<p>1) Is there anything I should do to the studs/drywall underneath to minimize issues in case of a leak in the PVC/copper supply plumbing?</p>

<p>2) What's best to put on top of the sub floor.  I was thinking of doing one piece of laminate flooring, should I put something underneath it, are there certain products that are better?  There will be a pre-fab shower and I'd rather not do any tile in this bathroom.</p>

<p>3) Should this flooring run completely under the shower?  Anything special I should do while setting the toilet/sink to keep it waterproof.</p>
","<p>Most of the floor of a bathroom should not see any great water leaks or standing water. The average puddle you make getting out of the shower before you can towel off will not pose any great threat. If your plumbing work is up to code, that shouldn't be a concern either. However, a plumbing emergency can pose a greater threat.</p>

<p>For laminate floors, it is generally a good idea to lay down a layer of moisture barrier, like Tyvek, between the sub-floor and laminate, and if the sub-floor is over concrete (doesn't seem to be the case here) another layer between the concrete and the subfloor. This prevents the transfer of liquid water between the layers of the floor, while still allowing the layers to adjust to changes in humidity without forming condensation. For the majority of the bathroom floor this should provide ample leakage protection if properly installed.</p>

<p>Make sure that the laminate, once installed, is well-sealed; laminate's great for providing a wood-like floor, but if water gets under the waterproof (or water-tolerant) top layer of the laminate and into the particle board underneath, the boards will swell and your floor will be ruined. A poly or acrylic topcoat will seal the cracks between planks and help protect the flooring; your flooring dealer can probably recommend a product that's compatible with your particular brand of laminate.</p>

<p>Where you really need to take care is in the shower area. If you have a tiled shower, behind that tile needs to be a waterproof barrier which will contain water that gets behind the tile grout (not waterproof) and direct it to the drain, instead of letting it contact the drywall or subfloor. It is not a terrible idea to install the same type of membrane everywhere in the bathroom, but it's probably overkill especially since you'll be wanting to prevent water even getting that far.</p>

<p>The main source of water leakage out of a bathroom, which you will likely not be able to prevent, is inside the walls. You probably won't know there's a problem until you hear water dripping onto your ceiling, or see that telltale tea-stain on a ceiling or wall. There is not a whole lot you can do to prevent this once the walls are up; the keys to prevention are in proper installation of the pipes in the first place. Minimizing joints in supply pipes, which can swell and shrink at different rates with temperature, and making sure all joints on all types of plumbing are well-sealed, are key to minimizing leaks. Any plumber worth his salt will use the appropriate joining materials liberally (solder and flux for copper pipe, glue for PVC/HDPE, rings and cement for PEX).</p>

"Should water heater thermostats be set to the same temperature?","56326","","<p>Should the top and bottom water heater thermostats be set to the same temperature?</p>

<p>I did a quick google search and saw all kinds of differing opinions.  for instance, this guy seems like he knows what he's doing:</p>

<p>my water heater's old, if that makes a difference.  I didn't see a date, but the energy sticker had some reference to 1994.  sorry I don't have more info; the thing's wedged back in a tight closet and hard to get to.</p>
","<p>Setting the top element slightly higher helps the elements to be used evenly.  If you set them to the same temperature, the bottom element will be the first one on every time, and frequently the only one used to maintain the temperature.  If you set the top element too much higher, then it will be used most of the time, and the bottom element acts more as a pre-heater.</p>

<p>Having them used evenly will spread out the minimum time to replacement.  But I wouldn't go through too big of an effort to change the settings on an old water heater.  Whenever your elements do go, or whenever you decide to change the temperature, that would be the time to make this adjustment.</p>

<h1>UPDATE:</h1>

<p>I finally got my hands on some of these things, and I'll tell you what. If you can pull the wires out through normal means once they're locked in, you deserve some type of prize.  I did find a way to pull the wires out, but I doubt they'll ever see enough movement while in use to allow the wires to slip out.  If you spin the wires back and forth while you pull, they will eventually work their way out (this is the official way to remove wires <a href=""http://diy.blogoverflow.com/2012/01/tool-review-ideal-in-sure-push-in-wire-connectors/#comment-71253"">according to an IDEAL spokesperson</a>).  Doing this chews the wire up pretty bad, leaving a bunch of nicks along the length of the wire.</p>

<p>They say not to reuse them, and I can see why. Removing the wire can leave fairly deep gouges in the wire. If you ever have to remove them, you'll likely have to trim the wire back and restrip it. However, Even after torturing them (including taking them apart), they still held the wire when it was reinserted.</p>

<p>So as long as your wiring is not subjected to constant twisting and pulling, you should have no problems with wires pulling out of these things.</p>

<h1>UPDATE:</h1>

<p>I think I finally found the relevant section in the code that would apply to these devices.</p>

"When I turn down the dimmer switch on my lights, do I actually use less electricity?","55439","","<p>My wife and I have several lights on dimmer switches throughout our home. We generally prefer the ambient lighting provided by dimmed lights. I am curious, though, if we are saving any electricity by dimming the lights. I feel like I read somewhere that dimmers work by rapidly turning on and off the current to a light, though it's just as likely I fundamentally don't understand how a dimmer switch works.</p>
","<p>Yes. And here's why.</p>

<h1>Rheostat dimmers</h1>

<p>Old dimmers, used a variable resister to dim the light. Lets look at a simple example.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fSPDr.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>We can find total resistance (RT), by adding up all the resistance.</p>

<p>RT = R1 + R2 = 0 Ohms + 144 Ohms = <strong>144 Ohms</strong></p>

<p>Then we can find the total current (IT).</p>

<p>IT = ET / RT = 120V / 144 Ohms = <strong>.83A</strong></p>

<p>We'll then calculate the voltage across each resistive load.</p>

<p>E1 = IT * R1 = .83A * 0 Ohms = <strong>0V</strong></p>

<p>E2 = IT * R2 = .83A * 144 Ohms = <strong>120V</strong></p>

<p>Finally, we'll calculate the total wattage (WT)</p>

<p>WT = V^2/R = 120V ^2 / 144 Ohms = <strong>100 Watts</strong></p>

<p>Lets see what happens when we increase the resistance of R1</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gvvSH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>RT = 200 Ohms + 144 Ohms = <strong>344 Ohms</strong></p>

<p>IT = 120V / 344 Ohms = <strong>.349A</strong></p>

<p>E1 = .349A * 200 Ohms = <strong>69.77V</strong></p>

<p>E2 = .349A * 144 Ohms = <strong>50.23V</strong></p>

<p>WT = 120V ^2 / 344 = <strong>41.86 Watts</strong></p>

<p>As you can see, we've increased the resistance of R1 and effectively reduced the voltage across R2. And now we have a dim light.</p>

<h1>Thyristor dimmer</h1>

<p>Modern dimmers use a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIAC"">TRIAC</a>, to reduce the amount of time the light is on. However, because of the circuitry in the dimmer, there is not a direct 1:1 energy savings. Dimming the light to 50%, will not equate to a 50% savings in electricity.</p>

<p>A typical waveform in an AC system would look like this.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NY3Vz.png"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<p>A TRIAC prevents electricity from flowing every time voltage reaches 0, something like this.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Eo3cP.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

"What tool should I use to cut memory foam?","54962","","<p>I need to cut 2x2 ft square pieces from a sheet of memory foam. Not sure what tool is best for this. Any ideas? In the future I'd like to cut circles and eventually sculpt irregular shapes, I don't know what tool can be used for this sort of job.</p>
","<p>For thicker pieces you might find you get better results by compressing the foam before cutting it. You could make a simple straight-line clamp out of a couple of 2x4s linked with a door hinge -- just put your foam in between, clamp the open end shut with a C-clamp, and use one edge of the wood as a guide for your cut. For your curved cuts it might make more sense to make a plywood die to match the final shape and press it down by hand or with something heavy before cutting around it. </p>

"Why are there bubbles in my bathroom toilet and sink?","54952","","<p>I have had a lot of really odd things happen in my bathroom this weekend and I want to make sure it is nothing too serious.</p>

<p>Ok so when I was taking a shower I heard the toilet bubble up. A few minutes later I noticed that my shower drain was going slower than normal.</p>

<p>So when I was done with my shower I took a plunger to the shower and it pulled back some hair, etc.  I also noticed that when I flushed the toilet it did not want to drain quickly. I immediately turned the toilet off and then I also noticed that some of the water had backed up into shower.</p>

<p>With the hair I pulled out of the shower I figured I had a hair clog. I put some Drano down the shower to clear the hair and I don't have hair coming up when I plunge the shower now.</p>

<p>However I still have some really odd stuff happening in the bathroom. When the shower gets used for more than a few minutes, the toilet bubbles up and the shower drain slows down again. The shower will eventually drain (very slowly) and when the shower empties, the water in the toilet appears to drop until I can hear air coming in from the bottom. When I use the sink the toilet bubbles up and when I flush the toilet I hear what I assume is some bubbles coming up from the sink.</p>

<p>With a little research I have done on this it looks like it could be the drain pipe on my roof leaking or that my drain field is flooded (I live in Michigan and we have had a ton of rain over the last 3 weeks or so).</p>

<p>I guess I am wondering if both of these ideas are plausible and/or likely and if something like this warrants a calls to a plumber to have them investigate?</p>
","<p>There is a clog downstream from both of these drains.  If they are both at the lowest level of the house and you have a septic system, then it's conceivable that the problem is there, but you'd also see water backing up into that bathroom when you run any other showers/toilets in the house.</p>

<p>Most likely, the clog is in the joint in the drain lines where the shower and toilet join on their way out of the bathroom.  Get a snake to fish down the drain (probably best to do this in the shower to avoid damaging the toilet bowl) and expect to go down quite a few feet before you reach the problem.</p>

<p>Edit: Revisiting this question, I'd agree that there's also a likely vent blockage from the bubbling descriptions. But the fact that toilet water backs up into the shower points to a drain blockage, too, and that will be easier to fix.</p>

"How to cover an open/exposed wire fast and safe for a long period?","54820","","<p>I have a 3 pin socket on the wall that is broken and I'm going to fix it. And while at that, I also want to fix the wall (re-cement it and paint it again). After I dismantle the socket, the 3 wires will become exposed. Is there any special tool to cover it? I search in the web but found no such thing or even if there is I don't know what it is called. I'm imagining something like a non electrical-conducting clip that's sold cheaply so that I can buy as many as I want and cover every exposed wire when I'm working my thing. The reason I what such thing is:</p>

<ol>
<li>I don't want to power off the whole house electricity because I
might need to use some of my electrical tool (corded drill etc from
another power outlet).</li>
<li>Using insulation tape (not sure if this is the right word) is time
consuming (wrap and unwrap it) and will lead to sticky hand.</li>
<li>There are kids/people in the house and I might need to get to the
store in case I need to buy something.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm thinking of creating it myself by getting an unused tyre tube. Cut 2 pieces of 1cm x 1cm from it. And then glued each of it to each of the jaw of a plastic clip used for clothes hanging.</p>

<p>So my question is, do such thing exist cheaply for mass/bulk buying? If it doesn't, is the one I'm trying to create myself is safe enough? I lack science understanding and I only know that rubber doesn't conduct electricity. Also I'm very scared when doing electrical stuff because even using a test pen to test for electrical current sometimes I can feel heat or static. Thanks.</p>
","<p>What you want to do is terminate the wires in the junction box using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist-on_wire_connector"">Wire Nuts</a>.  Simply thread them on to the end of the exposed wire, and you need not worry about live wires touching, kids getting zapped, etc.  You should turn off the branch circuit in question (via a circuit breaker or removing a fuse) while removing the outlet and putting on the wire nuts.</p>

<p>If you need to have the box open for a more extended period of time, get a flat cover plate for the junction box (put on the wire nuts, tuck the wire back in the box, attach the cover plate).</p>

"How do I find the water main entry point to my house?","54747","","<p>My house has no apparent main water line shut off valve. Usually one would find a shut off valve right near where the water main entered the house structure. At my current house I have never been able to determine where the water main entry point is located. </p>

<p>I have a house that has a lower level that is on a slab level with my garage. The other 2/3 or the house is built over a crawl space. I have checked the crawl space and found no water line entry points there. It is not possible to see where the water lines are routed in my house because they are all embedded in walls and ceilings that are covered over with drywall. Even my garage area, furnace area, water heater area and laundry room are all finished over with drywall. Thus I have no idea where the source point for my water lines is located. </p>

<p>It is possible the water main comes up through the slab of the lower level of the house and immediately goes up into a wall where it is hidden away from view. It is equally possible that the line enters below ground level at the periphery of the house and not findable unless I decided to dig a deep moat all around my house. </p>

<p>Currently if I want to shut off all the water in my house I have to use a T-bar handle to shut it off by the street near the water meter. This would be a less than ideal situation in the case of a water leak emergency. It is just not feasible to expect family members to be able to find the T-bar handle and run out to the street to turn off the water. For this reason I want to find the water main entry point and install a proper shut-off valve. </p>

<p>I am looking for suggestions about how to go about finding the water main entry point to the house. And hopefully there is a suitable method that works without having to rip down tons of drywall. </p>

<p><strong>* Some Added Comments *</strong></p>

<p>The water meter is out by the street under a concrete cover about six inches from the curb.</p>

<p>The water meter is at the extreme corner of the lot to the side of the driveway away from the house. </p>

<p>The water company's input ends about about six inches over the edge of the curb!!</p>

<p>The house was built in ~1987.</p>

<p><strong>* UPDATE *</strong>
I have found the water main entry point!! This was located a few weeks ago when I replaced some iron pipe risers out of the top of the water heater that had corroded so bad that a small leak had started. The gas fired water heater sits in the back corner of an alcove off the side of the garage. (The forced air furnace is also in this alcove). As you can imagine it is a rather tight fit in this alcove. I found that the water main is a 3/4"" copper pipe that comes up through the concrete slab floor under the rear part of the water heater. It has an immediate 90 degree elbow that aims the water line toward an inside wall where it pokes into the wall through drywall. </p>

<p>Here is a rough diagram of the layout. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EJ8g5.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I will be working at opening the wall behind the water heater and installing a shut off valve there. Unfortunately it has to wait till a day when I can stay home from work and have the city utility folks come out and shut off the water main. I tried to shut off the water main with my T-bar handle but something is clearly wrong with the valve because it does not turn the water off when rotated either direction. I was able to move the valve through 90 degrees of rotation but no luck stopping the flow of the water.</p>
","<h1>Everybody wants to save money</h1>

<p>Builders and utility companies are not in the business of wasting money, which means the main line will be as straight and as short as possible.  This is a big help to you, since it will narrow your search.  Walk out to the curb shut off, and look back at your house.  Try to determine the straightest, shortest path between the curb shutoff and the house.  Now you'll have a general idea of where the line enters the home.</p>

<h1>Trace the line</h1>

<p>In most cases utilities bury a tracer wire in the trench above utility lines, to make the lines are easier to locate later.  If you call <a href=""http://www.call811.com/"">811</a> (assuming you are in the US, though I believe this service is offered in other areas as well), they should be able to send somebody out to locate the line for you. This will show you the approximate path the line takes to the house.</p>

<h1>Don't let pipes freeze</h1>

<p>Because it's a water line, it will likely enter your house below the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost_line"">frost line</a>.  If you can determine the frost depth in your area, you'll have a more targeted area to search.</p>

<h1>People are idiots</h1>

<p>It's not uncommon for people to do dumb things, especially when they don't know how dumb they are.  Water meters and shutoffs are ugly, and nobody wants them in their newly remodeled living space. It's possible that your valve has been walled up, and you'll have to remove some finish material to find it.  Look in closets, and keep an eye out for access panels.   </p>

<h1>If only you had X-ray eyes</h1>

<p>There are a few tools that can help you search a wall where you suspect the valve might be. A stud finder should be able to locate pipes in the walls, depending on the stud finder you buy.  A metal detector will find anything metal, so that could also come in handy.  If you've got a bunch of cash to throw around, a thermal camera may be able to actually see the pipe through the wall. </p>

<h1>Where does service enter?</h1>

<p>After reading the update to the question, and then reading through building code.  It seems that it <em>may</em> be possible that there is not a shutoff valve where the line enters the building.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>International Residential Code 2009</strong><br>
  <strong>P2903.9.1 Service valve.</strong> Each dwelling unit shall be provided with an accessible main shutoff valve near the entrance of the water
  service. The valve shall be of a full-open type having nominal
  restriction to flow, with provision for drainage such as a bleed
  orifice or installation of a separate drain valve. Additionally, the
  water service shall be valved at the curb or property line in
  accordance with local requirements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to this, there must be a shutoff valve ""<em>near the entrance of the service</em>"". However, in most cases the water meter has to be near the ""<em>entrance of the service</em>"" too.  In your case, it may be that the ""<em>entrance of the service</em>"" is at the property line, and not at the building. So there may actually be no shutoff valve inside the house. </p>

"Is there an approved way of fixing a cracked Fiberglass Tub/Shower?","54663","","<p>I noticed a crack in the bottom of my tub, and noticed that it flexed when I stepped near it.</p>

<p>I called in 2 companies to give me an estimate on repair.  The first, proposed a more or less straightforward fiberglass repair: laying down a new full sheet of fiberglass on the bottom of the tub and then a partial re-coating.</p>

<p>The second proposed a more expensive option that seems more long-term, but is much more radical.  They proposed cutting out the entire bottom of the tub and then pouring in new concrete to create a new support for the tub bottom.  Then, they would re-attach the tub bottom with fiberglass repair materials and do a partial re-coating.</p>

<p>This second method, while radical, seems to address the root issue.  However, in trolling the home repair areas of the internet, I do not find mention of this method.  That makes me insecure.  It is also double the price of the first approach.</p>

","<p>I'm not familiar with the second approach but, as you say, it would address the root issue of the tray flexing when in use and should prevent the problem recurring. It also does seem to be rather radical.</p>

<p>The main drawback I can see is that you are causing more ""damage"" to the tray and therefore increasing the risk of the repair failing.</p>

<p>I'd ask the company if you can contact (or be contacted by) someone else who's had this done so you can ask them what they thought of the procedure. Ideally you'd be able to see the end result and check out for yourself before proceeding. If the firm is reputable they should have no problem with this. In fact refusing this would be a sign that the firm wasn't as reliable as they made out.</p>

I don't have the money to get it professionally plastered so I ask;  What is the best way to smooth them out?  Can I sand them?  Is it possible to cover them with drywall? </p>
","<p>The best solution is to get them replastered. However, this is a messy and expensive job as you need to hack off the old plaster first. The expense comes from hiring a plasterer.</p>

<p>The cheapest solution is to cover them with drywall. This will give you a nice smooth wall.</p>

<p>You can glue the drywall directly to the plaster which will work if the current plaster is not too uneven. A better finish will be obtained if you batten the walls first ensuring that the battens are vertical and level horizontally. However, as @Tester101 points out you'll have to ""pull out"" all your sockets and light switches and have issues around door and window frames.</p>

<p>A better solution would be to rip the plaster off and then plasterboard, again either gluing or battening depending on the quality of the wall. Battening would allow you to add insulation and/or a void for feeding any cables you might want to add (ethernet, coaxial, power) in the future. This is still messy, but should be cheaper.</p>

<p>Sanding is possible, but it <strong>will</strong> generate a lot of dust and is a lot of effort for indeterminate results. If the plastering isn't too bad you might get a good finish, but you will have to skim the walls again to get a really smooth finish.</p>

","<p>To answer all the issues you raise would require a book on US electrical wiring. Or several. And a copy of the Code.</p>

<p>The vast majority of outlets in residences in the US are attached to branch circuits that are rated at 15 Amps and 120 Volts. Current practice and code calls for outlets like <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/Leviton-15-Amp-Tamper-Resistant-Duplex-Outlet-White-R62-T5320-00W/100662608#.UhX-f5KKK8A"" rel=""noreferrer"">these</a></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/puTzV.jpg"" alt=""outlet""></p>

<p>This version is tamperproof, required in many jurisdictions. The non-tamperproof look similar, but the slots do not have internal baffles</p>

<p>You may see different styles, such as Decora, or decorator style, which are functionally identical to basic outlets, but have a rectangular face</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ym1hX.jpg"" alt=""decora outlet""></p>

<p>20 Amp circuits generally require slightly different outlets (if you are going to draw the full 20 Amps or there is only one outlet on the line) like <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/Leviton-20-Amp-Commercial-Duplex-Power-Outlet-White-R62-CBR20-00W/202066702#.UhX-qZKKK8A"" rel=""noreferrer"">these</a></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bymwl.jpg"" alt=""20a outlet""></p>

<p>But you can also find the lower 15 Amp outlets on circuits that are properly wired for 20 amps. Obviously 15 Amp outlets are limited in use to 15 Amp appliances, even if they are on a 20 Amp line.</p>

<p>Certain locations, especially where there is a risk of moisture, such as bathrooms, require a ground fault interruper (<a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/Leviton-SmartLockPro-15-Amp-GFCI-Duplex-Outlet-with-Red-Black-Buttons-White-R72-N7599-0RW/203425810#.UhYAXZKKK8A"" rel=""noreferrer"">GFI</a>) type outlet </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LCOti.jpg"" alt=""gfi outlet""></p>

<p>These also come in tamper resistant and 20 Amp versions and vary like the basic outlets.</p>

<p>All of the above are grounded outlets, required in almost every jurisdiction for new construction and renovations.  Some older installations may have <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/Leviton-15-Amp-2-Wire-Duplex-Outlet-White-R52-00223-00W/100356969#.UhYB1ZKKK8A"" rel=""noreferrer"">ungrounded outlets</a>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4YtXu.jpg"" alt=""ungrounded outlet""></p>

<p>These generally cannot be used except as a direct replacement for an existing one, and even then setting up a properly grounded outlet is preferred and may be required.</p>

<p>All of the 120 Volt outlets require a <em>hot</em> wire (usually black or red) and a <em>neutral</em> wire (always white). Grounded outlets also require a <em>ground</em> wire (green or bare). Outlets can be always live or switched. Live outlets have the hot wire coming directly from circuit without interruption. Switched outlets have the hot wire going through one or more switches before reaching the outlet so that the power can be turned on or off. </p>

<p>All of the 15-20 amp outlets shown above are <em>duplex</em>, that is there are two receptacles for plugs on each.  These almost always are bonded together by a strip of metal.  When you wire to one, both are energized. This bonding strip can be broken off allowing each of the receptacles on the outlet to be powered separately. This is most often done to allow one receptacle to be always live and one to be switched. This also allows each receptacle to be on a separate branch circuit (for heavy power use).</p>

<p>Some residences use higher amperage outlets for large appliances, such as an electric stove or dryer, and the outlets vary base upon a number of factors. Examples can be seen in the chart linked in the question.</p>

<p>Similarly, some residences use 240 Volts for large appliances and wells, and the outlets also vary considerably, and can be seen on the linked chart.</p>

<p>This is a very brief summary of the type of outlets most commonly seen in US homes. The full range of outlet types and uses is beyond a simple summary.  The range of possible switching and wiring configurations also is nearly infinite.  But this site welcomes questions on any particular configuration or problem you may encounter, so ask away.</p>

"How can I create a platform on my stairs strong enough to support a ladder?","53571","","<p>I live in a two-story condo and need to reach a spot on the wall high above my staircase to do some handy work.  A ladder is the only way I can do this (I am stating this explicitly in order to avoid responses of <em>Well, tell us exactly what you are doing so we can possibly find an alternative</em>).</p>

<p>A scaffold for a staircase would be nice, but there's no place around here that rents them out for a reasonable price.  I came across an idea on YouTube to set a ladder up against a wall and then lay a board across the staircase and one of the rungs on the ladder, but there's no way I can transport a board of such length in my sedan.  As I am sorta forced to find a way to do this on my own, I came upon the dangerous idea of creating a platform by stacking a few cinder blocks on a lower step and putting a sheet of plywood across the blocks and a higher step.  I have a rail that will serve as backing for the plywood.  Conceptually, it seems like a sound idea, but I am coming to you guys for alternatives that might help me avoid breaking a part of my body.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Since I am in dire need of a super quick solution and couldn't find a PiViT per Tester's recommendation, I picked up a Werner 22' multi-use ladder from Lowe's.  Tester gets the mark for best answer since his answer addresses my question. Even though I haven't tried it, I know it would work.</p>

"Should I use caulk or wood putty and paint to fill nail holes on trim?","53516","","<p>I'm installing painted MDF crown molding, and I wasnt sure which method for covering nail holes is technically correct. Is using caulk considered a shortcut? Or is filling in the holes with wood putty and then painting only for the super perfectionist with too much time on their hands? I already filled in some of the holes with caulk, and I can't really see them when standing on the floor. My only concern is that it will reflect light differently since the paint is semi-gloss.</p>
","<p>The key criteria for me is the size of the holes.  If you used brads, then I have no problem with using caulk, especially on baseboards.  The only possible downside is if you leave a fingerprint in it.  You have to have eagle eyes to pick out a small hole like that.</p>

<p>With crown molding though, I'd plan on a lightweight spackle.  Mostly because of the cost and effort you already put in installing it, might as well finish it nicely.  Vinyl spackle works great, but again if the holes are small, just about anything made by DAP works fine.  If you find yourself with a large hole, bondo (auto filler) does amazing things.  Or you can use painter's putty, glazing, just about anything can be made to look really good.  Sand and touch-up as needed.</p>

"How can I build a custom stair case in a small space?","53495","","<p>In my continuing pursuit of gutting this house and trying to better it; the snow has finally broken and its time to get back to work.</p>

<p>We really, REALLY, want to use the attic space as storage / den / office space.</p>

<p>We've finally come to the conclusion to use the spare room's closet as the space for a staircase to the attic. its an insignificant space (</p>

<p>I just took a rough measurement of the closet - total run: 4 feet 4 inches (inside stud to inside stud) and a total rise: 7 feet 6 inches (floor to finished ceiling)</p>

<p>Is it possible to put a staircase in this space? there is 1 other space i can use to put the staircase, but i'd rather not - it would put the staircase in the middle of the attic, in our opinion, cutting the space up there too much.</p>

<p>I've tried online calculators - i haven't found one (or dont understand how to) enter in the total run. i know the space is small compared to how big the main staircase is in the house. It must be possible.</p>

<p>And I'd rather not use a ceiling ladder.</p>
","<p>First of all, since it sounds like this could be considered ""occupied space"", you better check your local building codes and/or with your local inspector to see what is allowed. Most codes have specific requirements for stairs, and in some jurisdictions strange things like spiral stair cases may not be allowed or may require specific approval because of their narrow treads.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'd definitely look to see if there is any way to get more space at all. For example, what is behind the closet? If you can lose a bit of ceiling height there, you could get a bit more room for the staircase. Likewise, is it acceptable to have the stairs coming out into the room at all? This too, will provide a bit more space. Using <a href=""http://www.blocklayer.com/stairs/stairseng.aspx"">this calculator</a>, if you can do 10 rises of 8"" (this may be steep though), you need 6'8"" of total run space. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b1NkW.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Depending on the adjoining space, you might also be able to make use of the room under the stairs.</p>

"If my wall has metal studs, is it better to anchor heavy objects through just drywall or also through the studs?","53474","","<p>I live in an apartment that has that has metal studs.  I'm considering hanging various things from the wall, including a coat rack that will span 5 or 6 studs.  I've seen advice that says metal studs are useless and crumple like tin foil and instead of hanging from the studs, I should use one of various heavy-duty drywall screws like <a href=""http://www.moen.com/securemount"">SecureMount</a> or <a href=""http://www.toggler.com/products/snaptoggle/overview.php"">Toggler</a>.  I've also seen advice saying that heavy objects should always be attached to studs, whether metal or wooden.  I've even heard both sides by two different employees at the same hardware store.</p>

<p>I don't know the gauge of the studs but the drywall seems to be 5/8"" thick.</p>

<p>Since the coat rack will span so many studs, it's as easy to mount it on the studs as it is between them.  So which is better?</p>
","<p>It's going to be more secure to use the studs, but depending on the weight of what you're hanging, it may not be necessary.  If you're hanging more than 40+ pounds, I'd go ahead and use the studs.</p>

<p>Instead of using wood screws or lag bolts as you would use in wood studs, use toggle bolts similar to the Toggler brand that you mentioned.  Starting from the center of the stud, make progressively larger holes in the drywall and stud until the toggle bolt will fit through.  Follow the instructions as if you were putting it through just drywall.  You'll only need two studs for all but the most heavy items.  I've used this method to hang a small server rack in a partition wall, and it's stronger than I expected.  </p>

"What is this soft, sticky wood finish and how do I remove it?","53244","","<p>We have a second-hand table with a mysterious finish.</p>

<p>The wood underneath is pale, possibly pine. With the finish, it's a slightly darker and ""warmer"" colour. The table is not antique; I'd guess only about 20 years old.</p>

<p>The finish is soft, so you can easily score lines in it with a fingernail. It feels slightly sticky if you just press it with a finger. It becomes VERY sticky if it gets wet, and will permanently stick to any paper left on it, so the paper can only be removed by painstakingly scrubbing it into shreds. It also turns white after getting wet, for an hour or so, then fades back to brown.</p>

<p>Because of the stickiness it attracts dirt horribly, and is covered in dark grime which is very hard to remove. The grime can be removed by lengthy scrubbing with a rough sponge and Flash kitchen spray, but then the finish partly comes off too.</p>

<p>We tried Nitromors paint and varnish remover, followed by white spirit. It made some progress at removing the finish, but left it patchy and smeary and not completely removed; I think we've had better results with Flash kitchen spray.</p>

<p>Can you help me identify the finish, and recommend a way to remove it properly?</p>
","<p>By ""White spirit"", do you mean turpentine or mineral spirits? If that had no effect on it... My best guess would be that it's improperly cured polyurethane, or water-based polyurethane that wasn't mixed properly. Additionally, polyurethane doesn't take to pine well and is pretty resistant to being removed chemically, so there's another pointer in that direction. </p>

<p>You can try denatured alcohol. If it comes up with denatured alcohol, it's probably improperly mixed shellac. </p>

<p>What I'd probably do if I were you would be to sand it down completely back to bare wood, first with 80 grit and then 120 and 220 grits. I know it's a pain in the butt, but it'll provide the best finish overall. Then stain it and finish it again with something that isn't polyurethane... if you stain it, I'd recommend a lacquer finish like Deft, and then a really nice set of absorbent coasters so that you don't keep getting the surface wet. ;) Or if you do use polyurethane, use a satin spray in a rattlecan and bring it indoors to a moisture and temperature controlled environment to cure for 48 hours before you put it back into use. And your last option would be to paint it (after sanding back to bare wood, or it won't adhere!) with an oil-based enamel and a bit of penetrol. </p>

"Is there a way I can make an indoor door a better sound insulator?","53003","","<p>I have an indoor hollow bedroom door. The door seems to offer very little sound insulation, and I would like to add a bit more. I'm not expecting to get perfect silence or anything, but I would like to deaden down the sound some, so that way way I can listen to something in my bedroom at a reasonable level without my kids hearing it to the point that they can't sleep. I have in my mind that there might be something like an AB Foam type product that I could pour in to my door and make it a bit more sound resistant. Is there any such product? Any other suggestions to improving sound resistance in a room?</p>
","<p>Reducing sound output from a typical bedroom can be extraordinarily difficult.  The core problem is that sound travels through the point of least resistance -- you can get a good sound block in one area, but find it makes no difference since the sound just escapes from somewhere else.</p>

<p>If you have a hollow core door, then that is one of your biggest sound holes as a typical hollow core door has an STC rating of only 20 or so.  That's not going to do a lot for any noise above a whisper.  But wait, even that is not a true representation of the actual sound transmission.  The problem is that rating assumes we are only talking about the door and not the air gaps around it.  If you have a hollow core door, then I'm going to assume that it's not properly gasketed.  If so, then the actual STC rating is substantially less.</p>

<p>Can you make that door more sound absorbent?  No, not really.  At least not in any efficient (money and time) manner.  Your best bet would be to upgrade to a solid core door.  If you have a standard door, then there is a good chance that the hinges will even line up and it'll be a straight swap for maybe $100.</p>

<p>Doing so will immediately jump your sound blocking to an STC rating of 25 or so.  Eh?  That doesn't sound much better than a hollow core door!  Well, that rating is taking the air gaps into account, so it's actually substantially better.</p>

<p>But STC 25 is still not going to be good enough to make a big enough difference in your sound transmission.  To do that, you're going to need to control the air gaps.  If you add some acoustic door gaskets, then you'll be looking at an STC rating of 35 or so.  That's actually quite good -- roughly on par with the STC rating of your wall.  People will still be able to hear what happens in the room, but it'll be notably muted.</p>

<p>An alternate to buying an interior solid core door and adding acoustic door gaskets is to buy an exterior door, which is already going to be solid core and will have its own seal.  That could be expensive, though, and the hinges will almost surely not line up.</p>

"What is a proper high-quality sub-floor preparation for porcelain tile floor installation","52583","","<p>I am preparing to do a kitchen remodel where I am replacing an existing tile floor with a new porcelain tile floor. The old floor that is being replaced has several areas where it is not level and some areas where the old tiles have cracked, possibly because the sub-floor is not stiff enough.</p>

<p>I am interviewing contractors to do this work and I really want a high-quality installation, even if I have to pay more for it. I have a book about remodeling by that TV guy Mike Holmes and he says that the proper way to prep a subfloor for tiles is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, make sure you have a 1 1/4-inch sub-floor before any tile goes
  down. That means if there's a 5/8-in layer of oriented strand board,
  then you need at least another 5/8-inches on top of that. Use oriented
  strand board, conventional plywood, or better yet, a waterproof
  product like WonderBoard or HardiBoard which are concrete-based
  products. Whatever you use should be set onto the existing sub-floor
  and glued and screwed to the joists underneath.  Finally, I recommend
  a waterproof membrane on top of that such as Ditra from Schluter. It's
  a bright orange waffled plastic that's put down right before laying
  the tile. It helps with water-tightness and provides just a little bit
  of flex, which allows the tile to absorb impact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have prepared a scope of work describing that I want this done and sent it to some local tile laying companies for quotes. The responses I have received have indicated that this is not the way they would recommend prepare a floor for laying tile and they recommend alternatives. After I received those responses I went to a tile store and asked about this and they also said not to do this.</p>

<p>I have three questions</p>

<ol>
<li>Is the way described in the book a good way to prepare floor for
laying tile?</li>
<li>Why would he write this in his book if it wasn't a
    good/standard way of preparing the subfloor?</li>
<li>If you were having a
    tile floor installed in your house what subfloor preparation would
    you want assuming you are looking for the highest quality
    installation?</li>
</ol>

<p>I guess I am also wondering why I am getting pushback on this from the installers?</p>
","<p>One comment on the advice you read is that I don't see a thing in there about <strong>deflection</strong> - evidently Mike Holmes is sure that if he merely has 1-1/4"" of subfloor, all is good. Real tile specs tend to involve a concept called deflection, and that's the distance part of the floor system moves when loaded, relative to the span you measure over. L/360 is a typical spec - L/180 is twice as bad. (It's usually a lowercase L, but on the computer I'm using a capital to be clear that it's an L.) I happen to have a 3/4"" subfloor that's L/587, so it really doesn't need another half-inch on that basis.</p>

<p>Consider what a tile manufacturer has to say...
(I'm not going to cut and paste their extensive text here, or rewrite it all) but for one thing they specifically mention setting the backer board in a mortar bed, not ""gluing"" it down. I'd also venture to sneak in that if you really want ""the best"" (and will you pay for it these days) look at the ""old fashoned mortar bed"" (TCNA (Method F145-02)) mentioned at the end of their article. That, of course, means you need to establish an adequately rigid base 3/4"" or 1-1/4"" + tile thickness <strong>below</strong> the surrounding floor level, which is why it's not popular these days. But it was a VERY good method, as a lot of old houses demonstrate.</p>

<p><strong>Original Answer</strong></p>

<p>I am answering my own question here with an awesome, home-grown solution to my problem.  I fastened two pieces of wood together at a 90 degree angle.  Corner clamps made it easy to get it perfect.  I then took a third piece of wood and cut a 45 degree bevel off the corner.  This piece is my drill bit adapter that fits a number of larger-sized drill bits, but was made with my 3/8"" bit in mind.  I also made another for smaller sizes (not shown).</p>

<p>To hold the adapter firmly in place and tight against the bit, I use one of my smaller c-clamps.  Using this custom guide, I was able to drill a near-perfect hole into the subject.  I also used another similar custom assembly that works with a plug cutter bit for my power drill.</p>

"How do I uninstall a receptacle when the wires are stuck?","52459","","<p>I just installed a receptacle in my basement and I realized I need to reinstall it someplace else.  The leads are inserted into the holes behind the receptacle and I can't get them out!</p>

<p>The instructions ""push to release"" are printed on the back of the receptacle with arrows pointing towards slots next to the holes were the leads go in.  I'm not sure what or how to push here.  I tried inserting the end of a paper clip, which worked once, but almost accidentally.  I can't find anything in that slot that disengages the wire.  Clearly it's something easy that I'm overlooking, but what?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Thanks for all the answers.  It took me several days before I got back to this project, but the eyeglass screwdriver was what I had on hand and it worked pretty well.  The key for me was to push in the part of the slot closer to the edge (rather than the interior) of the receptacle.  </p>
","<p>To get the lock mechanism to release you will need to use a small tool (such as a small screw driver as in @Niall C's answer or even a utility knife or eyeglass screw driver as in @mohlsen's answer or my preference is a small diameter wood awl).  </p>

<p>The first tricky part is finding that tool that will fit in the hole and then be long enough and have enough strength to press the lock release.  You will find some tools get too wide before reaching far enough down (such as the eye glass screw driver).  </p>

<p>Then if you look into the slot you will see a lever that you need to press (and you should be able to tell which way to press based on the angle of the lever but usually it is to the center of receptacle).  Use your tool to press that release lever.</p>

<p>The second tricky part is to make sure you are not pulling on the wire <em>while</em> trying to press the locking release mechanism.  Otherwise you will be fighting with yourself and the lock will not disengage (since it will catch the wire and not let it go).  One thing to try is to push the wire <em>into</em> the receptacle and then press the lock release and then gently pull the wire out.</p>

<p>The complete instructions:</p>

<ol>
<li>With one hand hold the receptacle with the back facing you (difficult to do if you do not have a lot of wire coming from the box).</li>
<li>With your other hand, gently push the wire back into the receptacle to relieve pressure on the release latch.</li>
<li>With your third hand take the small screwdriver and press the release latch to disengage the lock.  The wire will gently come out.</li>

"How can I fix a Moen faucet that is still leaking after replacing cartridge?","52394","","<p>I had a leaky Moen faucet (Moen 4600) so I removed the old cartridge and replaced it with a new brass replacement cartridge (model 1200.)

","<p>I contacted Moen directly with this same question and they let me know that they recommended a model 1225 replacement cartridge instead (that's what I get for trusting the guy at the hardware store to look up the matching part for me). Technically either one will work but apparently the plastic 1225 offers a tighter fit than the brass (and more expensive) 1220.</p>

<p>Moen also recommended cleaning out the inside of the valve with an old toothbrush or bottle brush and then flushing thoroughly before installing the new cartridge.</p>

<p>I will update this once I know if the new cartridge resolves my leak.</p>

After the installation of the model 1225 cartridge, the faucet works without any leaks from the stem. With the addition of a new knob the whole fixture is working better than new.</p>

"How to avoid wires when drilling into the wall?","52364","","<p>I have to anchor a bookcase to a wall to prevent it from tipping over.</p>

<p>When drilling into the wall, how do I make sure I can avoid drilling into the wires behind the wall?</p>

<p>I have bought a Stud finder which says it can detect wires, but I am not sure if it's that's the only thing I should rely on.</p>

<p>One of the Anchors will be on a stud, and the other will be on just dry wall.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>This is something that you have minimal control over.  Most electrical runs going horizontally are about 2 feet off the floor or very close to the ceiling.  There are lots of reasons for this but one of the obvious ones is it limits the areas of concerns when drilling.  </p>

<p>Also for horizontal runs there should be a little slack where an anchor would just push the wire out of the way.  For vertical runs these are stapled to studs on one side or the other.  So just hit the middle of the stud.</p>

<p>Really two things that help me investigate walls if I am worried are <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000BM4Q3Y"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">monkey hooks</a> and my <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000IKK0OI"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">magnetic stud finder</a>.  With the monkey hooks you can prick a wall for a good two inches plus while causing almost no damage.  You can easily ""feel"" something if you hit plumbing, electrical, insulation, whatever.  </p>

<p>With the magnetic stud finder you can use the drywall screws to find your on center of your framing members.  With a spare yardstick or 2x4 and a couple of screw points you can find the center of a stud the drywall is attached to.  From there you can assume that there is a 1-2 inch ""don't screw"" zone on each side.  As usually the only issues you will have with anchors is screwing into something tightly stapled.  Even screwing into a wire ran through a bored hole would be hard because unless the hole is really small or there are a lot of wires the screw will push the wire out of the way.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  For a heavy bookcase I would rely on an L bracket using toggle anchors - pictured below - in the wall.  My reasoning for toggle anchors is that other anchors could effectively strip or lose binding but in effect stay in place because the shelf hasn't moved enough.  You don't want to find out that your anchor has stripped when you climb up to get something off a top shelf.  The toggle anchor won't give you a snug connection but you don't need it to be hardcore snug, you need it to work.  (also note that the toggle anchors usually don't have a sharp tip, therefore making it ultra hard to damage wiring)</p>

<p><strong>+++</strong> This answer was meant for anyone dealing with wood/metal framed walls.  This would include most people in USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, parts of Mexico, parts of Asia, most dividers in large apartment buildings.  The safe zones for drilling are usually the same no matter the country but the depth of the wiring and how it is secured is not.  As for safety I would still offer that a prick test is better than any voltage meter I have ever used.  If I was afraid of the prick going through the electrical conduit after going through a cinder block I would simply cover the tip (rubber, plastic, chewing gum).</p>

"Why does my laptop charger make a spark when plugged in?","52081","","<p>From time to time (not always but often enough) when I plug my laptop's charger in the wall outlet it makes a spark (even if I use different outlets it's the same). </p>

<p>Why does it do this? Is this a normal behavior? Is it not? Can this damage the charger, laptop or electrical installation? Is it safe?</p>

<p>I'm in Europe. Electrical outlet gives 220V/50Hz (from a pretty old aluminum electrical installation) while the charger is a 65W AC Adapter with 100-240V, 50-60Hz, 1.5A input and a 19.5V, 3.34A output. </p>
","<p>It can indeed be ""<em>normal</em>"" for a small brief spark to be seen or heard, when plugging in or removing a plug. </p>

<h1>Plugging in.</h1>

<p>Electricity desperately wants to get home, and will go to extreme measures to do so. Inside your receptacle electricity waits, patiently biding its time.  As you bring the plug closer to the receptacle, the electricity can see a way home and gets really excited.  Once the plug gets close enough, the resistance of the air is no longer great enough, and the electricity is able to jump the gap.  As the electricity jumps the gap, it shows its excitement by releasing light and sound.</p>

<h1>Pulling the plug</h1>

<p>Similarly, when something is plugged in, the electricity is running through the circuit on it's way home.  As you pull the plug, some of the electricity makes a last-ditch effort to get home. Again it jumps the gap, and releases the familiar excitement light and sound.</p>

<h1>Safety</h1>

<p>This type of arcing happens; to some extent, in every electrical appliance that connects and disconnects an electrical circuit.  The points at which the arc contacts do suffer a small amount of damage, but can typically withstand many arcs without failure. Devices that consistently see larger than normal arcing, typically employ some form of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_suppression"">arc suppression</a> or protection. For example, circuit breakers commonly have some form of arc suppression, or protection. </p>

<h1>When to worry</h1>

<ul>
<li>If the arcing is continuous, even when the plug is inserted fully</li>
<li>The arcing occurs when nothing is plugged in, or being plugged in or unplugged.</li>
<li>The spark is large (in brightness, sound, duration, and/or length).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Precautions</h1>

<ul>
<li>Keep flammable objects away (curtains, furniture, petrol, etc.)</li>

There's a slight depression in the ground about 6' in diameter centered around one of the fence posts which is set in concrete. The fence post at the center of the hole is about 6"" lower than the other posts. A hole just opened up on my side of the fence that's about 1' in diameter, and kind of shoots down at a 45° angle into my yard. My neighbor actually pointed it out, because the hole is more noticeable on her side of the fence.</p>

"Can my generator power my deep well water pump?","51946","","<p>I have a 120/240 volt generator with an output of 3250 watts peaking at 3750.

I'm also unsure how large my well pump is but everything else in the house is pretty standard so I'm going to say between 3/4 and 1 hp.</p>

<p>Consumer reports says a well pump runs about 700 watts.  Multiply that by 3 to get a rough estimate of the starting wattage for the pump and you run about 2100 which still leaves plenty  of wiggle room in terms of wattage.<br>

<p>Doing some other research online there are a lot of folks saying you need at least a 5k watt generator to power a well water pump.  Obviously that's a far cry from what consumer reports is listing and well below the output of my generator.</p>

<p>I don't want to just plug it in and ruin my water pump or generator so I'm trying to find a solid answer or direction before doing so.</p>
","<p>If you already own the generator I say go for it and try it out. If the generator is anywhere decent then it will regulate the voltage more than enough for a motor so you won't over power the motor with voltage. If the generator can't handle it you will not harm the motor unless you are able to stall it for an extended period of time; the generator shouldn't be harmed either it would be like trying to use a dead battery if it can't push out enough juice it just won't.</p>

<p>The reason I've notice that people suggest higher wattage ones is because they are typically built a little better and since they are capable of more wattage they respond to a peak significantly better, I'm going into peak discussion. Generators supply electricity on demand (even the power stations'), a household generator will produce approximately a few hundred watts at idle, as more items are plugged in/turned on demand rises and the generator senses it and runs harder. Since there isn't a preemptive notice about this, the generator will typically spike/peak higher than the demand and recovery back around what it needs to put out. A motor turning on with capacitors will typically be able to handle that lag, the capacitors will just charge up slower (almost not noticeable in most cases) and the capacitors work as rectifiers handling another other voltage changes during operation. Motors without capacitors also typically handle it but since they don't get a beginning zap from the capacitors you run a small chance of burning out your coils, imagine plugging a 220v motor under load to 110v source it will energize the coils but remain stalled. </p>

<p>If this is a more permanent installation (off grid scenario as opposed to hurricane prep, etc.) I recommend a separate motor starter kit - bad with naming here - before the motor or a heavy duty UPS/Battery system but for just when the power fails I think you'll be fine.</p>

","<p>The life of electrolytic capacitors is primarily shortened by heat. Therefore ambient temperature, temperature of nearby motors, ventilation and air circulation (e.g. fan), presence of thick layers of dust, clogged grilles, excess paint, ... can be important factors. </p>

<p>Electrolytic capacitors are manufactured to <a href=""http://www.digikey.co.uk/product-search/en/capacitors/aluminum-capacitors/131081?k=capacitors"">various specifications</a>:</p>

I have asked the previous owners of the house and the owners before that, but none of them know the function of these switches. The first family to occupy the house is no longer alive.</p>

<p>What techniques might I use to figure out what these mystery wall switches are for? I've tried all the outlets, and they don't seem to turn any of them on and off, and I can't find any mounted lights controlled by the switches.</p>
","<p>First thing I'd check is if the switch is even connected to any wires. You can probably check this just by removing the face plate. </p>

<p>You already checked the receptacles, but did you check both the top and bottom outlet?  Sometimes a switch will only control one part of the outlet.  In this case, the metal tab connecting both hot terminals is broken so that the top and bottom outlets can be individually powered (and switched).</p>

<p>The next step is to look at the wiring of the switch.  First turn off the circuit breaker and test again with a non-contact tester (if you don't know what the switches do, then it could have more than 1 circuit in the box - just to be safe). Remove the switch and take note of the switch type - is it a single pole switch or 3-way switch?  (If its a 3-way switch then the color of the traveler might be helpful in finding what it controls.)  Is the line (from the circuit breaker) in this box?   </p>

<p>If a visual inspection doesn't give you any clues then you need to trace the circuit.  This is usually done with the power off using a circuit tracer:</p>

<p><a href=""http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BG6WPKJ8L._SL500_AA300_.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">Circuit Tracer http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BG6WPKJ8L._SL500_AA300_.jpg</a></p>

<p>A telecom probe/tracer can also be used in many cases.  You hook the tone generator up to the wires at the switch, and then you use the probe to follow the wires through the wall.  With any luck you will find your way to a ceiling or wall box. Depending how badly you want to know, you might need to open the wall (or use a scope) at some point to help trace the wire.  More expensive versions of this tool exist that might be needed to find really sneaky wires.</p>

<p>It's not unheard of to find out that a previous owner dry walled over an electrical box, so keep this in mind as a possibility.</p>

<p>And if you just can't sleep at night without know where it goes, you could always x-ray your house as a last resort.</p>

"Why don't programmable thermostats automatically switch between ""Cool"" and ""Heat""?","51484","","<p>While I can set my house to be a particular temperature, I still have to manually switch it between ""Heat"" and ""Cool"" mode, and this seems to be true of every thermostat (programmable or not) that I've seen. Is there a reason for this?</p>
","<p>The logic involved is much more complex.</p>

<p>Right now the logic is simple: </p>

<pre><code>if AC Mode and it's too hot, turn on AC, else turn off AC
if Furnace mode and its too cold turn on furnace, else turn off furnace
</code></pre>

<p>But the determination of when to switch between heating and cooling modes is much more complex - otherwise the ac would kick on, and it would get too cold, so hte furnace would kick on, making it too hot, and a cycle would begin that would never end.</p>

<p>So the logic must be more like:</p>

<pre><code>if the average ambient temperature has remained below a certain threshhold 
    for a given period of time 
    and the air conditioner hasn't been on in quite a while, change to furnace mode 
but if average ambient temperature has remained ABOVE a certain threshhold
    for a given period of time 
and the furnace hasn't been on in quite a while, change to a/c,

then if we're in furnace mode and it's cold, turn on the furnace, 
but if we're in a/c mode, and it's hot, turn on the a/c.
</code></pre>

<p>The circuitry involved is much more complex, so the price is higher and the market share obviously will be smaller.</p>

"How can I repair the cool deck around the pool?","50963","","<p>In places around the pool the cool deck has flaked off and I can see the bare concrete. The previous owner tried to patch it in places but it looks horrible because the texture AND color don't match. </p>

<p>Is there some kind of cool deck spary texture, like the kind of texture you can get for drywall? Also, can I paint all of the cool deck and will it last more than a year?</p>
","<p>To repair cool deck flaking (not cracks in concrete):</p>

<p>Step One:
All of the flaking or cracked texture needs to be removed. This is accomplished by using a scraper in conjunction with a high pressure washer. If the flaking is excessive and severe it may not be necessary to use the pressure washer. Bottom line is the old patch needs to be removed to expose the underlying cement. The cement also needs to be cleaned and all loose dirt or sand needs to be removed. On areas where the patch is solid and sticks firmly to the cement the sides of those areas should be smoothed at 90 degree angle to prepare for the new cool deck coating.</p>

<p>Step Two:
After the removal of the old texture, wash off the exposed concrete and make sure all loose material is also removed. Using a mixture of half muriatic acid and half water, scrub the exposed cement to ""score"" the cement and also to clean off contaminants. After 3 or 4 minutes completely rinse off concrete and scrub with a hard brush to ensure all acid is removed. Again, a high pressure washer is always recommended for the best removal of all acid and residue. I let the concrete dry completely before moving on to the next step. I've found that any moisture remaining in the concrete will cause the new decking to flake and peel within a few years.</p>

<p>Step Three:
Several products exist on the market for cool decking. The easiest is a product I've found is by a company by the name of E-Z Patch. My best advise is to use the internet to find a store that carries the product. The coating product is applied directly to the concrete with a roller. Two coats are typically required. Dry time is normally 3 to 4 hours depending on the day.</p>

"Are mounting anchors necessary for plaster walls?","50441","","<p>I have a bathroom utility organizer I need to hang on a plaster wall. The organizer is lightweight aluminum, weighs about 5 pounds, and will be holding fairly light items such as toothbrush holders and bath towels. </p>

<p>Do I need to use anchors before installing screws and mounting hardware for plaster walls?</p>
","<p>A screw directly in plaster or drywall is not very strong. Over time it will work its way out and leave a hole in the wall. </p>

<p>It's OK to use a nail to hang a framed painting or photograph. If you do this, first put a piece of scotch tape on the wall, to resist cracking. Make sure the nail is angled 45 deg from vertical. You can pull the nail out when you're done and it will only leave a small hole that is easy to patch. (Many people don't patch, but you'll still see the hole when you repaint.) There's a limit to how much weight I'd want to put on nails in drywall, though - if it tears out, it's a mess.</p>

<p>There are a variety of drywall anchors that you can use for larger loads (see <a href=""http://www.naturalhandyman.com/iip/inffastener/infanchor/infanchor.html"">http://www.naturalhandyman.com/iip/inffastener/infanchor/infanchor.html</a> for a good list). Most require you to drill a hole first. Be careful when you do this, because if there is wiring or plumbing behind the wall you could make a lot of trouble. Threaded anchors don't require drilling and are very easy to use. </p>

<p>For the most strength, screw in to a stud. I do this with towel bars especially, because I know people like to use them as hand-holds. Also, people yank towels from their holders, which puts a lot of strain on the wall.</p>

"How to make a 6 inch hole through a brick wall for venting","50197","","<p>I'd like to vent my range hood out through an exterior brick wall. How would I go about making a 6 inch hole for the vent? </p>

<ul>
<li>I'd guess I'd use a masonry chisel to chip out the mortar and then pull out a couple bricks on the interior and exterior layers of the wall. Is this the best tool/approach to use? </li>
<li>Do I need to be concerned about the load of the bricks above the hole? </li>
<li>How would I make the hole round rather than square? </li>
<li>Any other considerations?</li>
</ul>
","<p>It is entirely possible to construct a 6 inch hole in brickwork. The problem with a round hole rather than a square hole is where the hole cuts across joints in the masonry leaving small triangular pieces of masonry over the hole. These tend to be fairly week so are best avoided. You would therefore have to position the circular hole carefully so that is best placed not to leave small or week sections of masonry. As mentioned in other answers to get a good hole, a diamond or similar circular hole saw is the best way but at this diameter you made need a large pillar drill rig to use the hole saw and this may need to be bolted to the wall prior to making the cut. </p>

<p>If you can fill it a square hole then may be better. Given the diameter of the hole you are suggesting you shouldn't have any structural problems as long as you aren't right next to openings or corners in the wall. The key is to make sure that the hole doesn't leave a whole brick unsupported from below when you make the hole and with a 6"" diameter this shouldn't be a problem unless your bricks are very small. The neatest way of doing this is to cut out the edges of your hole with something like a disk cutter and then use an impact hammer to chisel out the brickwork in the centre. This should leave a very neat cut. </p>

"What is involved in installing a free-standing electric oven range?","49886","","<p>My current oven just plugs into a big outlet in the wall. It's a giant three-pronged outlet. But all I need to do to get the oven to work (when it works) is to plug it into the outlet.  I am now ordering a new oven online, since the old one has broken. They offer an installation service, but money is tight and I don't want to buy it if not necessary.  I have people to help me lift the oven if it's just about lifting the oven, and people to take away the old oven. But will there be electrical issues to deal with, or will the new oven just have a plug and plug into the wall like the old one?</p>
","<p>In most cases when you purchase a free-standing electric range, you'll be required to purchase the appliance cord separately.  The sales person should ask if you need a 3 or 4 prong cord, at the time of purchase. </p>

<p>NEC Article <strong>250.140 Frames of Ranges and Clothes Dryers.</strong> requires 4 prong receptacles and appliance cords to be used in <strong>new</strong> installations, but allows 3 prong receptacles to be used  if the following conditions are met.  </p>

<p><em><strong>1) The supply circuit is 120/240-volt, single-phase, 3-wire; or 208Y/120-volt derived from a 3-phase, 4-wire, wye-connected system.</em></strong></p>

<p>This will almost always be true in a residential setting.</p>

<p><em><strong>(2) The grounded conductor is not smaller than 10 AWG copper or 8 AWG aluminum.</em></strong></p>

<p>It's not likely your wire will not meet this condition (unless it's really old).</p>

<p><em><strong>(3) The grounded conductor is insulated, or the grounded conductor is uninsulated and part of a Type SE service entrance cable and the branch circuit originates at the service equipment.</em></strong></p>

<p>Again, the supply cable will almost always meet this condition in residential. </p>

<p><em><strong>(4) Grounding contacts of receptacles furnished as part of the equipment are bonded to the equipment.</em></strong></p>

<p>This just means that if there are receptacles on the range (I havn't seen this in many years), they must be bonded to the chassis (which should have been done by the manufacturer).</p>

<hr>

<p>Plugging in a new electric range will not require the circuit to be brought up to current codes, so you should have no problem using a 3 prong appliance cord (in most situations). </p>

<p>It's a good idea to get somebody that has some experience with electrical work to install the cord, since improper installation can lead to injury, fire, and death. The basic idea is that you don't want to restrict conductivity in any way, so you'll want to make sure the terminals are tightened to the proper torque (a conductive paste is sometimes applied to insure adequate conductivity).</p>

<p>While you may be tempted to save a few bucks using the old appliance cord, this is usually not the best idea.  Over time the cord may become brittle or develop corrosion, which can both lead to increased resistance, which leads to excess heat buildup, which leads to failure and/or fire.  It's not worth the risk, spend the ~$20.00.</p>

<p>Make sure you read the manual before installing the range, and follow any and all manufacture instructions.  </p>

"How do I wire an old house with Cat6?","49587","","<p>I have a older home (build in the 50's) with 1/2"" dry wall and then plaster on top. </p>

<p>I would like to run Cat6 cable through most of the house (living room, kitchen, entertainment room,etc). </p>

<p>So, I'm looking for pointers on how to do this. </p>

<p>At first glance, I could make a fairly long 'horizontal trench' in the wall, through the plaster and dry wall and then run the cable through the studs (they are wood and I would have to drill a hole). </p>

<p>But I'm really hoping their is a better way. </p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>I also have a finished basement (except for the furnace area).</p>
","<p><strong>Go big or go home.</strong> If you're going through all the trouble to pull wires through existing walls, don't pull just one. It's only slightly more work to pull two wires than to pull one. Doing the project a second time in a few years <strong>is</strong> twice as much work, though!</p>

<p>Think about everything you might want (IP networking, surveillance cameras, cable or satellite TV, telephone, speaker wires, home automation control signalling). Then add a bunch of extras. Cat-6 is a good choice, because it can carry most things you might want.</p>

<p><strong>Consider a single conduit.</strong> During a major bathroom remodel &amp; replumbing job, I had the plumber put conduit from the attic to the ""wiring closet"". He went a little nuts, putting two 4"" conduits in - one for high voltage, one for low voltage. This makes it relatively easy to add a new service anywhere. Unfortunately, this was <strong>after</strong> I had finished running structured wiring.</p>

<p>Since a small part of your basement is unfinished, you might want to run conduit from there to your attic, and make that your ""wiring closet"". Then you can pull from each outlet to the attic, and easily run it down the conduit.</p>

<p><strong>Star topology.</strong> Pull everything to a central location, and patch them together there. I used the space under the stairs. </p>

<p><strong>How to pull up to an attic:</strong> In your attic, drill a large hole in the sill plate. It should be big enough to fit all the wires you want through it, but small enough to keep the strength of the sill plate. Avoid the wall studs below.</p>

<p>Cut a hole in the wall below, for the outlet. </p>

<p>Push a fish tape down from the attic. Have a helper watch the hole for the tape, and grab it with a bent coat hanger. They attach the wire bundle, and you pull it back up. </p>

<p>To push/pull from attic to basement, you can cut a hole on the floor in between, and do it in two steps. Or you can fish from both ends at the same time, using fish tapes that have hooks on the end. When they hook each other, pull the attic tape up to retrieve the basement tape. In the attic, tie on the wire bundle, then pull it down to the basement.</p>

<p><strong>To pull between finished floors</strong> you need to cut a hole in the wall to drill a hole in the sill plate &amp; fish between the floors.</p>

"How do I cut and cap copper water tubing cheaply and safely?","49529","","<p>In my basement I have copper water pipes that look like they hooked up to an old shower.

I want to prune these pipes where they come off the main water line (so I can put a deep freezer in their place) but I've never done anything like that before.</p>

<p>Google tells me I have two options for pipe fittings: sweating or compression fittings.
I want something more or less permanent but I don't to buy extra tools I may not need again for a long time, plus if I can avoid open flames I'd like to, etc.  Are compression caps available and suitable for this kind of thing?</p>

<p>I'll look forward to learning to sweat connections another time.  For a casual plumber like me, pushfit fittings cost about 10 times as much as soldering and so worth it.</p>
","<p>Compression caps are available and suitable, but you do need to be fairly careful when fitting them that you tighten the joint just the right amount. You also need a reasonable amount of room to be able to turn the spanner/wrench.</p>

<p>Soldering will give you the most professional result and can be done in a fairly confined space - as long as you take the necessary precautions to avoid scorching/burning the surroundings.</p>

<p>If you really can't face the thought of soldering the joints then you can get push fit end caps that work very well. You need to make sure you've got a smooth, straight end to get a good fit, so a pipe cutter is the preferred cutting method. You can use a hacksaw, but you will need to then use emery paper on the end to remove the burr.</p>

"Turning off Air Conditioning when out of the house for extended time","49489","","<p>Most people that live in cold climates know that you should not turn your heat off when you go away for an extended period of time.

","<p>A timely question since there is presently a heat wave where I am :-)</p>

<p>I have followed a couple of strategies on this over the years.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>As a general rule, and lacking any better reason, I turn the AC off if I am going to be out of the house for more than a quick trip.  It won't take that long to cool off when I get home.</p></li>
<li><p>For the bathroom and some other areas where built up humidity can become a problem, I either run an exhaust fan or a small dehumidifier.  In my case, the dehumidifier will consume less energy than the AC (local specialized solution vs generalized solution).</p></li>
<li><p>For larger areas, I run a fan to keep the air circulating, again rather than run the AC.  One of my newer AC units has a very energy efficient fan mode, so on that unit, I use it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To give you an idea of my environment, this week the temperature has been pretty consistently at or above 30 degrees C with humidity adding 10 to that.</p>

<p>In the case of central air (which I don't have), I believe some have programmable thermostats which can keep the environment ""cooler"", ie 25 deg C, when you're out ... this seems reasonable to me.</p>

<p>As was mentioned <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/7784/turning-off-air-conditioning-when-out-of-the-house-for-extended-time/7789#7789"">here</a> if there are pets to be taken into consideration, or any other reason (such as it gets absurdly hot where you are and food in the cupboards may melt) then running it at a low rate is probably the best answer.</p>

<p>I also make liberal use of drawing shades on my windows and doors to reduce the effect of the sun beating in and warming.  This really has a huge impact here.</p>

<p>Another thing I didn't see mentioned was that if you are going away and have high daytime temperatures but moderate relative nighttime temps, you can combine turning your AC down with an electrical timer, so that the AC is turned off overnight.  Since you're not going to be home, comfort isn't the main issue.  A temperature controlled thermostat like I mentioned on the central air or modern AC units is the best bet IMHO, and I'd set it on a higher-than-normal-but-still-cool range (here that would be 25-27 C, when I'm home I prefer being around 22 C).</p>

<p>If the other switch is turning on/off the light, regardless of which position this switch is in, then it is very likely this is a defective switch.</p>

<p>However, if it is only happening when this switch is in one particular position, then it's highly likely one of the two switches has the common wire connected to one of the traveller terminals. It could be either one. </p>

<p>If you can determine which wire goes where (the biggest hint is that the traveller wire is 14-3 while the others usually aren't), then you should be able to match it up to the wiring diagram here. </p>

"Is there an NEC-compliant method of repairing minor damage to electrical wire insulation without a junction box?","49142","","<p>While trying to pry loose a stubborn cable staple that fastens a 14-gauge electrical cable to a stud, I accidentally tore a very small hole through both the outer jacket and the insulation around the neutral wire, exposing the bare conductor inside.  The damage is located halfway between the electrical box and the 5/8"" hole in the frame's bottom plate where the wire disappears to beneath the floor somewhere.  The hole is but a mere dot measuring at about 1/32"" in diameter.</p>

<p>Is it okay to repair this tear with electrical tape?  The copper wire itself was not damaged.  I am hoping someone isn't going to tell me that NEC requires me to repair the damaged section by replacing it with a new wire and installing a junction box or something.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Right now, it's between shirlock homes and SteveR for the answer.  SteveR brought an excellent option to my attention, and that is to expose the junction box on the other side of the wall since, in my case, it happens to be a closet.  shirlock homes recommends wrapping the damaged neutral wire with insulating tape then taping up the jacket.  I like this idea, but if it's not NEC compliant then I think SteveR will get the answer.</p>
","<p>Like Shirlock said, this does happen. I have taped a few staple mishaps along the way. Each incident is evaluated differently. If it is a neutral with just the insulation rubbed away (not a compromise to the conductor!). And I was also sure that it was used as a neutral (and not a switched lead). Then I have layed the insulation back and given it a few wraps with the Scotch 33 (600V insulation per wrap!, not the cheap stuff) and felt confident it was safe. Is that code compliant? Will an inspector fail the job if he saw it? Absolutely! The inspector does not know what is behind the tape and is not going to take your word for it.
Okay, so obviously you want to sleep at night so here are a few code compliant ideas.</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a ""deep Handy box"" (single outlet box) at outlet height and splice the wire coming from the floor to a new wire going up if you can replace that wire. If the wire is a feed, perhaps include an outlet in the box. If not, just put a blank cover on it. As long as you can get to the box, a proper splice will be code compliant.</li>
<li>Can't add a box there? How about the other side of the wall? Maybe you will even get lucky and end up in a closet! Only if you're in a closet, you must make it a J-box w/blank cover, outlets, switches are not allowed in closets. </li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT:
I was told by a licensed Electrician awhile ago that it is a code violation to put outlets or switches inside the closet. I never questioned that because all new construction I have seen here in many years has the light switch outside of the door! It made sense, with posible arcing from a switch and clothes and all. I'm thinking it may be a local code requirement. I know he also talked about how you need to do it as the inspector wanted, in addition to NEC code. I did find however that code clearly states that no electrical breaker panels can be in a clothes closet, perhaps its a variation of that?. I have to stand by my friends interpretation, I know he is competent Electrician.</p>

"What do I use to mount a heavy framed mirror to a stud wall?","48974","","<p>I recently got my grubby hands on a beautiful, but extremely heavy, 4' x 7' framed wall mirror; it probably weighs around 100lbs, if not a little more.</p>

<p>I know what (exterior) wall to mount it on, exactly where the mount-points are, and have already installed two wood screws (2"" long) into the studs. The mirror came with a pre-installed wire, and I'm hoping that these two screws would be stable enough to hold the mirror.</p>

<p>When we tried actually installing the mirror, we tipped it onto one screw, and tried to pivot the rest of the mirror onto the second screw. In the 10 or 15minutes that this process took, I observed the first screw start to tilt downward a little bit. Didn't want to take chances with such a heavy object, and stopped the entire process.</p>

<p>Here's my questions:
01. What specific hook or other fastener can I use to safely hang this mirror?
02. Will just two such fasteners suffice, or should I use more?
03. Should I remove the mirror's wire and use just the D-rings that it came with?
04. If I use #03 above, what method should I use, considering that there aren't any studs close to the D-ring mount points?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
","<p>You'll probably have an easier time using a picture hanger than a screw, and it will leave your wall in better shape when you remove it. Picture hangers transfer the downward force into pressure into the wall because the nail is mounted at an angle. The screw, on the other hand, is being bent because you're acting as a lever, where the stud is the fulcrum, the drywall is just empty space, and the wire is the force applied at the end. Even if you get a stronger screw, you're still placing a significant twisting force into the stud.</p>

<p>You can't use your typical picture hanger for a task like this. The small hangers that come in most kits are rated to only 20-30 lbs. However, you can find hangers like this one that is rated to 100 lbs (and I'd still use two of them, since it will make adjusting for level much easier and reduce the risk of failure).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/74qgH.jpg"" alt=""100 lbs picture hanger""></p>

<p>The other option is called a french cleat which are two interlocking rails, one that attaches to the wall, and the other to what you're hanging. As long as you install them both straight and level, you don't need to adjust the mirror for level, and it distributes the weight across a larger area, reducing the risk of a failure.</p>

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RsbET.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>You CAN bond tile directly to a plywood subfloor and expect it to last. HOWEVER, the floor <em>must</em> be properly reinforced to minimize flexing; the joists, if they're 2x8 (newer code) and not 2x10 (older code), must be braced every four feet with cross-braces, which minimizes independent flexing of each joist and the subfloor above. Then, in either case the subfloor should probably be about an inch thick (at least 3/4""), and if that's accomplished with more than one layer of plywood/OSB, the subfloor should be glued and screwed together such that they're as close to one piece of material as possible. If you have the vertical space for a floating underlayment like Ditra, that will further reduce grout and tile cracking by allowing the two dissimilar materials (wood and tile) to swell and shrink at their own differing rates with temperature and humidity.</p>

<p>I would not ""glue"" stone or ceramic tiles in any case; the tiles will likely not be properly supported under their entire area and WILL crack and lift. Use thinset, and since this is a bathroom I would use a waterproof membrane laid down over a first layer of thinset to protect the subfloor, as neither thinset nor grout are waterproof. A waterproof underlayment is flat-out required on the floor and up the walls in shower stalls and anywhere else you expect to have water sprayed or standing on a regular basis; the water will wick into the thinset by the gallon, and eventually contact the drywall, where it will eventually degrade and mold even water-resistant ""green board"".</p>

Can I do residential electrical work without being certified? I heard that I only need to be certified if I work for a contractor. The certification seems to require 3-4 years apprenticeship and 8000 hours of training. Can anyone shed some light on this? </p>
","<p>I am quite sure you will find that in Ca., just like most other states, you need to have a licence to do electrical work for hire. Fixing minor things like replacing a light fixture or a broken switch does not fall into this category, however adding circuits, doing anything in a panel, or upgrading services certainly does.  You would never be able to acquire any type of liability insurance as a contractor to do any kind of electrical work without a license, nor would you be able to pull a permit for a homeowner. 
The three stages of progression to become licensed are first, apprentice, then test for a journeyman's licence, then finally a Master.  Only a master can pull permits or supervise the training of the lower two classes. This process can take years.
I would caution you sternly, basic knowledge of codes and theory is not a substitute for practical knowledge/experience and  proper guidance from a seasoned professional. Working in the trade as a unlicensed contractor could cause you a lot of grief and possible legal problems as well. I would suggest contacting your Secretary of State's  department or website for licensing requirements.    </p>

<p>I'm having some problems with it now, as it's no longer providing hot water as quickly as it used to.

<li>a thermal bypass valve should be installed at a sink furthest from the tank.</li>

<ul>
<li>There seems to be some sort of dedicated return line coming out of my wall</li>

","<p>You're sorta kinda in a bit of trouble here.  This system is close to being good, but because of a seemingly minor screw-up, you're going to have major problems here.  The recirculating pump SHOULD NOT be connected to the drain.</p>

<p>First off, it's quite possible that the segment of pipe between the pump and the ""tee"" attached to the drain valve is completely or partially clogged with (corrosive) scale/sediment buildup.  Judging by the scale buildup on the outside of the pipe just below the tee, it looks like the tee is leaking (why? corrosion?).  I can only imagine that the inside is worse.  Even the check valve and the ball valve upstream from the pump look like crap.  In fact, I'm pretty sure that's calcium on the ground below the check valve (thing between the pump and the drain with a hex bolt -shaped top on it), indicating that it too is already leaking.  The check valve almost certainly isn't functioning properly (check valves are intended to only allow water to flow one way,) which is possibly why you are having to constantly readjust the temperature in your shower.  The cold water gets injected into the tank at the bottom (via a long ""dip tube"" that enters at the top and travels down to the bottom.)  <strong>If this check valve is being held open by sediment, or if it has failed due to corrosion, then cold water could be coming out of the water heater from the drain at the bottom, making your ""hot"" water turn merely ""warm"" after about 10-15 gallons of use, which is one possible explanation for your <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/6617/shower-gets-colder-during-use-already-replaced-cartridge-what-else-could-it-be"">""shower get[ting] colder during use"" problem</a>.</strong></p>

<p>My advice would be to get this junk removed ASAP before something bursts and you have a disaster on your hands.  Get rid of it completely, or if you want to get it fixed up, get a new pump (Grundfos makes great pumps, but I can't imagine that this pump is usable at this point) and tell the plumber to connect the recirculating pump to the T&amp;P relief valve inlet, which is not currently being used(?), rather than the drain.  Doing this would reduce the scale/sediment buildup greatly, which happens mostly near the bottom of the tank.  Replace all of the pipe in the vicinity of the pump as well, as it is probably completely scaled up and corroded.  Everything else should be ok.</p>

<p>I see a line (the CPVC that goes into the wall) for what I hope to be a T&amp;P valve, but I can't see where the actual T&amp;P valve is.  If it's tee'd off of the hot water outlet, then that's fine.  I'd hope it's not simply laying on top, not connected to anything, but I don't have enough faith in whoever installed this to take that for granted.</p>

For cold-rolled, it seems to be broken into two:  Hot rolled is B67-B80 and cold drawn is B80-B90.  This confuses me even more because this looks like the steel is cold rolled hot rolled?  Why is the stainless rating just 88 while the others seem to be a range and use the B scale?  Does stainless just default to a scale since it's just represented by a raw number?</p>
","<p>OK, a few definitions:</p>

<p><strong>Yield strength</strong> is the amount of force required to cause the steel to yield, which means permanently deform (i.e. permanently stretch).</p>

<p><strong>Tensile strength (a.k.a. ""ultimate strength"")</strong> is the amount of force required to cause the steel to actually break. This will be equal to or greater than the yield strength.</p>

<p><strong>Minimum</strong> just means that the steel will be at least that strong.</p>

<p><strong>Hardness</strong> is a measure of how resistant the steel is to scratching and denting. For structural usage it's probably not important, but would be important if you were looking for a durable finish, e.g. a workbench top or a tool bearing point.</p>

<p><strong>Stiffness</strong> (you didn't ask about this, but it's another way of looking at the strength of a material) is a measure of how much something deflects when you put a force on it. Steel alloys tend to be pretty similar in this regard.</p>

<p>As you can see, ""strongest"" doesn't really have a specific definition, it depends on what you're looking for.</p>

<p>Here's an analogy for the difference between yield and tensile strength:
Imagine you have a spring. You pull on it a little, and when you let go it returns to its original shape. This is ""elastic deformation"", and no damage has been done. Now you pull hard on the spring and it doesn't return to it's original shape anymore. The material has yielded and you have ""plastic deformation"". This may or may not be considered ""failure"", depending on the application. Now pull really hard and the spring breaks. That's the ultimate strength. Clearly the spring has failed now.</p>

<p>As for the ranges: ""steel"" is a non-specific name for several alloys and it can be made in several grades, hence the ranges you've found. The material is usually designated with an alloy number. ""Cold rolled"" and ""hot rolled"" are methods for shaping the steel, and don't really tell you anything about the strength.</p>

<p>I should also point out that all of these properties that I've mentioned are for the steel material itself. If you want to know the behavior of an actual piece of steel, you need to know both its material and it's shape.</p>

"How can I mount a security camera on the outside of the house?","48085","","<p>I'm tasked with mounting a security camera on the outside of the house and I'm not sure what would be the right way to do this. There are two basic problems: how to mount the thing and how to run the power cable (the camera is using a low-voltage power adapter). The way I see it, my options are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use outdoors power outlet.</strong> This might be the easiest option (there is an outlet nearby) but it's not ideal: not only the cable would be hanging outdoors, but it is also too short to reach the outlet, so I'll end up with an ugly contraption of a power adapter and an extension cord - all dangling outside open to the elements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Drill the wall</strong> (the house is ""typical"" wooden frame with insulation and vinyl siding). I've never drilled the outside walls, so I'd appreciate some advice here. Obviously, I'd like to avoid messing up the wall interior and thermal insulation of the house by doing it wrong.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Run it through the soffit/under the roof</strong> - no idea if it's feasible at all.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Run it between the door and door frame</strong> - again the concerns are shorting the cable and messing with thermal insulation by leaving some gap.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The other question is specifically about <strong>mounting the camera to the outside wall</strong>. What would be the right way to attach it to the vinyl siding. Is it something that would require drilling through the wall or there is a way to do it in a less invasive manner?</p>
","<p><strong>Outdoor Power</strong> - Do not power the camera using an outdoor outlet. You have all the problems you listed and you make the system more susceptible to tampering (an intruder can simply unplug the camera and blind the system).</p>

<p><strong>Powering the camera</strong> - Let's begin by checking if the camera and its power supply is rated for outdoor use. The exposure to moisture, and to a lesser degree extreme temperature, makes many indoor units unsuitable. The connection of the power supply to the camera needs to be water resistant. If it is not, you need to consider a different camera unit.</p>

<p>In general, outdoor power lines need special cable or a metal or plastic pipe to protect the cable. The power to the unit is apparently low voltage, so it may not need the same level of protection as it would if it were 120 volts.</p>

<p>You will need to bring the wire through the wall (or through a soffit) at some point. You want to drill through an area that DOES NOT contain framing. You will go through siding, sheathing, probably insulation, and then finish material, probably drywall.</p>

<p>The main issue is sealing the entry holes from water and air infiltration.  This can be done on the outside using a good outdoor caulk.</p>

<p>On the inside, you can use a low voltage junction box to protect the wire and then route it to an outlet. The best approach might be to run the wire to a double box, low voltage on one side and line voltage on the other.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bdtsa.jpg"" alt=""dual voltage box""></p>

<p>You could then have the wire exit the front of the low voltage side and have the transformer plug into the line voltage side.</p>

<p><strong>Mounting Camera</strong> - Most modern cameras (at least those without heavy housings or motor mounts) are fairly light, just a few pounds, if that.  They can be screwed into the sheaving of the wall, which is located beneath the vinyl siding.  You need to drill through the siding and into the sheathing and then screw the base to the sheathing. As you are mounting, you can seal the screw holes and even the base of the camera with outdoor caulk.</p>

<p>If the camera is heavy, you should screw the camera to a framing member (stud). These are found at corners, regularly spaced horizontally (usually every 16 inches from a corner), and near the roof and floor line of each level. You can use a stud finder to locate them.</p>

"Can a mix of receptacles and light fixtures be installed on a single circuit?","48051","","<p>A while ago we had some renovations done in our house. After the electrician was done, we realized we now had one light switch in our kitchen that was no longer connected to anything. It is in a 2-gang box. The other switch in that box still is connected to a light in the kitchen. Suffice it to say that this isn't exactly what we wanted, but the electrician is done and won't be coming back.</p>

<p>So, now we have this useless switch and are trying to decide what to do with it. It happens to be above the counter (and it's more than 6 feet from the sink -- if that matters). So, we thought it might make sense to replace the switch with a receptacle, giving us an extra place along the counter where we can plug in small kitchen appliances (toaster, food processor, what have you). My question is, are there any problems with mixing receptacles and light fixtures on the same circuit? Does it make any difference if it is in a kitchen?</p>

<p>I realize that this means that if an appliance plugged into the receptacle trips the breaker, the lights will also go out. I'm personally not concerned about that.</p>
","<p>To directly answer your question about the unused switch in your kitchen, you have to check a couple of things before you install a receptacle in it's place:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there a source voltage feed in the box?</li>
<li>If there is only one cable entering the box and both the black and white conductors are connected to the  switch(es), then the voltage feed is coming through the light fixture. In this configuration, there is no neutral and you cannot install a receptacle.</li>
<li>Technically, if the source wiring is not 12/2wg, AWG and controlled by a 20 amp breaker, it does not meet current code for use with a receptacle. </li>
<li>If you do find that you can install a receptacle, be sure to use a GFCI type.</li>
<li>Determine if the wires on the unused switch are energized and where they go.</li>
<li>If you use the line side (source) wires for your receptacle, be sure to safely terminate the unused switched load side wires in wirenuts.</li>

<p>Under what circumstances is it useful or necessary?</p>

<p>In my case, would grounding it simply increase the (unlikely) possibility of a lightning strike?</p>
","<p>Yes, you should have a grounding block wired to a ground rod before the antenna wire enters your home. It won't necessarily prevent <em>all</em> damage from a direct lightning strike, but it will help.</p>

"How do I install an outdoor receptacle box on vinyl siding?","47296","","<p>Any tips for adding an outdoor receptacle box onto a house with vinyl siding? Shouldn't the box be attached to a stud? How do I seal around it? J Channel? How can I accomplish this without tearing off large chunks of siding? I can handle the electrical.</p>
","<p>You can probably get away with a weather proof box on top of the siding, but here's the full procedure to make it look nice.</p>

<p>Vinyl siding can be pulled off and later reattached. To remove it, you need a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000TDKDZA"">siding removal tool</a> that has a flat blade with a small hook on the end. You shove it up the gap between two pieces of siding and then pull to separate them. Start with the top edge that you want to remove, expose the entire piece, and then unscrew it from the wall.</p>

<p>There should be tyvek or similar weather proofing material under the siding. Repair the screw holes and any tears with tyvek tape.</p>

<p>Locate your new outlet installation location. More than likely, you'll need to remove the drywall inside to feed the lines to this outlet, so find your stud there and drill a small test hole. Make sure the hole is near where you want to place the electrical box, cut back the tyvek in an X shape with the, and then cut your opening with a drill in the corners and a reciprocating saw.</p>

<p>Install the new junction box to the stud. You may find it easier to screw it in since hammering requires space to swing the hammer and the vibration could cause damage to the surrounding drywall. Caulk all gaps around the box and the outside sheathing. Cut back any excess tyvek and tape around all 4 sides to make it weather tight.</p>

<p>Run your wiring. Don't forget to staple it to the center of the stud. Install your outlet, making sure it's GFCI protected since your outside. Use a weather protective cover over the outlet.</p>

<p>Install J-channel around the outlet. Install from the bottom up and overlap the joints so any drips go outside of the J-channel. Begin reinstalling your siding from the bottom piece working your way up. Measure twice around the outlet and cut your siding with tin snips (it will go through like butter and leaves the best edge for small cuts). Remember to measure so the cut is inside of the J-channel and you have a 1/4"" of play to each side (siding moves with temperature changes). Don't forget to account for the overlap with the adjacent pieces when measuring, and when reinstalling, the overlap should be such that you aren't looking into a gap from the predominant view of your home. When reinstalling the siding, give it a good shove against the track on the piece below until you hear or feel it click in all the way across.</p>

<p>When screwing back in, I'd use different screw holes and new screws. The screws should have a flange so the siding can't slip over the head, wide threads to bite the wood, and be relatively shallow so you aren't going completely through your sheathing (1/2"", maybe 5/8""). When screwing in, put your screw in the middle of the slot at the top of the siding so the siding can move from side to side. And leave the gap of a fingernail under the screw head, don't tighten it all the way down. For the last piece, after you've screwed it in, pull down the siding above into the track, and snap it in with a firm shove. The siding removal tool can help you line this up.</p>

"Why do light bulbs all over the house burn out disconcertingly fast?","47255","","<p>I've found a couple answers to this question. This generally revolve around the scenario where it's bulbs in a general area such as a fan. </p>

<p>My issue is that light bulbs all over the house burn out pretty fast. They don't last more than a year and this includes long life kinds, ones warrantied for 7+ years and such. I've tried a variety, but they all seem to burn out within a year or sooner. Places include living room ceiling fan, living room lamps, light fixtures in master &amp; guest bathrooms, office, guest room, and kitchen. Pretty much any where you can put a bulb.</p>

<p>I've noticed that the LED bulbs have been recommended on this Q&amp;A site but I have no idea which ones to get, how much light they put out, or how reliable they are.</p>

<p>Why would my light bulbs burn out so fast, and what can I do to fix the situation?</p>
","<p>One reason bulbs can burn out quickly is if the voltage applied to them is higher than the expected voltage (120V in The USA). Wiring problems and bad transformers can cause the voltage to be out of spec. Another reason is if there is a loose connection somewhere, and the light flickers (causing unnecessary heating/cooling cycles). A third reason is if the light is in a confined space, and overheats.</p>

<p>In order to check the line voltage, you will need to use a voltmeter. The Kill-A-Watt is a very safe product to use to check the line voltage. Note that you should try a few different outlets, since there are generally two different phases of power (not really phases, but opposite polarities, 180 degrees apart) going into a typical house, and you need to check both of them.</p>

<p>Identifying a bad connection is trickier. Generally, you would see flickering lights, but to be sure you would want to use an oscilloscope or spectrum analyzer (expensive equipment). Sometimes a bad switch will cause a short flicker when the light is turned on. Replacing the light switches with new high quality switches could help.</p>

<p>Finally, have you noticed that the bulbs go out more quickly in certain places? Are those places more confined, causing the bulbs to heat up more? If so, you need to use lower wattage lights (such as CFL, halogen, or less bright incandescents) so that the bulb is less hot. </p>

<p>LED lights, halogens, and CFLs are all more efficient than incandescent lights. For the same amount of light output, they use less electricity, and generate less waste heat (keeping them cooler). In order to check if they meet your needs, compare the light output (in lumens) to that of the bulbs you are currently using. Don't go by the ""equivalent"" rating (such as 60W equivalent).... The amount of heat generated is nearly proportional to the wattage of the bulb (generally between 10 and 25 W). Another thing to look at is the color temperature, as measured in Kelvins. More orange lights will be around 2700 K, while more blue (daylight) bulbs will be around 5000 K.</p>

<p>PS: Advertised bulb lifetimes are usually assuming use of perhaps four hours per day. So, a seven year bulb may only last a bit over a year if it is left turned on continuously.</p>

","<p>The fact that it is taking 5 minutes to deliver hot water to the shower rarely has anything to do with a tanked water heater and is instead because of the distance between the water heater and the shower.  (Also depends on whether or not those pipes are exposed to the elements, as the hot water will have to first heat the cold pipes before it can deliver hot water to the shower.  Raising the temperature setting would help heat the pipes faster, but that would nonetheless be a problem with the setting, not a problem with the water heater that would warrant replacement if it were the only problem.)  That aside, either the water at the top of the tank is hot or the water heater simply isn't working.  (Hot water, like hot air, rises.  If there's one place that hot water should be at, it's the top of the tank, which is where the hot outlet draws from.)</p>

<p>Water heaters typically go bad for two reasons:</p>

<p>(1) Not changing the anode rod, leading to corrosion that eats through the tank.  If you haven't had your water heater's anode rod replaced (typically about every 10 years), then this thing is a ticking time bomb, and it will fail very soon.</p>

<p>(2) Sediment covering the electric elements / gas burner, at which point performance will be reduced.  This will often cause ""popping"" noises, as the elements get quite hot and then cause water trapped within the sediment to almost instantaneously boil, causing a tiny explosion as the water turns to vapor.   In electric water heaters, this will pretty much cause the lower element to be completely useless, as it becomes buried under more and more sediment, either becoming thermally insulated from the water that it's supposed to be heating or outright failing due to excessive temperatures.  The common symptom of this in electric water heaters is that the hot water will quickly run out, as only the top element is working, and the hot water stays near the top.  I haven't worked with gas water heaters much, but the logic is pretty similar... sediment and scale is going to cover up the surfaces that are transferring heat from the burner to the water, and you're going to lose a lot of efficiency.  (To make matters worse, your water heater probably only had about a 50% AFUE [annual fuel utilization efficiency] rating when it was new, and if it has any sediment problems, it's probably down to 25%.  By contrast, a new gas water heater will have 75-90% AFUE.  Ergo, I would say it's worth it to change the water heater on account of efficiency alone.)</p>

<p>Note: Some of this depends on location -- the harder the water, the worse these problems will be.  </p>

<p>If you don't have a water softener, you should immediately replace the unit.</p>

<p>If you have a water softener, the unit might still have problems, and even if it doesn't, I would replace it on AFUE concerns alone.  If you don't want to replace it, though, you <strong>MUST</strong> at least have a plumber come install a new anode rod and <strong>T&amp;P relief valve</strong> if you have not had the water heater serviced recently.  (If your T&amp;P relief valve is scaled over or has otherwise failed, flooding should be the least of your concerns.  A failed T&amp;P valve can lead to a BLEVE [a type of explosion], which would pretty much flatten your entire house and possibly kill everyone in it.  See below.)</p>

Anyway, the light is now on and won't turn off so I'm guessing just wiring all black to black, all white to white and all ground to ground was a bad idea.</p>

<p>How should this be done?</p>

<p>EDIT:   We used a voltage sensor and discovered that one line is always hot.  Wired it to one of the white lines and hooked up the others to the light.  We now see intermittent flickers, but it won't light up.  Wondering now if I did caused damage to the dimmer switch earlier.   Will put a regular switch in and see in the AM.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: Dimmer switch was bad.  Janessa's answer explained what was going on, and the two comments below are correct in saying I shouldn't be working on it.</p>
","<p>Alright there are two options. </p>

<p>1.Either your light was fed power from the panel (or a plug etc...) first.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>The light switch box was fed power first and your light has two cables in it because it goes to another light after that one.</li>
</ol>

<p>You need to first figure out where your strait hot power is coming in from. I understand that you believe you have found it. Just make sure to double check. Like you say use just a basic light switch (not that dimmer) and test for hot again. Is that wire you believed was hot , still hot when you have the switch in an up and down position? I will give you both options for wiring below. If there is power in both the up and down position of your light switch, than that is the hot power.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If the light was fed power first than here is how you connect the wires. Take your black (hot all the time wire) and marrett it onto the white of the opposite cable (that brings hot power down to your switch). On the same cable (the white you just used that goes to your switch) put the black wire onto the light (under the copper looking screw). Now you have one white wire left (it goes back to your panel somehow or another) so attach that to your silver coloured screw on your light. Done. You have a path, the hot going thru your switch, coming back to the light as switched power, going through your bulb and back to your panel. </p></li>
<li><p>If your hot wire feeds your light switch first. Heres how you wire it. Your switch box will be opened from testing and finding constant hot power in it so lets start there. Take your always hot black and put it on your light switch, than take the other black in that box and put it on the light switch. Take your white that is in the same cable as your always hot black and wire nut it with your other white. Now go up to your light box. Take the two blacks and wire nut them together with a pigtail. The pigtail will go to the copper coloured screw on your light. And take the whites and wire nut them together with a pigtail that you put on the silver looking screw on your light. Done. Power goes thru your switch, out of the switch to the light, thru the light and back on the white/neutral to the panel.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you are using a light that you do not attach to screws you attach to wires, than the copper coloured screw is the equivalent of a black wire. And the silver coloured screw is the equivalent of a white wire. Your dimmer might be ruined but just try first with your basic switch and than add the dimmer in after to see if its ruined...</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

"Can I convert a gas log fireplace to wood burning?","46850","","<p>My house currently has a gas fireplace with (as far as I can tell) a metal firebox and a metal flue running up a non-masonry chimney. Are there any options available to me to convert this fireplace to wood-burning? This isn't out of a desire for increased efficiency, just a personal preference for the flame and smell of wood instead of gas.</p>
","<p>There is no way to <em>convert</em> a gas fireplace to burn wood, unless you are very lucky and the gas fireplace is an insert in a properly functioning solid fuel fireplace (in which case you basically just remove the insert, and have the fireplace inspected).  </p>

<p>In situations like this, you have a couple options.</p>

<h1><strong>Install a Solid Fuel Stove</strong></h1>

<p>This option will require the least amount of work, though can still be quite expensive and time consuming.  </p>

<p>You'll have to follow all local codes that deal with this type of project, but for this example we'll use National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards (NFPA 211 Standard for Chimneys, Fireplaces, Vents, and Solid Fuel-Burning Appliances).</p>

<h1>Clearances</h1>

<p>You'll need 36"" clearance from combustible materials on all sides (top, left, right, front, and back). </p>

<h1>Floor protection</h1>

<p>You'll need a floor protector under the unit, that extends 18"" in all directions (except up/down, that would just be silly). </p>

<h2><strong><em>Listed Stoves</em></strong></h2>

<p>The floor protection requirements will be provided by the manufacturer, for listed stoves.</p>

<h2><strong><em>Unlisted Stoves</em></strong></h2>

<p>For unlisted stoves, the floor protection requirements are determined by the length of the legs on the unit.</p>

<h2>0"" - 2""</h2>

<p>Stove must be placed on non-combustible floor.</p>

<h2>2"" - 6""</h2>

<p>4"" hollow masonry laid to provide air circulation through the layer, covered with 24-gauge sheet metal.</p>

<h2>6"" and Greater</h2>

<p>Closely spaced masonry not less than 2"", covered with 24-gauge sheet metal.</p>

<h1>Reducing clearances</h1>

<p>There are ways to reduce the clearances, by installing special materials around the stove. Check your local codes for methods to reduce clearances.</p>

<h1>Stovepipe</h1>

<p>You'll need 18"" clearance around the stove pipe, as well as a stovepipe thimble where the stovepipe passes through walls/ceilings.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kXABP.jpg"" alt=""Thimble""></p>

<h1>Chimney</h1>

<p>If you don't have a proper masonry chimney to attach the stovepipe to, you'll have to use a factory built metal (A.K.A. prefabricated, Class A, all-fuel) chimney. You likely won't be able to use the same pipe used by the old gas fireplace. You also don't want to connect the stovepipe to the chimney used by your other gas appliances (furnace, water heater, etc.).</p>

<h1><strong>Build a masonry fireplace</strong></h1>

<p>If you've got the cash and time, you could have a proper masonry chimney/fireplace built (or build it yourself).  This option will require modifications to the building structure, lots of masonry skills, a healthy bank account, and a good bit of time.</p>

  <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/5183/how-can-i-efficiently-heat-a-pool"">How can I efficiently heat a pool?</a>  </p>
</blockquote>



<p>I have an in-ground pool at around 20,000 gallons and I live in the northeast (Maine). My pool  gets direct sunlight for about half the day. I would like to extend my swimming season by heating my pool. I don't want to spend the $2000-$3000 dollars on a commercial unit, and would rather go DIY.</p>

<p>I'm wondering what others have done with the most success. I don't think I want to go the small pvc piping route, as those often fail to think about friction gradients in a tube (so for the 100's of feet you need of tubing, your pump effectiveness goes way down). But if the tube size is the right size, I would consider it.</p>

<p>For a fun idea, there's this:
<a href=""http://ecorenovator.org/diy-solar-water-heating-fresnel-lenses/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://ecorenovator.org/diy-solar-water-heating-fresnel-lenses/</a></p>

<p>But I don't want to spend all day tracking the sun (but if you lived in a really sunny area, I'm betting a good method to utilize this would be to include a section of cast iron pipe on your return line and point the fresnel lens at that pipe. )</p>

<p>I'm thinking I would probably need to use propane/wood as my heat source, rather than solar. </p>

<p>Any good ideas out there?</p>
","<p>When I first read this, my first instinct was ""don't"", and I think that still holds. You are mixing water, electricity and possibly natural gas in a single untested design, and if anything goes wrong your pool could drain out, you could get electrocuted going in the water, or you could even end up with a bomb. It's not worth whatever costs you'd save building your own heater versus buying a commercial unit.</p>

<p>If you are really serious about a DIY pool heater, I think the best (safest, most reliable) route would probably be a heat exchanger sourced from a commercial hot water heater tank. You can build the heat exchanger yourself with a 55-gallon drum and some copper plumbing pipe, but for a whole host of reasons I would buy the HWH commercially (you can get gas or electric; your choice, but either way the HWH should be kept in an enclosed indoor area and properly connected to your home wiring/gas). Then, simply draw water from your pool into one closed loop of pipe in the drum, where it will be heated by being in close proximity to the loop which is fed by the HWH (a transfer medium like more water between the two coils might be a good idea). The HWH's water can feed back into itself, and due to natural convection, as the water is heated by the tank and then cooled in the exchanger it will flow through the loop, so there shouldn't be any need for a pump on the HWH side.</p>

<p>The tricky bit will be the thermostat; you'll want the water from the HWH to be hotter than the desired pool temp so that you can rapidly heat such a large volume of water, so you'll need a method to monitor the ambient pool water temperature and stop running water from the pool through the heat exchanger. I think the easiest design would be a temperature monitor that controls an inlet valve, and then the inlet valve is simply a diverter that draws water out of the main circulation pump's loop. If you design the exchanger right, convection can work for you here as well, or you can use a Y with a reducer off of the circulation loop to let the pump's pressure help you.</p>

<p>If you simply must do it all yourself, instead of introducing heat through a water coil from a HWH, fill an inner drum (40 gals or so) with water, put the loop from the pool in that, and then put that in a larger drum with some gas burners or electric heater coils underneath. When the pool needs to be heated, turn on the burners; that will heat the standing water in the drum which will then heat the water flowing through the pipes. You will need the same thermostat with will control both the flow of pool water and the heater element, and you'll also need a thermostat and a temperature/pressure relief on the inner drum (for a demonstration of what can happen without it, check this Mythbusters clip: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGWmONHipVo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGWmONHipVo</a>)</p>

<p>Whatever you do, do not heat your pool water directly. First, it will be very difficult to control how hot that water gets, which can result in burns if the heated water is returned directly to the pool without getting a REALLY good chance to mix with ambient water. Second, there are a lot of chemicals in your pool water, which can react with the water line under high heat (like an open flame), and can erode it causing your pool to drain (and if you're using a gas burner, the flame could go out and then you have a gas leak). Commercial pool heaters are designed with multiple levels of redundancy to prevent overheating, flameout, or energizing the water with any electrical components. You will need to provide similar protection in any design you come up with yourself.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/maK5Y.jpg"" alt=""Paint we are using""></p>
","<p>If you must paint this stained wood, a light sanding with 4-O steel wool or 320-grit sandpaper should be fine. All you're doing is roughing up the surface coat, usually poly, which will let the paint ""key"" to the surface better.</p>

<p>Be aware of the finish originally used on the wood; only poly will take a latex topcoat well, while on most other finishes like varnish or oil-based finishes, latex will not bond to the surface properly; it may peel easily, or even bead up when applied. If this is the case, roughing up the topcoat is not enough; you will have to sand off the topcoat to get to raw wood, and on a profiled wood piece like mouldings, this can be difficult or impossible.</p>

<p>Also be aware of the type of wood; certain woods are ""open-grain"", and will absorb paint deeply into the structure of the wood, requiring many coats to ""fill"" the wood and get a solid color on top. Otherwise, the grain and any knots will show through the final coat until you put 3 or 4 thick coats on. If you have to go down to bare wood on an open-grained wood, you have to seal the wood with a product that is compatible with your paint base.</p>

Someone told me that the discharge head on a washing machine water pump is enough to handle the rise into the attic and the run to the drain, but I haven't really been able to find out if that is true.

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EVi2Y.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Grey water from the sink and washer are collected in the cistern, then pumped up and out of the area when the cistern is filled to a certain level. </p>

<p>If the washer discharges faster than the grey water pump can handle, you're going to have problems. That's why when installing a system like this, the cistern should always be large enough to hold more than the volume of water that will be discharged by the washer.  In the above image, the sink acts as a secondary reservoir (as well as an air gap) allowing the pump extra time to discharge the water. If you're not using a sink it's a good idea to have a larger cistern, and/or a grey water pump that can handle the volume. </p>

<p>You'll also want to install a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_valve"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">check valve</a>, on the discharge line from the grey water pipe.

<li>Air vents that are producing a lot of noise are either
<ul>
<li>too small of a vent</li>
<li><strong>clogged up / broken</strong> (this is you because you're leaking steam)</li>

","<p>From <a href=""http://www.pexinfo.com"">Pex Information</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flexible PEX tube is manufactured by extrusion, and shipped and stored on spools, where rigid plastic or metal piping must be cut to some practical length for shipping and storage. This leads to several advantages, including lower shipping and handling costs due to decreased weight and improved storage options.</li>
<li>PEX plumbing installations require fewer fittings than rigid piping. The flexible tubing can turn 90 degree corners without the need for elbow fittings, and PEX tubing unrolled from spools can be installed in long runs without the need for coupling fittings.</li>
<li>Attaching PEX tube to fittings does not require soldering, and so eliminates the health hazards involved with lead-based solder and acid fluxes; PEX is also safer to install since a torch is not needed to make connections..</li>
<li>PEX resists the scale build-up common with copper pipe, and does not pit or corrode when exposed to acidic water.</li>
<li>PEX is much more resistant to freeze-breakage than copper or rigid plastic pipe.</li>
<li>PEX tubing does not transfer heat as readily as copper, and so conserves energy.</li>
<li>Water flows more quietly through PEX tube, and the characteristic ""water hammer"" noise of copper pipe systems is virtually eliminated.</li>
<li>PEX plumbing installations cost less because:
<ul>
<li>PEX is less expensive than copper pipe.</li>
<li>Less time is spent running pipe and installing fittings than with rigid pipe systems.</li>
<li>Installing fewer fittings reduces the chances for expensive callbacks.</li>

<p>These are very good guidelines that are widely recognized.  However if getting inspected I would just ask your building department for their code requirements.</p>

<p>**NOTE*****  This is how deep your footings would be in undisturbed soil.  So for example if there was a regrading of the land - as often the case in new builds - you would have to go this deep past the disturbed soil or consult an engineer that would sign off on something else.  So if they regraded your land to 3 feet and you lived in Arkansas you would need to go to 54 inches or gets clearance from an engineer to put the footings shallower.</p>

"What could cause clothes to come out of the dryer with tiny burn or scorch marks?","45605","","<p>I have a fairly standard Hotpoint vented electric tumble dryer, which normally works as you would expect, drying clothes, venting the humid air out the side wall, and with a lint trap I empty every load.</p>

","<p>Pop open the front panel under the door and vacuum out the lint. It collects inside the housing and pieces get drawn into the air heating elements and blown into the drum. Having nothing to do with the lint trap, this stuff accumulates because it slowly migrates through the felt drum seal.</p>

<p>You may have a potentially dangerous situation here. Any other type of materials that get into the cabinet will also get vacuumed up and blown through the heating elements (glowing coils) which essentially turns them into glowing embers.</p>

<p>We tried <strong><em>everything</em></strong>.  Goo-gone.  Soapy water.  Various hardwood floor cleaners.  Alcohol.  Windex.  Dry ice.  Steam.  Swiffer Wet Jet.  Industrial Strength Adhesive Remover.  None of these made the cleaning much easier, and even after <em>hours</em> of scraping and wiping, the foam <em>still</em> left nasty black stains on the floor that we couldn't get out.</p>

<p>In our desperation, my dad made what turned out to be a brilliant suggestion: <strong>Orange Goop</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/i3T4G.jpg"" alt=""Orange Goop""></p>

<p>It's an industrial-strength hand-cleaner, used by mechanics to get strong oils and grease off their hands.</p>

<p>It worked wonders getting the foam off the floor.  We'd spritz some on a small patch of foam, wipe it around a bit, let it sit for five minutes, then the foam came off almost effortlessly, leaving no stains!</p>

<p>However, we were desperately worried the Orange Goop would ruin the floor's finish.  We tested a patch and it looked okay several days later, so we did the entire floor in small patches, immediately waxing after each patch, as a precaution.  However, we left an area unwaxed to test, and two years later that unwaxed patch still looks as good as the rest of the floor, so I don't think the waxing was necessary.</p>

<p>Hopefully this helps someone out in a similar situation!</p>

"Why doesn't my GFI receptacle reset?","44974","","<p>I have a GFI receptacle in my kitchen that feeds four other receptacles.</p>

<p>It tripped the other day and I cannot get it to reset.  All of the other receptables on the circuit are not functioning which is to be expected.  I first thought it was a bad GFI receptacle so I replaced it to no avail.</p>

<p>I then checked power at the electrical panel and all of the breakers for the house appear to be providing power.  The breakers for the GFI receptacles in the bathrooms have test buttons on them and trip when it is pressed, however the kitchen GFI breakers are standard non GFI breakers.</p>

"Can a 20 amp circuit have a 14 gauge pigtail directly to one receptacle?","44961","","<p>I'm rewiring a a small part of a wall and I'm confused about a combination of the NEC and the products that I'm able to find.</p>

<p>I'm working on a 20 amp circuit (with 12g wire of course).  I'm connecting 4 receptacles each in their own box, 15 amp receptacles for normalcy.  But the terminals don't seem to accept 12g wire, even on the screws.  My first reaction was to make pigtails 14g pigtails, so that the 14g tap goes directly to the receptacle and is not used to feed the rest of the circuit.  12g in the box, 12g out of the box, and 14g inside the box only.  </p>

<p>Is that type of splice allowed, or should I look harder for a 15 amp outlet that can more easily accept 12g wire?</p>
","<p>I would say 14 gauge wire anywhere on a 20 amp circuit is not OK. The purpose of the breaker is to cut off power before the wiring overheats. If you plug in several devices on an outlet that total 20 amps, you will exceed the safe working capacity of the 14 gauge wire without tripping the breaker. (You may be under 15 amp for each individual outlet but between the two outlets on a duplex receptacle you can exceed the 15 amp rating of 14 gauge wire).</p>

<p>12 gauge wire is a little tougher to work with but I've never had much of a problem getting it attached to outlets. (Working with the extra stiffness &amp; bulk in the junction box is the issue I've usually noticed.) However, maybe you can pick up some 20 amp receptacles, even if you don't anticipate using any 20A appliances? Obviously a 20A receptacle needs to support 12GA wiring...</p>

<p>You might find some chemicals to help remove it, but because spray paint is paint afterall, you will undoubtedly damage the paint underneeth it.  Permanent Markers can often be removed with Isopropyl alcohol if the markings are relatively new - you might have some luck with this on the spray paint too. However, with markers, generally speaking, the longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to remove.</p>

","<p>You can pull carpet up off the tacking strip to do some work. It depends on how much of the carpet you're going to pull up.

"How can I make an outlet switched?","44487","","<p>I thought all I had to do to make an outlet switched was to break off the tab between the hot wires.  Needless to say when I did that, the fan previously controlled by the switch quit working all together, as did other lights/outlets on the same circuit in another room.  Is there something wrong with my wiring (or me)?  Is this enough information?</p>
","<p>No, just breaking the tab off is not enough. You need to have wiring specifically that goes from the switch to the outlet.</p>

<p>What likely happened is this: Most electricians will daisy-chain outlets, using one set of terminals for the feed, and one to go to the next outlet. By breaking off the tab, you removed power to everything downstream from that outlet.</p>

<p>Wiring for a switched outlet varies. </p>

<hr>

<p>Sometimes there is a normal two-conductor wire that goes from the feed in the outlet to the switch (on black), and then the switch connects the two wires, and it comes back and goes to the top outlet (with the tab broken off). In this case the white wire should be colored red, or at least black to indicate it's hot. Red usually means switched. It's against code to leave a white wire carrying hot, but it does of course happen.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ovppy.jpg"" alt=""wiring with switch attached to outlet""></p>

<hr>

<p>The other way it's often done is by having the feed come into the switch, then carried over a 3-conductor wire to the first (switched) outlet, where the red wire is switched and is connected to the top outlet, white carries neutral, and black is hot and is both connected on the bottom outlet and daisy-chained along to the rest. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lk2C7.jpg"" alt=""wiring with switch on feed side""></p>

<hr>

<p>There's other variations as well, though generally the power will be on the same circuit (breaker) - otherwise any fixture on it must have a clear indication that it is powered by two sources, and honestly I've never seen this done in a residential setting before (not even sure if residential code allows it). </p>

<p>So in short, you can't make a switched outlet unless the outlet is explicitly wired that way. </p>

<ul>
<li>If you can re-wire (from an unfinished floor below), it's doable. </li>
<li>If you want to cut holes in the drywall and redo it, that works as well. </li>
<li>For a less intrusive option, you can put in some ""smart"" switches like Insteon, UBP, or X10 (though honestly, X10 has signal reliability problems, I'd stay away despite it being dirt cheap). Benefit of those is you don't even have to replace the outlet - once you have the switch in, you can put plug-in modules anywhere you want that will be controlled by that switch.</li>

","<p>If you look at a service panel without any breakers in it, it will look something like this.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hk18c.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Notice the thick metal plates running vertically, those are your hot bus bars. One is L1 (A), and one is L2 (B). They are each at 120V potential to ground/neutral, and 240V potential to each other (So don't frigin' touch them!).  </p>

<p>When you add breakers, they will make contact with the hot bus bars using the tabs that protrude between the bars.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xgRTQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You'll notice on the cover of the panel that each slot is numbered, with odd on one side and even on the other.  So for a 20 breaker panel you'll have.</p>

<pre><code>1    A    2
3    B    4
5    A    6
7    B    8
9    A    10
11   B    12
13   A    14
15   B    16
17   A    18
19   B    20
</code></pre>

<p>So 1 &amp; 2 will be on leg A, 3 &amp; 4 on leg B, and so on down the panel.</p>

<p>What types of things are fed by each breaker will determine which leg is used more.  For example. If breaker 1 feeds the lights in your living room, and breaker 3 feeds your bedroom lights. If you turn on the living room lights and turn off the bedroom lights, leg A will be used more than leg B.</p>

<p>For 240V circuits, you'll use a double pole breaker that spans two slots on the same side (eg. 2 &amp; 4). This means it will have a hot from each leg, and will use each leg equally.</p>

<p>So the short answer is... It depends.</p>

<h3>More Information</h3>

<p>While we're on the topic, lets tackle some misnomers about phase in this type of system. While this is sometimes incorrectly called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_electric_power"">Two-Phase</a>, it is in fact a <code>3-wire, single-phase, mid-point neutral system</code> (Sometimes called Split-Phase).</p>

<p>As you may or may not know, we are dealing with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current"">Alternating Current</a> here. So viewed with an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope"">Oscilloscope</a>, we'll see a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave"">Sine Wave</a> like this.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Uvmy5.png"" alt=""Sine Wave""></p>

<p>However, since we can measure this system at multiple locations, the waves will look slightly different depending on where we measure. This is where the misconception that this is a two-phase system comes from. Lets slow things down, and look at what is happening in the system as the current alternates.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2qsxp.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>At this point current is flowing in a positive direction on L1, and a negative direction on L2. Because of this if we measure between different points, this is what we'll see.</p>

<p>L1 -> N = +120V<br>
L2 -> N = -120V<br>
L1 -> L2 = +240V  </p>

<p>Now as the current swings back the other way, we'll start to see the sine wave appear.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/z9rJb.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If we take the same readings again, we'll find things have changed.</p>

<p>L1 -> N = -120V<br>
L2 -> N = +120V<br>
L1 -> L2 = -240V  </p>

<p>As you can see, it really is a single phase. Things just get a little confused when measuring from Line to Neutral. A true Two-Phase system, would use 4 wires and the phases would be shifted 90&deg;.</p>

<p>In this type of system the two lines are <strong>not</strong> referred to as ""phases"", instead they are called ""Legs"".</p>

<p>I have metal downspouts that come down from by gutters.  One of them happens to be right by my bedroom window.  When the rain is just right this downspout will often make an extremely loud pinging sound when water is coming down slowly (think someone hitting a coffee can with a spoon ever 2 seconds).  For some reason this rhythmic sound seems to wake me up and then drive me mad.</p>

<p>Has anyone else had this problem and found a good solution?  I tried stuffing rocks up the down spout in the hopes that they would quiet things down.  This works for a short time, but every big storm they seem to wash away.  Suggestions?</p>

<p>FYI - the downspout comes down perpendicular to the ground and then angles out 135 degrees from perpendicular.</p>

"Why don't people use rigid or spray foam insulation in attics?","44057","","<p>I'm looking to upgrade the insulation in my attic bumping it from an R-6 to R-30 or better, and while looking into things I realized I've never seen anyone use rigid or spray foam insulation in an attic.</p>

<p>Is there a particular caveat to these, or is it just that most people prefer fiberglass batts?</p>
","<p>Short answer : money.</p>

<p>Longer answer:</p>

<p>Inquiring at Google Contracting Services and doing some back of the envelope math, I came up with the following price ranges for the mentioned insulation types.</p>

<p>Spray foam is about $0.15-0.21/square foot/R</p>

<p>Fibreglass batts are about $0.03-0.07/square foot/R</p>

<p>Rigid foam panels are about $0.10-0.15/square foot/R</p>

<p>As we can see, in terms of insulation value for your money, the batts take a bat to all challengers.</p>

<p>Now someone will look at an insulation value chart and says ""But foam has a higher R-value per inch, so it's better insulation since you have non-infinite space to put it in"".</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.bontool.com/knowledge_center/KC_Insulation_Values.htm"">Comparing insulation value per thickness</a>, they are correct as shown below:</p>

<p>Spray foam - ~R-6.3-7/inch</p>

<p>Fibreglass batts - ~R-3.1-3.3/inch</p>

<p>Rigid foam - ~R-5-6/inch</p>

<p>Both of the more expensive options achieve more with less thickness, so those options would allow more insulation value to be packed into the same volume.</p>

<p><strong>But</strong>, you're going to bang your head into a point of diminishing returns where you'd achieve more energy savings putting the money towards improving things somewhere else, and you'll hit that point sooner than you think, given the way R-values work*, so that increased insulation density doesn't really get you much gain.</p>

<p>Additionally, installing batts (and rigid foam, for that matter) is a pretty simple DIY job and requires minimal PPE (gloves, goggles, dust mask).  Spraying in foam indoors means you're going to need a full-body suit, gloves, goggles, respirator, etc. which makes DIYing it outside the skill/comfort level of many, meaning needing to hire a professional to do it for you (and the hassle/expense/loss-of-pride that entails), leading people to just go with the simpler batts.</p>

<p>*expanding, R-value basically means that 1/Rth of the heat (or cold, as the case may be) will escape compared to no insulation.  R-6 means 16.6% of the heat is getting out.  adding R-24 of insulation and going to R-30 results in only 3.3% getting out, a saving of 13.3%.  But add another 24 to get to R-54 only gets us down to 1.85%, a saving of 1.45% for the same investment, and as I said above, you can likely find somewhere else to improve things that will get you more than that small savings for the same money, or at an endpoint, that money will buy you more gas/electricity than the extra insulation will save you over any realistic timeframe.</p>

","<p>The screwdrivers are designed to work at a much lower RPM which makes them much more controllable.  They also have a lot more torque than the drill.

<p>One reason is that the aggregate can settle to the bottom much too easily, yes. This is called segregation and results in non-cohesiveness of concrete.
Another reason too much water is bad is that it can result in porous concrete, especially at the surface.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Concrete that is poured too wet will be weak regardless of how it is
  cured. Not all of the water that is added to the concrete mix is
  necessary for the hydration process. In fact, the amount of water
  required to completely hydrate the cement is only about one half to
  two thirds of what is usually added at the batch plant or on the job
  site. The rest is added strictly to make the mix more workable. Adding
  too much water, however, might save work during placement, but it will
  also result in very weak, porous concrete, even with proper curing."" - <a href=""http://www.stanleytools.com/xhtml/p_concrete.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""When there is too much water in the concrete, there is greater

  strength by approximately 500 psi. So for example, if you ordered
  5-inch slump concrete and received 7½ inches, a mix designed to be
  4000 psi would end up being 2500 psi. This represents a serious loss
  in strength, especially if you were placing exterior concrete in a

"Toilet does full-blast, one-second refill every hour or so","43987","","<p>I wouldn't lose sleep over this, except the unexpected and fierce sound startles my girlfriend and cat every time.</p>

<p>So I just replaced the refill valve on our toilet (using a kit, so everything from the lock nut to the overflow spout, but not the plunger or handle).  It works great. No signs of leaking (at least not on the floor or walls). It does a full refill every time right up to the refill line printed on the back of the tank. The overflow spout is above, not inside, the overflow pipe.</p>

<p>Every so often (maybe once an hour), the toilet shrieks for a half-second, like the float drops just enough to cut on the flow and then rises with just a squirt of water.</p>

<p>My first thought was evaporation, but 1) I'm surprised it's that sensitive and 2) I know our old fill valve didn't do this (at least I don't remember it doing it, and I'm sure both gf and cat would have mentioned it if it did).</p>

<p>The one thing I didn't tweak was the water level screw, because the critical point line and overflow pipe were the specified 1 inch apart (eyeballed) and the water fills to exactly the above-mentioned line.</p>

<p>If it is the water level, is this spontaneous and short burst indicative of needing to lower or raise the water level?  And can someone explain why it happens at all? I imagine the water-level adjustment changes where the float ""floats"" so if the water level is where it should be after a refill, why would it run 30-60 minutes later for a short burst?</p>
","<p>The most common problem that causes the symptoms you describe is a slow leak around the flapper. A very small amount of water drains into the bowl over time, lowers the tank level a slight amount and activates the float valve of a couple of seconds to refill the tank.  What you should do before getting carried away dissecting  the fill valve, is to check the flapper, clean it and it's seat well and be sure it is centered on the drain. If there are any signs of wear or cracks around the edges, replace it. Monitor the tank level between phantom fills, does it change at all?  The second thing is to slightly lower the float so the water fills to apx 1/2 inch below the fill mark. This will eliminate the possibility that you may be losing water over the overflow, and tripping the fill valve. </p>

<p>These checks are simple, cheap and often solve a  very common problem.  Good Luck.</p>

Granted that advice was about 15 years ago and none of that wiring is improving with age.</p>

<p>Once you touch the lines at all, rip it all out.  It's very likely that you will introduce a problem between the coating and the wire.

"Can I add a standard receptacle on a GFCI circuit","43712","","<p>So, I want to add a receptacle in the bathroom (I tend to run out of batteries on my phone while crapping at the end of the day).

","<p>You should never chain two GFCI circuits together.  When you install a GFCI circuit, you should only ever chain standard outlets off of them.  Multiple GFCI on the same circuit can cause each other to trip.</p>

"Why do I have blue water coming out of the faucets?","43603","","<p>We have an upstairs bathroom that we've gutted and are having some contractors remodel. The toilet is the only thing that hasn't been touched. We had a plumber come and redo all of the source and drain lines for the new sinks and the shower. The other day, he turned off the water for the entire day to do his work and turned it on when he was done. </p>

<p>That evening, we turned on one of the downstairs baths, and blue water came out for about 2-3 seconds, then it became clear. We tried other sinks and saw the same thing. My immediate fear was that this was somehow the water from the blue bleach tablet we had in the upstairs toilet and that somehow the sewage drain line water from the toilet was making its way into the source line. I'm no plumber, but this seemed improbable to me since they are separate lines and direction the water pressure would probably not allow it to go throughout the entire house the way it did. </p>

<p>The plumber is a trustworthy guy who has done a lot of work for us before. He was pretty astonished when I showed him the blue water coming out of the downstairs bathroom faucet. He rechecked the lines and felt that it was unlikely that the sewage water was getting into the source line, but had no solid explanation for the blue water. He said it could be that the source valve for the toilet tank was somehow letting water back into the source line, but he seemed skeptical. He also said that it could be a coincidence of timing and that maybe the city's copper line has some corrosion which could possibly cause blue water. He suggested getting the city to come check the water quality. </p>

<p>We caught some of the water in a glass to see how blue it is. I apparently can't seem to smell anything, but my wife assures me that it smells like the bleach tablets. We we're going to try to put some food coloring of a different color in the toilet and see if that color comes through. We're also going to experiment with whether it happens only after we flush the toilet. </p>

<p>Any other suggestions? Has anybody seen something like this before?</p>
","<p>By the way, it is not at all easy for this to be sewage getting into your water lines, but it might be a problem of siphoning back into your house lines from the toilet tank itself. If so, it is still a bad thing that really must be repaired. I like the idea of a couple of drops of food coloring as a test of this. It might happen only when the toilet is flushed, and the faucet for the sink is also open.</p>

<p>If that test shows nothing, then redo the test, but this time, turn off the water pressure into your home at the main supply. (There will be a shutoff valve in your basement.) Now, open the valves in your downstairs faucets. This will create a siphoning effect, trying to suck water back from the toilet supply tank.</p>

<p>Since this has happened only once, my guess is it happened when the water pressure for your home was turned off. This allowed water to siphon back into the water supply lines from the toilet tank. An old valve in the tank might explain that.</p>

<p>Regardless, if you confirm this is what happens, then I would add an anti-siphon valve (also known as a back-flow prevention valve) into the water line to the tank. This is a spring loaded one-way valve, that allows water to flow into the tank, but not the other way.</p>

<p>Could this be a copper corrosion issue as the plumber claimed? This seems unlikely for that to have happened since you have not seen it before, but anything is possible. If you have that much copper in your water that is leaching out of the supply lines, this would be something to worry about. So if you do the food coloring test, and there is no sign of backflow from the tank, then I would get a water test done for copper. In fact, a quick check on Amazon finds a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0009E5YIA"">home water test kit</a> that includes a test for copper in your water.</p>

","<p>Oiling your gun on regular intervals is important. In your case, if the pin is stuck, try the following. </p>

<p>Put several drops of oil directly on the pin and slide channel. Remove all nails, reassemble the nose and see if the gun will dry fire against a scrap piece of wood. the gun should fire and leave a dent from the push rod in your wood if it is working.</p>

<p>If the gun still does not fire, then the pin may be damaged or bent. At this point the upper air chamber will have to be removed and the pin assembly removed/replaced.  Rebuilding air guns is not real difficult and parts for a Bostich are readily available. You problem may be a worn or damaged O-ring in the compressor section. Rebuild kits for the upper end have got to be replaced often, especially if they have not been oiled regularly of after long periods of storage.  Parts are cheap. </p>

<p>I recommend leaving a coil of wire in the window return.</p>

  <p>Should I drill a small hole in the rough window frame, and pull the wire through? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Exactly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I do drill a hole, where should the hole be positioned?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Somewhere that meets these criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>a spot that minimizes the run of exposed cable from the window frame to the contact</li>
<li>in a position that won't interfere with the installation of window coverings</li>
<li>in a position that lends itself to finishing the window frame area (e.g. avoid spots that will become finished vertices)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>I guess I'm questioning the workflow more than anything. For instance, do those putting up the sheetrock, installing windows, or those installing the molding around the window typically know how to deal with these wire?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In general, the other trades will make sure your wire doesn't get buried, but where it ends up and in what condition it will be in is uncertain.  </p>

<p>I recommend installing the windows before wiring.  If the returns are drywall, I recommend one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>install your own peice of Sheetrock on the part of the return where the wire is run</li>
<li>have your contractor board the drywall returns but not the walls or ceilings before you wire</li>
</ul>

<p>If your returns are wood, I recommend coiling wire on the studs inside the window frames, and working out a specific plan for how the wires will be handled with your carpenter just before he starts work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will not be installing the system for months after we move in, so would prefer not to have cables sticking out of the window frame until the install is complete. Do I have any chance of fishing the wire out if I drill a small hole in a window frame? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not likely.  If you are concerned about aesthetics, just finish the contact install for those windows that matter.</p>

<p>Unlike window contacts, these are mounted to the walls like any other electrical device.  I recommend using open-backed electrical boxes rather than just a hole in the sheetrock.

"How can I prevent spillage from my bathtub?","43342","","<p>Let's set the scene: </p>

<p>The horizontal surfaces of the bathtub in my apartment are flat. We have a double shower curtain (with the waterproof bit that hangs on the inside of the tub and the fabric bit that hangs on the outside of the tub) and are careful not to splash too much, but the flat top bits of the tub still get water on them when you reach for stuff. The floor in the bathroom is very slightly slanted, so the open side of the bathtub is slightly lower than the wall side of the bathtub. This means that any water that gets dripped onto the short end of the tub (the side with the showerhead) drips down to the floor, and then slowly flows across the bathroom floor to the opposite wall. </p>

<p>Not ideal.</p>

<p>We rent this apartment, so replacing or making major upgrades to the tub is not really an option. (We will have trouble convincing the management company that a few drops of water on the floor merit remodeling the bathroom, since there's no actual leak involved here.)</p>

<p>I need a way to catch the water that wants to drip off the edge of the bathtub and redirect it back down into the tub. (My current plan is to use some foam tubing and rubber sheeting to create a sort of ramp... thing... around the corner of the tub, but I bet this community can generate some ideas that will both look and work much better.)</p>

"Converting closed stairs to open stairs","43307","","<p>I am removing the 1st floor wall section of my stairs.  The stairs were constructed with stringers under the treads, but a closed skirt board was attached.  I have removed the walls surrounding the stairs and the old skirt board.</p>

<p>Should I add a false stringer mounted all the way at the ends of the new, longer, treads or should I build a small wall with different height top plates to effectively make a stringer but provides a nailing surface for drywall?</p>

<p>EDIT:
Sorry, I really asked by question poorly...</p>

<p>The stairs are supported by 3, strong, full length stringers.  I will not be changing the construction of structural part of these stairs.  The two outside stringers are right at the edge of the current tread.</p>

<p>My question is actually about the construction of this new wall.  Should I basically just build a stair shaped wall?

","<p>There are 2 ways to do this, the first way is in essence just cutting the wall at the top of the skirt board and capping it off and setting the handrail on top of the cap that is finishing off the cut wall, sounds a bit crude, but essentially that describes what you will have.<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/50aDg.png"" alt=""enter image description here""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gY9z6.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The other way to do it is by removing the wall entirely, repairing the floor, removing the treads and risers, and set longer ones with return nosings on either side. and re-support the stairs with a new walls under the existing carriages.<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sREfx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6kdwk.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

"When to stop putting out mouse traps?","43241","","<p>So last week my wife and I discovered some evidence of mice fooling around in our kitchen at night (e.g. shuffled cleaning supplies under the sink, hoarded dog food, and of course their droppings). After a little research, I decided to get the classic spring-style mouse traps. I set them with some peanut butter and after a night or two, I woke up to a dead mouse. After that, I cleaned up and set traps again. Things were quiet for a few days but then we got another hit.  A second dead mouse captured.  We were happy up until this point because we figured it was just one mouse but since we got the second one, I had to ask myself ""when do I stop setting traps?"" and ""did the mouse come in because it smelled the peanut butter set trap?"". It's sort of a catch 22 now. I am afraid that the mouse got in ""because"" I had peanut butter out (as part of the set trap).  I'm afraid that if I keep setting traps that I may just be inviting these little guys in. Suggestions?</p>
","<p>Setting traps will kill what you have, but you still have the problem of the mice getting in. you need to figure out how they are getting into the house. Mice can get through incredibly tiny holes, so it might be a chore to find them all. But as you find holes, seal them up. Steel wool is useful for this as they don't like chewing through it. </p>

"How do I install an air conditioner in a larger window?","43147","","<p>I have a brand new AC in the box which was meant for another room, but recently had a baby and her room is too hot.</p>

<p>I want to use the AC I already purchased, but the max window width is 36"" and the window in her room is 48""</p>

<p>Is it possible\safe to use plywood or some other material to act as the AC curtain to make up for the remaining 12"" of space?  Cant seem to find anything on the web. (perhaps I am searching for the wrong keywords)</p>
","<p>You could use exterior grade plywood, but you should still seal it on both sides with paint or clear coating suitible for exterior use.  It still may be somewhat unsightly on the inside.</p>

<p>As an alternative, I have regularly used plexiglas type plastic to fill in the spaces along the sides of air conditioners.  This avoids weatherproofing and appearance issues. It also give you a bit of a view to the side of the air conditioner (this was critical in my New York apartment where the peek-a-boo river view was in the only window that could take the air conditioner).</p>

<p>The easiest way to use this system is to remove the expandable plastic filler frame altogether.  The accordian plastic is prone to leaking air anyway. While the filler sides do not provide <em>much</em> support, they do provide a bit, so it is essential to make sure the air conditioner is well attached behind the upper sash, prefereably with screws, and that the upper sash is blocked from opening with a bracket of some sort.</p>

<p>Cut the plexi to fit. You do need to seal the plexi on all four sides.  One way to to this is to create a molding one side of which will press against the face of the plexi (on the inside surface) and the other side against the side of the window frame, the sill and the upper sash and against the air conditioner itself.  Silicone sealant or similar latex glues can be used to glue the plexi and the molding.  These can generally be removed fairly easily with a razor blade if needed.</p>

"Can I using a 3-phase connection to power 1-phase AC unit?","43143","","<p>I have preparation for an AC connection with 3-phase 220V 3X16A breaker. I want to install a 220V 1-phase unit, which also needs a 16A breaker. The physical connection has screw-on terminals, so there is no worry about plug compatibility.</p>

<p>I have spoken to 3 electricians: one says that I need only change the 3-phase breaker to 3 separate 1-phase breakers, and leave the 2 additional phases disconnected and unused in the AC connection. The other two electricians say that there is no problem leaving the 3-phase breaker and just leaving the unused phases disconnected. All of them agree that there is no worry about the shared neutral of the connections, and say there is no need to re-wire the neutral.</p>

<p>Should I listen to the majority? I tend to trust them more since they are basically telling me that they don't have to work (do nothing = no get paid), so I'm more suspicious of a guy telling me I need to pay him to do the needed changes.</p>

<p>I'm asking both in terms of code-correctness and more importantly, safety for myself, the AC unit and the house (electrocution is bad, blown AC unit is bad, fire is bad).</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> to clarify, mains voltage in Israel (where I live) is 220V. Most older homes have 1-phase 40A (or even 25A) breakers, and new homes (like my own) have 3-phase 3X25A breakers. The main usage for the 3-phase is AC units and electric cooktops and ovens. The rest of the electrical wiring in the house is distributed across the three phases to even out the load.</p>
","<p>Both are correct.  The 3-phase breaker is just 3 separate 1-phase breakers with a handle physically connected so shutting off one shuts off all.</p>

<p>Code correctness depends on your local jurisdiction.  In virtually all USA locations, separate uses of each phase allows either breaker setup, while use of all 3 phases on the same device requires the 3-phase common handle breaker.</p>

<p>The 3 separate breakers would be more convenient with 3 separate circuits since you won't turn so much off if one of them goes off.  But there may be a rule that requires this in some location.</p>

","<p>The jury is still out on these types of products.  I was at a contractors day at my local Lowes and the rep from one of the manufactures of the epoxy style coverings was there demonstrating the product. The end result was a smooth, not sandy, but mottled non skid finish. the dried samples on display revealed about an 1/8"" coating on the wood. I did spend a little time talking with the rep and he cautioned that the wood needs to be clean and free of any loose decay, oil or grease (like from a BBQ). Any loose nails should be replaced, better if the deck was screwed down so nails would not work up through the new finish.  He did not claim that this was a ""fix"" for rotting wood or a surface in very bad condition. This product seems to me to be an alternative to conventional sealers or stain. The claim to fame is that it will outlast regular sealers and stain for years. The previous points about spacing and the top of the joists are very valid. My biggest concern is the holding ability if used over bad wood. I think lots of people will try this hoping to stretch the lives of aging decks. Since this product is so new, there are few anecdotal cases with which to compare it. I might be tempted to try if if a customer insists on it, but think I'll wait until I get some feedback from other contractors or users. the cost is also a consideration, it is expensive.</p>

"Good looking drywall, without mud and tape?","43057","","<p>There are many things I like about drywall. It's easy to cut, moderately easy to hang (practice certainly helps), easy to paint, is relatively cheap, and a fire barrier to boot. I've probably missed a few positive attributes too.</p>

<p>Drywall mud and tape though... well, that sucks, or at least I suck at it, even with practice. It takes a long time, creates a heck of a mess, and is easy to do a bad job and hard to do a good one.</p>

<p>Mudding and taping sucks enough that I don't mind paying for someone else to do it for me. I may even pay a premium. Except, contractors who I know are good at it are already booked to next year and beyond. There are other contractors available, but they are aren't very good (says painful experience), or at least not good enough for the money they want. There are, I assume, some out there who are both good and available, but invisible to me.</p>

<p>Sooo, <em>what if we just skip the painful part, and just use drywall without mud and tape? What are some creative solutions? that still look good?</em></p>
","<p>Hang everything horizontal.  Throw some 1x6s (using wider board will really cover any hanging mistakes - sure 1x4s would work too) on the main seams to make a faux rail.  A lot of decorators are breaking up rooms like this now.  The rail usually being white and different colors on top and bottom.  Your would also need something for the vertical seams.  You can go with 1x6s or 4s again.  This would look fine for the bottom section and could look fine for top but not common.  I guess it would have a alsace/swiss feel.</p>

<p>On corners, including ceiling joins you can use quarter round.  If you painted this well it wouldn't really be that noticeable. White for ceiling joins and the same color as surrounding paint for the other corners or seams. </p>

<p>This could be done.  It could look great.  You could even convince me if you were really good with wood work that this could be done in a similar amount of time as mudding.  But you will spend more time on materials and will have a style that not everyone is thrilled with.</p>

<p>On the issue with taping and mudding... If you apply your coats thin enough then it isn't messy at all.  I do 5 total coats.  I scrape with my knife between each coat.  After the 4th coat I might sand a little if I was messy - but not much.  It isn't messy or hard.  It is very time consuming I agree.</p>

<p>Are there products and/or tools that I can use to repair those spots without substantial sanding, and without refinishing the whole floor?</p>
","<p>Repairing these worn spots should be fairly easy assuming the damage is only to the urethane finish and not into the wood itself. This should be as easy as buffing the affected area with a green dish style scrubby to remove loose finish and slightly level the surrounding surface.  If the scrubby is not quite aggressive enough, use some very fine 220 grit sand paper gently by hand or with a DA or vibrating style sander. Without seeing the area and damage, it is hard to say how far you need to sand, but most likely do the area where the chairs have worn the finish to slightly into the non affected area. Be absolutely sure to get the same urethane product and finish (satin, semi gloss, or gloss) to do the overcoat. After cleaning all dust etc after sanding, apply a VERY THIN coat  of the new finish. Allow this to dry completely, buff sand the area again removing any dust that dried into wet finish, assuring it is extremely smooth to the touch. Repeat this process with at least 3 coats.  I recommend using a good grade foam brush or very good Purdy flared bristle brush. If the area is larger, consider a mohair roller.  A mohair roller is simply a very low nap roller avail at a good paint specialty store. You may see a slight difference in the new finish to the old surrounding area, simply because of the age of the rest of the room, however that is a small compromise compared to having the damage migrate into the wood which will require a much more extensive repair later.

"How do I run ethernet cable through a wall cavity?","42478","","<p>I want to install an ethernet jack in an interior wall of one room. I'd like to run the cable up through the wall cavity (so it is hidden) into the crawl space and back down another wall to another jack which would be connected to the network router. I presume this is a pretty basic thing to do but I'm not sure how to access the wall cavity. The walls are covered by a horizontal beam that gives me no clue what is underneath or how high they are.</p>

<p>Should I drill down at the red X(see picture) and feed the cable through, then guess the right spot to drill a hole at the site of proposed jack (coloured green)?</p>

","<p>To help you with the terms, what you're looking at from above is the top plate.  Frequently there are two 2x4's for a top plate.  Two boards are used for added structure at the joints and extra fire proofing.  This gives you about 3"" of wood to drill through.</p>

<p>As ChrisF mentions, you should run a stud finder up and down the wall cavity near the halfway point to see if any fire blocking has been installed.  This would be a single 2x4, and will almost always be in a wall if the ceilings are over 8' tall.</p>

<p>You'll significantly reduce the odds of insulation in the wall if you are doing this project on interior walls.  You should also be avoiding any electrical in the same wall cavity (between the same two studs).  You would see an outlet, switch, or wire coming out of the top plate if this were the case.</p>

<p>As for the actual wiring, I've used these <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-100195825/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10051&amp;catalogId=10053"">low voltage mounting brackets</a> for the hole in the wall.

","<p>If you're having the same problem I had, and it's a case of rubbing but the door could be forced closed (so it's just slightly off), I just made a note of where it was rubbing with a bit of crayon (wipes off easily), then took a small hand plane to shave down that area slightly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I also made the mistake of passing off the plane to my house mate, who wasn't familiar with its use, and he ended up taking a chunk off of his bedroom door.

"Why is it taking so long for my house to heat up?","42370","","<p>Firstly, I should probably mention that I'm in the UK...</p>

<p>My wife and I bought a house new from a builder over 9 years ago and have had no problems whatsoever with our central heating system in that time. It is a typical modern system with a gas boiler in the kitchen feeding radiators upstairs and downstairs and a pressurised hot water system. The radiators have thermostatic valves on them (except for one in the entrance hall).</p>

<p>Earlier this year, I contracted a local plumber to do 4 things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Replace the original (""bimetallic"") thermostat with a more modern programmable thermostat so that we could keep the heating on over night but at a lower temperature</li>
<li>Service the boiler (for no real reason other than that it was 9+ years old and had never been looked at)</li>
<li>Re-balance the radiators</li>
<li>Re-pressurise the hot water system as the showers had lost their original mains water pressure</li>
</ol>

<p>The system has never been quite right since but of course we haven't really been able to pin anything down until the recent cold weather. We are now seeing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>For a while, the thermostat would call for heat, but the boiler wouldn't fire up. The boiler casing was very, very hot, so I suspect overheat protection had kicked in.</li>
<li>When the boiler does fire, it doesn't stay on for more than a minute and then goes of for 2-3 minutes before firing up again. Again, suspicious that it is overheating.</li>
<li>As a result of the above, it can take all day to get the house up to temperature (20C)</li>
</ol>

<p>The plumber came to investigate last week and made a number of noises about the pump overrun not working, and the possibility of a pump failure, but ruled both of those out. He made some adjustments and now:</p>

<ol>
<li>The boiler appears to fire up reliably, although it does cut out periodically. He assures me this is normal and that it switches itself off while the water is circulated. I can't honestly say I was aware of it doing this before the summer.</li>
<li>The radiators get too hot to touch, but I'd swear you used to be able to feel the heat radiating from them up to 12+ inches away which you no longer can.</li>
<li>But still the house is very slow to heat (it appears to heat up at a bit under 1C per hour).</li>
</ol>

<p>The house is a fairly typical British 4 bed detached (c. 1800 sqft) and is relatively modern (being newly built 9 years ago) so has pretty good thermal characteristics.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does taking 8+ hours to get the house warm sound right? I'd swear it used to be warm within an hour or so of the heating coming on.</li>
<li>What further diagnoses can I perform to help (the plumber and/or you good folks) identify the problem.</li>
<li>Does it sound reasonable to assume (having had 9+ years of faultless service) that my problems stem from the work done in the summer? Perhaps a valve was closed while the plumber worked that he subsequently forgot to open, or something like that?</li>
</ol>

<p>Taken together, all the symptoms sound to me like the hot water is not being circulated around the system quickly enough (boiler over temperature, house not heating up), and the plumber would appear to agree. He seems rather keen to fit a bigger pump. But I'm reluctant given that the system has worked fine for so long previously.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rambling post, but I'm pretty much at my wits' end with this and we have two small children that we'd really like to keep warm over the winter.</p>
","<p>So, nearly a year later I think I've got this solved! It appears that the bypass valve was left almost fully open. This explains a lot. </p>

<p>The ""path of least resistance"" is for the water to use the bypass circuit to return to the boiler instead of going around the radiators, which explains why it was taking forever for the house to heat up. </p>

<p>Now, the water returning to the boiler is almost as hot as the water leaving, having lost very little of its heat in the brief trip to the bypass circuit and back. This explains why the boiler shuts down very quickly. It is expecting a much larger temperature difference between the output and the return and hence gets very hot very quickly. In the mean time, the pump continues to circulate hot water around the bypass circuit. </p>

"How do I use an extension ladder to get onto my roof?","42237","","<p>I have a two storey house and need to get onto the roof to apply some heat paint on my furnace exhaust pipe before winter.</p>

<p>It looks about 20-22' from the ground to the edge my eaves, so to be safe I figure I need a 28' extension ladder. </p>

<p>The ground around my house is level and there is plenty of room.</p>

<p>How do I correctly position my ladder? Do I need to attach it to my roof somehow so it won't fall over (with me on it)?</p>
","<p>Personally, I hate ladders with a passion. :) Heights are best left to birds, squirrels, etc. Having said that...</p>

<p>A ladder stabilizer can often help. This is a bracket that attaches to your ladder. It makes the ladder much more stable when leaned against the house. A nice thing about the ladder stabilizer is it lets you lean the ladder on the wall of your house, NOT against the edge of your gutter, possibly causing damage to the gutters.</p>

<p><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0007R6L8Q"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ladder-Max Stand-off Stabilizer</a></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/knUF6.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Next, make sure the ground is flat and solid under your ladder's feet. If the ground is not so, I made a wooden wedge to place under one of the feet of my ladder to make sure the ladder will be happily placed. The bottom of that wedge has spikes sticking out of it, so it will not slip on the grass. You can also buy extension ladders with one leg than can be adjusted in length to account for uneven ground.</p>

<p>To climb onto the roof, you want to run the top of the ladder past the roof, so it extends far enough that you can hold on when you step on and off. I'd suggest it should be at least 3 feet past the edge of your gutter, and 4 feet is better. I also have a helper hold onto the bottom of the ladder to stabilize it. A helper is a good idea in general anyway. One thing you don't wish is for the ladder to fall down when you are standing on the roof, leaving you with no way down, and nobody around to put the ladder back in position (or, as my wife might add, to call 911 when necessary.) A picture is worth a thousand words though:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lXVBH.jpg"" alt=""fireman pic""></p>

<p>Getting back onto the ladder off the roof is merely a matter of reversing your steps, as you hold onto the top end of the ladder with your hands.</p>

<p>Obey this setback rule: keep the base of the ladder at least 1 foot out from the house for every 3 feet in height. (Yes, many say to use a 1/4 ratio, but I often tend to go for 1/3.) So if the top of the ladder touches the house at 15 feet up, the base wants to be between 4 and 5 feet out. The trick is to not have it at too steep of a pitch, as then it would too easily tip away from the house - a bad thing especially if you are on it. The idea is that when you are standing on the ladder, you always want the center of gravity (of you plus the ladder) to be between the foot of the ladder and the house.</p>

<p>If I have an extension ladder standing on my deck, I'll often screw down a 2x4 cleat outside of the feet. This prevents the feet from moving/slipping out when I am on the ladder. On a grass or dirt footing, the feet of an extension ladder can swivel into what are effectively spikes that can be set firmly into the ground. These prevent the base of the ladder from moving out from under you.</p>

<p>Other rules - don't climb a ladder if you can avoid it when it is windy, or if you are even remotely tired or not completely focused on the matter at hand. If you are very uncomfortable with climbing ladders, money solves all problems here, as you can always hire even small jobs out.</p>

"How do I achieve required torque when using an impact driver?","42124","","<p>There's such tool called <em>impact driver</em> (like <a href=""http://www.boschtools.com/Products/Tools/Pages/BoschProductDetail.aspx?pid=PS41-2A"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a> for example). The manual says it uses a special mechanism to produce a series of torque impulses to fasten/loosen nuts and screws.</p>

<p>The tool has only two adjustments - the forward/reverse switch and the On/Off switch. The deeper the On/Off switch is pressed the faster the tool motor rotates.</p>

<p>There's no clutch to adjust the torque value after which the clutch would disconnect the motor. How do I control the torque without a clutch?</p>

<p>Suppose I need to assemble a section of fence that will require say one thousand screw/nut connections with nuts of the same size (that's not an imaginary task - I did such job without an impact driver). Obviosly I need to tighten all nuts to more or less the same torque. If I overtighten a nut it can just break or cut the screw or bend the parts it connects - that's bad. If I undertighten a nut it will soon loosen and fall out - that;s bad as well.</p>

<p>So let's pretend I use nuts that need to be tightened to approximately 70 Newton-meters and the driver I use is said to produce torque up to 100 Newton-meters.</p>

<p>And of course I need to drive those nuts fast - otherwise why would I use a power tool instead of a screwdriver and a usual wrench? So obviously I can't time the periods of applying torque or count impacts or whatever else - I need some reliable way to achieve more or less the same right torque for all nuts.</p>

<p>Please note: I don't care of achieving exactly the right torque. I only care of achieving more or less the required torque - so that the nuts don't loosen on themselves and parts are not damaged while the nuts are being tightened. The primary concern is that the driver works very fast, so if I hold the switch pressed for just too long I can easily overtighten the nut and cause unintended damage.</p>

<p>How do I achieve roughly the same torque repeatedly for multiple nuts when using an impact driver?</p>
","<p>Usually, around the home anyway, there are other signs to let you know when you've applied enough torque.  MarkD noted a common one -- when you see the screw head just go below the surface of the wood.  In your fencing example, if you're tightening lag screws or nuts with washers, you'll see the washer start to sink into the wood long before you've applied enough torque to shear off or strip the screw or bolt.</p>

<p>It's a great tool for this kind of work, and it's super fast.  Don't slow yourself down unnecessarily by underestimating your own ability to judge how much torque you've applied, and how much is enough for your application.</p>

"How can I remove a stuck bath stopper assembly?","42120","","<p>The drain in our tub is slow and I'd like to snake it. I was planning on going through the overflow / drain stopper toggle plate:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6s0pU.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>But I can't remove the stopper and link from the overflow pipe. It seems stuck—there's maybe 1/2"" of vertical travel and I can't pull it up any more. I've tried a moderate amount of force, but I don't want to break anything and be in a worse spot.</p>

<p>Is there some trick to this? Should I just pull hard? Or does it require disassembly from behind the wall?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Sorry for not being more specific about the fixture: the tub does <em>not</em> have a pop-up stopper in the tub floor. The drain fixture is just a grate (can't get a snake through). I assume that the stopper is suspended in the overflow pipe, like Tester101's second image.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> After fiddling with the lever more I was still unable to get the stopper out. I'm also unable to close the drain plug.</p>

<p>However, somehow in my jiggling I must've loosened the clog, since the tub is now draining well. Oh well, problem solved, I guess! I don't take baths so am not concerned about not being able to close it.</p>
","<p>First, make sure that the clog is accessible via the overflow.  Try this test...  While the tub is draining slowly, pour water down the overflow through a funnel.  If that drains fast, then the clog is in the horizontal arm and no clearing through the overflow will help you.</p>

<p>What works for me is to use a wet cloth to seal off the overflow (replace it first to make as small an opening as possible).  With the tub 1/2 full of water and holding the wet cloth over the overflow vent, a plunger should then be able to clear the clog because it will force water down the drain (horizontal or vertical) rather than pushing water up the overflow pipe (or pulling air down it).  Should that fail, use draino or physically pry off the grate for an auger.</p>

<p>The plunger should pull some amount of gunk back up into the tub while you're using it, even through the grate.  If that doesn't happen and the drainage does not improve, then you may have a clogged <em>vent</em>.  You need air behind water for it to drain quickly otherwise it's like water draining from an upside-down bottle.  Cleaning the vent means going up on the roof and clearing the clog from there -- a hose at full blast will usually do this.</p>

<p>As for fully removing the overflow and parts...  I don't know.</p>

"My 5th (top) floor apartment is shaking; what might cause this?","42023","","<p>I live in a developing country (so don't have much faith in building codes), and have been experiencing increasingly noticeable and frequent ""shaking"" in my top fifth floor apartment. I'm seriously concerned.</p>

<p>My home has been shaking. I have felt small tremors from an earthquake before, and this is the best way to describe it, however, I do not currently live in an earthquake zone, so this is quite worrying. </p>

<p>The ""shaking"" bouts seem to last for about 5-10 seconds, by my estimate; I should also note that this country is not an earthquake zone. My home is the top floor of a five story building, that is rather ""skinny"" (in my judgement, something like a 2.5 - 3.5 : 1 X:Y ratio. When I first began experiencing this shaking a couple of months ago, I thought that it might have been the bed, or even just my imagination, and paid it little attention. However, over the past few weeks, the shaking has become markedly more noticeable, and I confirmed that my girlfriend also felt it. I made a query with the landlord, but I was told that there was no problem, or that it was ""the wind"". After some research on the internet, I found that buildings do indeed sway slightly with wind, and so felt at least somewhat placated in my perhaps overblown fears of building collapse.</p>

<p>However, today, I felt the most violent instance of shaking to date in the late evening, and confirmed that my girlfriend also felt it. This had me very concerned, so I took the step of also asking the tenants on the floor below, and they also confirmed that they had felt the shaking. Based on our positions at the time of the shaking, it was apparent that the shaking was felt at least on the 4th and 5th floors of the building, and at all locations, as I was in the middle, my girlfriend was on the ""left"", and the other tenants were on the ""right"" at the time of the occurrence of the shaking. There was absolutely no wind, and as it was late night, there was no construction going on that may have caused vibrations or such. </p>

<p>I should also note that since I moved into the apartment, there has been ongoing construction on the lower level floors; I obviously have no idea, but my fear is that they may have weakened a key supporting wall or some such.</p>

<p>I decided to leave the building immediately, and I'm currently in a hotel, and plan to cancel my lease and find a new place to live.</p>

<p>So, my question to you, in your opinion, am I overreacting, or is something reasonable likely to be seriously wrong with this building? What sort of tests would a structural engineer perform to determine the cause of the shaking / if a building like this is safe? I ask because it may be that the landlord says she will hire an engineer or some such to look into the problem, and in this case, I want to be sure that my fears are sufficiently placated, as right now I have absolutely no desire to move back into my apartment.</p>

<p>Hope you can help shed some light on this rather scary situation of mine!</p>
","<p>""Normal"" building movement would only be due to wind or earthquake. Movement due to normal wind would only be slightly apparent to very sensitive individuals in very tall buildings, as in dozens of floors. Most people would notice slight wind movement in very high winds or minor earthquakes, but nothing alarming. The only alarming movement anyone would notice would be during strong earthquakes.</p>

<p>How much a building moves due to a lateral force such as wind or earthquake depends partly on the buildings height to width ratio and the relative rigidity of the building's structural elements. The critical width when determining the height to width ration is the building's critical (narrowest) depth in the direction of the force. Since wind and earthquakes can come from any direction, we can simplify and say the least horizontal dimension.</p>

<p>Sometimes people in buildings will sense vibrations caused by passing trains, or even heavily loaded trucks. Some types of soils have a certain elasticity that transmits vibrations from heavy movement into the building's foundation and up into the structure. These movements are primarily vertical in direction and would typically not be threatening to the building, though repeated severe vibrations can cause brittle finish materials such as plaster work to crack or even fall out of position.</p>

<p>A similar movement can be caused just from people moving normally on a particular floor system, especially in smaller buildings, because the floor structure is overly elastic. This usually would not indicate any structural failure is imminent, rather that the structure was not built adequately from a usability standpoint.</p>

<p>Renovations to existing buildings must be carefully planned to avoid disturbing structural, load bearing elements. Not just bearing vertical loads, but lateral loads as well. If they must be disturbed, adequate temporary shoring must be in place until proper permanent structure is replaced. Even if shoring was not done, building movement would not be discernible unless structural failure was imminent. Imminent in building failure can be anywhere from within the next few minutes to happening over a period of several months.</p>

<p>Besides wind, earthquake, heavy vehicles, and compromised structure, the only other cause for building movement would be differential settlement due to foundation not being founded in stable soil materials. This is actually a subset of structural failure, as stable soils is a necessary part of a sound structure.</p>

<p>When an engineer assesses a structure for soundness, testing may or may not be done, depending on the situation. Structural testing often means testing to failure, which is often not feasible in an occupied structure. The engineer will make an assessment based mainly on inspection of existing conditions and comparing with the building's plans to see if it was built in accordance to the plans, if the plans have design errors, if there are signs of failure such as cracks of certain form in certain locations or sagging and deformation of structural elements.</p>

<p>Some small scale materials tests can be done to verify the installed material matches the design specifications by taking samples and testing in a laboratory. Only after considering all available evidence will the engineer make an assessment based on the evidence and his/her experience and knowledge. They would typically publish a report summarizing what they did, what they observed and their findings. While such reports are quite technical by nature, the main gist of it should be comprehensible to any reasonably intelligent person without an engineering background.</p>

"Controlling separate heat and AC devices from a single thermostat","41883","","<p>I have hydronic radiator heat powered by a gas furnace situated in one mechanical room of my house and a currently being installed central AC whose air handler is situated in another mechanical room (separate locations).</p>

<p>I would like to control both of these units from a single thermostat with separate thermostat wires going from the thermostat to each respective unit. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is this possible?  Do I need a special thermostat or can any modern thermostat support this split functionality?</p></li>
<li><p>Product recommendations?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>You can use any heat/cool thermostat on the market to do this. All is required that you run 2 separate 18/4 wires from each system to the thermostat.</p>

<p>R is what carries continuous 24v power to the thermostat. RH is continuous power for heating, and RC is contentious power for cooling. As long as you have constant 24v to these terminals, your system will work. Many modern thermostats have these built in to one terminal on the thermostats (will only show R). All the thermostat does is split the 24v continuous power to RC and RH at there thermostats control board.</p>

<p>From Furnace:</p>

<p>Connect R to R - If your thermostat has RH and RC you can either keep the jumper in, or attach it to just RH for heating. This does not matter as long as you have 24v constant from the unit.</p>

<p>Connect W to W For Heating</p>

<p>Connect G to G for the Fan </p>

<p>From A/c Air handler:</p>

<p>Connect R to R - you can use both R wires at same connection on thermostat if there is only an R terminal. If there is RH and RC like above, you can either leave the jumper in, or connect it to RC.</p>

<p>Connect Y to Y for Cooling</p>

<p>Connect G to G for the Fan </p>

<p>The reason for connecting the G terminal for only the air handler is because you will only really want to have the fan continuously running for the cooling season. Additionally, depending on the type of air handler you have, some control boards require the Y and G terminals to be energized together to run the Cooling and the Fan speed on high. If older units with older style control boards have just Y energized on a call for cooling, the unit will only run the outdoor condenser, which will cause issues with the system. Almost all thermostats will energize G and Y together to avoid this happening if there thermostat is used on a older system.</p>

"How do I remove and reinstall baseboards (Skirting Board) without damaging them?","41309","","<p>I need to temporarily remove the baseboards in a couple rooms. I am interested in some suggestions for removing the baseboards without damaging them so they can later be reinstalled. Suggestions may include</p>

<ul>
<li>Helpful tools</li>
<li>Pitfalls</li>
<li>Removal techniques</li>
<li>Reinstallation techniques</li>
<li>Systems for keeping track of where the pieces go</li>
</ul>
","<p>Pretty easy DIY job. All you'll need is: a hammer, old metal putty knife, utility knife, small pry bar, pliers, and a pencil. For reinstallation, a finish nail gun really makes the job go fast, and a nail set is also useful.</p>

<p>The typical procedure:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cut away any caulk on the top edge and corners.</li>
<li>Check any inside corners to see if they are coped rather than mitered. If they are coped, you have to remove the coped side first.</li>
<li>Use an old putty knife to pry back slightly between the top edge and the wall. Focus any prying near the studs or where ever you find nails, pulling where there isn't any nail too far will risk cracking the trim.</li>
<li>In the crack, use a small pry bar so that all the force is applied to the back of the trim, and not the top edge. Work you way down, one end to the other. To protect the wall, pry against the putty knife rather than directly against the wall itself.</li>
<li>Pull any nails in the trim through the back with a pair of large pliers rather than hammering them back out the face where you'd damage the wood and paint.</li>
<li>Number the back side of the trim and the bottom of the wall where the numbers will be covered up upon reinstallation.</li>
<li>For reinstalling, a nail gun works best with finish nails. One nail per stud and two at the ends is usually enough for basic trim. Use a nail set to sink any nails slightly below the face of the trim. If a nail starts to bend, pull it with the pliers, using the putty knife to protect the trim. Do not bend the nail over and hammer it in sideways.</li>
<li>Paint any trim before it goes on the wall, use a small bit of spackle or wood putty on the nail holes, caulk the top edge and joints, and all that's left is a bit of touch-up paint.</li>
</ol>

<p>Pitfalls:</p>

<ol>
<li>Prying too hard and too far away from a nail, causing the trim to crack.</li>
<li>Applying force to the delicate top edge.</li>
<li>Trying to pull the flat end out of a coped corner first, breaking off the delicate coping.</li>
<li>Not cutting away any caulking, resulting in the paint and drywall pulling away with the trim.</li>
<li>Trying to knock out any finish nails back through the face of the trim, causing lots of damage to the trim.</li>
<li>Nailing in a groove or somewhere that you can't get a smooth spackle finish.</li>
<li>Nailing so close to the edge that the trim splinters.</li>

"Is it ok to screw into a steel door?","41212","","<p>I am looking to hang some blinds over the window on my front door.  Is ok to screw the mounting hardware directly into the door?</p>
","<p>It's definitely not a problem.  As @ChrisF mentioned, the best way is to drill a small pilot hole (1/8"" would probably be about right) and use a self-tapping screw.  </p>

<p>""Self tapping screws"" suggest that you don't need a pilot hole, but they're really meant for sheet metal.  They'll never get started in the steel skin of your door.  A small hole will let them engage.</p>

<p>Drilling steel is not like drilling wood.  Please forgive me if this is too basic, but someone else might find it useful.  </p>

<p>To drill the hole, first locate where you want it with a pencil.  Then use a center punch with a hammer to tap a small indent right where you want the hole.  If you don't have a center punch use a nail.  <strong>If you don't tap a center mark, your drill will skate right across the surface of the door and scratch the paint</strong>.  </p>

<p>Then drill at the full speed applying some pressure directly behind the drill motor, in line with the twist drill.(1)  If you're used to drilling wood you might be surprised how much pressure it takes.</p>

<hr>

<p>(1) A bit (ha ha) of anal-retentive vocabulary: the thing that you plug in is the ""drill motor"".  The thing that actually drills, which most people call the ""bit"", is not a bit, it's a drill, usually a ""twist drill"".

"How do I shut off the ceiling fan without a pull chain?","41171","","<p>So, I move into my new house.  The first hour, my mother-in-law decides to try out the ceiling fan.  She turns the unit on at the lightswitch, then pulls the chain right out of the unit.  The fan is now on at max whenever the unit is turned on.</p>

<p>I still have pull chains to turn on and off the light, and a chain to reverse the direction.  Those two switches however do not stop the fan.</p>

<p>I may replace the pullchain in the future, but for the time being, is it possible to shut off the fan somehow without the chain?  Would it be possible to, for example, bridge the switch connection, then flip the breaker a couple times to switch the fan off?  Any other ideas?</p>
","<p>Here is a good diagram that shows how a 3-speed switch works.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/apclz.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>To control the fan speed without the switch, you'd have to apply current to the proper wires to get the speed you want. Since this is likely a mechanical device (not electronic), the only way to change the setting is to physically move the switch to another position.</p>

<h1>A tiny bit of chain is visible</h1>

<p>If even a small bit of the chain is left, you may be able to pull it using needle nose pliers. If the fan is connected directly to power (not controlled by a wall switch), you'll probably want to shut off the breaker to stop the fan while you do this (so you don't loose your head). Most fans have the same click pattern.</p>

<ul>
<li>1st Click = High.</li>
<li>2nd Click = Med.</li>
<li>3rd Click = Low.</li>
<li>4th Click = Off.</li>
</ul>

<p>So be careful to count your pulls, or you'll be making another trip to the breaker.</p>

<h1>The chain is just GONE!</h1>

<p>If the chain is completely gone, the easiest option would be to replace the entire fan. </p>

<p>If you like to tinker; and have a bit of knowledge about this stuff, you could take the fan apart and replace the switch. It's probably a good idea to have the old switch in-hand, when you make your trip to the hardware store for a replacement. Don't forget to label the wires when you remove the broken switch, you <em>won't</em> remember where they all went.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</strong> Flipping the breaker on/off a couple times, will do nothing but turn the fan on/off a couple times. It is possible to control the speed of the fan by continuously flipping the breaker on/off, but your arm would get tired pretty quick.</em></p>

<li>How much more expensive is porcelain (in general)?</li>
<li>Is it worth spending the extra money on porcelain?  </li>
<li>What are the general pros/cons of each material?</li>
</ul>
","<p>I am going to give you a very short answer to a very involved topic. Ceramic and porcelain are basically similar products. There are very good and very cheap versions or each product. When you go to your supplier, ask about the hardness rating. Softer cheap tile usually has a redish tint on the back side and is made from softer clay, typically in Mexico. Some of the better grades come from Turkey, Italy etc. and have hardness ratings of 5 or above and have a gray or whiteish back.  Most ceramic tiles have a thinner glaze finish than Porcelain. I usually prefer a porcelain glaze on a good hard base in shower and bath applications.  Rather than hitting the box stores first, go to a few tile specialty tile stores where a good knowledgeable sales person can give you a good education on the differences.  If and when you feel comfortable with your knowledge about tile, find a professional flooring liquidator in your area where you may save anywhere from 40 to 80% on overages, returns or closeouts.  I recently purchased 600 sq feet of Turkish porcelain grade 5 commercial tiles for 60 cents a square foot that retailed for over $8 a foot, at a local flooring liquidator. (overages from a hotel job) Huge savings.</p>

"What is the best flooring for my basement?","41098","","<p>I live in Michigan, where humidity is fairly high.  I have a 70 pint dehumidifier that works great.  I also have a sump pump and water powered backup sump pump.</p>

<p>I am looking to floor my basement because I am planning on using it has a home theater.</p>

<p>I have done a lot of googling on this topic and have found a lot of varying opinions.</p>

<p>I don't want to add a subfloor because I don't have much headspace to play with.  Currently it has a drop ceiling and I am 6'4"".  I am only a couple inches from the ceiling standing on the unfinished floor.</p>

<p>I have been looking at different carpeting and vinyl options.
I am trying to finish around 600 sq ft so price is a concern here.  I would like to stay under $1000 and can do installation myself if needed.</p>

<p>I am concerned about moisture not being able to dissipate into the air and instead getting trapped under whatever flooring I put down.</p>

<p>Is it okay to use a padding with carpet? Do they make special padding that allows for air to transfer through it?</p>

<p>Is vinyl going to trap moisture underneath and cause mold?</p>

<p>I don't really like the look of painted/stained concrete so I want to avoid that option.</p>
","<p>I lived in a house that had standing water once or twice a year.  It had a pad with berber(?) carpet on top.  It dried easy with a space heater and fan within a day of these wet periods.  Usually a 5x10 foot area got wet.   When I went to pull up the carpet both the carpet and pad were in perfect condition.  I asked a friend who had done installations for years and he said that I had an open-celled padding with no moisture barrier and if they are dried out thoroughly within a reasonable time he has never seen mold.</p>

<p>So new house I am in is basically about the same as yours.  I am putting down carpet in part of the basement with pad.  Almost all pads are open-celled and you would have to ask for one with a moisture barrier - so if you go to a carpet store and pick out their normal padding that is the right thing.</p>

<p>Also I am using <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/TrafficMaster-Allure-Ultra-7-5-in-x-47-6-in-Vintage-Oak-Cinnamon-Resilient-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring-19-8-sq-ft-case-517115/202352552#.UiYwRT-O7Tc"" rel=""nofollow"">Trafficmaster Allure Ultra</a> on part of the basement which I have used on jobs.  I am not a HD homer - but I have used this stuff and it is awesome.  It is pure rubber and even if you got mold (you shouldn't) it would just clean right off.  </p>

<p>As for your $1000 budget.  You are going to have to get some very low grade carpet to meet that.  Do not get non-floating vinyl.  If you have to install the vinyl to the floor and you do have moisture problems you are in for a big mess.  The recommendation I have above is $1800.  Also a great website for flooring builddirect.com has other all rubber options but they may make you have a minimum order.</p>

"How to catch smart mice that avoid anything that remotely looks like a trap?","40796","","<p>We've had mice since last year (maybe even the year before) and they seem to have smartened up after successfully using snap traps the first time we noticed them. We probably caught at most 10 and I'm pretty sure that they've bred a thousand more over the months. </p>

<p>I've plugged a couple holes in the bathroom walls with fine steel wool, one hole that isn't made by a mouse (no idea why it's there) and one that is. There's another hole in one of the bedroom walls that I'm afraid of plugging because I don't want to end up with the possibility of dead mice in the walls. </p>

<p>The steel-wool in the mouse-made hole mysteriously disappeared in about 2 weeks of plugging, and continued to do so within a week of replugging it. Bits of the wall were on the floor when it happened so I'm assuming the mice are pulling it into the walls. I just place a glue trap in front of it now instead of replugging.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's a list of other things I've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Putting the food away. They still come to scratch the walls and other things to find nesting material I'm guessing.</li>
<li>A bunch of snap traps in the recommended positions, changing the type of bait occasionally when I noticed I haven't caught anything in a couple weeks. Unfortunately, they remained uncaught. I've even tried 'hiding' the traps with tissue paper, haha. One with bait under the paper, over the paper, and no bait at all.</li>
<li>My brother tried the live bucket trap; didn't work.</li>
<li>Glue traps worked twice. I'm not sure about the first time, but I'm positive the second catch was pure luck.</li>
<li>I've a Victor electronic trap that's been on for a few months with nothing in it. I've tried baited and unbaited (which it currently is right now), nothing.</li>
<li>We have those bait stations that go into a corner, but they haven't done anything since being put up either.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's about it. One thing about these mice is that they don't care what time of day it is, they'll still venture about the house, usually a day before, after, and on the weekends. I'm certain they also just walk around the traps. There have been times when they ran away upon seeing me and avoided all the paths with snaptraps waiting.</p>

<p>Anything I can do? Sorry for the long post.</p>
","<p>Every time I have dealt with a rodent issue they ALWAYS eat the poison pellets.  Now can you live with a dead mouse somewhere?  Maybe it isn't the best inside way to catch them.  But if you hit them with pellets all along the outside of your house 2-3 heavy sweeps over a course of a few months they will all be dead or close.  They share food when close.  I have done this on a couple houses and I not only killed the mice but didn't notice a chipmunk or squirrel for a while.  I would try this even if you have an inside problem because often they will nest outside right by your house.</p>

I noticed there was an arc of darker color going against the grain on the test scrap. Any ideas how this happened? </p>

<p>I made very sure that I sanded with the grain (by hand), starting with 100 grit, moving to 150, and finally 220. The only thing that I can think of is I wiped the sawdust away with a <em>very</em> slightly damp rag, without paying attention to grain direction. Then about 15 minutes later I applied the wood conditioner. Could the be the cause of the streaking? I'd like to figure out the cause before I move onto staining my actual project.</p>

<p>Also, I applied a second coat of stain 8 hours after the first. I let it sit for about twice as long before I wiped it off this time. I didn't notice much of a difference in color from the first coat. Is there something about gel stains that it doesn't matter number of coats/how long it's left on?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Here's a photo (the streak starts in the bottom left and goes toward the top right):

"What is the best way to calculate the angle at which crown moulding should be cut?","40698","","<p>What is the best way to calculate the angle that crown moulding should be cut in the compound miter saw to fit an inside corner?</p>
","<p>Most crown molding is going to have to be cut flat on the table.  the angles are going to be 52 degrees on the angle, and 38 degrees on the bevel.  For your corners, you are going to want to cope them instead of trying to fit these angles.  Coping is the proper way of installing any type of trim (crown mold, base, shoe molding, cherry rail ect.)</p>

<p>How you would cope your corners is by getting your measurement to the wall.  You will be running the coped end into another piece that is cut square into the wall.  Your wall measurement for your coped piece is going to be the long point of your 52 degree angle, and the long point of your 38 degree bevel.  You will then take a coping saw and cut back into the piece cutting along the short edge of your bevel cut.  Following the pattern of your molding.  A good technique to installing to ensure a tight fit is to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First make sure your corner fits well into the other piece.</p></li>
<li><p>After you have to corner matched nail the molding about 4-5 feet back from the corner to hold the piece up for you.  Also, leave your square cut loose as well.  This way you can manuver both pieces to fit right incase the corner is out of square.</p></li>
<li><p>Match your corner and nail where it fits snug.</p></li>
<li><p>Nail in the middle of you first nail and the corner. If there is any slack, push the middle in and nail.  This will help seat your corners and give you a nice fluid look.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you choose to try to angle you corners you are going to spend all day trying to get them right.  It will not look good, and you will waste a lot of time.  With coping you can get away with being a degree or two off without it opening up at the base or top of your corners. </p>

<p>I have done trim carpentry for 8 years and this is the best way to put up your molding.  It will look great, and you will not have to worry as much about the expansion/contraction of your molding due to season changes.  Also another tip.  On your long runs, make sure you bevel the ends together when joining two pieces in the middle.  Do not ever but up square ends when installing any type of trim.  Happy DIY </p>

"How can I remove the tile from this wall?","40612","","<p>Doing a tile removal on our master tub/shower.  I'm pretty sure the tile is original to the house, which is 34 years old (1978).  It's a 4 1/4 inch tile, that has been backed by dry wall.  When I was at Home Depot, I asked about what the best tool was and was directed to a <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-100507481/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1#.UL7VdIPO1SM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2 3/4"" ""Electricians"" chisel</a>.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8nPgz.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>After watching a few videos, it appears many people use some sort of curved chisel to help approach the back of the tile with a more perfect lateral, where as with the chisel we have (above) is straight and will always angle into the wall/backing a bit.  I'm not sure if that's part of our problem or not.</p>

<p>Right now, the tiles are coming off in very very small pieces - maybe thumb or finger size if we're lucky.  Furthermore, they are really only coming off with the drywall backing.  If we get the chisel in deep enough and try to pry, the whole wall of tile moves, but clearly not enough to just pull the whole thing off as one piece (tile + drywall backing), given the nails keeping the drywall anchored are (as expected) numerous and spaced through-out the backing.</p>

<p>Any recommendations? Are we using the wrong tool here?  What should I expect when removing from dry-wall backing?  Should we loosen the grout first with a grout-removal tool (we have an oscillating multi-tool we can get the grout-head for)?  </p>

<p>Below are some pictures of what we are seeing.  These three pictures represent the sum of about 45 minutes of actual chisel work, and a huge mess of tiny and in some cases pulverized tiles.  </p>

","<p>When I used to do a lot of these for a building/renovation company, the approach our foreman recommended was to assume the drywall will need replacing anyway and just rip it out. That would let you remove that entire panel in 45 minutes, and then you can just pop a new piece of drywall in, which is another 15 minutes.</p>

<p>As you can see from your 45 minutes, the drywall is going to be ruined, so just bite the bullet - get in behind it and pull it all off. The use of a crow bar and hammer may help here.</p>

<p>If you are wanting to keep the tiles on the adjacent wall, make sure you have cut a gap in at the corner so you don't rip it out as well.</p>

<p>Also, make sure you have something over the drain, to avoid it becoming clogged (I know - sounds obvious, but people do forget)</p>

<p>Updated to incorporate comments</p>

<li>Cement board and a vapour barrier are the only suitable backing for your tiles here. Drywall shouldn't have been in there to begin with.</li>

"How should I prepare a plywood subfloor for vinyl sheet flooring?","40515","","<p>I'm planning on replacing the carpet in my dining room with a vinyl sheet flooring.  I know I need to get the carpet, padding and any staples/debris cleaned up before laying the vinyl, but do I need to do any other prep work on the plywood subfloor (ie. fill cracks between sheets of plywood, etc.)? </p>
","<p>Vinyl isn't very thick, and it is quite plastic.  This means that over time, it will conform to the shape of the floor beneath.  This means that you will see grooves in the vinyl where there are gaps between the plywood sheets.</p>

<p>This means you want the sub-floor to be as smooth as possible.  BUT!!!! you need gaps between the sheets to allow for expansion or else you risk having the sub-floor develop a slight buckle.</p>

<p>Here's what I would do under ideal circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spend some time screwing down the existing floor to the joists.  This is likely the only opportunity you will have to do so.</li>
<li>Get some 1/8"" Hardboard, Lauan or birch plywood (one side smooth) and lay it down without gaps over the sub floor.  At this thickness, you can staple it down.</li>
<li>smooth any edges/fill any gaps.</li>
<li>Lay your vinyl.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, you need to make the call as to the quality of the existing floor the level of imperfection you are willing to tolerate.  It may not be worth the extra expense and labour to do it this way.  In which case, I would fill the worst gaps, sand down the worst edges, and lay down the vinyl.</p>

","<p>I would not waste the insulation on an outside wall unless your garage door was getting insulation.  Drywalling has benefits though...

"How do I improve Pergola Stability?","40344","","<p>The deck is nearly finished but I have a small structural problem with the pergola.  A left or right force near the top of the pergola (such a a tall person leaning on the post) leads to a bit of noticeable wobble.  Everything is rock solid at the deck level, and there is no wobble in the in/out direction. The span is 12' from post to post.  The beam is 2x6 cedar, with 2"" x 2"" notches where the pergola joists connect with a six inch screw coming in from the top.</p>

<p>I'm thinking up putting 2x6 cedar diagonals at the posts to the beam, connecting at the first pergola joist on each side (20"" from post) at a 45 degree angle.  Does this sound like the right thing to do?  Is 20"" enough?  The next joist would be at 40"" from the post, and would come down too low.</p>

<p>[<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rstJDl.jpg"" alt=""Newly Completed pergola"">(<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rstJD.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://i.stack.imgur.com/rstJD.jpg</a>)</p>

<p>RESOLUTION:
I've added one 2x6 45 degree brace in the upper right corner.  It stabilized it significantly.  I'll put up the other side when time allows.</p>

<p>FINISHED: Rock Solid now. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HXKNJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>The pergola is much like a stick framed house--the framing itself resists vertical forces (gravity) but in and of itself, has no resistance to shear forces (side to side). For a house to stand up on its own, the sides need to be braced against shear forces...typically that's done with plywood sheathing. Barring that, diagonal bracing can be used.</p>

<p>On the pergola, since it's attached to the house, the house is acting as shear resistance on 3 sides of your pergola, but the front is the weak spot, as you've found out.</p>

<p>Some potential options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>sink the front two posts into the ground several feet and surround with concrete (typically you'd want 1/3 of the post in the ground</p></li>
<li><p>add diagonal bracing. 45 degrees is the strongest but for the pergola, likely not a requirement. If 45 degrees brings the braces too low, you could consider a different angle. Or make it an architectural detail...perhaps bringing the braces on the outside of the posts (extending the top beam)</p></li>
<li><p>metal reinforcement. Pick up some metal L-plates. The bigger the better and attach them to the post and beam. </p></li>
<li><p>add a railing to that side of the deck and diagonal brace that (tensioned cables, wood panels, diagonal rails, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>add tensioned metal cables diagonally between the tops of the two posts. Not sure you could enough of an angle to make that work or not, though.</p></li>
<li><p>add diagonal bracing to the TOP of the trellis. Create a giant 'x' using wood beams or, again, possibly tensioned cables. That will transfer the horizontal shear forces on the front back to the ledger and house. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>You will have to do something, though. Even a 'wiggle' of a couple of inches will cause problems over time as the wind rocks it back and forth. The hardware may not fail but eventually the wood where the hardware connects the members will fail with wear over time. </p>

<p>Of the options I listed, I'd probably start by getting some large L plates. It's likely the least expensive option and you can hide them fairly easy on the inside of the posts and beams. Alternatively, you might be able to use some heavy duty metal shelf brackets. As a bonus, you might find some with some architectural detail that will look nice. </p>

<p>PS: After re-reading your question, I have a few structural concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you state your beam is a 2x6 with 2"" notches. The notches means your beam is really just a 2x4. While there isn't much of a load (just the joists) a 2x4 can't really support any force without noticeable defection over time. I'd be worried that in a decent storm, there could be enough force to eventually snap it. That would be worse-case. Best case, though, I think it'll just start sagging after a season or two and look ugly. I'd consider under-mounting an un-notched 2x8 or even 2x10. As a bonus, that can help with resisting some shear force.</p></li>
<li><p>I can't tell if the house-side is actually connected to the house. You do have 2 posts back there so now I'm thinking this is maybe a free-standing pergola. If that is the case, then you have <em>no</em> shear force resistance on any of the 4 sides--so you'll need to apply whatever solution to all four sides if that is the case. [EDIT: I just saw your comment in the other answer, the back is, indeed, a ledger. So disregard this one]</p></li>
<li><p>you mentioned that you attached the beam to the posts with a screw. Note that a) screws have <em>very little</em> shear force resistance (compared to bolts, plates or even nails) and b) one screw isn't going to cut it. If it's truly being held with one screw on both ends, they could snap quite easily with minimal force. Simpson hardware and/or through- or lag- bolts should be used to make those connections. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Again, these are all assumptions so apologies if you've already accounted for those issues--but if not, please do consult local codes. I'm concerned that the structure is way under-built and a good wind storm can send large pieces of wood flying in every direction--dangerous to your home and anyone in the vicinity.  </p>

","<p>Your problem is very common with old multi=turn valves. The packings in the valve have probably dried out and split or shrunk a bit.

"Can I safely ground a light fixture if the ceiling box has two hot and one neutral wire (no ground wire)","40207","","<p>Checking for dupes, I saw <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/20351/how-should-i-connect-the-ground-wire-for-my-light-fixture"">this question</a>, but the situation appears different as my box is metal, among other things.</p>

<p>I'm fairly new to electrical projects, so bear with me. I recently installed a new light fixture in a ceiling connection in a new building.   </p>

<p>The fixture has black, white, and exposed ground wires, and came with instructions to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Connect the black wire to the black wire</li>
<li>Connect the white wire to the white wire</li>
<li>Connect the ground wire to the green screw, and then to the ground wire.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I checked that the power was live on a meter, then re-metered after cutting it to ensure it was safe, and proceeded to connect the wires as described, using the white, black, and brown wires in the ceiling.   </p>

<p>When put the power back on, the light turned on.  But when I hit the light switch, I got a fireworks display and tripped the circuit.  After some research, it would seem that the ""brown"" wire that I assumed was the ground (by process of elimination) was more likely meant to be red (damn you, burnt sienna!), and was in fact a second ""hot"" wire, probably for a ceiling fan, or maybe a 240V device.  I'd connected the second ""hot"" wire to the exposed ground on the lamp, which was... not awesome.</p>

<p>So, I reconnected the black and white wires, and since there's no ground in the box, just connected the lamp ground to the green screw on the crossbar that's now screwed to the metal box.</p>

<p>I get that my worst initial mistake was not testing the voltage on each individual wire before connecting the fixture.  And I get to apply that next time, since I'm not dead.</p>

<p><strong>But here's my question:  Is the lamp still grounded, given that it's screwed to a bar in a metal box, or does the lack of an actual ground wire in the box mean I can't ground it?</strong></p>

<p>If I can't ground it, how concerned should I be when changing the bulb?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:  Some clarification points -</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The building is very new.  I think it was completed in 2008</li>
<li>The box in the ceiling (more like a cylinder, really) is metal, but I don't know if it's connected to some kind of ground wire behind it, as it's attached to the ceiling and I didn't try to remove it.</li>
<li>There were three insulated wires in the cylinder: White, black, and brownish red</li>
<li>The black and red both were ""hot"" on a meter; the white was not</li>
</ul>
","<p>Sometimes when ceiling boxes are roughed in, they use <em>x</em>/3 with ground cable so that they can supply 1 switched hot, 1 neural, 1 hot/switched hot, and 1 ground to the ceiling box. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5T9gW.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This allows a ceiling fan to be installed in such a way that the fan can be controlled either by a separate switch, or using only the attached pull chain. In this situation the red wire in the cable is usually disconnected and capped at both ends, and is only intended to be connected as needed.</p>

<p>You may be able to verify this by opening the switch box, and verifying the wiring at the switch. If this is the case and the extra hot wire is not needed, it should be disconnected and capped at both ends. Once that's complete, you can move on to determining if you have a proper grounding conductor.</p>

<h1>Grounding Conductor</h1>

<p>If the building was renovated/built in 2008, it's not likely the circuit does not include an ground conductor.  However, there are multiple ways to satisfy the grounding conductor requirement according to <strong>NEC 2008 250.118</strong>.  </p>

<li>Surface metal raceways listed for grounding.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Checking for a Grounding Conductor</h1>

<p>The most accurate way to verify whether or not there a proper ground connected, would be to check for continuity between the junction box and the grounding electrode system.  In most situations this is not an option, so another test must be performed.</p>

<h3>Checking Continuity to the Grounding Electrode System</h3>

<p>To run this test you'll either have to be within reach of; or be able to run a lead to, the grounding bus in the main service panel. </p>

<ol>
<li>Set your multimeter to the continuity setting or the lowest
resistance setting.   <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/i8Qyp.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">   </li>
<li>Place one lead on the grounding bus bar in the load center.   </li>
<li>Place the other lead on the junction box under test.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the meter beeps or gives a reading close to 0, the box and the load center are electrically connected.  This means there is a proper grounding conductor installed.  If the meter does not beep or has a reading of infinity, the box and the load center are not electrically connected.  You'll have to install an approved grounding conductor throughout this circuit, if you want proper grounding.</p>

<h3>Checking Continuity to a Known Good Ground</h3>

<p>If you have a known good ground nearby (from another circuit, for example), you can use this ground to test for an equipment ground at the box in question.</p>

<ol>
<li>Set your multimeter to the continuity setting or the lowest
resistance setting.   <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/i8Qyp.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">   </li>
<li>Place one lead on the known good ground.   </li>
<li>Place the other lead on the junction box under test.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the meter beeps or gives a reading close to 0, the box and the known good ground are electrically connected.  This means there is a proper grounding conductor installed.  If the meter does not beep or has a reading of infinity, the box and the known good ground are not electrically connected.  You'll have to install an approved grounding conductor throughout this circuit, if you want proper grounding.</p>

<h3>Check Continuity to the Grounded Conductor</h3>

<p>If neither of these options are available, the next best option is to check for continuity between the box and the circuits grounded conductor (neutral).  These two conductors should be electrically connected (bonded) at the main service panel, so checking continuity between them can (usually) determine if there is an equipment ground.  </p>

<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This method relies on the circuit being installed correctly. If the grounded conductor (neutral) is (incorrectly) connected to the grounding conductor anywhere along the circuit, this test may give invalid results.</p>

<ol>
<li>Set your multimeter to the continuity setting or the lowest
resistance setting.   <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/i8Qyp.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">   </li>
<li>Place one lead on the grounded conductor (neutral).   </li>
<li>Place the other lead on the junction box under test.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the meter beeps or gives a reading close to 0, the box and the grounded conductor (neutral) are electrically connected.  This means there may be a proper grounding conductor installed.  If the meter does not beep or has a reading of infinity, the box and the grounded conductor (neutral) are not electrically connected.

"Does a homeowner need a permit for electrical work in Massachusetts?","40127","","<p>Does a homeowner need to obtain a permit from the town in order to do electrical work on his own house in Massachusetts?

This seems to indicate that electrical work that is not for hire does not need a permit, but I don't know if it's the whole story.</p>

<p>The final paragraph of the same section of the law says that “Any person installing for hire electrical wiring or fixtures subject to this section shall notify the inspector of wires in writing upon the completion of the work. The inspector of wires shall, within five days of such notification, give written notice of his approval or disapproval of said work.”  Again limited to work for hire.</p>

<p>(In order to avoid localizing this question further, let's ignore the fact that individual towns may have stricter rules.  And it's obviously dangerous for a homeowner to do electrical work he is not qualified for, so many of us should hire an electrician for everything except the simplest work.)</p>
","<p>I called the building commissioner in the town of Maynard, MA. He said that by state law, homeowners are entitled to do their own electrical work. However, the state's Division of Professional Licensure has instructed his inspectors not to issue permits, except to licensed electricians.

"Can I hang a bathroom shelf with command strips or something similar?","40047","","<p>I'm currently living in an apartment that doesn't allow me to put anything larger than a finishing nail sized hole in the wall. I have a small bathroom shelf that I would like to put up that consists of a lightweight metal frame with three tempered glass shelves as well as a towel rack on the bottom.</p>

<p>Initially my thoughts went to the 3M command strips. I know they have picture hanging strips that essentially consists of velcro on top of command strips. But I have a feeling that this wouldn't hold up  and the shelf would fall down. So I was thinking it might work out to buy the plain command strips and put them directly on the back of the shelf where it would contact the wall. I see that they're rated for around 5lbs each and I believe loaded the shelf wouldn't be more than 10lbs or so. I'm just curious if this would work or if it might end up causing more damage than just putting holes in the wall?</p>

<p>Does anyone have any experiences with hanging something of this nature without damaging the wall?</p>
","<p>I would not risk hanging a glass shelf with those strips.  They are meant for hanging things directly from (like a towel, hair dryer, etc.), not a shelf that sticks out.  Instead of just pulling down on the strip, it will pull down and away, almost a guaranteed recipe for broken glass.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is no way to anchor something to the wall without proper anchors.  If you are able to get the shelf anchored into a stud then the hole should not be all that large - it's the drywall anchors that tend to make larger holes.</p>

<p>If the wall was concrete you might be able to glue it to the wall, but this will leave a larger mess (leftover glue that someone has to scrape off) than screws in drywall.</p>

<p>Perhaps you could offer to repair any damage you are responsible for?  Otherwise you should get a free-standing shelving unit.</p>

The microwave I'd like to replace it with (Whirlpool Gold) happens to be an over the range model. Is it OK if I use an over the range model in a cabinet? Reading the installation instructions it's hard to tell since they talk about ventilation, but I'm guessing that ventilation is for the stove below (which won't exist here).</p>
","<p>In almost all cases you can do this.  The difference between the microwave models is more about the mounting and how the front looks.  There are basically three general types.  Your typical countertop microwave which some people just stick in cabinets - which is fine given that the electrical is done right.  The you have your over the range which usually have two extra functions - an undercarriage with range venting and lighting, and simple mounting brackets on the top.  Then you have your cabinet or built-in models.  These are the least sold and usually cost a bit more because they have a nice mounting plate in front.  </p>

<p>Any ventilation space that you currently have should be adequate for whatever you get.  In your particular case my ""problem"" would be the undercarriage.  These microwaves are generally not made for sitting on their bottoms which have a fan and lights and usually a plastic casing.  This casing may break or crack over time.   I don't see an ""issue"" with doing this - although I would simply double check by calling Whirlpool - but I wouldn't do this unless I was 100% certain that the bottom of that microwave wouldn't be damaged because of movement and rubbing.  Also I can't see how this aesthetically looks the best of the three options.</p>

<p>I know about the standard spacing that must be left between the flooring and the walls.  I also understand I should run flooring parallel with the longest wall.  I would like to know if I should just run the entire flooring from room to room, or if I should separate it based on the rooms and have T moulding to transition from the bedrooms to the living space.  I think this would help with the expansion of the flooring and be less likely to have bowing.  I think it would look better to have no spacing at all, so maybe I'm being paranoid about the spacing/bowing.  Is there a standard for this type of transition?  I think once you reach a certain square footage you need to insert a gap, but I'm not sure what that is.  Any advice is appreciated.</p>

<p>The short answer is it depends.  If the staircase will be carpeted or if there is no overhang on the treads then the answer is tread first.  Basically this is faster because your treads don't have to be perfect.  Also your skirt doesn't have to be perfect. </p>

It contains a vial filled with liquid that seems to be mounted in a flex metal plate. It is a safety device that is supposed to trip when the temperature inside the combustion chamber goes above safe limit. This could happen due to ""Flammable vapor incidence"" or for variety of other reasons. There is not much information about this online. This device tripped off for the gas water heater and the first plumber did not even know anything about it. He thought that it was thermocouple gone bad.

"Why is it safe to use 15 A receptacles on a 20 A circuit?","39169","","<p>OK, the one answer I got was way off target, and another commenter couldn't figure out what I was asking, so I'm restating the question...</p>

<p><strong>Are 15A 3-prong grounded outlets actually rated to 20A, allowing them to be used on 20A circuits? And if so, why, when the outlet can never be asked to supply more than 15A by anything that would be plugged into it?</strong></p>

<p>More info:</p>

<p><a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/11803/would-there-be-a-problem-installing-20a-switches-on-a-15a-circuit"">This question</a> had a comment that 15A outlets were actually rated to 20A. However, by design, there is nothing that will plug into a 15A outlet that will draw more than 15A. An appliance that draws more than 15 amps would have a ""T-blade"" plug that wouldn't go into a standard 15A outlet. </p>

<p>In addition, outlets are always wired in parallel, meaning that a 15A outlet would never have to transmit the amperage draw of a ""downstream"" outlet; you never ""daisy-chain"" outlets by connecting hot to neutral, for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>So, there is AFAIK no situation in which a 15A receptacle would ever have to handle more than 15A, even if installed on a 12AWG, 20A-breaker circuit.</p>

<p>If all the above is true, why would a 15A receptacle even have to be rated to 20A?</p>
","<p>A 15A outlet is rated for 15A, with a 20A pass through. That is to say that the 20A circuit is in continuance throughout the circuit, however the receptacle itself (the contacts) are rated for 15A continuosly. Any <strong><em>single</em></strong> appliance with a 15A plug will not normally draw more than 80% of 15A, or 12A. The total circuit draw (multiple appliances - same circuit) can be 20A before the breaker trips.</p>

<p>A 20A breaker used with 12awg wire can feed <strong><em>multiple</em></strong> 15A outlets, one example is the kitchen. The reasoning is so that today's demanding appliances, which draw more current, can be used with a 20A breaker without the worry of nuisance tripping. If more than a total of 20A were to be drawn from the circuit, the breaker will trip.</p>

<p>It should be noted that any circuit that is intended to be 20A must use a 20A recepticle.</p>

<p>If the appliance were using 15A, it will be safe with the 20A breaker ( @ 80% = 16A). If it were to short, it will trip the 20A breaker just as it would a 15A breaker. A 15A receptacle can take 20A for a short time with no problem. The receptacle is overrated, otherwise it would blow up upon a short. A short circuit in actuality can be hundreds of amps in a very short duration. The breaker and receptacle are rated as ""Time overcurrent"" meaning it can take a lot of current for extremely short durations, and will trip on lesser currents that occur for a longer time. </p>

<p>An example one can relate to (refer to chart): Joe plugs in two electric heaters in his family room. Everything works fine until 20-100 seconds later the breaker trips! Joe overloaded his 20A circuit, by drawing 40A! The breaker will allow this overload for a short time. If the overload were bigger, say 60A the breaker would trip faster from 10-35 seconds. If the trip was due to a direct short, the breaker will trip Immediately. Breakers actually have a ""Load characteristic curve"" that you can tell when it will trip in time vs current.

"If metal expands when heated, how does heating a bolt loosen it?","39059","","<p>If you're having trouble removing a stuck bolt, common advice is to heat the bolt up.  But if metal expands when heated, wouldn't heating up the bolt just make it harder to remove? How does heating the bolt get it unstuck?</p>
","<p>The answer is surprisingly simple: the bolt expands, but the nut expands <em>more</em>.</p>

<p>What is happening here is good old thermal expansion:</p>

<ul>
<li>The bolt is heated and expands outwards, its radius increasing</li>
<li>The nut is heated and... expands outwards, its radius increasing</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, since the nut's radius is <em>slightly</em> greater than the bolt's, and since the increase is proportional to the rest length, the nut expands a little more.</p>

<p>Iron has a thermal coefficient in the 10<sup>-5</sup> / K ballpark. It means that for each 1 K increase in temperature you have an increase in size of 10<sup>-5</sup>: a 1 m rod becomes 1.00001 m long.</p>

<p>If your bolt has r = 1.5 mm, and the nut has R = 1.501 mm, what happens is temperature is increased of 500 K? Well:</p>

<ul>
<li>r = 1.5*(1+500*10<sup>-5</sup>) mm = 1.5075 mm</li>
<li>R = 1.501*(1+500*10<sup>-5</sup>) mm = 1.508505 mm</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, before heating R - r = 1 μm, while after R - r ≈ 1.001 μm. It increased!</p>

<p>Please note my numbers are quite wild and used just to make an example. I am sure that I got the starting values wrong, but I hope they help to get the message across anyway.</p>

What's the reason to pick one over another?</p>

<p><strong>Follow up</strong>: I'm guessing this is related to OSB's tendency to expand on the edges when wet, possibly for the flashing and the plywood side of the firewall that would rest on top of this edge of the roof. Here are some links that I came across when doing a bit of research:</p>

<p><a href=""http://bct.eco.umass.edu/publications/by-title/choosing-between-oriented-strandboard-and-plywood/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Comparison from UMass</a></p>
","<p>Twofold theory:</p>

<p>Perhaps OSB is cheaper at the moment for this builder than ply and wants to use OSB as much as they can. OSB and Ply are apparently seen as the same in terms of performance and code see: <a href=""http://bct.eco.umass.edu/publications/by-title/choosing-between-oriented-strandboard-and-plywood/"">http://bct.eco.umass.edu/publications/by-title/choosing-between-oriented-strandboard-and-plywood/</a></p>

<p>However, OSB, when cut, is more susceptible to water damage on the cut (the cut exposed raw wood not covered in the bonding agent/glue). Once OSB edges get wet, it expands like a sponge...which would ruin the roof. </p>

<p>So, it looks like they might be using as much OSB as they can, but have to switch to ply whenever cutting. </p>

I know for a fact, having fixed the ""hot"" side of the wiring to the three-way switches before, that the switches (along with others in both boxes) are fed by different circuits. However, all of the white neutrals in each box are twisted together into one bundle and wire-nutted; this predates any work I did on the circuit, but I don't know if this is the work of the original electrician or the ""handyman"" whose work I've been fixing since I moved in. </p>

<p>As these joined neutrals include the travelers of both three-way circuits, the neutrals from the nearest light to each box, and the neutral heading back to the panel from each box, these two circuits' neutrals have multiple junction points that tie the neutrals together.</p>

<p>Is this dangerous (from a fire hazard perspective)? My Google-fu brought up some similar questions, but the answers were all along the lines of answers to the related question in the link: ""a shared neutral is bad"". However, this isn't a ""shared neutral"" as in one white wire carrying the load from two circuits; this is two white wires carrying the load from two circuits, but the two white wires are both carrying the load from either circuit.

And obviously there are no AFCI/GFCI breakers in the house (plenty of GFCI receptacles), because everything on both circuits works fine (they'd trip as soon as I turned a light on otherwise). The only concern AFAIK would be shock safety, as you'd basically have to make sure both of the breakers were off before working in either switch box (something I would do anyway; I wouldn't want ANYTHING hot in either box if I were messing with these switches, regardless of whether the neutrals are separate or not).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: picture == word*1000:</strong></p>

","<p>EDITED FOR CLARIFICATION:</p>

<p>If this is wired as you have drawn it, then it will not be a safety issue. The additional neutral will only share the current in both circuits. Because both circuits are fused for 15A, each neutral will only see a maximum of 15A. This is providing that both neutrals are solidly connected! If one were to become loose or disconnected then the other can potential see the full load, 15A*2=30A. </p>

<p>If anything else is fed from either of those breakers, it becomes a whole other issue! 
I recommend you wire it the right way. However to answer your question, I don't see it as a safety issue <strong><em>if</em></strong> that is the only circuit on those breakers.</p>

<p>With either breaker off, that circuit will be isolated from the energized circuit. The only common path between the two is the shared neutral. If the energized circuit were to draw the breaker maximum of 15A, the de-energized neutral potential would be at maximum only a few hundred millivolts, not posing a safety risk.</p>

<p>Also it is not against code to have more than one feed in a jbox or switch box.</p>

","<p>From your last picture, the water proof membrane goes between the tile and concrete in the shower.

","<p>The symptom of the gap you have in all my experience with recess lights have been the rough in housing has room for deflection. As you push the trim in place, the rough in pushes up also under the tension of the lens going in and it stays pushed up until the lens bottoms out on the ceiling and is released. The housing relaxes back down and creates the gap.</p>

<p>I have had some success minimizing the gap by twisting the trim slightly after the trim is meeting the ceiling. Twist it in the direction that keeps the tension fingers out on the lens. The wrong direction may allow the tension fingers to collapse for removal and you are back to square one.</p>

<p>If that does not work to your satisfaction, I have glued the rough in down to the drywall so it is stable enough to not rise when inserting the trim.</p>

<p>Blue tape the finished drywall to keep it clear of the adhesive you choose to use, it can be practically anything. Construction adhesive or painters caulk would be my choice. Push up on the rough in to expose the gap if possible of the upper drywall surface and rough in lip. Inject a lot of the tube in the space, it will be messy, have paper on the floor. Let the rough in back down, more may ooze out, keep it clean remove tape and let dry for a while. A day or two will work, longer the better, then try to reinstall.</p>

"How to move stacked washer/dryer from closet","38721","","<p>I'd like to replace the water hoses on my stacked washer/dryer set - the purchase records for the set show that they are 6 years old, and as far as I know the hoses have never been replaced.</p>

<p>They are in a narrow closet that's only about 8 - 10"" wider than the washer/dryer itself. If I took the folding door off, I think I could squeeze beside the set to reach the back and replace the hoses, but I still need to slide it out from the wall to gain access to the recessed hose box. It's in a small narrow bathroom, so there's not a whole lot of working space in the room itself.</p>

<p>Since I didn't see the installation of the units, I have no idea how to slide them away from the wall, I don't know if they joined the set outside the closet and slid them in as a unit, or if they stacked them inside the closet. </p>

<p>I see how I could pry up the front of the set to place it on a furniture slider or a very low dolly, but I don't see how to get the back to slide. The back of the set is only about 2"" from the wall, so I couldn't tip it back very far to slide anything beneath it.</p>

<p>The washer is a front loader, and the washer/dryer set weighs about 350 lbs.</p>

<p>Is there some sort of specialized dolly that can jack up the whole set to move it away from the wall? Is there some other trick to moving the set?</p>

<p>Even if I wanted to split the set and remove the dryer to lighten the load on the washer or to make it easier to reach the hose box, I'd still have to get behind the unit to disconnect the dryer gas line and power cord.</p>

"Is super insulating exterior walls with rigid foam board insulation possible?","38643","","<p>2"" rigid foam-board insulation can have an R-value of up to R-10, layering 4 boards would create a R-40 value, right? However that creates an 8"" foam wall above the actual wall. What would be a recommended way to attach all the boards to the exterior wall? Also how would you attach the  finishing wall surface to the foam?</p>

<p>Reason to use rigid foam board insulation, is that its cheap?</p>

<p>Cost to insulate 16 Square feet to an R-40 value, $70 USD  for rigid foam, $238 (not including installation) for closed cell spray foam. </p>

<p>I am thinking plywood base, vapor barrier, foam board base, screwed and glued down to base. Then can I glue??? the remaining insulation foam boards in place on top of one another?  Then lastly how about attaching the exterior weathering wall, maybe something like exterior cement fiberboard? Can that be glued to the insulation foam-board.</p>

","<p>Yes, Rigid foam (XPS and ISO) boards are frequently used in exterior applications, and can be a great option for improving efficiency. There are a couple of issues with your proposed approach, though:</p>

<ol>
<li>Vapor barrier location. The vapor barrier should be on the warm side (probably inside, unless you live in a very hot &amp; humid climate). Ideally, this is immediately behind your interior drywall. You also do not usually need an extra vapor barrier layer adjacent to rigid foam sheets, they are typically highly resistant to moisture.</li>
<li>Attachment. You cannot rely on glue to support foam and siding panels. These need to be mechanically fastened.</li>
</ol>

<p>On a wood frame house, you'd want to use this order:</p>

<ul>
<li>interior drywall</li>
<li><strong>possibly</strong> a vapor barrier (e.g. poly sheeting), though the wisdom of this is debatable (see the comment from iLikeDirt below)</li>
<li>wall studs (optionally with batt or cellulose insulation in between)</li>
<li>exterior sheathing</li>
<li>rigid foam</li>
<li>wooden strapping for attaching siding, screwed to studs through foam. This provides support for the siding and also allows air circulation behind the siding, so any moisture that gets behind the siding can dry out.</li>
<li>siding panels, nailed to strapping</li>

<p>Note that adding foam on the exterior of your house complicates some things. You will likely need to redo the trim on your windows and doors, which will become more in-set. These inset areas will need to be flashed properly or you will have leaks, which have more potential to do damage when you've got multi-layered, thick walls that could trap moisture. If done well, you can get very good insulation. But make sure to work with someone who knows what they're doing!</p>

Comes with sealant (caulk tubes) and fastening bolts (might be tricky to drive in small backsplash places)  To avoid flex, you want to use a thicker board.  It's pretty strong stuff (particularly for a kitchen backsplash, which shouldn't bear much (any?) weight or pressure.</p>

<p>I have also used the original <a href=""http://www.schluter.com/8_1_kerdi.aspx"">Kerdi membrane</a> (not the newer board you mention) for a shower.  I have a lot of confidence in the quality of the seal with the Kerdi membrane, but it's quite a bit of extra work if you haven't done it before, and is probably overkill for a backsplash (I assume the counter top runs below).</p>

<p>As for cost - my <em>personal</em> opinion is that small jobs are precisely the place to spend the extra money (assuming the quality is better for what you need).  If I had to do 100 bathrooms, the added cost of the these newer products would really add up.  If I'm doing 1 or 2, then the difference is relatively small.</p>

","<p>Sounds like the packing inside of the faucet needs to be replaced, assuming this is similar to an outdoor hose faucet.  After you shutoff the water (probably for the whole house if you don't have a separate shutoff for that line) you can open the valve up by unscrewing the nut that the valve stem goes through.  You can find new packing material at most home improvement stores that looks like a black string like material, typically right next to all the washers.  I'd also suggest replacing the washer at the same time.  And clean all the threads and apply fresh plumbers dope before screwing things back together.</p>

<p>If the installing plumber was nice, you can also unscrew the entire faucet from the pipe.  Then clean up the threads, put on some fresh pipe dope, and screw on a new faucet.  It will cost a few bucks more, but the process is much easier and the result is also nicer.  Unfortunately for me, my plumber decided to solder the threads making this task nearly impossible without opening up the wall to cut the pipes.</p>

<p>As @HillBilly.Developer pointed out, since the red and black wires are both hot it doesn't matter which one is connected to <em>X</em> or <em>Y</em>. Each hot wire will have an electric potential of 120V to neutral/ground, and 240V potential to each other. This is because in US residential wiring, the house is fed from a transformer with a center tapped secondary.

<p>Because of this, any device in the house can be powered using either 120V, 240V or both. To supply 240V to a device, a hot wire from each leg of the system must be present at the outlet. </p>

<p>In our situation one leg of the system is the black wire (L1), and the other is the red wire (L2). So either way you hook them up, you'll always have 120V potential L1 to N and L2 to N and 240V potential L1 to L2.</p>

But if I wanted to take some action next summer/early fall to prevent mice from entering, what could I do?</p>
","<p>This is probably a futile exercise. Mice can squeeze through the smallest of gaps so you'd have to virtually hermetically seal your house to prevent any mouse coming in. Obviously you can block up the largest/most obvious holes and make it generally more difficult.</p>

<p>Make sure that you keep all food sealed in plastic containers etc. so that your house is not a source of food for them. They might still get in, but only for warmth.</p>

"How do I frame a room inside a garage so that the room's ceiling will not touch the garage ceiling?","38010","","<p>I am considering building a small 6 x 9 room inside my garage to use as an office. However, I do not want to remove the garage door opener unit nor the tracks the door slides on because we will want to continue using that door for access to the garage. </p>

<p>I have seen a few resources with guides for framing but all show the top plate of the room being secured to an existing ceiling. In my case I want the ceiling to be independent.</p>

<p>Also, the height from the floor to the garage door slider tracks is 8 feet. With some play I am thinking I will be OK with a 7 foot ceiling but I am not too thrilled with a ceiling that low. Any creative recommendations for dealing with garage door sliders?</p>
","<p>You are essentially building a self-supporting flat-roofed shed inside the garage, not adding interior walls to the garage.</p>

<p>You should be able to screw a 2x4 sill plate onto the garage floor. The sill plate is mostly there in case the concrete is uneven. It could be pressure-treated in order to resist rotting from moisture on the floor or in the concrete. (In that case, use galvanized nails to nail the sole plate to it.) If you don't build a floor, I think the sole plate of the walls could be screwed directly into the floor, avoiding the sill.</p>

<p>Since you're in a cold climate, you may want to build and insulate a floor. If so, place the rim joists, then hang the remaining joists with joist hangers, insulate, then glue and nail on plywood sheathing. If the joists go in the short direction and are spaced 16"" o.c. you should in theory be OK with 2x4 joists, but the code may require 2x6 as a minimum, and that would leave more space for insulation.</p>

<p>Next, frame the walls individually, sheathe them with plywood or OSB, and raise them. If you have a sill or subfloor, face-nail the sole plate to the floor with 16d nails 16"" o.c. Sheathing the walls adds lateral support, and thereby helps keep them square. This is a lot easier to do while the walls are still flat on the floor, before you raise them. Make sure to double the top plate. </p>

<p>Finally, frame an ""attic subfloor"" as a ceiling for your office. In response to your question, the ceiling is <em>somewhat</em> similar to a wall, but the joists must be hung properly (not just end-nailed like the studs in a wall), and the sheathing (plywood or OSB) needs to be glued as well as nailed. Sheathing this subfloor is essential for stability. As mentioned, if spaced 16"" o.c., 2x4 is sufficient to span 6 ft, but your code may require 2x6 anyway.</p>

<p>Check out the framing books at the home improvement or bookstore, or google for ""framed floor"" and ""platform framing"". Check your building code for insulation requirements. You will probably need a building permit.</p>

<p>The ceiling height may be an issue, once you subtract 6 inches for a floor and 6 inches for a ceiling.</p>

"What should I do with the extra grounding wire in my ceiling fan box?","37977","","<p>I am installing a Hampton Bay Ceiling Fan that has a transmitter install for the remote.  I have a green ground and a bare copper ground coming from my ceiling box.  I have a green ground coming from the ceiling fan motor.

I understand that, however, I am not sure what to do with the copper ground wire out of my ceiling box.  Can I curve the top and attach it to the ground screw on the fan mounting bracket? Do I connect it with the other two green ground wires and make it a party of three?  The rest of the instructions are self explanatory but I want to make this install safe.  Need to make sure I have done the right thing with the grounding wires. The fans are fine if I only want the fan motion, however, using this transmitter with the remote would also provide a light option. </p>
","<p>The bare copper wire and any green insulated wires are meant to be connected together, making it a ""party of three"" as you stated in your question.

"Is there an ideal height for a workbench?","37951","","<p>Is there a universal standard height that people try to go for when building workbenches? Should DIY tabletops be tailor made to the height of the user and how does the ideal height of the tabletop correlate to the person?</p>
","<p>There is a large body of information about what size furniture and tools should be. The field concerning sizing furniture to individuals and populations is called Anthropometrics  and information about safety and ease of use is called Ergonomics.</p>

<p>If you are building your own workbench for your own use, then you should size it to yourself unless you expect others to use it. Why buy off the rack if you can get tailored for less?</p>

<p>Most furniture is optimized for the middle of the height distribution curve which is roughly 5'8"". I got into woodworking in the first place because I am 6'4"" tall and absolutely nothing fits. It's all literally 6"" too short. </p>

<p>I used the ""fall drop"" rule to size my generic workshop surfaces. Just stand relaxed and let your hands fall down as if resting comfortably on a surface in front of you. It's the position you hands will just fall or drop to if you try to rest them on an imaginary surface. It gives a higher bench than the using the wrist line method above. </p>

<p>I suggest creating a mock-up first using whatever is available and easily resized. I used a chair, a sturdy box and books of various thicknesses. I swapped books and fiddled with the height of the mock-up until I found the most comfortable height. In my case, it was exactly 39"".      </p>

<p>You'll know it when you find your own ideal height because it just feels right.     </p>

<p>However, shuffler is correct that different work requires different heights. The ""fall drop"" rule sizes a bench for use with modern power tools and precision hand tools but if you use other tools you might want a higher or lower bench e.g. heavy handsaws, chisels and planes usually require something like saw bench which is usually just under knee height.     </p>

<p>I use a mini-bench on top of my main 39"" surface if I have fiddling work like soldering.    </p>

<p>I've hung a new door with new hinges and am about to paint. Most of the doors I see have painted hinges but is this just because someone hasn't gone to the effort of removing the door  to paint it or because it's considered better?</p>
","<p>Painting hinges is not a question of being better or worse. Depending on the motif, hinge finishes are often selected to complement the door or trim color.  For example: brass metal finish often used with tan trim/doors or natural wood finishes.  Chrome or brushed nickel hardware is popular with white trim/doors.  Hinges and passage sets come in a lot of different metal and colored finishes.</p>

<p>If you do decide to paint the hinges, resist the temptation to simply paint them in place. It is difficult to evenly paint all the surfaces of a hinge and not fill the slots of the screws. When painted in place, the paint will often chip if it dries and bridges the joints of the hinge. It tends to chip when you first open/close the door. I really try to avoid painting hinges, but when I paint new, previously unpainted hinges, I remove them, clean them well, spray paint them, screws included.   </p>

","<p>Yes, you might want the highest precision possible - for example when you build furniture which benefits greatly from precise cuts.

Since it is my only source of light in the room and it is 2015, I bought a 13W / 75W equivalent LED bulb to go in it, the highest I could find at the local hardware store. No problem, right?

<p>15W WW827 Tornado Philips, equiv 85W or 950 lumen</p>

<p>Why the 2x power difference and 6x luminosity difference? </p>
","<p>There are a couple terms involved that all have specific meanings:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Watts</strong>: the amount of electricity used by the bulb (a.k.a. ""power"")</li>
<li><strong>Lumens</strong>: the amount of visible light the bulb produces (a.k.a. ""luminosity"")</li>
<li><strong>Equivalent watts</strong>: an approximate incandescent bulb wattage that outputs a similar amount of light.</li>
<li><strong>Luminous efficiency</strong>: the amount of light put out by the bulb per watt. Higher means better efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's not a direct relationship between watts and lumens, but you can look at the luminous efficiency to compare bulbs. Wikipedia lists values for common household bulb types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Incandescent bulb: 12-18 lumens / watt</li>
<li>Halogen incandescent: 24 lumens / watt</li>
<li>Compact fluorescent: 45-75 lumens / watt</li>
<li>LED: 60-100+ lumens / watt</li>
</ul>

<p>The LED you list has an efficiency of 28 lumens / watt, which is pretty poor for an LED. LEDs have been increasing in their efficiency; maybe it's an older model? Your CFL is 63 lumens / watt, which is pretty good for a CFL.</p>

<p>Compare those to the current gold standard for mass-market LED bulbs, <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B007RKVT4C"" rel=""nofollow"">Philips' L-prize LED</a>, which puts out 940 lumens using 10 watts, or 94 lumens / watt.</p>

<p>You're also seeing the problem with ""equivalent watts"", which is kind of an unhelpful metric. I don't know if there's any regulation on what manufacturers can claim as the incandescent equivalent, but I've seen bulbs as low as 700 lumens and as high as 950 lumens all claim to be ""60 watt equivalent"". Even among incandescents there's a range of light output for a specific wattage. The most reliable way to look at brightness is the ""lumens"" rating. If you're trying to match the brightness of an existing bulb, try to look it up online to find the lumens.</p>

<p>My concern with the cast iron (other than lugging it up the stairs) is the rust problem.</p>

<p>How well does acrylic hold up?</p>
","<p>Cast iron tubs are very heavy and expensive.  Rust is not a problem with cast iron tubs as long as the enamel top layer is intact (if you get a chip in it, you can get enamel repair kits).  My wife did not like the old cast iron tub in our bathroom because it was cold when standing in it during a shower and made bath water get cold fast.  Evidently she was not taking baths in the “cast iron method” which is to put super-hot water into the bathtub and allow the heat to transfer into the tub, this will cool the water down but keep it at a reasonable temperature longer (in theory at least, YMMV).</p>

<p>Enameled steel it basically a cheaper version of the cast iron, it is a lighter because the metal is much thinner. I doubt the “hot bath trick” described above for cast iron tubs will work in a steel tub.  Like cast iron tubs, you should not have to worry about a steel tub rusting or cracking.</p>

<p>Acrylic (plastic) tubs come in a different quality levels.  Some are really cheap, thin plastic that have the potential to crack over time (particularly if they are poorly supported/improperly installed).  However some acrylic tubs use thicker stronger plastic (often with fiber glass embedded for tensile strength) that are very sturdy.</p>

<p>Also because I'm a big user of the SE network, I figured where better to help find an answer to my question. My goal, <strong><em>do it right the first time</em></strong>.</p>
","<p>I just completed a 90 square foot patio.  I ended up putting down 4 inches of paver base (crushed concrete), 1 inch of sand, and then the 2 inch patio stones... so I dug down 7 inches all around.  To be honest though, I went deeper than that in some places and ended up having to bring in much more paver base (crushed concrete) than I really needed.  So maybe I have 6 inches of paver base in some areas.  In my opinion, the key was the compacting.  I highly recommend you rent a plate compactor.  You should be able to rent one for less than $100 for 4 hours and it is completely worth it.  You will only use it for 30 minutes but it will make the crushed concrete as solid as rock.</p>

<p>Also one of my neighbors who is a landscaper joked about how far I had dug down... he said I went way too deep and now I can land a helicopter on my new patio.  I tend to agree with him that the 4+ inches of paver base was more than needed but still I am happy with how it all turned out.</p>

<p>Couple other notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>After compacting the crushed concrete it was smooth and solid.  When you walked on it nothing moved... kind of like walking on concrete.</li>
<li>Lowes/Home Depot sell paver base by the bag but that is much more expensive than having it delivered.  2 tons (approximately 1 cubic yard) of crushed concrete was not enough to cover my 90 square feet to a depth of 4 inches; I probably ended up putting down 3 tons.</li>
<li>Since the patio was positioned next to a concrete sidewalk, I used an 8' 2x4 with a piece of scrap wood nailed to one end which gave me a depth of 3 inches (the sand and paver depth).  Then I pulled the 2x4 back and forth across the area (with another person holding one end on the sidewalk) to level out the paver base before compacting (and to know where the shallow/deep spots were).</li>
<li>I used 1 inch diameter pipes to give me the 1-inch depth for the leveling sand.  Put two pipes down on the compacted paver base parallel to each other and then pour the sand on top.  Then pull a 2x4 over the pipes to level the sand.  Remove the pipes and then fill in the indentation by hand.  Now lay your pavers (or patio stones).</li>
<li>I used polymeric sand to fill the cracks in between the individual patio stones.</li>

"How does low freon cause the compressor suction line to freeze up","37457","","<p>There are many questions about air conditioner issues with the most common being that it isn't cooling properly.  Among the typical answers are low Freon and the standard diagnosis for low Freon is ice on the large copper pipe at the outside compressor.</p>

<p>From my understanding the small copper tube is the high pressure side with Freon that has been compressed to a liquid.  When this liquid is allowed to boil in the inside evaporator things cool down.</p>

<p>Conversely the large copper pipe is the return line from the evaporator sometimes referred to as the suction line or low pressure side.</p>

<p>So my question is: under low Freon conditions how can the suction line freeze up?</p>

<p>Intuitively I would thing with low Freon the entire cooling ability would be below normal causing the evaporator to not produce as much cold air.  A side effect of all this, I would expect the suction line to be warmer that normal.</p>

<p>Why does the suction line freeze up under low Freon conditions?</p>

<p>See the image in this question for a great diagram of an HVAC system:

<p>In a normally functioning system, the refrigerant is sent into the evaporator at about 55-65 psi. Which means that the boiling point will be above the freezing temperature of water. The refrigerant absorbs heat from the air passing through the evaporator, boils, and flows on down the line at a temperature above the freezing point of water.  The refrigerant will likely be below the dew point, however, so there will be condensation on the line.</p>

<p>If the pressure in the system drops, the R22 might be entering the evaporator a bit lower than the typical pressure. In this case, the boiling point of the R22 will be below the freezing temperature of water. As the warm moist air moves over the evaporator, the moisture condenses and freezes on the coils. Ice will start to form at the beginning of the evaporator coils, and slowly creep along its length. </p>

<p>The ice will act as an insulator, so the refrigerant in the line will not be able to absorb the heat it needs to boil. This causes the refrigerant to boil off further along in the evaporator, which forms more ice further down the line.  This process continues all the way along the line, until the entire evaporator and suction line are covered in ice. </p>

<p>Once the refrigerant levels get too low, there's not enough refrigerant in the system to freeze the line. So eventually if the system has a leak, this behavior will stop and you'll simply get no cooling at all from the system.</p>

"What should I do with leftover sulfuric acid from a sump pump battery backup?","37391","","<p>In our new house, we found that a previous owner installed a sump pump battery backup unit, which is nice. The battery in the system is like a car battery, but it's the kind where you initially add sulfuric acid to, and then periodically top off with distilled water.</p>

<p>However, the owner left behind the container of leftover sulfuric acid. The manual for the battery system says to <em>never</em> add more acid to the battery, only water.</p>

<p><strong>So, what should I do with this acid?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Is it dangerous to keep in the basement? Will it emit bad vapor?</li>
<li>Can I keep it in case I need more if I buy a new battery in 5 years?</li>
<li>Should I dispose of it? How?</li>
</ul>
","<p>I'm going to second <em>mikes</em> advice about wearing rubber gloves and safety glasses, especially if you can't guarantee that the container is properly sealed. If you get any on you, simply flush with lots of water, and apply a paste of baking soda and water to neutralize (I would flush first while someone else mixes the paste). For transport, just make sure that you have something that will keep it from tipping over.</p>

<p>OK, now to the reason I answered: places that you can take it.</p>

<p>The easiest is if your town or city sponsors a hazardous waste day or provides a hazardous waste dropoff (more likely in a large city). Call first to ensure that they take acids. Most will, especially acids that are commonly used in home improvement, such as sulfuric and hydrochloric (aka muriatic).</p>

<p>If you have a relationship with a repair shop, you can call and see if they'll take it (for use with batteries). They probably won't, and a stranger definitely won't, but it's worth asking.</p>

<p>A metal plating shop is another possibility. They probably won't accept it for use, but might dump it into their waste drum for a nominal charge.</p>

<p>Finally, if <em>mikes</em> scared you, there's <a href=""http://www.cleanharbors.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Clean Harbors</a> or similar companies. They'll come to your house and scare you even more, and you'll pay through the nose. But it will be gone.</p>

"What could be causing a leaky p trap under my bathroom sink?","37297","","<p>Recently, the bottom of our bathroom sink has started to leak just slightly. Little drips come out of the nuts. The leaking part seems to be more toward the end where the pipe meets the wall and the end of the curve where the p trap ends.</p>

<p>What are some common issues with a leaking p trap under the sink? </p>
","<p>If it is a PVC compression fitting, put a bucket under the p-trap and take the trap off.</p>

<p>Odds are good that you will find one of two things.  Either the threads were cross threaded, which will affect the pressure seal around the pipe, or the plastic o-ring was caught in the threads at one point in time and was mangled.  A mangled o-ring won't provide a satisfactory seal.</p>

<p>Either way you will know which part to replace, and these connections (provided it is compression fitting PVC) can be replaced easily at your local hardware store.</p>

<p>If it seems that everything is fine, look for the following items:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is the pipe being unnaturally flexed or bent due to particular pipes being too long or short?  If so the solution is shorter / longer pipes, but make sure you don't dramatically change the geometry of your setup.</p></li>
<li><p>Are the locking nuts really tightened appropriately?  Sometimes a good ""extra twist"" solves a leak in the best possible way.  Remember, if you ""break"" an obviously replaceable section of pipe, you're out a few dollars in plastic, so don't be shy.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The joint between the end of the p-trap and the pipe from the wall is supposed to be constantly under water, so it is fairly common for those to leak.  Normally they are fitted and tested for leaks.  The workman will not leave with one leaking.  Since it is under the sink, and people often store items under their sink, eventually the pipe gets bumped.  That's probably the source of your new dripping; however, it is highly unlikely that anyone will remember bumping the pipe, even if they did it.</p>

"Why am I finding condensation in my dryer?","37293","","<p>I live in Houston, TX (Very Hot, Very Humid).  In the summertime, my dryer is dripping with water, when not in use.  I do not have overly excessive drying times.</p>

<p>My dryer is vented via an unfortunate run of over 25 feet with two elbows.  It exhausts through the roof.  Dryer is in the center of the first floor, so the vent goes up to the second floor, runs through the ceiling/floor, comes out in an attic and through the roof.  The attic is unfinished, with temps well over 120F on an average summer day in Houston.</p>

<p>My guess is that I have hot moist air pouring down my dryer duct, hitting my nice cool air conditioned dryer and condensating.</p>

<p>Initial google searches have pointed me at the Fantech DBF110 which is a booster fan that you install on your duct run.  I'm not certain this is going to solve my problem, as it doesn't run constantly, only when the dryer is running.</p>

<p>Would I get more bang for my buck by insulating the duct and trying to seal it up?  Any recommendations on materials if that's the case (thermal blanket, just wrap fiberglass, other)?</p>

<hr>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>As Eric suspected, I didn't have a working flap on my dryer vent.  So I bought one and gave it a test run and I wasn't happy with how little the flap opened from the pressure on the dryer.  So, I installed the booster fan as suggested by Doresoom as well.  We had a few hot humid days after that, dryer stayed dry.  My clothes drying times are pretty low too, 30-45 mins.</p>

<p>Fan pic is before I cleaned up the electrical, looks a little neater now.  The ideal install for that fan is with the bracket on a stud, unfortunately there was no good way to attach a stud and avoid cutting a new hole in the roof.  Luckily the fan is pretty light.</p>
","<p>Usually a dryer vent will have a spring loaded flap where it exits the house to prevent outside air (and bugs, rodents, etc) from coming in through the pipe.  If you are getting airflow from outside through your vent pipe, it sounds like either you don't have one or it isn't closing.  I would check that first.</p>

"How can I replace a single switch with two switches?","37017","","<p>I have a single pole switch on a wall that turned on a ceiling light. I want to replace this ceiling lamp with a fan/light combo.

<p>Here is what I see when I open up the switch box with the single pole switch: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CXrZ5.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>How I do wire the above switch?</p>
","<p>I am assuming that the upper wire is the cable that goes to the ceiling where the fan/light is to be installed. If so, you should have a red wire in the ceiling box that is unused and probably capped with a wire nut.</p>

<p>Your description of the switch box seems a little off.  If all three black wires were connected together, what wires go to the switch?</p>

<p>More than likely, one of the lower black wires is the hot source, and it is connected to the other lower black to power another box, and is also connected to the existing switch.  The upper black was probably also connected to the switch asn was hot when the switch is on and not hot (open) when the switch is off.  The whites are all neutrals and all should be connected to each other (and not to the switch).</p>

<p>You can install a double switch or two separate switches in the box to separately control the fan and light.  The lower hot black goes to the common on a double switch or one pole on each of the two switches. The upper black goes to the other side of the first switch and the upper red goes to the other side of the second switch.  Effectively, these switches share an ""in"" but have separate ""outs"".</p>

<p>In the switch box, all of the whites (neutrals) continue to be connected.</p>

<p>At the ceiling box, the white goes to white, the black goes to the wire for either fan or light, and the red goes to the other. The fan wire colors may vary, but the instructions should indicate which is which.</p>

<p>You make no mention of green or bare wire (ground). In a modern, properly wired system, there also should be these, both from each cable and at the fan. Ground wires are connected together and to the base of devices, switches and metal boxes or fixtures. If they are present, connect them.  If they are not, you have an ungrounded system that poses a bit of risk if a device is damaged or shorts out.</p>

<p>My only experience with an airless sprayer was a $40-ish dollar hand-held one that I bought for doing a fence. It worked...but not really all that well. It sputtered and splattered more than it sprayed and we had to go over it all with a brush as we went to get an even coverage. </p>

<p>Granted, that was $40, so hoping the $300 airless systems are a bit better.</p>

<p>My question: What is the primary difference between the performance and usability of an air spray gun vs. the airless ones? What should I be looking for in an airless sprayer in terms of features? </p>
","<p>First off, I'm no expert on compressor/air type sprayers. Most of the time, these type sprayers are used for very thin paints such as automotive, lacquers etc. They also have fairly small paint reservoirs attached to the gun itself. They tend to put out a lot of over spray and should be used in a controlled area like a spray booth with proper ventilation. I never see this type of sprayer on building jobs.</p>

<p>The airless sprayer, such as the one you noted, use a high pressure pump to push paint through the hose to the gun. They deliver a good pattern (depending on tip selected), are easily controlled and since they don't mix air with the product, have far less atomazation of paint in the air. the other huge advantage is that the pick-up hose can be put directly into your 1 or 5 gallon can of paint. Follow the directions on priming and cleaning, but it is easy.  I personally have a Graco model 17 and love it.  It is a professional grade sprayer and retails around $450-$500. Just two weeks ago, I and a helper painted and back-rolled a complete two story house and detached garage in one day.(very long day, however!) This saved 3 or 4 extra days of labor and the results were fantastic. We shot both semi-trans stain on the house and matching color solid stain on the garage.  This sprayer handled both products easily. (I always use apx 10 to 15% flowtrol with thicker solid latex based products)</p>

<p>The only disadvantage of this type of sprayer is on very small jobs. It takes about a pint or more of paint to fill a 25 foot hose and closer to 1/2 gallon for a 50 ft hose when priming the unit. This amount product is usually wasted at the end of the job when you get ready to clean the pump.</p>

<p>From the type of jobs you plan to do, I would recommend the airless sprayer hands down.</p>

<p>3/4 plywood - I know that - and later we could do a dormer if we feel we need it.</p>

<p>Also, any links to how to finish the attic? It's just rafters, plywood and the actual roof up there. Can I insulate the actual rafters and drywall over or should I use that foam channel to allow air to pass through from the soffits that I've seen.</p>
","<p>The 2X4's you are looking at are <strong>collar ties</strong> attached to the end of the rafters and span wall to wall.  They are really only strong enough to support ceiling materials, not a live load. The new floor joists will need to rest on the upper wall plate (load bearing) adjacent to a rafter, and cross supported. </p>

<p>The items you need to determine are <strong>span</strong>, joist <strong>spacing</strong> and <strong>material</strong> to be used as floor joists.  This link shows a chart in feet and inches for you application: <a href=""http://www.the-house-plans-guide.com/joist-span-tables.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.the-house-plans-guide.com/joist-span-tables.html</a>. Even on short spans, I would never go any smaller than 2X8's to assure a flex free floor.</p>

<p>The second issue you will face is <strong>insulating the roof</strong>.  The size of your rafters are going to dictate how much insulation you can install. If they are less that say, 2X10, you will not be able to get a good R-value. You may have to consider maxing out the cavities with blanket insulation, then also adding some 2 inch rigid foam sheets over the entire field to increase the total R value. You could then install strapping (purlins), with long screws, to mount drywall to. In this kind of roof design, there would be no venting required. This is a very common type of construction on cathedral type ceilings.  Good luck.</p>

"Can rock salt be used for sewer maintenance?","36311","","<p>I have read that flushing a glass full of rock salt down your toilet every month is good practice if you have a cast iron sewer line. Reason being is that the salt will kill off any tree roots in the pipe and also prevent more roots from coming in and causing blockage.

<p>Though honestly, I've never heard of this approach until now. I'm no expert on the corrosiveness of salt, but I would imagine the levels of salt in the sewer would not be high enough to rust the pipe. I'm also skeptical that the salt levels would be high enough to completely kill and prevent the roots. While I wouldn't recommend pouring a bag for rock salt down the drain, a handful once or twice a month will probably not hurt the pipe.</p>

<p>There are other tried and true methods to remove roots from sewer lines.</p>

<h1>Mechanincal</h1>

<h2>Augers</h2>

<p>Augers can be used to effectively remove roots from a sewer line, by cutting the roots out. This is not likely a solution for a DIYer, since it involves expensive specialty tools.  This method will not prevent roots from growing back into the sewer. </p>

<h2>Hydrojetters</h2>

<p>A hydrojetter is essentially a power washer with a rotating mechanical ""sweeper"", that is designed to be fed into the sewer line and blast and sweep roots away. Again, this is not likely a DIY option and does not prevent the roots from regrowing.</p>

<h2>Digging</h2>

<p>In some cases roots may have caused too much damage to the sewer line, and the only option available is to dig the line up and replace it. This can be very expensive, and will almost certainly not be a DIY project. </p>

<h1>Chemical</h1>

<h2>Contact Herbicides</h2>

<p>Contact herbicides are chemicals that will kill the roots, and in some cases prevent them from regrowing.  These are typically a more DIY friendly option, and can be found as simple ""pour down"" solutions.  </p>

<p>Contact herbicides can include:</p>

<p>A common product recommended by plumbers is <a href=""http://www.rootx.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RootX</a>. This is a herbicide in a foaming carrying agent, that allows the herbicide to reach roots at the top of the pipe.  RootX uses Dichlobenil, and is non-caustic, non-fumigating, and non-systemic. Unfortunately, it's not readily available to homeowners, so you'll likely have to contact a plumber for this treatment.</p>

<p>Searching around, I stumbled upon a product similar to RootX that is available to homeowners. <a href=""http://www.roebic.com/catalog/root.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Roebic® Foaming Root Killer</a> is available at <a href=""http://www.lowes.com/pd_93164-331-FRK+FOAMING+ROOT+KIL_0__?productId=3228283&amp;Ntt=roebic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lowes</a> for about $20.00. It foams up, and uses dichlobenil as the herbicide just like RootX.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to prevent roots from entering your sewer line, is to carefully plan where you plant trees and other deep rooting plants. </p>

","<p>The cost of prefinished wall paneling can vary wildly. Cheap 3/16 inch fake wood or patterned panels can cost around $10 per panel. A decent real wood veneer can soar to $40 each. </p>

<p>It is common practice to put paneling over drywall. Two main reasons for that are fire rating and ability to spread adhesive evenly so panels don't bulge between studs. There is no real R-value advantage. If anything, if paneling is not installed over drywall, the seams can be a source of air infiltration, negating any insulation value.</p>

<p>As a comparison, my drywall subcontractor charges me an average of $45 per sheet for 12 X 4 foot 1/2 inch rock, hung, taped, mudded, and sanded paint ready. This is really competitive with  decent quality paneling, especially if you figure in a drywall untaped backer. If you do decide to go with prefinished panels, be sure you really like it, because you're gonna be looking at it for a long time! LOL</p>

"Do I need to remove existing drywall before framing an interior wall?","36076","","<p>Below is a rough diagram of the interior wall I'd like to build.  The wall is in green, and the rooms are in white.  The grey offset around the edges of the walls represents 3/8"" drywall.</p>

<p>My question is simple - do I need to remove the drywall where the interior wall will meet the existing framing, or can I just drive framing nails straight through it to pick up the stud on the other side?</p>

<p>What about the top plate?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zQWDM.png"" alt=""Proposed interior wall in green showing divide between two rooms in white; sheetrock layer of existing walls in grey.""></p>
","<p>Why?</p>

<p>You are going to have to seal and finish the edges where the new wall meets the existing walls and ceiling. To do that, you are going to compromise the area of the existing drywall. Why not trim out a channel in the existing drywall the width of your new studs so that you can get good, tight <strong>firm</strong> attachment points.</p>

<p>The problem with butting framing up against drywall is that drywall is not very solid. Flexing of the framing can tend to crush and crumble the drywall between the new framing and the old. While this is not a load bearing wall, you do want it solid and stable, especially if you are going to hang any shelving or other moderate loads. Also, if you remove a strip of the old drywall, you can make sure you are attaching the new framing solidly into the old and not driving to close to the edge of a stud.</p>

<p>While you <strong>might</strong> get away with it, there is little reason to do it. If you insist on going that way, I suggest you use construction grade screws rather than nails. If you use nails, the very process of nailing may increase the likelihood of crushing the drywall underneath and creating a looser joint.</p>

Of course I realize that the 1x6 boards wont support the same amount of weight as the original boards, but I think the 2x6's might have been a bit overkill anyway.  Besides price, is there anything else I should be basing my decision on? </p>
","<p>1X stock is fine if you have 16 inch on center joists, and the joists are themselves sized properly. Using 2X stock over undersized joists does help make the deck feel more solid. If you have 24 OC joists, I'd definitely stay with the 2X decking. An other option if you have wider joist spacing is to add a joist between each one if possible,  then you can use 1X wood or even better, composite decking that will last a very long time, low maintenance and you can have your choice of colors and not have to worry about staining etc. </p>

<p>My question is this: since adding the L-brackets will mean screws, do I need to pre-drill holes into the wood to avoid splitting the particle board? Is there a way to prep these holes without a hand-held power drill? Can I drill the L-brackets in without pre-drilling at all but with great care?</p>
","<p>To answer your question: it depends.  The larger the screw, the more likely you'll need to pre-drill.  If you're installing the screw near the edge, or if the screw is larger than maybe 1/8"" wide on the solid part, then I'd pre-drill.  To pre-drill, make the hole almost as large as the solid part of the screw (not the threads themselves, they need to have something to bite into).  Also, make the hole as deep as the screw minus the size of the bracket.  Use some tape on the drill bit to see when to stop.</p>

<p>That said, for your bed, looking at the plans, I think you'll get the most added stability by adding a short piece of 2x2 vertically as a center brace under the metal bar.  Check the hardware isle of your HI store to see if you can find an adjustable foot to put on this board, and then attach it via a few screws to the center beam.  This is actually a quick way to detect some lower quality beds that use wooden slats from side to side.  If the slats have a center brace going to the floor, it's a lower quality bed.</p>

<p>Edit: For clarity, just imagine a table with a 5th leg right in the middle.  You have a long span from the headboard to the foot of the bed which will benefit from an extra support directly in the middle.  The adjustable legs I'm thinking of screw into the wood leg of a piece of furniture and look something like this (this is a cutaway view, you simply install it into a hole you drill into the bottom of the leg):</p>

<p>I'm thinking maybe because it's a kitchen and the repaired area is near sink-- that it might make sense to prime.</p>
","<p>My dad and his dad were both professional union painters.  They taught me that for small spots of spackle on the wall, all you have to do is put a quick layer of regular paint over them with a brush while you're doing your cutting-in brushwork.  The spot over the spackle will be mostly dry when you go back over it with the roller later.  I know from personal experience that this works.  Also, there's no reason to prime if you're repainting a similar color.</p>

<p>I also know from personal experience that if you don't pre-paint your spackle as I described, you will be able to see it after the paint job is done.  The color may hide it just fine, but where the rest of your wall is covered with a slight texture from the roller, the spot that was spackled will be smooth.  It stands out like a sore thumb.  Hitting the spackled spot with your brush while cutting in and then rolling back over it later is all that is needed to fix that problem.  </p>

"How should I build the concrete footings for my deck?","35765","","<p>I plan on making a small deck and I live in Howard County Maryland.  The deck code here says that the concrete footing must be 30 in below ground level and have a thickness of at least 8 inches (i.e. to 22 inches below ground level).  This which means the wood post is in the ground. This is also how all the contractors I have talked to would do it. (<a href=""http://www.howardcountymd.gov/workarea//downloadasset.aspx?id=6442458972"" rel=""nofollow"">Deck guide for my county (PDF)</a>)</p>

<p>The books on deck building I have only suggest having the concrete footing extend above ground level by a little bit (I think this is called a tube footing).  This method has the post not touching the dirt.</p>

<p>Is the second method better?  Do I need to worry about the post rotting with the first method?  I am assuming that I should be able to do it the second way because that exceeds the minimum requirement here.  Is there anything better about the first method?  Should I consider a different type of footing than these two? My deck with have about 3 posts and footings and will also attach to a ledger on the house.</p>
","<p>Burying the wood post will cause it to rot prematurely. Even ground-contact rated Pressure Treated lumber won't last forever.</p>

<p>The only benefit of burying the post (besides it being easier to do) is lateral stability. i.e. you can sometimes neglect lateral bracing this way.</p>

<p>Best practice for wood-post decks is to have the concrete extend above grade and use a stand-off post anchor to hold the wood post to concrete.</p>

<p>Here is an example of this with some knee-braces for lateral bracing.

"Is there a more rugged finish than Polyurethane for a heavy use table?","35754","","<p>A few years go I sanded a stained table we had. Upon doing so, we discovered that it had really nice wood underneath. So instead of restaining, I applied about 4 coats of satin polyurethane. It looked nice.</p>

<p>Since that time, a few small spots have formed...typically from a wet spot when a coaster wasn't used. More recently, someone (<em>cough</em> kids! <em>cough</em>) managed to spill something on it and not tell anyone for about a day. As such, there's now a large spot down the middle where the liquid leached through the finish and raised the grain and flaked off the poly. </p>

<p>My initial thought is to get the sander out, sand the whole thing down again, and re-apply a poly finish. But is there anything else I should consider as an alternate DIY finish that can maybe stand up to daily use as a dining/homework/junk table in the center of our house full of kids? Or should I just live with the fact that it'd going to take a beating and that maybe I just need to re-apply a new coat of poly every now and again? If the latter, is there a benefit to add more coats that 4? Do I double the durability with 8, for example? </p>
","<p>For starters, I am going to guess you used a water based urethane instead of an oil based product? I have never seen a good oil based product react as you described to simple spills. I have seen some damage caused by very hot items being placed on a urethane finish, but normally, liquids will bead up and not penetrate the finish. Even though the water based urethanes are easier to work with, it take two to three coats to give the same protection as one coat of oil based urethane. </p>

<p>More directly to your question, the hardest finishes you could use as a DIYer would be a good oil urethane or lacquer. Lacquer finishes are common on high end manufactured pieces, but really need to be sprayed on, several coats to make a good protective finish. The end result of a lacquer finish is much like the finish on a car, very hard and durable.  I have built many bars for folks and used 3 to 10 coats of oil based urethane with great results. I have never had a complaint similar to the problem you are experiencing. If I were going to fix your table, i'd probably start from scratch.  Sand it down again, fix any color flaws then apply 4 to 6 thin coats of oil urethane, sanding with 220 or 440 between coats. I personally prefer using a 4 or 6 inch good quality foam brush instead of a bristle brush. Use thin coats, resist the temptation to put on too much at a time. Each coat applied and finished with long complete strokes across the entire table. Be sure to allow proper recoat time as prescribed by the manufacturer. Don't rush it! Not allowing proper dry time will create a ""softer"" finish as undercoats will not have gassed off enough and not hardened or cured.  </p>

<p>How hard would this be to do myself? I don't want/need to run a fence along the sides, so how would I go about integrating with my neighbor's fences?

<p>Also, what is the best way to match up the fences, given the height disparity?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q3ZdN.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>A general rule (not sure if your neighbors abide to it) is to build the fence 1-2 feet inside your property line. You mention that the fence post is presumably in their property so even butting up to it would be in their yard. You best option is to ask them to join your new fence to it and get a simple contract to protect yourself. Either that or put up all four sides in your property.</p>

<p>You may also need to get a permit or permission from city/municipal/HOA depending on your location. Your neighbors could have even blocked you from getting a fence because of easement right between yards, all things to look up before this endeavor.</p>

<p>As for the height difference, it's more personal preference than anything else. Personally I'd recommend one size fence for the front of your preference and one size in the back of your preference which may or may not be the same. Like if you want front privacy but have nature in the back, it allows you to get away with 6ft in the front and only 4ft in the back. I'd mainly recommend the same size in both front sections if your yard is level otherwise it will look off from the street.</p>

<p>In the front you may want to fade the height difference but I wouldn't even bother in the back. Could be a nice design feature if it fades into a gate post or something.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assuming jacking is not an option, the next easiest way would be to install ""pearlings"" or surface shim boards every 12 to 16 inches on center across the floor in decreasing thickness and install a new 3/4 inch subfloor over these, screwing it down all the way into the old floor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there another word or phrase than 'pearlings' that is used for this process? Searching specifically on pearlings has gotten me nowhere. Can anyone walk me through the steps of the outlined procedure in more detail, or point me to a walkthrough of the procedure somewhere else on the internet?</p>
","<p>I think the word is actually spelled ""purlin,"" and normally refers to framing members bridging laterally across roof trusses, rafters, or wall posts or studs.</p>

<p>You say (in the other question) that the slope is consistent, i.e. the floor is still planar, just not a <em>level</em> plane.  This means the method suggested by shirlock homes in your other question shouldn't be too difficult; certainly a lot easier than the other options you mentioned.  </p>

<p>If the slope is across 10 feet, and the outer edge is 1"" lower than the inner edge, you'd start by ripping a 1"" strip off the edge of a piece of 2-by lumber, so you'll have a strip that's 1"" x 1.5"".  Attach that to the existing subfloor at the outer edge.  Now say you've decided to put these shims every 12"", that means you'll end up with 10 of them across the 10' dimension of your room, and each one will need to be 1/10"" shorter than the last one so that you end up at zero right where the room meets the house.  So rip your next one to 0.9"" thick, or about 29/32"", and attach it parallel to the first one, 12"" away from it.  Next one will be 0.8"" or 13/16"", and you'll attach it 24"" away from the first one.  Then just keep going until your last shim is 0.1"" or 3/32"" thick, and it will be about 12"" from the inner wall of the room.</p>

<p>Once you've installed these shims, their top surfaces will form a flat level plane onto which you can attach your new subfloor.  Your finished floor will be higher with this method (at the threshold it'll be equal to the thickness of your new subfloor plus the thickness of your new flooring material, and at the outer wall it'll be one inch thicker than that), but if that works in your situation I think this is a great solution.</p>

"How should I apply brick to an interior wall?","35574","","<p>I don't want to use veneer, I want to use real brick. Is it as easy as using tie-ins to the studs and setting the brick as one would normally?</p>

<p>The existing wall is drywall, So I was thinking of leaving this in place, screwing in the tie-ins and laying up the brick to my desired height.</p>
","<p>If you don't have the proper structure under the area, you're <strong>not</strong> going to want to use full sized bricks for this project.  Brick walls require proper concrete footings to support the massive amount of weight, if you don't have the ability to add the footings you won't be able to build a brick wall here.</p>

<p>In situations like this, veneer will likely be your only option.  There are different types of veneer available, depending on the look you're going for.  </p>

<h1>Faux Brick Veneer</h1>

<p>If you're looking for cheap and fast, you'll want to look at faux brick veneer. This is typically a sheet material made from plastics, which is molded and colored to to look like brick.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RWuK5.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<p>This is very easy to install, goes up fast, and is cheap-ish.  Though it tends to look just as cheap as it is, so it may not be suited to your tastes. </p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Follow the manufactures instructions.</p>

<h1>Real Brick Veneer</h1>

<p>If you're looking for an authentic look and feel; without all the weight, real brick veneer is where it's at. It's simply really thin brick (usually ~1/2"" thick), and comes in many different varieties.  Some veneer bricks are made by cutting actual reclaimed bricks, which can make matching older existing brick much easier.</p>

<p>Choosing real brick veneer over a full brick wall will save you a huge amount of weight, and allow you to have a brick wall almost anywhere you want.</p>

<h2>Real Brick Wall</h2>

<p>A 14' x 2' wall made from real brick, will take about 182 standard size bricks (3/8"" joints).  At about 6 pounds a brick, this is going to weigh 1092 lbs + the weight of the mortar.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V0roc.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>That's a massive amount of weight for your floor structure to support.</p>

<h2>Veneer Brick Wall</h2>

<p>Since 1/2"" veneer brick only weighs about 0.8 lbs, you can cover the same wall with a fraction of the weight. That same 182 bricks, is only going to weigh about 146 lbs. Not to mention the load will be spread across the wall, not sitting directly on the floor.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MA4MS.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>There are a few different ways to install it, but it's going to be quite a bit of work either way you choose to do it. </p>

<h3>Wall Tracks</h3>

<p>One method of installation, is to use a track system.  This involves attaching specially designed channels to the wall, then attaching the bricks into the channels.  This method takes a bit of extra prep time, but getting straight, even joints is made easier by the track design.</p>

<h3>Wire Mesh</h3>

<p>Another way to install brick veneer (or any masonry veneer), is to use a wire mesh backing.  You'll simply attach wire meshing to the existing wall, apply a scratch coat, then install your veneer on top.  This method takes more prep time (since you'll have to wait for the scratch coat to set), and will require more time and skill to place the bricks.</p>

<h3>Directly on the Wall</h3>

<p>Some types of brick veneer can be applied directly to a wall, in the same manor as tile is installed. This method is going to involve the least amount of prep, but will require a lot of time and skill to set the bricks (Hint: Start at the bottom, and work up).</p>

<p>Whichever product or method you choose, make sure to follow the manufacturers instructions. And as with all DIY projects, don't ever be afraid to ask for help.</p>

"How high can I stretch my washing machine drain hose?","35555","","<p>The waste hose through which the water is removed from my washing machine is inserted into a vertical pipe extending from the floor with a U shape at its end.</p>

<p>The problem is that there is foam coming out of the pipe where the waste hose is inserted.</p>

<p>Can I extend the pipe that is after (above) the U to leave more room for the foam to form and hopefully prevent it from overspilling?</p>

<p>Is there a height limit ? </p>

<p>Is there a danger of causing damage to the washing machine's water pump that pushes the water outside if it has to push a water column that is too long/high ? </p>
","<p>Experience tells me that at least some models of washer won't hold water unless the drain hose extends above the water level of the wash basin. I can't quite figure out what you're trying to say about extending pipes, but it should be safe to have the water drain out of the washer drain hose at its maximum height.</p>

<p>Eventually, the drain hose can be high enough that the water column overwhelms the pump (or hoses), but you'd have to be doing something bordering on insane to reach that. Every foot of height in a water column adds .43 psi of water pressure, so even a hose rising 15 feet above the washing machine will provide less than 7 psi of back pressure. I can't imagine a washing machine pump which doesn't handle that.</p>

"How noticeable should the seam be on a quartz counter install?","35477","","<p>This is my first question on the DIY stack so be gentle with me!</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>We just had new quartz counters installed in our kitchen renovation. We have done everything else our selves, but we figured we would use professionals for the counter top since we wanted to make sure it looked perfect. It is a medium sized L shaped counter area and due to the size of the counter the installer informed us that it would require two seams and gave us a few options for where they could locate the seams. We were a bit concerned about this but he assured us that you would not notice the seams unless you really looked for them.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few weeks to the installation date. The counters looked FANTASTIC as they were being installed. Unfortunately, once the installers finished and were ready for us to sign the satisfaction form we took a look at the seams and they are very noticeable. We refused to sign the satisfaction form at this point in time because we wanted to investigate it further.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>How noticeable should the seams be for a quartz counter installation? Obviously this depends on the texture and color of the counter, but is it something that should ever be painfully obvious? Do the pictures below illustrate what can be expected for this type of counter?</p>

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2vCaL.jpg"" alt=""Counter seam""></p>

<h2>Update 1</h2>

<p>Based on the feedback I received from this site, as well as a few other companies I contacted for consultation, I have determined that this is NOT the normal for this type of counter installation. The general consensus is:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is a pretty serious shade difference on either side of the seam which is not acceptable.</li>
<li>There should only be a single seam for this type of installation.</li>
<li>Most likely the company was trying to cut costs by using a single slab of the material.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have contacted the company that provided the counter tops and they are sending someone out to take a look at the counters and see if there is anything they can do. I will update this post again once we get to a final solution.</p>

<h2>Update 2</h2>

<p>The company has been great to work with to resolve this issue. Unfortunately, because the counter was already cut they couldn't do anything about the double seams, which is annoying. However, they did have their crew out to my house twice to get the seams as minimal as possible (both look great now) and to fix a few chips in the counter. I would leave the following advice for anyone else having a counter install:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be sure to ask that the the company installing your counter use as few seams as possible. This is likely going to increase the material cost for the counter but is well worth it in the long run.</li>
<li>Ask for opinions from the installer on your counter selection. The color we went with in this case is very difficult to install because the seams are very visible and it is difficult to mix the filler to match. This is the consensus we received from multiple installers. If we would have known this, we would have definitely gone with something that is easier to install.</li>
<li>Think twice before going with Quartz. We went with the top of the line Quartz so it was very comparable from a cost standpoint to granite. We were sold on the fact that it is zero maintenance and is supposedly as durable as granite. Unfortunately, this is not the case. It is very difficult to clean well and it chips extremely easily. We have seen small chips from dropping a very light weight ceramic plate on the counter from ~1 foot. The plate didn't even chip or break! </li>
</ol>
","<p>I wouldn't sign the form if you were told that you wouldn't be able to notice the seams.  As Jack says, they are in horrible locations.  But the #1 thing I am thinking about is I have had granite and quartz installed on at least 30-40 kitchens, with at least 15-20 Ls.  You have two sheets, not 3 and your seam is in the corner.  If they are using smaller pieces they could easily be using leftovers from other jobs, maybe really costing them nothing more than labor.  I would have never allowed them to install 3 slabs there.  That is the biggest mistake.  </p>

<p>I have had many many companies propose something like this, a couple with no-see guarantees.  I took two of them up on it in the beginning and they both looked like yours.  Got the first one at 1/3 cost and told them to take the second one out.  Never did I go for the three slabs.</p>

<p>Now the other issue is the install itself.  To me - and I am just seeing a picture - it looks like the slabs aren't exactly level with each other.  They may be off by 1/128th of an inch but it looks like they are off.  Then you have the epoxy filler which was not mixed with a matching sparkle nor was it sanded/buffed properly at the site.  I have paid a lot for high quality quartz and don't have pictures but the seams are much smaller than yours and really you couldn't see them unless you put a spot light on them.  </p>

<p>The question is did you get what you paid for.  Did this cost you $500-800 and you are expecting better?  If you paid full/normal cost you probably just need them to come take the counters.  You obviously aren't happy now.  Let me tell you by the looks of your seams, they aren't going to look this good in 3-4 years.  So you are seeing them in their best state.</p>

"Can I safely power a three-prong electrical device from a light socket?","35398","","<p>I have a covered lampholder (light socket) outside my house that I want to use to temporarily power a plug-in string of indoor/outdoor lights. Using CFLs, the total wattage of the string of lights will be lower than the rated wattage (100 W) of the lampholder.</p>

<p>The string of lights uses a grounded (three-prong) plug. Is there a way to safely power this using the lampholder?</p>

","<p>If you're talking about an A19 lampholder (the medium screw-in base widely used in the US), there are only two electrical contacts: live is at the back of the lampholder and neutral is the screw thread.  While the light fixture itself should be grounded, it's not available via an adapter.</p>

<p>In an outdoor situation, ground protection is even more important than indoors; if your exterior circuit also includes exterior receptacles, it should already be covered by a GFCI.  As I said in an another <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/1722/some-three-prong-outlets-dont-properly-test-as-grounded/1724#1724"">answer</a>, that breaks the circuit if there's a ground fault, but without a ground connection, any current is going through you to ground, instead of through the ground lead.  So no, it's not safe to use a two-prong to three-prong adapter and leave the ground on your lights disconnected.</p>

<p>I <em>have</em> seen exterior light fixtures with a grounded electrical outlet built into them; if you were able to change the light fixture, that would be the safest way to go.</p>

"Can I install cellulose insulation without a blower machine?","35295","","<p>I've purchased a few bags of loose fill cellulose insulation from the local hardware store (GreenFiber brand). How will the insulation work if I don't put it through the machine to fluff it and force it through a tube? Will the insulation be compressed a bit so that I won't get the coverage that the bag says, but its R value per inch should be about the same? Can I consider its R-value to be something close to the ""dense-pack"" R-value?</p>
","<p>Since cellulose insulation is compressively packaged you cannot install it without using a blowing machine. I do not recommend trying to do this by hand. ""A few bags"" may not qualify you for loan of a machine, but you can certainly rent one from a big box home center or an equiment rental service.</p>

<p>The R-factor of fiber insulation follows an inverse ""U"" curve. As density increases, R-factor increases--up to a point. Dense packed cellulose insulation at 3.0 to 3.5 pcf--typical installed density in closed cavities--has an R-factor of 3.9 or 4.0, compared with 3.7 or 3.8 at settled density. Fiber glass at 2.2 to 2.5 pcf may have an R-factor in excess of 4.0, compared with 2.2 to 3.1 at design density.  At some point the curves for both materials turn around and R-factor decreases with greater density.  For cellulose that seems to be somewhere between 3.5 and 4.0.</p>

"Creaking / Clicking noise coming from wood / cardboard","35218","","<p>Feel like I'm starting to lose my mind with this one. </p>

<p>I'm regularly hearing a noise in at least two rooms of the house, which I can best describe as a creaking or clicking. I've listened to recordings of deathwatch beetles and it's definitely not that. It sounds almost exactly like a door creaking gently except very faint. </p>

<p>When present, this noise repeats in intervals of about 5 seconds. It's barely audible, just on the edge of hearing - so much so that it's almost impossible to pinpoint it to one place. I've tracked it down to above one of the cupboards in the kitchen, behind a set of shelves in the study (possibly IN the shelf) and bizarrely, an old box of tea bags. </p>

<p>That last one is what really throws me, but I'm 100% sure. The box was on the counter, and I was able to put my ear right up to it, and the sound was very pronounced. I was sure it was some kind of audible woodworm or something, but now that I've found it in a tea bag box I'm unsure. I emptied that tea bag box and found no bugs or insects. </p>

<p>The sound appears to be organic in nature, because if I make a disturbance in the area, the sound stops. In the case of the cupboard and shelves a sharp bang or shake, in the case of the tea bags I just lifted the box. </p>

<p>I have quite sensitive hearing and my wife can't hear the noise. She's starting to look at me funny when I talk about it. The only recording equipment I have is my phone, and that's not sensitive enough to pick it up. </p>

<p>I'm going to see if I can find an old laptop with a mic port and record it next time I hear it, but until then has anyone got any ideas what this could be? </p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>

<p>It's definitely NOT a mouse. I know what a mouse sounds like, and there was no mouse in my box of tea-bags. This is something much, much smaller. Something small enough to live inside cardboard. </p>

"How do I remove a chimney?","35115","","<p>I've got a chimney in my 50's-era house that doesn't do anything. It's a regular brick and mortar chimney but it used to be used to vent the old oil heater (it's been converted to natural gas since). The chimney isn't used any more. I don't believe it's structural. Let's assume it's not but I'll get a second opinion on that before I do anything.</p>

<p>I've looked online and it seems that you just need to get an air hammer, chisel out the mortar and remove the chimney brick by brick. Then patch up the roof and the floor.

<p>Any other recommendations?</p>
","<p>You didn't mention how tall the chimney is.  2 story house or single. Is there or was there ever a displacement for a fireplace, one flue or two?  Lined or bare brick interior?  </p>

<p>In general, the procedure is brick by brick. A small mini jack/impact  hammer will speed up the process, but it can be done with a hammer and cold chisel. Most chimneys are independently supported and not structural to walls or the roof. there may be ties to framing members that you will have to cut or remove as you go through the roof or floor. You definitely want to use basic safety equipment like a dust mask, gloves and good eye protection. You can cut down on the dust and debris spreading in the house by hanging plastic from the ceilings around the work area. Use some painter's tape to hang lightweight plastic from the ceiling creating an enclosed area around your work area. </p>

<p>One cool trick on chimneys with a large flue opening and a clean out on the bottom is to drop the bricks one at a time to the bottom and have a helper remove them and stack them at the bottom. This is a bit neater and saves bringing bricks through the house. </p>

"How can I remove grout and mortar from a drain?","34818","","<p>I <strong><em>accidentally</em></strong> poured some mortar and grout down my bathroom drain when I was cleaning the remains of a bucket of mortar after tiling the kitchen. The drain was plugged up pretty bad so I tried to scrape some of it out with a wire hanger down the overflow, and that got it flowing again, but its still draining kind of slow.  </p>

<p>It's an old house, so the drain isn't PVC, it's galvanized, or bronze, or whatever they used back in the 50's</p>
","<p>You probably (and <em>hopefully</em>) have a large amount of sand/grout stuck in the P trap.  If so your best bet would be to remove the P trap and give it a good thorough cleaning (out in the yard, with a hose).<br>
(While the trap is off you'll be able to inspect the tailpiece and the drain line as it goes into the wall and clean those up too if necessary.)</p>

<hr>

<p>If you can't detach your P trap you have a few options:</p>

<ul>
<li>If your trap has a cleanout nut, open it up and run water through until gunk stops coming out (you can employ your wire hanger here too, to ""encourage"" it).<br>
(My experience is most older pipes that have such a cleanout nut are so old that the thing is frozen and can't be opened without breaking the pipe, so be careful if you try this)</li>
<li>Remove as much of the tailpiece as you can and clean out the trap with a shop-vac and/or spoon/wire/etc.</li>
<li>Work a snake down the drain and whip it around like crazy while running LOTS of water<br>
(In the hope that you'll wash enough of the grout further downstream that (a) your drain runs quickly again, and (b) it doesn't clog your pipes further down the line where you can't get at it.<br>
This is really a last resort and just delays (or moves) the need for a proper fix...)</li>

"Should I cut-in the whole room at once, or only the portion I'm working on?","34750","","<p>Never painted before. I've decided to paint my studio, which is a 770 sq rectangular space.</p>

<p>I'm going to need to paint the ceiling as well as the walls. I am planning to follow John Burbidge instructional videos on youtube. I'm going to paint the ceiling first then the walls. I'm going to use a roller for the majority of the work. I have several questions:</p>

<p>When painting the walls do I ""cut-in"" just the areas I'm going to paint or do I cut-in all the walls?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>if I were going to paint the right side of my studio on Friday night and the left side on Saturday would I still cut-in the all the corners and edges?  Or just the ones connected to the wall I'm planning to paint that day?</p></li>
<li><p>what if I were going to take 3 a hour break between painting the right side and the left side?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, I'm trying to figure out when I should cut-in the entire room as oppose to cut-in only part of it.</p>

<p>Could you also explain how the ""frame/border/halo"" effect happens?  This is where the cut-in area is a different shade?  Is really because the ""cut-in"" area had dried before you painted the area?</p>
","<p>It really shouldn't matter. In the end, it's the exact same paint so it should match. </p>

<p>What can cause the halo, though is if your brush vs. roller technique lay down different amounts of paint. In my experience, it's easier to lay down a thicker coat of paint with a roller than brush, so after doing one coat of cutting in, and then one coat of rolling, you may notice the edges look lighter because there is less paint there. That said, I've yet to find any magical wall paint that only takes one coat so by the time you get the second (or sometimes 3rd coat) on you shouldn't notice it.</p>

<p>The only reason you may not want to cut in well before you roll is if you want to reduce the amount of brush marks as much as possible. While the color won't change based on what you are using, the texture may. </p>

<p>What I typically do is do them both at the same time. I'll cut in around a window, then roll as close as I can get safely with the roller to even out the texture. Then I'll cut in the ceiling on the same wall, then roll that, repeat. </p>

<p>Also, if you just hate cutting in, or have so much to do it's daunting, consider not doing it all at the border of the ceiling and walls and instead roll close to it, then when finished, tack up some crown moulding. It doesn't have to be fancy moulding at all...even a 2"" bit of slightly tapered door casing can look sharp. </p>

<p>That's the technique I usually use on already painted rooms that I'm repainting. Often the previous paint job at the border is just sloppy enough that even if I carefully go to the edge, there's enough spots of the old color that creep out that it just looks tacky. In those situations I go get the pre-finished window casings from Home Depot (can be found for less than a dollar a foot) and tack them up with a brad nailer. For a slightly more modern look you can use plain dimensional trim (such as a 1 x 2).</p>

<p>Yet another technique to avoid all that cutting in at the corner of the ceiling and wall is to simply paint them the same color. I'm redoing a bath that needs new paint on both the walls and ceiling so I'm going with a very light gray for both. </p>

"How can you reverse a sliding glass door?","34747","","<p>We have a sliding glass door to our patio. The opening side is jammed up against a wall, meaning you have to scrape against that wall unless you throw the door all the way open. On the other side there's plenty of room.</p>

<p>I had the thought to reverse the door so that the left side slid, instead of the right side. Now, given that glass doors are sold in left- and right-handed, I imagine this is a bit involved. But can it be done without replacing the entire unit? If so, what's involved?</p>
","<p><strong>If</strong> the door can be reversed (and that's a big if) then I can't imagine it can be done without removing the entire door frame. The fixed pane is, well, <strong>fixed</strong> and unless you see a way to detach it from the frame and attach it to the other side then you may be out of luck.</p>

<p>So let's assume you <em>can't</em> remove the fixed frame. Well, you could try rotating the door. This should work, but it would put the rail on the <strong>outside</strong> of the door. I don't know how this exposure would affect the longevity of the product, and you'd certainly be prone to more things getting built up in the track. This also means that the exterior side of the glass would be facing the interior. A lot of modern glass has reflective coatings and treatments on the outside for energy efficiency purposes. You'd be losing this, and likely by making it worse in the summer (as energy would more readily penetrate and less readily escape).
Lastly, if your door is flashed and sealed, and if it has a flange around the frame, it might not even fit the other way without sticking out of the siding, and if it's vinyl it likely has drain holes in the frame which would now <strong>drain into the house</strong>.</p>

<p>You'd then have to reverse the lockset and handle on the door. This is probably the easiest part.</p>

<p>But, in conclusion, you should recognize that you would likely:</p>

<ul>
<li>Need to remove the entire frame from the opening</li>
<li>Likely lose energy efficient properties from the glass treatment being reversed</li>
<li>Expose your rail track to the exterior and additional wear</li>
<li>Need to reverse your handle and lockset (and lose the ability to use the ""bar in the track security method)</li>
<li>Need to re-flash and re-seal the door (provided that there is a flange and that it's still usable)</li>
</ul>

<p>In my humble opinion, each of these together would warrant simply buying a new sliding door to replace this one. Because the door frame isn't really all that expensive. The issue is the labor of removing, replacing and resealing the door.... which I think you'd have to do either way.</p>

"Should I encapsulate my crawl space?","34595","","<p>Our home was built with a dirt crawl space that is about 2' from ground to bottom of floor joist. The floors are insulated with fiberglass held up (where it hasn't fallen down) with wire rods. The AC/heating duct runs through the crawl space and has insulation that looks worn out. There are vents all around the perimeter thru the concrete blocks.</p>

<p>Have had trouble for years with dampness in the crawl space. A few months ago after it had rained for about a week I was under the house and it was so damp it was dripping from some of the floor fiberglass. Also, the AC ducts always drip in the summer.</p>

<p>Currently I have a fan running all summer long to help keep it dry down there.</p>

<p>I'm considering encapsulating the crawl space thinking this should solve the moisture problem. From what I've read it should also eliminate the need to rehang all the fiberglass that keeps falling down, as well as eliminate the need to redo the duct insulation.</p>

<p>Would like to hear from someone who has done this before as to how it turned out.</p>

<p>Update, 10/3/13: Just want to thank littleturtle not only for your comprehensive info on this but your cited source.  I read through it last night and am still trying to digest it. But one thing I picked up on was that you don't have to vent the crawl space to the inside of the house to exchange air. That's what seems best for me because I'm thinking that during the winter I'd have to pay to heat the crawlspace, and heating KWHs are expensive. Incidentally, I'm near Charleston, S.C. (Zone 3) where the cooling cost exceeds the heating cost and the humidity is typically high. Anyway, I'm going to keep plugging along on this topic until I get a good feeling about doing it, or not. I'm retired and have time to think this through carefully.</p>

<p>Update, 11/14/13: Have decided not to encapsulate for now. Why? Doesn't make sense to spend thousands of dollars when the little box fan seems to work okay. In other words, running a box fan in the crawl space all summer does an adequate job of removing the condensation, at a low cost. Keep in mind that there has never been a problem with the dampness actually rotting any of the floor joists, or sill plate. Since the condensation is the only problem, other than that the insulation keeps falling down (another story), it just doesn't seem necessary or smart to spend that kind of money. If, on the other hand, there was ample evidence that there was a payback from the reduction in the KWH used for heating and cooling, then I would do it. </p>

<p>Update, 4/17/14: After further research I became convinced that I should seal the vents in the crawlspace. So, that's what I did. Now I'm monitoring both the temperature and humidity down there with a handy-dandy display in my den. Something I'm also thinking about is using the cooler air down there to cool the house. It stays in the 60's (since February) down there. Depending on the temperature this summer, I may devise a method to exchange air to cool the first floor next year.</p>
","<p>Yes, bringing the crawl space into the conditioned space is generally recommended as a way to prevent crawlspace moisture problems (I assume this is what you mean by encapsulate). </p>

<p>This means:</p>

<ol>
<li>sealing vents to the exterior</li>
<li>sealing the dirt floor with polyethylene sheeting (at least 6 mil), or concrete</li>
<li>creating vents between the living space and the crawlspace (ideally supply air to/from the space with HVAC ductwork), and </li>
<li>insulating the interior side of the crawlspace walls on (not necessary in <a href=""http://energycode.pnl.gov/EnergyCodeReqs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">climate zone 1 or 2</a>; and preferably with board foam or spray foam because fiberglass doesn't do well with moisture).</li>
<li>probably a good idea to remove existing floor insulation</li>
</ol>

<p>This will prevent humid outside air from coming into the crawlspace and condensing on cold surfaces, and prevent/reduce moisture from coming up through the dirt floor or walls. Your AC will also deliver cold air more effectively. Good site drainage is also key.</p>

<p>There are many good references on how to do this properly:</p>

"Can I install 6' 6x6 fence posts onto a cement driveway?","34581","","<p>We would like to install a 6' privacy fence with 6x6 cedar posts, between our house and driveway, that would involve 3 posts on top of our cement driveway and 1 in the ground.  My intention was to hire someone with a core drill to dig 3' holes for footings, and pour cement into 10"" tubes, but I am now wondering if it is ""ok"" to just install the footings directly on top of the driveway.</p>

<p>I have not checked the depth of the cement yet, so is there a recommended driveway depth for this sort of thing, if I can install directly into the existing cement?  Or should I go ahead and get 12"" holes taken out with a core drill and create 3"" deep footings?</p>

<p>Also, is this a proper post anchor to use? It is the only type they had at our store.</p>

<p>[self-removed image]</p>
","<p>A fence post has very little vertical force...mainly just the weight of the post and panels it holds. Your driveway slab would work fine as a footing for that. HOWEVER, the primary force on a fence is typically lateral--especially a 6' fence. The reason posts are put into the ground is to counter lateral forces on the fence (typically the wind).</p>

<p>I imagine there are types of brackets that could be used on the concrete to accomodate the lateral forces, but the type you have in your post is not that type...that's typically used to attach structural posts to concrete (it handles the vertical force, but not lateral). </p>

<p>The type of brackets you'd need would be something akin to a shelf bracket where there's a diagonal brace between the two plates. </p>

<p>So, one option is to cut holes in your slab and dig proper holes there. Alternatively, you could find plates designed for this (or have someone weld some up for you). </p>

<p>A third option would be to not build a straight fence, but rather stagger the posts in a zig-zag pattern.</p>

"How can I add a carbonated water tap in my kitchen?","34516","","<p>I love carbonated water, but am sick and tired of buying it in bottles.  There are home water-carbonating appliances like <a href=""http://www.sodastreamusa.com/"">SodaStream</a>, but I prefer not to have another countertop appliance.  Can I install a carbonation device under my counter and have it available on a tap on my sink, similar to how under-counter water filtration devices are often installed?</p>

<p>I also prefer to have a co2 that can be refilled or at least recycled.</p>
","<p>You need 3 major factors for this:</p>

<p>1) a source of CO2. Many people use paintball tanks which can be refilled. They come in 12 and 20 oz tanks so they would easily fit under your counter. But I bought a 20 pound tank as that seemed like the sweet spot for tank cost vs gas cost for me.</p>

<p>2) a tank to hold the pressurized water. For example, a 3 Gallon Pepsi style Cornelius keg is 17"" high by 8.5"" wide.</p>

<p>3) a way to keep the water tank cold. This is the hard part and I don't know of any easy solutions. I bought a 7 CF freezer and hacked the thermostat. It doesn't fit under the counter but my wife is ok with it because she drinks a LOT of carbonated water.</p>

<p>--
In response to the question about refilling the water tank:</p>

<p>The cheapest Cornelius kegs are used and hold 5 gallons/19 liters. That would last most people at least a week. So I just refill the keg as it gets empty.</p>

<p>I thought about other methods to refill the keg, partially with the aim of reducing the CO2 wasted when the keg is opened for manual refilling.</p>

<p>One idea is to buy a 2nd keg and use an air compressor to force water from the 2nd keg to the 1st keg. You would stop before the 2nd keg is empty so that air doesn't get into the 1st keg. Then you add CO2 to the 1st keg to bring it up to the desired carbonation level.</p>

<p>How much could you save by doing this?
Typically there is 2 to 4 volumes of CO2 in carbonated water. Let's assume we use 3. In other words, 20 liters of water would use 60 liters of gas. Also that we use 1 bar or 15 psi to push the water out. That's an additional liter of gas per liter of water. At one liter of water consumed per day, that's 365 liters per year of gas wasted by opening the keg to refill.</p>

<p>There are 229 liters of gas per pound and I paid about $1 per pound, thus the wasted 365 liters of gas costs $1.60. I don't think this is worth any effort to avoid at my price for gas. If gas costs you more, you'll have to analyze the tradeoffs for yourself.</p>

<p>Note that 20 pounds gives 4,580 liters of gas while 1 liter of water per day is 1,460 liters of gas per year. This means 20 pounds of gas will last over 3 years.</p>

<p>If you wanted something really automated, you could use a weight sensor to detect when the water tank was running low and turn on a valve to let more water into the keg. This assumes household water pressure is higher than keg pressure. For me, water pressure at the street is 100 PSI and my regulator takes it down to 60, much more than the 15 PSI that the keg uses.
If this is not your situation, you'd need a water pump.
The weight sensor also needs to signal when the keg has enough water and turn off the valve.</p>

<p>You'd also need a pressure sensor to detect when the keg pressure is too low and inject more CO2. I consider this too complicated for home use.</p>

<p>Another reason I do it this way is that my wife and I love the taste of San Pellegrino. I read an article describing how to make it at home.</p>

<p><a href=""http://blog.khymos.org/2012/01/04/mineral-waters-a-la-carte/"">http://blog.khymos.org/2012/01/04/mineral-waters-a-la-carte/</a></p>

<p>I was able to find a local brewery supply house that sold ""Burton water salts"". Mixed into the water at an appropriate ratio (I use 1 gram per liter), it tastes very good.</p>

<p>Since I have to mix the minerals into my water anyway, refilling the keg and pressurizing it as a batch process is no extra burden.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Does the sub-panel seem over loaded? If so, I could keep the water-heater in the main panel and free up space in the panel another way.</p>

<p>Seems reasonable to me. Most of the equipment won't draw anywhere near the overcurrent rating, at least not during normal operation. Motor loads will draw a higher current on start, but you shouldn't have a problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know I need four-strand wire to run to the sub-panel (2 hot, neutral, ground) but copper or aluminum and what gauge?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can use either copper or aluminum, though I recommend copper for DIYers. Copper is quite a bit more expensive, but it's easier to work with (in my opinion). If you feel confident working with aluminum conductors, you can save some money using it. </p>

<p>I've covered the topic of feeder sizing <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/a/29077/33"">here</a>, so I won't go into detail. If you're using copper, you'll want to use 3 AWG conductors. If you choose to use aluminum, you'll need 1 AWG conductors.  </p>

<p>If you want to run a single cable, instead of individual conductors in conduit. You can buy what's called 3-3-3-5 SER cable (1-1-1-3 for aluminum), which will contain three 3 AWG conductors (hot,hot,neutral) and a 5 AWG grounding conductor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I run the wire along the floor joist, does it need to be secured to the joist or can it just hang there and rest on the drop ceiling? Seems like it should be secured to the joist with wire hanger or something.</p>

<p>You'll have to attach the cable to the joists, using 1 - 1 1/4"" staples or other approved means. Check the packaging, to make sure they are rated for the size cable you're using.</p>

<p>The cable you'll be working with is thick and heavy, and it's not going to be fun pulling it. You'll probably want a couple helpers, to help you wrangle it.  </p>

<p>Make sure all your connections are tightened to the manufacturer's specified torque.</p>

<p>If you choose aluminum conductors, make doubly sure you tighten the connections. And don't forget the <a href=""http://www.idealind.com/prodDetail.do?prodId=noalox"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">anti-oxidant</a>.</p>

<p>Come back a day or two after the panel has been put into service, and tighten any connections that need it.</p>

<p>Don't forget to remove the bonding jumper between the grounded and grounding bus bars.</p>

<p>You'll need clamps big enough for the cable, to secure it to the panels.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>should I put a 100 amp breaker in the sub-panel to act as the ""main"" for the sub-panel? Or is the 100 amp breaker in the main panel sufficient?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can usually pick up a main breaker panel, for about the same price as a main lug only (MLO) panel. In my opinion, unless the secondary panel is next to; or within sight of, the main panel. You're better served to install a main breaker panel.  It simply offers better protection during maintenance, or other work within the panel.  </p>

<p>For example. If you turn off the feeder breaker in the main panel, and start working in the secondary panel. Somebody could easily come along, and flip on the feeder breaker. Since you can't keep an eye on the breaker, you can never be sure the panel will be dead. (unless of course you're using a lockout like you should). </p>

<p>If the secondary panel is in a separate building or structure, then you either need a main breaker, a main disconnect, or the ability to disconnect all ungrounded conductors within 6 or less hand moves.</p>

"How much weight can an old work box hold?","34356","","<p>I will be installing new light fixtures in two bathrooms that look like this:</p>

<p>The challenge: The old light is connected to the power cable and there is no work box, it was simply screwed to the wall and wired up. The wire comes through the wall via a hole as big as the cable.</p>

<p>I plan on using an old work box to not only contain the cable, but attach the new light fixture to it.

"Why is the water in my toilets orange?","34340","","<p>My wife and I just moved in to a brand new house and have started to notice that the water in the toilets is an orange color, and is starting to leave stains in the bowl. After looking online briefly, I have seen the suggestion that perhaps there is rust in the plumbing. I know that all of the plumbing in our house consists of what appears to be plastic piping... is there any other explanation? What steps should be taken to fix the problem?</p>
","<p>If the house was vacant for a long period of time, there might be build up in the pipes. Try running a number of facuets for a while and flush the toilet over and over.  Assuming your incoming water isn't orange, it should go away after you flush out the pipes.</p>

<p>Also open the tank and have a look in there - maybe there is a component of the toilet that is rusting, or maybe there is some type of cleaning tablet present (usually they are blue but you never know).</p>

<p>EDIT: You mentioned in your comment that there is orange sediment on the bottom of the tank.  I can't really guess at what this is (maybe orange soil as someone in the comments suggested), but I would suggest that you turn off the water to the toilet, flush it to empty the tank, and then using a sponge, scrub it off, or at least disturb it enough that it will wash away when the tank refills.  Turn the water back on and flush it away.</p>

<p>If it comes back after some time then you'd need to investigate further..</p>

"Why can't I lay tiles on an uneven floor?","34289","","<p>My buddy and I have gotten into a bit of a dispute on facebook, here's what he asks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I keep hearing tiling an unlevel floor will result in tiles coming up. This reason makes no sense to me. The only reason a stable but unlevel floor will have tiles come up is if the bond between the cement and floor or tile fails. This failure should have NOTHING to do w/levelness of the floor, correct?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My response goes something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here's the thing: Unless you use a LOT of paste underneath the tiles (which won't dry out properly so will crack fast) then you will have a potential for a lever situation once the paste that's under an uneven one <em>does</em> dry out (because it will). Then that will cause disruption under the other tiles. Can't you just lay another level of backerboard to try and get things mostly level?</p>
  
  <p>The more the floor is uneven the more you will have to use extra cement, which means it won't dry out at the same time. Here, I'll go ask the pros for you to see what you can do since apparently you don't like my idea of asking them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Am I on the right track? What can he do to reduce the risk of the tiles coming up if the original floor is uneven?</p>

<p>FWIW: He's refinishing an older townhouse that he purchased in Houston, TX (in case age/location makes a difference)</p>

<h2>UPDATE:</h2>

<p>after feedback from Tester101 (much obliged) the actual problem is a wavy and uneven concrete floor. It's for the living room, so there's not really any real risk of water.</p>
","<p>If the floor is concrete the best thing todo is scorch the uneven floor with a grinder making deep grooves in various directions. Clean with water jetting loose dust away. Mix some new concrete. Wet the floor again and screte it to a level But dont make it smooth just leave it slightly rough maintaing the level. 
Pour water on as per concrete bag reccomebds. Usually 48 to 72 hours. Let the concrete dry for another 48 to 72 hours. 
Then using tile paste and the tile tool (the one that is straight on one edge and has teeth on the other) lay the paste. </p>

<p>If it's a wooden moving floor. Like suspended on wooden beams and when you walk on it the glasses in your cupboard rattle then you place long as possible boards to have a flat even surface that is as continuous as possible. Make sure to find out which boards to use. I can't remember the name now. Then using the same tile paste lay your tiles. You might want to use chaulk or silicone to grout. But using normal grout is ok. It could just make hairline cracks or sometimes just a section would shatter. Just need to regrout. This is the minus side of unstable floors. </p>

<p>I have tiled 1 place on a place in Europe a house built in 1st world war. Some german barracks where everything vibrated when you walked on it. I used that method 11 years ago and no complaints till today. </p>

"AC Unit Blow Warm Air Indoor But Colder Air Outdoor","34113","","<p>I have two AC Units.  One for upstairs and one for downstairs.  The upstairs one works just fine but not the downstairs.  So, i did a test by turning both units on and went outside to compare the two units.

Anyone know what is wrong with my downstairs unit?</p>

<p>BTW: I had the HVAC guy come out to check it 3 years back, and he added refrigerant into the system.  It worked for a week or two after he left, then it's back to warm air again.  Would this be a leak of some sort?</p>
","<p>Because of the need to capture the refrigerant and licenses to get the refrigerant in most places, this typically isn't a DIY job. The fact that the outside unit is running and air is blowing inside suggests that it's not a problem with the thermostat.

<li>Compressor has failed</li>
<li>No refrigerant or not enough</li>
<li>Controller has failed or wiring has become disconnected</li>

"Can I run a central air conditioner in the winter?","34101","","<p>What happens if you run a central air conditioner when it's below freezing outside? Is this expected to work?</p>

<p>I know, it sounds crazy, but that's because you don't live in an overheated New York apartment building built in 1904 where the whole building is a single heat zone. </p>

<p>Our building has a big boiler in the basement that goes on for a certain number of minutes every hour, depending on the outside temperature, sending steam to every radiator in the building. In order to make sure that the coldest room in the whole building is adequately heated, that means lots of rooms are way overheated, and the temperature can reach the upper 80s (F of course).</p>

<p>The usual solution is to open and close windows manually. Apparently this is ""by design"", many of our windows actually have little panels in them you can open to get cool air. Then the temperature goes down to the lower 60s near the window, while it's still 80s elsewhere in the apartment, and it's drafty, too.</p>

<p>We're looking into installing <a href=""http://www.habitatmag.com/archive/article/4112/trv-guide/"">thermostats on the radiators</a>, but that is not the question.</p>

<p>The question is, what happens if we run the central air conditioner while it's freezing outside but over 80 inside?</p>

<p>The central air conditioner consists of an <a href=""http://www.aerosysinc.com/THDC-364860.php"">Aerosys THDC</a> condenser (which is mounted through an ""exterior wall"" to an air shaft) connected through refrigerant lines to an indoors air-handling unit which has typical ductwork going to each room.</p>

<p>I don't think the people who made these condensers ever expected that they would be operating when it's well below freezing outside, so I am wondering if it should just work fine or if this is really a morbidly bad idea for some reason. </p>

<p>Empirically, it sort of worked for a couple of months, but when it got really cold, the condenser conked out, and now I have a repair call in to the AC company, but I don't know if that's because it was so cold outside or for some other reason.</p>
","<p>After reviewing the spec sheet for the unit i have found that the LX series has a variable speed blower that will allow the unit to operate under low ambient conditions. Is specifies the system can operate down to 20 degrees. Anything below this and the system will not operate. If you do not have the LX unit and do have the standard, the. The unit is not permitted for low ambient use.</p>

<p>Most central air conditioning systems do not work under low ambient operation and doing so can damage the system. Residential condensers will very rarely come with a crank case heater for the compressor as well as a low ambient control that can modulate the condenser fan speed to maintain proper operation of the system. This is however common practice on heat pumps and ductless units. Most will only allow operation down to 32 degrees. A low ambient kit is normally required to lower the minimum operating temperature of the system.</p>

<p>The issue on running an air conditioner in cold weather is that refrigerant will migrate underneath the oil in the compressor crank case. When the compressor is then energized the refrigerant will rapidly change state as it is agitated and absorbing heat. This will cause the oil to be forced out of the crank case and will cause the compressor to run dry on oil for a period of time until the crank case has refilled with oil in the system. This can cause the compressor to fail. A crank case heater is utilized to prevent this by keeping the compressor pre heated.</p>

<p>So in conclusion if your system is the LX model it will stop operating when the outdoor ambient is below 20 degrees. The fact that the system is advertised for low ambient operation means that it is ok to operate down to 20 degrees.
If it is the standard model then you may have damaged the system from running it in low ambient conditions. </p>

"Why do my new door hinges prevent my door from shutting completely?","34070","","<p>I have installed some new standard 3"" door hinges with a small corner radius on a 32"" door.  The doors are solid-core oak doors.  The hinges appear to look fine and fit perfectly flush in the existing grooves in both the frame and door.  But now when I close the door, the door hits the opposite side of the door frame (handle side), and overlaps about 1/16"" - 1/8"" so it will not shut.  The top of the door is fine.  It appears to be pretty evenly overlapping, so it's not like the top of the adjacent side is ok and the bottom overlaps.</p>

<p>I assume this is because the hinges must be slightly thicker, or in the closed position they are a bit wider.  How do I go about fixing this?  I guess I could take them off again, and chisel away a little on the door grooves or in the frame, but how would I keep that consistent?  I have 5 more doors to do after this one; I sure hope they are not all this way.</p>
","<p>I'm not sure about ChrisF's suggestion since I've never had that particular problem (with the door rubbing on the hinge side) - is the issue that it's hitting the frame on the hinge side or the doorknob side?</p>

<p>If it's hitting the jamb on the doorknob side (as if the door is now too wide) then the usual solution is to trim down the door.  Usually I would run it through a table saw, but you could do it with a circular saw as well if you are really careful.  </p>

<p>Just make sure to trim off the knob side rather than the hinge side so you don't have to worry about mortising out new spots for the hinges (and then risk being off on the top of the door)</p>

","<p>The tape you purchased is the correct tape for gas fittings.  However, the fitting in your picture is a <strong>flared</strong> fitting.  PTFE (Teflon) tape/pipe dope is only necessary on <strong>pipe thread</strong> fittings.</p>

<p>This is because pipe threads are tapered - as you tighten the fitting, the threads bind together and deform slightly to create a seal.  The pipe tape/dope helps lubricate the threads and make a better seal.</p>

<p>With a flared fitting like your photo shows, the flare at the bottom seats in a mating flare inside the female fitting.  The threads are only there to draw the two together.</p>

<p>Using tape on the flare fitting may not cause any problems, but I would not take the chance, especially with gas.  If any tape gets under the flare or prevents the nut from tightening down fully, you're going to have a leak.</p>

"How can I get my shower head to increase water pressure?","33701","","<p>My mom has very thick hair and typical low flow shower heads take a very long time to rinse her hair.  I decided that I would look online for some high flow shower heads and can't seem to find anything with a flow of more than 2.5GPM.  </p>

<p>I've seen some where people have commented that they were able to remove a flow restrictor to improve flow, but no one states what the new flow rate would be.  </p>

<p>While I would prefer to find a shower head that has a high flow without modification, I would be amenable to one that the restrictor can be removed but would still want to know what the flow rate is once modified.  Can anyone provide direction?</p>
","<p>First as Henry Jackson mentions the low flow shower heads are part of the the water consumption laws passed in the US.  I am not sure how the US compares to other countries.  I have done construction in France and in Spain and nobody has mentioned this to me and I never really thought about the pressure after installation - if I were to guess they seem to have a lot of pressure.  </p>

<p><strong>Removing the restrictor</strong> (sometimes referred to as the flow control by some manufacturers) is probably the easiest thing to do.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qqOkG.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Actually let me take it one step further.  Given the green restrictor you see in the picture above, I don't want to totally take it out.  This is because the depth of the gasket that is over this may not match up well with this out and could be loose.  So I like to just remove the center part of the restrictor and put it back in how it was.  Boom - half of the shower heads I had issues with are fine after this.  </p>

<p>The next factor we have to think about is how much water is making its way to the shower valve.  The <strong>size of the plumbing</strong> will determine how much water your shower is getting.  Most showers in the US are fed with 1/2"" PEX or copper.  This should be plenty to get a pretty powerful shower.  If you have 3/8"" or 1/4"" feeding your shower this could cause low flow.  But this is usually pretty costly to fix and includes opening bathroom walls.  Some people will differ with my take on the 1/2"" being enough and say that a shower head needs 3/4"" - this is more personal preference but you can get a good shower from 1/2"" in my opinion.</p>

<p>Then to go along with the amount of water pumped to the shower head another restriction point is the <strong>filter of your shower valve</strong> shown below.  If you have a newer shower valve they will come with on or two filters (hot/cold).  These become clogged and restrict water flow.  In the picture below there would be a mesh filter under the two smaller gaskets.  These can get clogged with mineral deposits or ""dirty"" water.  To clean these you can get a new filter from manufacturer or often you can just soak the screen in vinegar.  If the filters are really clogged often they will have damaged the filter mechanism enough that you will have to replace.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AtuBp.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The next factor is if the <strong>head pressurizes the water</strong>.  Some manufacturers do a turbine type of effect that pushes out the water faster.  Others restrict the water before outputting which increases pressure.  Others add air into the mix to create pressure.  And others do something else or a combination.  This is really ""what to buy"" thing.  I don't want to get buying advice but I have bought these types and have been happy.  Read reviews.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/t6AHn.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The last factor that I can think of is how many <strong>outlets the shower head has and how big they are</strong>.  The less outlets for water to go through and the smaller they are will lead to more PSI output.  This is really a buying question too and one where you want to read specs and reviews on a shower head.  I tend to go for the mulit-function ones below that can adjust through 5-10 stages.  Usually 2-3 of them outputs pretty high.  (The picture below is not a recommendation, just an example)</p>

Which would be the best choice for building a desk without sag?</p>
","<p>Any sheet goods are going to be lacking in strength in terms of deflection so your construction will have to compensate for this.

<li><strong>Plywood</strong> is the strongest of the sheet goods and takes mechanical fasteners by far the best. But it's either a terrible surface to paint (if you get construction grade) or too nice/expensive to cover up (if you get cabinet grade). </li>
<li><strong>MDF</strong> paints well but is monstrously heavy, is the most prone to sagging, and will not take fasteners in its edges.</li>
<li><strong>Particle board</strong> is inexpensive but it's flimsy and is almost impossible to seal up well enough to protect it from water damage unless you cover it with laminate but then you've just got a counter-top.</li>
<li><strong>Melamine</strong> has an durable, stain proof film on both faces but as such it cannot be painted. It's also susceptible to water damage as it's just particle board in the center.</li>
<li><strong>MDO</strong> is a sheet of plywood covered in a thin layer of MDf. This gives it the strength and versatility of plywood while keeping the weight down, but it also takes paint just like MDF. It's only draw back is that the edges are not finish grade in the traditional sense so they'll need to be banded or captured in some fashion, and it's a bit more pricey than MDF or CDX.</li>

","<p>The proper name for it is a self piercing saddle valve. The valves are bad for many reasons, including the fact that they often clog and no longer allow water through the line, and they leak.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GgtoS.jpg"" alt=""self piercing saddle valve""></p>

<p>If you need a valve there to supply something like an ice maker or humidifier, then I'd cut the pipe, add a T, and put a proper quarter turn valve on the line.</p>

<p>To remove it, I'd just cut the pipe right on the piercing and install a copper coupling between the two cut pipes. The steps include: shutoff the water, remove the saddle valve (unscrew the two sides), cut the pipe, clean it, apply flux to the pipe and a copper coupling, fit them together, and solder the joint by heating with a blow torch and working solder into the joint from the opposite side. A skilled plumber should have the entire job done in under 30 minutes including setup and cleanup. For the DIY'er, you'll need the following tools and parts:</p>

"Doors have stopped closing due to humidity, how can I close my doors?","33584","","<p>I have a few doors in my house that will not close at the moment due to humidity and I was wondering what is the smartest course of action would be.</p>

<p>1 door will not close due to expanding past the frame width wise and the other is being caught on the top.</p>

<p>My options as I see it right now are</p>

<ul>
<li>Sand down door frames</li>
<li>Sand down doors</li>
<li>Rehang doors</li>
</ul>

<p>I could use some advice.</p>
","<p><em>First things first:</em> Check to make sure the screws in the hinges are all tight. If they are not, you can pack the screw holes with toothpicks and white glue, and once dry, redrill and reset the screws. </p>

<p><em>Next things next:</em>  Assuming that the hinges of the doors are properly mortised (set into the wood), that the door has not sagged on its hinges (a different question), and that there is no significant bump in the frame, the best bet is probably to trim down the doors and then properly seal them to prevent moisture absorption.</p>

<p>There is supposed to be a gap between the door and the jamb (the broad moldings that face toward the door opening). This gap should be about the thickness of a nickel (but a good bit larger at the bottom) when the door and framing is at its tightest (in high humidity). Doors and their frames shrink and expand naturally, and sealing (with paint/varnish/poly/etc.) is meant to minimize, but not eliminate this shifting. Once you have a sticking point (assuming the hinges haven't shifted much) you need to re-size the door.</p>

<p>Sanding may be sufficent, but you probably need to take off at least 1/16th and preferably 1/8 to solve the problem long term. In most cases it is worth taking the door down so that you can work flat and exert some pressure. Befor taking it down, mark the tight spots with a pencil line run parallel to, and about 1/8 in from the jamb. Then pull the hinge pins and set the door standing on its hinge edge down. If you need to work near the lockset, you may need to pull the latch bolt and its faceplate, or the whole lockset if it is a mortise lock. Either way, you need to remove the door handles and the spindle. </p>

<p>An orbital finish sander may do it, but this may be too slow. Careful use of a belt sander may be preferable. But careful. A plane or Sureform-like tool can remove a fair amount of stock without much risk of serious gouging.</p>

<p>Check the door regularly by resetting it on its hinges. Be generous with your trimming. It is hard to over-trim and you don't want to be doing this again.</p>

<p><em>Last things last:</em> Once you are certain of the fit, take the door down again and SEAL IT! Prime and paint all expose wood, or stain and topcoat if using clear finish. Let it fully dry. While it is down, check to make sure that both top and bottom of the door are sealed.  This is often the most frequent source of the moisture that causes door to swell.</p>

<p>P.S. I learned these lessons the hard way, having installed several doors on a basement project (read <em>soon to be damp</em>) in winter where the gapping was not quite sufficient and the sealing was less than complete. </p>

"Why do my LED lights flash on cold start?","33551","","<p>Whenever I flip on my dimmer switch, all four dimmable LED lamps flash on in unison, blink off, and then come on at the selected dim level. This happens even with the dimmer slider maxed out, so it's not a matter of trying to drive the lamps with too little power, which I know can cause flashing and flickering.</p>

<p>The flashing happens only on cold start, by which I mean, if I've just turned off the lamps and then flip them back on, they come on directly with no flash. Wait just a few seconds after flipping them off - a bit past the time they take to completely stop emitting light - and they will flash when you flip the switch back on again.</p>

<p>I don't know what could be causing this particular failure mode, so I don't know where to start debugging this problem.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I first noticed this behavior when testing after wiring in the third lamp. When only two were wired in, no flashing was apparent.</p>

<p>Gory details:</p>

<p>I have a <a href=""http://www.lutron.com/PRODUCTS/STANDALONECONTROLS/DIMMERS-SWITCHES/DIVADIMMERSWITCH/Pages/Models.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Lutron Diva CL 3-way dimmer</a>. The ""CL"" designates that it handles CFL and LED dimming.</p>

<p>It's driving 4 Cooper Lighting HALO 4"" LED retrofit kits, <a href=""http://www.cooperindustries.com/content/public/en/lighting/products/recessed_general_purpose_downlighting/led/_4_inch_led_retrofit_module/_706328.html"" rel=""nofollow"">model RL406830WH</a>.</p>

<p>The dimmer's package insert installation instructions state it can handle up to 150 W of CFL/LED load. Each of my LED lamps draws only 13.5 W, so all 4 together draw less than 55 W. This is well within the operating range of the dimmer.</p>

<p>The exact LED lamps I'm using are not listed among the <a href=""http://www.lutron.com/TechnicalDocumentLibrary/3682066_CFL_LED_Bulb_list_Analog_Dimmers.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">""Approved Bulb List for Wall-Mount CL Dimmers""</a>, but several similar models by Cooper Lighting are.</p>

<p><strong>ETA:</strong> I still would like to know why I saw this behavior, but the problem appears to have been the dimmer.</p>

<p>Disconnecting 3 of the 4 lamps showed flash-on-start still.</p>

<p>I swapped the dimmer for a standard S_3 and had no problem.</p>

<p>I then swapped in another instance of the same model. (Though the sticker on the side gave a different hardware rev, and the assembly location was St. Kitt's rather than China.) The new dimmer caused no flash on power-on, but it couldn't dim the LEDs nearly as low as the first instance. Frustrating.</p>
","<p>As I don't know the interns of this dimmer it might switch when the alternating voltage (and therefore the current with resistive loads) crosses zero. To detect the phase (crossing 0V will occur at 0° 180° and 360° which is again 0° - you might want to look it up here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_%28waves%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)</a> ) and the type of load (e.g. inductive loads delay the flow of current depending on their inductance and the frequency in relation to the voltage. I could not find a text on wikipedia describing that so here's a plain image: <a href=""http://people.sinclair.edu/nickreeder/eet155/PageArt/phaseInductor.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.sinclair.edu/nickreeder/eet155/PageArt/phaseInductor.gif</a></p>

<p>To detect the type of load it has to observe the mains line for a short period of time without regulating it.</p>

<p>The issue does not occur on light loads because most dimmers can handle inductive, capacitive and resistive loads quite well on low power levels.</p>

<p>By letting the dimmer ""cool down"" you may erase its short term memory so it has to resynchronize every time you switch it on.</p>

<p>Again: As the internals of this dimmer (or better: the two) are not known I can't provide a better answer. A newer hardware revision usually improves the product. Also chinese manufacturers tend to produce lower quality products as seen here: <a href=""http://hackaday.com/2012/08/15/buying-cheaper-electronics-and-not-saving-money/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackaday.com/2012/08/15/buying-cheaper-electronics-and-not-saving-money/

"Gas stove whines/hums - is this a safety concern?","33493","","<p>I am located in the United States and have a natural gas (not LP) range in my kitchen fed by a natural gas utility.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I turn on my range, the appliance makes a whining or humming noise. This only occurs when gas is actually flowing:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If I adjust the burner on the stove top, the volume of the noise increases and decreases with the flow of natural gas. That is, on setting 2 it is quiet, on 6 it is very loud.</p></li>
<li><p>If I am using the oven, the noise only occurs when the oven burner is actually lit.</p></li>
<li><p>If I am using the broiler, the noise is constantly loud because the broiler burner is always on full blast.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>At no time do I smell natural gas anywhere in my house. I have checked all flexible hose connections on each gas appliance and several black iron connections with soap and it appears there are no leaks.</strong></p></li>

  Which will create a hum, whistle or whining sound. Generically
  referred to as ""noise.""</p>
  
  <p>Burner air ratio to fuel can be adjusted by slightly closing the air

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on your symptom and details the gas pressure regulator is most
  likely causing the whining noise as the gas flow is being regulated.
  Replacing the gas pressure regulator will likely resolve the whining
  noise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It appears my range has no user-serviceable components: I am not able to adjust ""air shutters"" or anything else on this model of range. This leads me to believe the most likely culprit is its gas regulator.</p>

<p>I do not want to replace or fix this range unless there is a reasonable risk that it will leak natural gas or some other issue that could cause damage to my house.</p>

<p><strong>Given the evidence presented in this question, is there an elevated risk of my range malfunctioning in such a way that it will create a risk of fire, explosion, or anything else that might damage my house or its occupants?</strong></p>
","<p>My background is Industrial, Commercial, &amp; Residential combustion &amp; appliances.  I often also consult to Commercial &amp; Residential Cooking Equipment OEMs.  The noise you are most likely hearing is a high-pitched hum, caused by turbulent flow in some pipe fitting.  Most frequently, the source is an undersized or too lengthy flexible pipe fitting.  If you notice, black iron pipes have straight smooth sides.  This does not guarantee laminar flow, but it does greatly reduce internal friction &amp; turbulence (low pressure drops).  This results in quiet &amp; efficient flow.  Many plumbers enjoy the speed &amp; efficiency of flexible tubing to make the final 18"" or so easier to pipe to the appliance.  Flex hoses are flexible by using overlapping corrugated sections.  They cause VERY turbulent flow...but are acceptable under certain conditions...and very quiet when sized and used properly.  There are very specific flow rates assigned to each individual flex line manufacturer's rating.  Exceeding those rates will always cause excessive pressure drop (lower firing rates to you) and usually an improper air-fuel ratio (although not necessarily in atmospheric-type burners)...but they will ALWAYS cause a whine or loud hum.  Increase the flex line size (less than $30 in parts), or try to decrease the length...substituting pipe.  Warning, a burst regulator diaphragm can cause a noise, but the gas odor (caused by the chemical mercaptin) will be evident as it leaks through the regulator vent.  Accumulations (nat gas floats in air) are explosive.  You would easily smell the gas.  LP gases have a 1.5sg (Air is 1 specific gravity) and will drop quickly in air...and also go down drains!  A gas company can easily check for leakage (and should)...however, their meters check in parts per million (ppm).  Gas is only combustible in very defined %.  A room at 100% gas will not support combustion...but do not open the door and introduce oxygen!  Accumulations build to %...and the danger...and exceed the flammibility limit and self-extinguish (not enough oxygen).  Competent gas appliance installers use a method of a soapy water spray (or a specific leak detection soap) brushed onto every joint.  They just look for the bubbles.  It is very accurate to show problems (many OEMs use this approved method to detect leaks).  Any joint can leak in ppm (some pipe dope will outgass and set detectors off), AND be safe AND in full compliance with all standards.  No fitting is leak-tight.  Bottom line, change the flex.  If it is not a code issue in your area...it is a 15-20 minute job by a normal plumber.  Best Wishes.</p>

"Can I keep unused paint in the roller tray?","33477","","<p>I've partway through a multi-weekend project involving turning two free-standing metal shelving units into a fully enclosed workshop-cupboard.

"Why does the circuit breaker for my bedroom continue to trip without any visible event after a power loss?","33433","","<p>The 20A breaker for my bedroom will trip whenever we have a power outage at my house. If you reset it, it will trip again after an interval, say 5~10 seconds. The longer you wait to reset it, the longer it will go before it trips. It generally takes 5-6 hours of waiting before you can reset it and and not have it trip again. What might be causing this? Could it actually be a wiring or electrical problem in my house or is it likely that the breaker is failing?</p>

<p>Things connected to the breaker:</p>

<ol>
<li>Two desk lamps</li>
<li>One overhead lamp</li>
<li>One fan</li>
<li>Two desk clocks/alarm radios</li>
</ol>

<p>Having the lights and fan off does not seem to impact this. </p>

<p>The last time this happened, we contacted our landlord to have an electrician come fix it when we could not get the breaker to stay on. An electrician came out the day after and found nothing wrong and it was working: very unhappy landlord.</p>
","<p>Probably a bad breaker, but the symptoms are also consistent with a mild overload causing the breaker to heat up and trip over time, the longer you let the breaker cool before resetting, the longer it takes for it to heat up and trip again.</p>

<p>I'd leave it turned off until you've ruled out a short in the wiring or other overload condition causing it to trip - if it's a short somewhere, that short is causing a lot of heat somewhere in the walls or other inaccessible place. </p>

<p>It's possible that the wiring is not straightforward and there's a load connected to the breaker that you're not aware of - like maybe the toaster in the kitchen is on the same circuit so be aware of what other appliances in the house may be in use when you experience the trip.</p>

<p>The hard thing about finding a short circuit is that if it's due to, say, a bad connection in a junction box under the floor, it may not short out until you walk near it and make the wires flex enough to touch. If you notice any kind of burning smell associated with the trip, keep the breaker turned off until someone finds the problem.</p>

<p>Some types of breakers are subject to ""nuisance tripping"" even without any overload or wiring problems - if you have an AFCI or GFCI breaker, you could be experiencing nuisance trips due to a device that's plugged in.</p>

<p>If you have 20A service to your bedroom, you're probably in a newer house (15A is more typical, especially in older construction), so a short is less likely than if you're in an older house so the most likely cause of the problem is a bad breaker. Hopefully the landlord had his electrician swap out the breaker since a breaker is relatively cheap compared to having the electrician make another service call.  </p>

<p>The consequences of a short somewhere are severe enough (i.e. a fire in the walls or other inaccessible area) that it's worth ruling out a short before you leave the circuit turned on. If the landlord can't fix it to your satisfaction, hire an electrician of your own and bill it back to the landlord. Even if it's just a bad breaker, the landlord is responsible for wiring problems. </p>

<p>The fact that it stays on after waiting 5-6 hours probably means that it's not a short, but I wouldn't dismiss any repeated circuit breaker trips since the circuit breaker is your only warning about a dangerous short in the wiring.</p>

Silicone caulk has enough give that it is fine for this application.</p>

Unfortunately I think I'll have to go entirely to the outside corner of the wall because the shower curb goes that far and I want to make sure the shower door will have ample room to be installed without having to deal with the outer edge of the tile being right in the middle of the door installation.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of the wall and curb. When I put on the 1/2"" drywall, it should align with how far the curb sticks out.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/O79IT.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ol>
<li>Should I use some kind of corner bead? Are there any special instructions for that since it's near the wet area? Maybe I can treat it as a dry area since it will be on the opposite side of the shower door?</li>
<li>Should I skip the corner bead and instead take the tile all the way to the corner?</li>
<li>Can I have a corner bead and take my tile almost to the corner (about 1/2"" away)?</li>
<li>Does anyone have tips for ending the tile in the 'open' like I am? People have previously suggested using the Schluter edging but I haven't see any that would look good with my tile so I've sort of ruled that out as an option.</li>
</ol>

<p>(Yes I now realize I should have done the floor before setting the bottom row of tile)</p>
","<p>Joe, sorry to use the ""answer"" function again instead of adding another comment, I wanted to attach more pictures.</p>

<p>The tile I used was not available with a bullnose so I finished it flat on the sidewall. The edge cant be seen normally so I did not spend time making it perfect, but for your situation I retract my note about never finishing an edge with caulking. If you end flat to the wall around that corner it would be perfectly fine to use caulking for aesthetic purposes, use paintable caulk so you can paint a straight line down the whole side when you paint the wall.</p>

<p>Sorry I misunderstood your question, my situation was similar to yours and wrapping the tile around to the outside seemed like the best solution for me, and it looks pretty good that way (at least my wife did not complain, that's all that really matters). <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IN7h6.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

"Should I let pressure treated lumber dry before building with it?","33197","","<p>I bought some treated 2x4's from Lowes, and it was fairly wet and heavy.  I went ahead and built a firewood rack, but screwing into it releases a lot of water.  It got me thinking, is it better to let the wood dry out a while before building with it?  </p>

<p>This project is done, but if I was going to use treated wood in the future, should I buy some ahead of time and let is sit outside for a few weeks?</p>
","<p>Unless you have a kiln to dry wood in, drying wood in a standard environment takes a really long time (if you buy firewood, usually you want ~2yr old wood!). I don't know that leaving it out for a couple weeks would dry it if it were so saturated that there is visible water coming out of it.  It is recommended to let wood used for hardwoods sit a couple weeks to get accustomed to the environment as far as humidity goes, but it is not being dried any further.</p>

<p>I would recommend that you find a better source of wood that is dried properly.  You also want to carefully select your wood, it might be that you just got a bad piece some how.</p>

<p>For outdoor projects, instead of PT lumber you might opt to try a wood like cedar which naturally resists the elements pretty well.</p>

","<p>If you want to use a screw I would use <a href=""http://www.concretefasteners.com/anchors-fasteners/tapcon-screw/index.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tapcon® Concrete Screws</a>. They hold very well and are fairly easy to use. The only draw back is that they are a bright blue and you will have to countersink them and caulk or plugged the hole.  3/16 inch will be strong enough, you will want about 1.5"" of penetration. To install you just drill a hole matching the size of the screw (needs to be exact size required) and screw them in.  Using a screw is helpful because its about the only concrete anchor you can easily remove.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yNjMe.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The other option is <a href=""http://www.concretefasteners.com/anchors-fasteners/metal-hit/pricing.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Metal Hit Anchors</a>. These are a nail in a sleeve. you pre drill the hole and hammer the anchor in and the nail expands the sleeve.</p>

<p>On most brick homes anchoring into the brick is going to be stronger.  But it is only shutters and you could get away with drilling into the mortar. This way if you ever want to take the shutters down you can fix the hole in the mortar, unlike if you were to drill directly into the brick.</p>

<p>Is there a preferred or recommended way for which arm, the longer or the shorter, goes on the wall and which under the shelf? </p>
","<p>Put the leg that best matches your shelf width under the shelf. That is why there's different leg sizes. The bracket's critical section is the inner corner, it is equally strong in both directions. That said, usually the critical portion of the entire assembly is the withdrawal of the upper wall screw. Having the long leg against the wall somewhat reduces this force. But if that results in a significant portion of the shelf unsupported, that could weaken the assembly more than the modest gain in withdrawal strength.</p>

<p>The best approach is to fully support the shelf and use wall screws that are long enough to provide plenty of withdrawal strength regardless which leg is against the wall.</p>

"How do I know if my power drill needs to rotate clockwise or counter clockwise to drill forward?","33049","","<p>This maybe a dumb question but I simply want to make sure I got it right because the manual seems to be defective. I already got one of my drill bits ruined.</p>

I'm assuming the manual meant that from the perspective when the drill bit is facing you as shown in the image from the manual. It actually does that. So from my perspective behind the drill it's rotating counterclockwise. As written in the manual, you have to set it to ""R"" if you want to drill forward and ""L"" if you want to reverse drill.</p>

You can make some voltage checks on the lines if you have a meter, to see if there is partial voltage on the outlets that aren't working(bad neutral). You can also check the main box, but realize you are dealing with 240Volts. If you have any 240V dryer outlets you can check those too if you have an AC meter.</p>

<p>Beyond inspecting the main box for anything obvious(loose screw terminals, etc), it is probably time to bite the bullet and call an electrician.

"What is the proper way to run Category 6 underground?","32945","","<p>I'd like to run some Category 6 cabling underground, for a distance of about 120 ft, between a main home and a 2nd unit, for ethernet connectivity between the two homes. I've run Category 5 indoors before, but running Category 6 and underground is a new ballgame for me.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a specific kind of Category 6 cabling I should use? I see a <a href=""http://www.mcmaster.com/#category-6-wire/=disec0"">variety of specifications available here</a>, but to be honest I'm not sure what specifications matter.</li>

<li>I read that Category 6 needs special grounding?</li>
<li>Is there any major benefit to running more than one cable through the same ditch or pipe?</li>
<li>Are there any pitfalls I may not be aware of?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Cat6 is capable of very high speeds (by today's standards; hi 2021!), but only within a bunch of additional constraints over lower-speed cable. </p>

<p>Especially difficult is terminating the cable. When you untwist enough to terminate, it's easy to expose yourself to interference. Some people buy long, pre-terminated Cat6 and pull that, instead of pulling bulk cable, for this very reason. You'll need larger conduit if you take this approach.</p>

<p>Another difficulty is strains during the pull. If you tug hard to get around a corner, you can damage the cable enough to stop top speeds from working. Limiting the number of elbows, wide sweeps, conduit bodies, larger conduit, and having someone push while you pull all help.</p>

<p>You may decide that you don't need 10G speeds. In that case, save the money and pull Cat5e. Since you're running conduit, it's easy to upgrade later if you change your mind. It's a good idea to leave a pull string, but if you forget, just suck a new one through with a shop vac.</p>

<p>If there is any EMF in the same trench, a shielded cable will help. Ground the shielding at both ends. </p>

<p>If you are sure you need maximum speed, consider using fiber. You'd put a fiber-to-ethernet converter on each end. Very long runs and EMF are non-issues. Cost scales well with distance.</p>

<p>To make sure I've covered your questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a specific kind of Category 6 cabling I should use? </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Solid</strong> conductors, since these cables will be immobile. (Stranded is for wires that move often, like from your laptop to the wall.</p>

<p><strong>Shielded</strong> is good for protecting against EMF, especially for long runs or if there is a power cable in the same trench.</p>

<p><strong>Gel-filled</strong> cable protects against water intrusion that could cause corrosion.</p>

<p><strong>Direct Burial</strong> cable has a tough jacket that can tolerate abrasion underground. If you're in conduit this matters less, but you might choose it anyway.</p>

<p><strong>UV</strong>-resistant jacket is important if your wire comes out of the PVC where sunlight can get.</p>

<ul>
<li>Can I simply run the cable through PVC pipe for most of the way?</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, and this is a good idea. Schedule 40 gray is the normal choice around here.</p>

<ul>
<li>I read that Category 6 needs special grounding?</li>
</ul>

<p>I dunno about that. </p>

<ul>
<li>Is there any major benefit to running more than one cable through the same ditch or pipe?</li>
</ul>

<p>You can run multiple low-voltage cables through the same conduit if you want, but don't put power cable in the same conduit as low-voltage. Use a large enough conduit that you can pull additional cables later.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there any pitfalls I may not be aware of?</li>
</ul>

<p>Many, but I can't think of any more.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Since power will be in the same trench, I recommend staking the conduits to their respective sides before filling, to make sure they keep a good foot space between them. I wish I had known to do that!</p>

<p>For future-proofing, consider installing an additional conduit. A contractor friend likes to install an extra 4"" conduit, which can be used for a lot of stuff. Other people think he's nuts. I think they're both right. :-)</p>

"Is 20 feet too long to run bathroom fan duct for 100cfm fan?","32785","","<p>I need to run about 20 feet of duct to reach the gable, I don't want to go through the roof unless I absolutely need to, I live in Vermont and we can get a lot of snow build up on the roof, I also would prefer not to go through the eaves. Is this too long a run?</p>
","<p>This will completely depend on the number of elbows, the size of the room being ventilated, and the power of the fan.</p>

<p>In general for a bathroom, you'll be looking to have an Air Change per Hour (ACH) of 8. To accomplish this, you'll have to select a fan based on the size of the bathroom, and the equivalent duct length.</p>

<h1>Bath room size</h1>

<p>The first thing you'll have to figure, is the size of the bathroom.  For this, simply multiply <code>Length (ft.) * Width (ft.)* Height (ft.)</code>. This will give you the size of the room in cubic feet.</p>

<h3><em>Example:</em></h3>

<p>Given a room that is 10 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 8 feet tall.</p>

<p><code>Volume = Length * Width * Height</code><br>
<code>Volume = 10 ft. * 8 ft. * 8ft.</code><br>
<code>Volume = 10 * 64</code><br>
<code>Volume = 640 cu. ft.</code></p>

<h1>Equivalent Duct Length</h1>

<p>To calculate the equivalent duct length, you'll have to consider not only the length of the duct. You'll also have to know the duct construction, and number of elbows. The basic rules that apply to both 3"" and 4"" duct, are as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li>Measure the length of straight duct. </li>
<li>If the duct is flexible aluminium, multiply the length by 1.25.</li>
<li>OR If the duct is flexible insulated, multiply by 1.5.</li>
<li>For each elbow, add 15 feet.</li>
<li>For each terminal (wall cap, roof jack), add 30 feet.</li>
</ol>

<h3><em>Example:</em></h3>

<p>Given this duct:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zNPKSm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>There is 10' of straight smooth walled duct. Plus 2 elbows, and one terminal at the end.</p>

<p><code>EDL = 10' + (2 * 15') + (1 * 30')</code><br>
<code>EDL = 10' + 30' + 30'</code><br>
<code>EDL = 10' + 60'</code><br>
<code>EDL = 70'</code></p>

<h1>Determine the proper sized fan</h1>

<p>Once you've got all the information, it's time to select an appropriately sized fan.  To do this, you can use a chart like this</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/y5fTj.png"" alt=""Bathroom Fan Sizing Chart""></p>

<p>Using this chart, you'll find that for a 640 cu. ft. bathroom and 70 ft. of duct (equivalent length), you'll need a 110 cfm fan to achive the recommended 8 air changes per hour.</p>

<p>There is an attic above the bedroom and there is insulation with paper backing in place. The attic area seems far more likely to get moisture as the bathrooms both vent directly in to the attic and not out through a vent.  I'll address that issue eventually.</p>

<p>So my question is, should I install a 4mil moisture barrier on the ceiling, or omit that from the ceiling?</p>
","<p>I completely disagree with BMitch here. If you live in an area with sustained freezing temperatures, you should have a plastic vapor barrier between the drywall and the studs, wherever ""warm meets cold"" (exterior walls, top floor ceiling). You want this vapor barrier inside your insulation so the barrier is toward the ""warm"" side of the thermal break provided by the barrier, thus reducing the amount of condensation that forms on it.</p>

<p>Paper, like the backing of your insulation rolls, is NOT a vapor barrier. Neither is the insulation itself, even though its purpose is to ""trap"" a bubble of air and thus provide a buffer between warm and cold. Neither of these are continuous; the insulation is cut to fit inside the studs, and so air and thus moisture can still get around the paper. Moisture also soaks into paper. 6-mil plastic vapor barrier, installed properly, has no way through it; it's sealed against the studs so the drywall screws don't break the barrier, and all J-boxes are sealed with Tuck Tape or similar vapor-proof adhesion.</p>

<p>As for mold concerns, there shouldn't be any, even on the back side of the wall. Because the area behind the vapor barrier can still breathe, even with the insulation, there is little chance of there being enough water in the wall to damage the studs or cause mold to form on them. The big concern is the drywall, which is a sponge for any condensation that may form on it. It will trap this water and hold it for a long time, which along with the processed wood product (paper) on its skin, is a definite attraction for mold.</p>

<p>Is there some pourable product I can use to replace these joints?  Should I just grout them now with additional concrete?</p>
","<p>I have been caulking expansion joints in concrete for 15 years.
This is what you do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get the wood out</li>
<li>Clean the top 3/4"" of the interior walls of the joint with a wire brush </li>
<li>Install ""closed cell"" backer rod into the joint. You want it to be about 1/8""-1/4"" larger than the joint. Roll it down in from the side is easiest. The top of the rod should be about 3/4"" below the top of the concrete. </li>
<li>Blow the crack out with a leaf blower. (the backer rod should fit tight enough to stay in place as long as you dont blast it head on)</li>
<li>Use professional grade urethane or silicone caulk for concrete. The best thing is probably Dow 888 silicone but its very expensive. Urethanes are cheaper and almost as good. Sika brand Sikaflex 1a or Sonneborn brand NP1 are great</li>
<li>Caulk depth in the center of the joint should be 1/2 the width of the joint but no deeper than 1/2"". People are tempted to think deeper is better but it will cause bubbling and premature failure. If it is too thick it will not stretch easily and therefore pull away from the concrete. </li>
<li>Tooling the caulk is necessary. It will force the caulk into the pores of the concrete and it will smooth out lumpiness. Use a metal or rubber spatula or a tablespoon. </li>
<li>Self levelling urethanes are available but the have the consistency of pancake batter so your joints have to be pretty level to use it. You'll also have to dam up the ends of your joints. Plus you will have to be on the lookout for rain, bugs, and blowing leaves for a couple of hours after you finish. </li>
<li>2x4s are a lousy choice for expansion joint because they are so wide. You are going to use a lot of caulk.</li>

<p><strong>What type of wire should I run from the wall switch to the celling box to support the new fan's blue wire?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What type of wall switch should I install to control the fan and light independently?</strong></p>
","<p>The type of wire you use depends on what kind of circuit you are attaching to.  Go to your electrical box, find the circuit for the current light switch, and read what it is rated for (probably 15 or 20 amps).  If it is 15 then you use 14-3 wire.  If it is 20 then you need 12-3 wire.  The ""3"" will give you an extra red wire and that will be used to separate your fan and light controls.  If you feel that you will have additional electrical work down the road I suggest buying in the 250 feet spools.  Wire goes quickly and the smaller samples are pretty costly.  You might pay almost half for 25 feet what 250 would cost you.</p>

","<p>We have had CFL's in a number of enclosed fixtures for years now.  They generate comparable light for much less heat.

What do you suggest?</p>
","<p>In the main panel, ground and neutral are connected, so you're free to attach to whichever bar is most convenient. There are two bars because if it was used as a subpanel ground and neutral would have to be kept separated.</p>

<p>The main breaker will cut power to the bus bars and breakers, but the lugs and feeder cables near the top of the panel will still be hot. Shouldn't be too hard to avoid those since the top slots are most likely full anyway and you'll be coming up from the bottom, just pay attention.</p>

Let's suppose (i.e. I'm making this up in the hope that someone will correct me) that the tank should be half full of air and half full of water.  If I just open the tank's faucet, some water will drain out (let's say one bucket), but I think I need to ensure that I get a bucket full of air to go back in the tank.  I don't want to just decrease the pressure of the air bubble that's in there.</p>

<p>Or, do I keep the faucet open and drain several buckets?  Will the water stop coming eventually, or will I just be draining water from the closed water circulation system?</p>
","<ol>
<li>Turn off the valve that auto-fills the system from your cold water line</li>
<li>If you have one, open a valve or bleeder on the top of your expansion tank.  If you can't do this, it will still work, the water will just gurgle and drain slowly</li>
<li>Open a drain valve and drain a suitable amount of water</li>
<li>Close drain valve and re-open valve you closed in step 1</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Amount of water to leave in tank</em>:  If the system is cold, I would leave the tank close to empty, that maximizes expansion space.  If it's warm or hot, I'd go for about halfway.  You can tell where the water is by feeling the temperature of various spots on the tank and the pipe that feeds the tank.</p>

"Best practice for oily rag safety?","32650","","<p>Most everyone's heard about piles of oily/greasy rags igniting.  Linseed oil seems to be a popular culprit for it, but I've also recently heard claims of common automotive oil being involved.  I've run across a couple recommendations, but I have no idea if there are any better ways to handle them.  Also wondering if there's a certain threshold as to quantity of material required for them to ignite.  Is it a problem just with natural oils, or are synthetics also involved?</p>

<p>Recommendations I'm aware of include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Seal rags in side a metal bucket (with lid).</li>
<li>Allow rags to dry (spread out), then throw out normally.</li>
</ul>

<p>The metal bucket sounds good, but what happens when you have to transfer them into a trash bag?  Spreading them out to dry seems unproductive, especially with synthetic auto oil which never seems to dry.</p>

<p>I've experimented with putting a pile of synthetic auto oil soaked rags in a plastic bag (worst case scenario based on my reading) and not only did they NOT catch on fire, but there was no detectable increase in temperature.  I've seen so much conjecture on this important topic, hopefully there are people on hear that can bring some science to bear on the problem!  :-)</p>
","<p>The trouble with linseed oil, especially boiled linseed oil, is that it generates heat as it dries. If you leave BLO-soaked rags in a pile, the drying process proceeds but heat is trapped. The drying process accelerates as the rags warm up, and the temperature rises to the point of ignition. Spreading the rags out lets the heat escape so that the drying process can proceed safely. I've heard of people just spreading the rags out on their shop floor without problem, but I'd suggest putting them outside just to be safe.</p>

<p>I don't know if the risk of spontaneous combustion is as high with motor oil, but whether it is or not the fact remains that oily rags are highly combustible and should be handled with care. It's worth putting them in an <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001DSKBXE"">appropriate container</a> to prevent sources of ignition from reaching the rags, to limit the oxygen that reaches the rags, and to contain a fire should one occur.</p>

"Is there any harm in using shorter shelf brackets with a deeper shelf?","32534","","<p>I'm planning on installing Ikea shelves mounted on wall brackets (using the <a href=""http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S29884397/"" rel=""nofollow"">Antonius system</a>).

The only things I can think of are a reduced carrying capacity for the bracket and since the out edge of the shelf is not supported, it might be break.

","<p>A wooden shelf that is cantilevered 3 inches or so out from the end of a bracket will probably survive some load. But stack too much of a load on it (a pantry, canned food is heavy!) and even wood will crack. Particle board is very likely to fail of course as it has very little real strength.</p>

<p>A shorter bracket will often be designed for a smaller load. (Long brackets may be wider at the base, to support a larger load. They may be more robust to prevent buckling.) The issue is not just will it support the entire width of the board, but is the bracket adequate to support a greater load since a wide shelf will have more items stored on it. Those extra items stored are hanging a significant distance away from the wall.</p>

","<p>Lightning strikes can cause damage to many items in a house. The most suspectable items are GFI outlets, any electronic machines ( TV, computers, audio equipment etc.), dimmers, switches and elements of an electric range/oven, and yes, garage door openers.</p>

<p>Another area to check is to unplug any device plugged into a receptacle and inspect the metal plug prongs for any signs of burns. If you find dark pits, any melted metal etc, then the plug and outlet should be replaced. </p>

<p>Using an inexpensive outlet checker, check all outlets for malfunctions such as open grounds, neutrals etc. Open the circuit breaker box and do a visual check for any signs of arcing or burned wires.</p>

<p>Just a side note. Lightning rod systems are somewhat effective for direct hits, however in the large percentage of lightning damage cases, the surge of ultra high voltage enters the home via the grounding system of the house. Lightning strikes a tree, a transformer or the ground close to the house and energizes the entire ground and neutral system and conductors. The instantaneous voltage spike can easily exceed 50,000 volts. there is little you can do to defend your property from such a strike. Common surge protectors will fail most of the time.

"When should HVAC returns be opened and closed?","32241","","<p>My Pennsylvania house was built in the early 90s, has central heat (natural gas) and central A/C, and most rooms have pairs of closable air returns on the wall near the floor and ceiling. </p>

<p>I've been searching for guidance on whether and when any of the returns should be closed, but I've found lots of conflicting and unsourced answers. Some say that the upper returns should be closed when the heat is running (to circulate out the cold air), and the lower returns should be closed when the A/C is running (to circulate out the warm air). Others say that they should always be open (so the HVAC unit doesn't have trouble pulling in air).</p>

<p>If and when should any of the returns be closed? Some explanations as to ""why"" and/or links to reliable sources would be appreciated.</p>
","<p>All are true! Generic questions receive generic answers. The advice about closing the upper or lower with heat or cool respectively follows physics of ""hot air rise"" so sucking up the hot air you just produced isn't very efficient. On the other hand, you don't want to block an intake if it would put additional load on your fan and isn't allowing the amount of air the handler is expecting as they are engineered to a spec to try and optimized HVAC and/or energy performance. But you have two returns and they are designed to be able to shut, so why would they do that. The vent may have been installed because they were cheaper/on-hand, because they looked better, or actually because they were intended to be shut. They also could have been installed correctly and to spec of the air handler but then the air handler was replaced. With so many variables (generic question) you will hear a lot of different answers and most people with lean on the side of caution.</p>

<p>So how to determine what is right for your situation, I've had a few scenarios where people want to place a table or open entertainment center near or in front of their return so I'm going to give you the same advice. Limiting the handler is bad; however, short term is negligible so we'll perform a before and after test. First I inspect the handler to make sure the fan blades are clean. Try and find the vent furthest away from the handler and tape a piece of light cardboard/posterboard or paper to the top; create a hinge, tape on top with paper covering vent. Without any obstruction, both returns open, turn the fan on and see how far the board/paper moves; repeat with a return closed. On a house I typically only check one vent but you can check more. Typically when there is a problem it is extremely noticeable so I'm not breaking out rulers to measure the distance.</p>

<p>If you have the one return closed and your handler is running longer or more frequent that is also a sign that you either need service, possibly just a new filter, or that you don't have enough air flow anymore.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5OsFG.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>It is possible that there are several reasons for the screw head destruction.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You may be using an electrical tool that is not at all suitable for driving screws. Some tools designed for drilling holes are not going to offer enough torque at a low enough speed to properly drive screws. If your tool starts out with a huge burst of speed it can almost certainly lead to immediate stripping of the screw head.</p></li>
<li><p>You are using the wrong size driver bit for the type of screw that you have. If the screws are Philips head be aware that there are multiple sizes of drivers such as #1, #2 or #3.</p></li>
<li><p>You may attempting to use the wrong style of driver with the type of slot the screw. Do not mismatch the likes of Philips and Pozidrive. There may be other specialty type slots that are also similar but require the proper drive bit selection.</p></li>
<li><p>It may be that you are not properly aligned with the axis of the screw. Proper installation of screws with a driver requires that the driver be directly in line with the axis of the screw.</p></li>
<li><p>When driving screws with a power driver is in necessary to apply a pressure on the driver to properly keep the driver bit in the screw slot. Without proper pressure the bit can run out of the slot and strip the screw head.</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible that you did not properly prepare the medium into which you are trying to drive the screws. With many screws you will need a pilot hole in the area where the threads are to engage with the medium. If you are attaching another piece to the base medium you would want to provide a screw body clearance hole to the mounted piece. This can actually result in a stronger screw joint as well.</p></li>

<p>I've been interested in running a really fast hard-line network for a while, but the main deterrent has been installing the CAT-6 cable in the walls and installing face plates for outlets. I'm trying to understand exactly what would be required for my current setup.</p>

<p>It's a one-story apartment, not sure on the square footage, but I'd definitely do almost all of the cable through the wall. </p>

<p>How do I pass the cable through studs? Do I have to cut away at the drywall and drill a hole through each stud I want to pass through? Also, how much drywall will I have to cut away and patch? Will it be every stud? Is there a ""from-scratch"" guide available to instruct on how to do this? </p>
","<p>I did this yesterday, so it's fresh on my mind. :)</p>

<p>First, for your wires and whatnot, I highly recommend monoprice.com. Excellent products, and very affordable. I also found an excellent, power-saving 8-port 1Gbps switch on Amazon.</p>

<p>In a best-case scenario, you'd want to run the wires across the attic/crawlspace and then down/up into the walls. If there's any way to access over your head or below your feet, that's the way to go. In that case, interior walls are easy to get to, just aim right when drilling down! This is by far the best solution, since the only drywall disturbed is where you install the jack.</p>

<p>But as for exterior walls--forget about ceiling access, the combination of tight working spaces, insulation, etc. will make it impractical to do without opening the drywall and running across the wall. And in most cases, floor access will be just as hard.</p>

<p>For that scenario (across the wall), you'd need to open a small section of drywall (perhaps 3""x8"" across each stud, and use a drill with a LONG bit to get through the studs at an angle. Then, like a ceiling-down or crawlspace-up installation, use a fish tape to pull the wire through.</p>

<p>You'll need about a 5/8"" hole or so through the studs to get a CAT6 cable <em>with</em> the RJ-45 end on it through the hole. You can go a lot smaller for just the wire, but I recommend buying cables with the RJ-45 connector molded on--proper punch-down for CAT6 leaves a lot less room for error than 5 or 5e, and MonoPrice and others sell an excellent Keystone-style coupler so the wall-plate still has an RJ-45 jack, not a wire coming out of the wall.</p>

<p>Another option for across-the-wall installation is to run the wiring behind the shoe molding or the baseboards. Then, your run up to the jack can either be behind the wall (a short run that you should be able to fish relatively easily) or just up the wall (home improvement stores have cable channels to help tidy this up).</p>

<p>A third option for exterior walls is to run it in conduit on the outside of the home. Aesthetically, this is the worst option, but if the conduit is hidden by bushes or something where you need to go through the wall, it may be a viable option.</p>

<p>For jacks, I recommend a Keystone-type system combined with a low-voltage (orange and backless at Home Depot) old-construction electrical box. This combination offers the best flexibility for the future and easiest cable management (making the turns) inside the wall.</p>

<p>If you have thick plaster walls or shiplap behind drywall (common in older homes), skip the low-voltage box, you'll need deep, blue plastic boxes for old construction, and replace the screws that hold the wings with longer versions of the same, since those screws are only long enough for 5/8"" drywall.</p>

<p>Other tips:</p>

<p>Always run two wires. One for what you're doing right now, and another (just a strong, loose wire without connectors) so you can pull something else through in the future easily without opening up the walls again.</p>

<p>Be generous with taping. It's always easier to remove electrical tape that is holding your fish tape to the wire you're pulling than it is to try to retrieve said wire if it come detached from the fish tape during the pull.</p>

","<p>On second review of the photos, I don't think that the corrosion is due to electrolysis. The dielectric nipples should be adequate to prevent that and there is no sign of issues with the hot connection. As for the T&amp;P connection, if the copper drain pipe does not come into contact with anything then there is no closed circuit for electrolysis to take place.</p>

<p>It looks more like corrosion due to a small leak over a long period of time. A leak that would not have always been noticeable, but would slowly get worse over time. You can see where the water has been dripping and there is signs of calcium buildup.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned in a previous comment, I would inspect the sacrificial anode rod and replace it if needed. As for the cold connection, you could:</p>

<ul>
<li>cut the copper line and unscrew the copper section from the nipple</li>
<li>brush the nipple with a steel wire brush to remove the buildup</li>
<li>reinstall the copper section using teflon tape and a joint compound on the nipple</li>
<li>reconnect the copper line that you cut with a shark bite coupling or
a solder coupling if you know how</li>
</ul>

<p>You could do the same with the T&amp;P connection, just cut the vertical down pipe so that you can remove the copper pipe from the T&amp;P and then remove the T&amp;P, clean and reinstall.</p>

"Workarounds for single-zone HVAC? Second thermostat? Adjust vents?","32127","","<p>I have a two story brick home built in 1970 with a relatively new HVAC system blowing through original ductwork.

<p>Are there any vent opening/closing tricks I can try?</p>
","<p>There are a few things you can do which can help:</p>

<p>1) Adjust the dampers in the duct work. Partially close dampers in the ducts going to the first floor and fully open the ones to the second. Take some time to mark them so you know what goes where. It will probably take a few tries to get them set right. That's usually the first thing an HVAC guy will do for this situation.</p>

<p>2) Seal off the leaks in your duct work. Go around and find leaks and seal them with the aluminum backed tape. It's real sticky and has a peal off backing. Oddly enough, duct tape always seems to come loose on my duct work. Go figure. There are services which will come out and blow a smokey substance through your system to locate leaks and seal them.</p>

<p>3) This can be controversial, but you could cover your low returns in the summer and high returns in the winter. The theory is that this will pull more warm air out in the summer and more cold air out in the winter. There are magnetic covers you can get for this purpose like this: </p>

<li>We would like to install some kind of flooring (I am hoping for hardwood as adding hardwood to the whole house is my next major project for the house)</li>
<li>I suppose we need to add some sort of drop ceiling, but I am not sure.</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is compound. First of all, is there any major pitfall to doing this project incrementally that I may not have thought of? The second part is which order would be best for tackling these projects. Lastly, Which parts of this project should I (as a not terribly handy person) attempt to take on by myself in order to maximize my savings while taking on the least risk of screwing the job up? Thanks for the help!</p>
","<p>First, handle drainage. If you want to install a sump pump, perimeter drain, or water proof the walls, now is the time to do that. You should also install any plumbing drain lines at this point.</p>

<p>Next, framing. Concrete transmits moisture, so use pressure treated, and a styrofoam underlay that would normally go under the sill plate, to keep the walls dry. With pressure treated wood, you need galvanized nails to avoid a chemical reaction that would eat a normal nail. Make sure the framing is designed for the drywall (16"" OC studs, nailing edge in the corners and around the ceiling perimeter). And make sure the walls are positioned/sized for any plumbing or other utility lines. For exterior walls, the thicker the wall (2x6 instead of 2x4) the more insulation you can include.</p>

<p>At this point, utilities go in, including plumbing, electrical, hvac, and communications. I'm a strong believer in conduit for running communications lines (like ethernet, catv, and phone) so that you can upgrade those without opening the walls or running wires all over the floor. Note that with more outlets, you will need more circuits, and copper isn't cheap.</p>

<p>Insulation is done after all the utilities are finished. If you have water proofed the walls, then I don't have much against the standard fiberglass insulation. Actually, I like fiberglass because it's easy to work with as a DIYer, relatively cheap, and replacing a piece or temporarily moving it (e.g. in the attic) is simple. However, with moisture concerns, or if you live in a northern climate with harsh winters, then I'd favor the spray foam. The spray foam has the downside of being difficult (impossible?) to remove, but it functions as a vapor barrier and leaves no cracks that air can get around.</p>

<p>After this, you have drywall, paint, doors and trim, and touch-up paint. I like to paint the walls and trim separately so there's less work on edging.</p>

<p>As for the flooring, you would usually do this before or after the trim. With hardwood, you would often do the flooring first, and then the trim goes up tight against it. With carpeting, you would install your trim 1/2"" above the floor and the carpet installers would install the carpet right under that.</p>

"Do any ultra quiet ceiling fans that have no motor hum exist?","32076","","<p>I am in the market to buy two large ceiling fans to cycle air within and potentially cool my master bedroom. The room is about 16x27 feet, and it gets pretty hot during spring, summer, and early fall. I have wired both mounts into the ceiling, and tried out a single 52"" Harbor Breeze fan in one of them. The fan produced a very audible motor hum, similar to that described in <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/6086/humming-ceiling-fans"">this question</a>, however strait off of my native power. Cranking the fan up to high speed would drown out the sound of the hum, but then I have the fan noise itself to deal with. I've had an electrician come out and check the wiring, and everything is solid according to him. </p>

<p>From a wiring standpoint, I used a Harbor Breeze remote control with the fan, which was nicely designed to fit within and work perfectly with the Harbor Breeze fan itself. Wiring the remote control receiver was a no brainer...every connection was color coded. I did notice, however, that the wires from the fan itself were solid core, where as the wires from the remote receiver were stranded aluminum. I am not sure if this might cause a problem, and introduce motor hum? Having a remote is important (see background below for why.)</p>

<p>I did some searching, and there seem to be a variety of complaints about Harbor Breeze fans and motor hum (and an even broader search indicates that motor hum is not an infrequent problem.) Do ceiling fans of high enough quality, with large enough motors to run the fan silently, actually exist? Is it possible to get a ceiling fan that works with a remote without motor hum?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Background</strong>  </p>

<p>I have severe sleep issues, one of them being high sensitivity to noise. When its hot, I have even more trouble sleeping, and I expend a considerable amount of money running my air conditioner to keep my home cool during the summer. I am close to desperate to find a way to cool my room without the need to run my air conditioner as much, and ceiling fans seem to be the ideal solution. I've lived in apartments in the past that had truly silent ceiling fans, and I was able to sleep well with them. I'm largely just lacking information and knowledge about what brands I should be looking at, what price point I should be looking at (I think I spent about $200 on the one 52"" Harbor Breeze before, from Lowes, but I'm willing to spend twice that or more per fan if it gets me a quiet one without motor hum.)</p>

<p>Given my sleeping issues, I need to be able to turn the fan on or off without getting out of bed. Generally speaking, if I get up once I've finally started to fall asleep, my night is over...I don't sleep at all. I used a remote with the Harbor Breeze, however I think that may have made the motor hum worse...as the wiring of the receiver was really cheap. Are there any known high quality remote receivers that use proper wiring and support the right kind of electric load for a large ceiling fan?</p>
","<p>You might look into ceiling fans with DC motors.  While I have not seen a manufacturer talk about <a href=""http://www.ceilingfan.org/top-10-energy-star-ceiling-fans/"">quietness</a>, some reviews I've read talk about quietness.  The biggest attraction to DC motors is the efficiency of the motors, getting more air movement with less power.</p>

<p>My suggestion would be find a local fan / light showroom that has some of these on display that you can try. </p>

<p>Also, fan speed controls have a lot to do with the fan noise.  A fully variable wallbox style speed control can cause motor noise, but the fan speed controls that have preset ""clicks"" that you feel when adjusting are made for quiet operation.  I don't know if the remote set you got was matched by the manufacturer or just off the shelf, but that could make a difference.</p>

<p>You also have to remember that some people leave their fans on for a ""white noise"" effect, which helps them (me) sleep.  My wife insists that we keep a floor fan on for the noise.  Because of this, when it comes to trouble shooting a loud motor then you might not get as much help as you think you would get.</p>

<p>Again, try a fan specialty shop.  The salespeople will know which are quieter and should know more about them than a box store.</p>

"How should I evaluate my central A/C to see if it's working properly?","32045","","<p>I was once told by a service tech that they evaluate how well the system is performing based on temperature difference between the the return and supply sides.  On our first really warm day (80 &deg;F+), I measured the temperature in the supply duct at about 50 &deg;F; at the time, the interior temp was about 78 &deg;F, so the temperature drop was about 28 &deg;F; the air coming off the compressor was about 105 &deg;F.  Measurements were taken with an instant read thermometer, waiting for the reading to stabilize.</p>

<p>I don't have reason to believe that the system is not working correctly, but if it's moving toward needing servicing, I'd rather know sooner than later.</p>
","<p>When the person you spoke to said to measure the ""<em>temperature difference between the return and supply sides</em>"". What they were talking about, is what's known as Delta T (of the evaporator).  It sounds like you took the first measurement in the proper place (or close to it), but not the second measurement.  The ""<em>supply side</em>"" refers to the air just after it passes through the evaporator, while ""<em>the return</em>"" is referring to the air going in to the evaporator.</p>

<p>You could also measure the Delta T of the condenser, but I'm not sure how useful that is. Simply measure the ambient air around the condensing unit, then measure the temperature of the air exiting the condensing unit.  The difference in these values is the Delta T of the condenser.</p>

<p>There are three values HVAC technicians typically use to evaluate a system. Superheat, subcooling, and the Delta T (of the evaporator). </p>

<h1>Superheat</h1>

<p>This is the number of degrees a vapor is above its saturation temperature (boiling point), at a particular pressure.</p>

<h2>Calculate Superheat</h2>

<p>To determine the superheat of a system:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using a gauge, measure the pressure on the low side (suction) line.</li>
<li>Using a chart for the type of refrigerant, convert pressure to temperature [Saturation Temperature].</li>
<li>Using a thermometer, measure the temperature of the low side (suction) line [Line Temperature].</li>
<li>Calculate superheat <code>[Line Temperature] - [Saturation Temperature]</code></li>
</ol>

<p>At 75&deg;F - 85&deg;F ambient temperature, superheat should be 12-15&deg;. Above 85&deg;F ambient, superheat should be 8-12&deg;. <strong><em>Check manufacturer documentation for recommended superheat values.</em></strong></p>

<h3>Superheat too high</h3>

<p>If superheat is too high, it means that not enough coolant is entering the evaporator. This leads to poor refrigeration, and wasted energy.</p>

<h3>Superheat too low</h3>

<p>If superheat is too low, it means the evaporator is being flooded with coolant. This could lead to liquid refrigerant getting back to the compressor, which can be really bad.</p>

<h1>Subcooling</h1>

<p>This is when the liquid refrigerant is colder than the minimum temperature required to keep it from boiling.</p>

<h2>Calculate Subcooling</h2>

<p>To determine the subcooling of a system:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using a gauge, measure the pressure on the high side (liquid) line.</li>
<li>Using a chart for the type of refrigerant, convert pressure to temperature [Saturation Temperature].</li>
<li>Using a thermometer, measure the temperature of the high side (liquid) line [Line Temperature].</li>
<li>Calculate subcooling <code>[Saturation Temperature] - [Line Temperature]</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Subcooling should typically be around 12-15&deg;. <strong><em>Check manufacturers documentation for recommended subcooling.</em></strong></p>

<h3>Subcooling too high</h3>

<p>If subcooling is too high, it means the condenser is flooded. This could lead to the compressor working too hard, and possibly being flooded with liquid refrigerant (which is really bad).</p>

<h3>Subcooling too low</h3>

<p>If subcooling is too low, the refrigerant can ""flash"" or boil before it reaches the evaporator. This will lead to the metering device not being able to properly meter the refrigerant, which leads to poor refrigeration.</p>

<h1>Delta T</h1>

<p>Knowing the change in temperature of the air moving through the evaporator can also be useful.</p>

<h2>Calculate Delta T</h2>

<p>To determine Delta T:</p>

<ol>
<li>Measure the plenum air temperature about 12"" from the evaporator.</li>
<li>Measure the return air temperature close to the unit.</li>
<li>Take the difference.</li>
</ol>

<p>Typically, Delta T should be 15-18&deg;F. <strong><em>Check manufacturers documentation for recommended Delta T range.</em></strong></p>

<h3>Delta T too low</h3>

<p>This is usually caused by return air bypassing the coil. Make sure the evaporator is properly sealed to the unit. It can also be a symptom of low refrigerant, bad compressor valves, or a leaking reversing valve.</p>

<h3>Delta T too high</h3>

<p>This is commonly caused by low air flow across the coil. Make sure the filter is clean, and the fan is set to the proper speed (on multi-speed units).</p>

<h1>Diagnosis using superheat and subcooling</h1>

<p>Knowing only superheat, or subcooling is not enough. To figure out what's going on, you'll have to use both values.</p>

<h3>High Superheat, Low Subcooling</h3>

<p>This usually means the system is undercharged. </p>

<h3>High Superheat, High Subcooling</h3>

<p>This likely means there is a blockage in the system.</p>

<h3>Low Superheat, High Subcooling</h3>

<p>This usually means the system is overcharged.</p>

<h3>Low Superheat, Low Subcooling</h3>

<p>This usually means too much liquid is being fed to the evaporator. Likely a problem with the metering device.</p>

<p><strong><em>All values are based on my current R22 system. Values may vary from system to system, always check manufacturer documentation.</em></strong> </p>

"Is ""don't mix data and power cables"" and ""don't loop power cables"" still valid nowadays?","32013","","<p>There are two sayings I keep hearing when talking about wiring e.g. home cinema or computer hardware;</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't wrap data/network cables and power cables up in the same loop because the power cables will mess up the streams of your data cables</li>
<li>Don't loop power cables because it can produce an induction effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm interested in whether these two theses are still valid with the current coating and shielding of modern day data/network and power cables.</p>

<p>So, when I wire my home cinema and the power cables lie next to the data cables, will that cause any effect on the quality of video/audio I am likely to perceive?</p>

<p>And is wrapping three or four meters of power cables in a coil actually in any way dangerous, seeing how thick the coating and shielding is on them?</p>

<p>How else should you manage the power cables that are too long to just let them lie around? Maybe a different wrapping/looping technique?</p>
","<p>Yes, its still valid.</p>

<p>Power and data cable coatings are insulation - designed to protect from electric shock and to avoid short circuits.  They do not interfere with magnetic fields.</p>

<p>I do not know what kind of shielding you are talking about - I have never seen any modern power or data cables with shielding that blocks magnetic fields.  Magnetic fields are quite pervasive.</p>

<p>In response to your follow up question:</p>

<p>The size and strength of a magnetic field is relative to the amount of current flowing through the wire within.  For very low voltage wires, like network cables, bundling them together generally doesn't create a strong enough field to disturb the other lines in the bundle.</p>

<p>However, if you loop the cables, you end up running the same current through very nearly the same space - over, and over, and over - and this can amplify the magnetic field that's created, enough that it can interfere with other signals.</p>

<p>With power cables, they run much more current and so create much bigger fields.  Big and strong enough to interfere with the tiny currents going thru the other cables.  Looping them is even stronger and more problematic.</p>

"How do I fix laminate flooring that's begun to rise in the middle?","31986","","<p>We have laminate flooring in our kitchen/lounge and over the winter (which are cold and damp here in New Zealand) the flooring has begun to rise up in a couple of places. It was fitted by the previous owner and it appeared that they had left enough gap around the edge for expansion, but it turns out they didn't. Is there a solution to fix this without having to take most of it up and shorten/reshape a lot of bits?</p>

<p>One option we've had suggested is to get a dehumidifier in there to take the moisture out, but that doesn't seem like a long-term fix!</p>
","<p>Depending on the layout, you might be able to fix this without taking up any of the flooring.  Here in the US at least, laminate flooring is usually installed in a floating manner, where the individual laminate boards are not attached to the subfloor at all and the entire floor is free to expand and contract (assuming it's not bound up at the edges).  The expansion gap around the perimeter of the room is hidden under a baseboard and some variety of quarter-round or shoe molding.</p>

<p>If your floor is buckling because its expansion gap isn't big enough, you should be able to remove that shoe molding and baseboard and cut the edges to increase the gap without pulling up the flooring.

I have personally tried to repaint over oil stains totally wasted my time, noticing the same oil coming through a few days later on new paint job.

<p>Or am I too paranoid that nails won't have enough holding power? I'd prefer the cheapest option that's still going to be effective.</p>
","<p>There is absolutely no reason to use nails in this day and age. I urge you to use 1 5/8"" drywall screws.  There are several reasons.  Screws have much better holding power, they are actually faster to install, and they can be slightly counter sunk during installation to make mudding a lot easier ( especially with a drywall screw gun or a decent drywall bit that can be used in any drill).  Nails can loosen with age and ""pop"" out through the mud coat, cracking your paint.  The difference in price is negligible, but the difference in performance is massive. Drywall finish is the end result of a room project, the surface you will see for a very long time, don't cheat yourself.  Do it well, use screws and a good gun or bit.  Good Luck. </p>

"Can I connect all of my LED strips to a single power supply?","31838","","<p>Im working on a project with LED light strips, and want to connect them all to a sd controller. The lights are ws2812b 60 LED/meter, and have 20 meters of it. It calls for 14.4w per meter @ 3 amps per meter. Can I hook all these strips to one power supply of 400W 80A?</p>
","<p>The power rating of the supply must be higher than the power rating of the load -- so based on the numbers, yes, this seems sensible.</p>

<p>However, the strip lights themselves will not support running that much current through them -- which means you can't just daisy-chain all the strips lights. </p>

<p>From <a href=""https://www.pololu.com/product/2547"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.pololu.com/product/2547</a>:</p>

<li>The 60 LED 1 m strip drew 3.0 A and had a voltage drop of 0.6 V.</li>
<li>The 120 LED 2 m strip drew 4.7 A and had a voltage drop of 1.4 V.</li>
</ul>

<p>The voltage drop means you'll have dimmer LEDs.. and at some point they'll stop working entirely. To get around this, you should provide power to each strip. You can interconnect the data lines, but separate power wires should be run to each segment. How long the segments are really depends on how much voltage drop you can tolerate (how dim the LEDs at the end get). </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7qXp1.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You can use a voltage drop calculator (Google it) to figure out the size of wire you should use for the distance and power draw -- but expect to probably run 18 or 16awg wire from your power supply to the segment.</p>

<p>It may also make sense to use multiple smaller power supplies (with shorter runs), depending on your distances, room layout, etc.</p>

"How can I get low water pressure in sprinkler system fixed?","31786","","<p>I have a new house that is still under warranty. Compared to at least two of my neighbors whose houses were built by the same builder and have very similar sprinkler systems, my sprinklers put out very low water pressure. The water pressure is so low that several sprinklers don't even deploy (that is they don't fully come out of the ground).</p>

<p>I demonstrated the problem to the builder, and he's sent out two different contractors in succession (first was a sprinkler guy, then was a plumber) that have said that it's not their area of expertise. The plumber confirmed that the decrease in water pressure was localized to the sprinkler system (water pressure at the exterior spigots was 55 psi, I believe), which I already knew from anecdotal experience, and said that an irrigation specialist would be the one to call.</p>

<p>Given the way the last two experiences have turned out, I'm hesitant to tell the builder to call a third contractor before I have a better understanding of the steps needed to get this problem solved, because to this point I've just had to take what the contractor's have said at face value.</p>

<p>So here are some specifics I would like to know:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it likely that the plumber is right, that the problem will necessitate an irrigation specialist (by process of elimination, I would expect this is true, but I had no idea of the existence of such a specialist before the plumber mentioned it)?</li>
<li>Are there any steps that I can take to better prepare for the next contractor?</li>
<li>Is there information that I'm missing that I should try to collect? I've basically given all of this information to the builder and the contractors, but we still haven't arrived at a solution.</li>
<li>Neither of the two contractors spent more than a couple minutes trying to diagnose the problem. Once I'm pretty sure I have the right sort of contractor, is there anything I can do to make sure that the he or she actually works to pinpoint the precise problem before trying to pass me along to someone else?</li>
</ol>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I haven't noticed any water pooling in my yard, so if there's a leak in the irrigation system, it's not obvious where it is, but my yard is pitched pretty sharply for drainage purposes, so I don't think that this indicates that there is no leak.</li>
<li>Water pressure in the house is quite good</li>
<li>At each step, I've actually had to push to get everyone to acknowledge that the problem isn't just that the city is not supplying my house with enough water pressure, which considering all the above, indicates to me that this is the sort of problem that nobody wants to deal with, probably because it's difficult and time consuming.</li>
<li>The sprinkler system is separated into zones, one of which only has two sprinklers, so I think that it's unlikely that the system simply has too many continuously running sprinklers to maintain enough water pressure.</li>
</ul>
","<h1>Clogged line</h1>

<p>There could be a clog in the lines feeding some of the sprinklers, or clogged up sprinkler heads.</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove all the sprinkler heads (the procedure will vary based on the type of heads).</li>
<li>Inspect and clean the heads.</li>
<li>Turn the system on.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don't notice any dirt or gunk coming out, and the pressure does not increase in the low flowing outlets. Cap the working outlets, and turn the system back on. If you still don't notice a difference, you might have to dig up the lines to inspect them.</p>

<h1>Damaged line</h1>

<p>The line feeding some of the sprinklers could have been crushed, damaged, or broken.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cap the working sprinklers.</li>
<li>Turn the system on.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the pressure in the low flow heads does not increase, you'll likely have to dig up the lines and inspect them.</p>

<h1>Not enough pressure</h1>

<p>It could just be that the system does not have enough pressure for all the heads to work simultaneously.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cap one of the working sprinklers.</li>
<li>Turn on the system.</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ul>

<p>If each time you cap an outlet you notice the pressure increase in the low flow heads, it could be that there is just not enough pressure to operate all the heads at once. In this case you might have to have the system split into zones, and only run one zone at a time.</p>

"Can you rout plywood?","31658","","<p>I have some applewood 13 ply 3/4"" plywood that I'm using for a desk top.  I was wondering if I took a router to the edges if it would turnout ok.</p>
","<p><a href=""http://www.appleply.com/"">ApplePly</a> is a brand name for an all-hardwood veneer plywood that is higher quality than your typical construction or cheap hardwood plywoods.  (You may want to confirm that your ""applewood"" plywood is truly ApplePly).  ApplePly should be similar in quality to baltic birch plywoods and like baltic birch it is not supposed to contain voids.  You can find these higher quality sheet goods at a large lumberyard or cabinet supplier.</p>

<p>A router will work fine on the edges of either ApplyPly or baltic birch.  The glue in the plywood may dull the router bit slightly more quickly than solid wood but if you are only doing one desktop this is not really a factor.  </p>

<p>From an aesthetic standpoint, you will be able to see the veneer layers on the edges.  Depending on the piece of furniture this may be what you desire, or not.</p>

<p>additional info and clarifications based on the comments:</p>

<p>As several have mentioned it's a good idea to take several shallow passes rather than try to get it done in a single pass.  This will help give cleaner cut.  What 'shallow' means kind of depends on what the profile and thickness is, but start with about 1/16"" and increase from there. Use a carbide bit rather than a cheaper high speed steel one.  Make sure that you understand where the bearing of the bit will be riding, especially if you are profiling both sides.  You should test all of these by working on the scrap edges of the sheet (or other scrap of the same material) before you cut it to final size.  Secure the sheet with multiple clamps if at all possible.  This is for safety and it will also give you more control and a better quality cut.</p>

<p>The direction that you move the router when working is important.  If you are working on the outside edge of a plywood sheet with a handheld router the correct direction is counterclockwise- start on the left and cut only towards the right.  This keeps the cutter rotating against the wood- you will actually have to push the router where you want it to go.  If the router is pulling you along, you are making a climb cut which is useful in some situations but not really recommended for beginners because much more effort is required to maintain control of the router.</p>

<p>Aluminum and steel appear to be the two major products when it comes to metal roofing for residential homes.  I'm not sure whether I should be considering aluminum, or steel.</p>

<p>What are the pros and cons of steel vs. aluminum metal roofing?  That is, what advantages and disadvantages does steel roofing have compared to aluminum roofing, and vice-versa?  If I go for one or the other type, what should I be looking out for and what should I be avoiding? </p>
","<p>The aluminum is probably more susceptible to denting, being a softer metal.</p>

<p>Will you ever need to walk on the roof? Do you have overhanging trees that may drop branches in a storm? Even trees near your house can see branches go flying your way.</p>

<p>Another question is the coating used. Since steel can rust, you don't want to worry about it. A high quality product would seem valuable there. Of course, you don't want to see paint flakes peeling off an aluminum roofing product either.</p>

<p>Finally, make sure that you can deal with snow, although this is not a factor that depends on the material itself. Our neighbor has a metal roof. A few years ago, we had a large, heavy snow fall, and a huge mass of snow broke free to slide off the roof. As it was coming down, it tore off the gutters on their home, then completely flattened part of their porch. My guess is it was several thousand dollars worth of damage. Falling snow can also damage plantings near the house. There are tabs that can be placed on the roof surface to prevent this if you live in the snow belt.</p>

If you want to avoid any type of legs right at the front edge you could build your own equivalent of a triangle bracket out of wood. </p>

<p>If I was setting out to make a built in unit mounted onto a wall I would secure a wood piece along the wall to every stud at the table height minus the top thickness. Then I would use this horizontal strip as the rear side mount for the table top. Then I would install supports under the table from near the front edge and angle them down toward the bottom of the wall where they could be fastened into the wall stud and/or the floor.</p>

<p>At the end of the day I would really suggest that you step back and evaluate if it really necessary to fasten your table to the wall. Having it sit on its own supports makes for a huge bunch of flexibility. It can be moved, taken away when all computers of the future fit into a pocket and a computer desk is no longer needed, and lastly you can easily get it away if you ever want to sell the house. </p>

"How often should I repaint the inside of my house?","31581","","<p>How often should I repaint just to keep it looking fresh? Should I wait until the old paint start to peel and crack or should I repaint it every 2 to 3 years regardless if the old paint is still ""quite fresh"" or not?</p>
","<p>It should normally be many years, if not decades, before paint starts to peel. Cracking may occur as the house settles, but that is usually due to the structure shifting and not a poor paint job. If the paint was not applied properly (eg, surface not prepared correctly), it may peel earlier, or this may indicate another major problem such as moisture in the walls.</p>

<p>So to answer your question: you should likely re-paint when the house is looking dated, the walls are scuffed up or damaged beyond cleaning, or when you're sick of the color. Between 5 and 15 years is a reasonable expectation of time between repainting, in my experience. </p>

<p>To have the longest-lasting paint job, the keys are good surface prep and good quality paint (basically just not the cheapest stuff). There's also another question with <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/5611/what-is-your-top-tip-for-painting"">some good tips about painting</a>.</p>

<p>Though we don't give decorating advice here, if you are going for a long-lasting paint job, keep in mind that there are colors that seem to always be current (I guess the ""neutral"" colors) and others that while they may be trendy today, a decade from now someone will look at them and say ""wow that is so 2010's"" just like today you might do that for the 90's or 80's. </p>

<p>Many people paint neutral colors before selling as it does look new, and some potential buyers  can be negatively affected by strong colors they don't like or that make a room look dark or small.</p>

"How should I configure my plumbing with PEX?","31470","","<p>I have a house built in 1940, which has a mix of copper, PVC and galvanized pipe for its plumbing at present.  I am going to be gutting the upstairs bathroom in the near future, and have access to most of the rest of the pipes, giving me an opportunity to replace all of the corroded galvanized and to reconfigure my plumbing pretty completely.  </p>

<p>I'd like to install a PEX manifold system in the basement, but what I don't have is any way to feed 3 cold and 2 hot lines up to the 2nd floor without opening walls I don't want to open, so I am thinking that I could install a small manifold on the 2nd floor just for that bath, and feed the rest of the house (kitchen sink, fridge, dishwasher, another full bath (2 hot 3 cold) and a half bath (2 cold 1 hot) from the basement manifold.</p>

<p>I have 3/4 copper coming into the house, if it matters.</p>

<p>What should my piping configuration be?  Am I right in thinking 3/4 runs to the upstairs manifold and 1/2"" runs from it to each fixture?</p>

<p>I was thinking about using using 2 <a href=""http://www.pexsupply.com/Viega-41033-1-2-3-Port-Zero-Lead-Brass-PEX-Crimp-MINIBLOC"">3-port MINIBLOC manifolds</a> (1 cold 1 hot 3 ports each) in the upstairs bath and 1 <a href=""http://www.pexsupply.com/Viega-41143-1-2-14-Port-Crimp-MANABLOC-6-hot-8-cold"">14-port MANABLOC manifold</a> (6 hot, 8 cold) for the basement. </p>

<p>Total fixtures to be fed:
- Upstairs Bath (separate manifold?) - 2 hot, 3 cold (sink, tub, toilet)</p>

<ul>
<li>Line to upstairs bath (main manifold) - 3/4"" - 1 hot, 1 cold</li>
<li>Downstairs bath (main manifold) - 2 hot, 3 cold (sink, tub, toilet)</li>
<li>Kitchen (main manifold) - 2 hot, 2 cold (sink, d/w, fridge)</li>
<li>Half Bath (main manifold) - 1 hot, 2 cold (sink, toilet)</li>
<li>Garden hose bib - 1 cold</li>
</ul>

<p>So for the main manifold that's 5 hot, 8 cold.  Is that enough or should I step up to the 24 port manifold (9 hot, 15 cold) even though that would have 4 unused hot and 7 unused cold?</p>

<p>Or - should I consider a completely different configuration altogether?</p>
","<p>First of all the information I'm providing is based on my local codes, your local codes my very.</p>

<h1>Quick Answer</h1>

<p>You will need to feed the lower floor manifolds with 3/4"" PEX inlets and 1/2"" outlets. No manifold would be required for the upper bathroom as only 1/2"" PEX is needed for both the hot and cold, just tee off the 1/2"" lines to feed the sink, tub and water closet. All individual fixture runs would be 1/2"" as well.</p>

<h1>Detailed Answer</h1>

<p>Using manifolds and running to each fixture individually is called a homerun system. This can be less labour but may have a higher material cost. It all depends on how far the groups of fixtures are from the manifold. This method is typically used when the pipes are run through the slab.</p>

<p>Depending on the location of the fixtures, you may want to look at a truck and branch system. This is were you would run two mains and branch off to the fixtures as it passes them. The mains would get smaller as the fixtures are taken off.</p>

<p>Water lines are sized so that the velocity within the pipe is kept below a set point. This is to limit the wear and tear on the pipe material. Different materials can handle different velocities at different temperatures. The max velocity for copper and PVC is 5ft/sec for cold and 4ft/sec for hot. PEX pipe can handle a maximum velocity of 8ft/sec for both hot and cold.</p>

<p>Fixture units (FU) are given to typical fixtures. A FU is a design factor that is used to represent the typical requirement of a particular fixture (it is not a flow rate but).</p>

<h3>Fixture Units for Private Use Fixtures (no flush valves):</h3>

<pre>
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Fixture           |    Hot FU  |  Cold FU  |  Combined |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Bathroom Group    |      4.50  |     4.50  |      6.00 |
| Bathtub/Shower    |      1.50  |     1.50  |      2.00 |
| Clothes Washer    |      2.25  |     2.25  |      3.00 |
| Dishwasher        |      3.00  |        -  |      3.00 |
| Hose Bib          |         -  |     7.00  |      7.00 |
| Kitchen Sink      |      2.00  |     1.50  |      1.50 |
| Water Closet      |         -  |     3.00  |      3.00 |
| Lavatory          |      0.75  |     0.75  |      1.00 |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
</pre>

<p>The above table lists the common residential fixtures and their FU. You can see that a bathroom can be considered one group and has a lower FU then the sum of it's parts. This is because they are typically used by one person at a time so it is unlikely that all fixtures will be running at the same time.</p>

<p>Once we have the FUs, we can look up a sizing chart that will tell us the maximum FUs that a pipe of a set size and material can handle while staying below the maximum velocity. You can view these tables in the Domestic Water Sizing Tables (For Small Buildings) section below.</p>

<p>Based on this information, we can size your distribution system as follows for PEX:</p>

<pre>
|----------------------------------------------------|
| Fixture Group        |      Hot      |    Cold     |
|                      |    FU  Size   |    FU  Size |
|----------------------------------------------------|
| Upstairs Bathroom    |  4.50   1/2   |  4.50   1/2 |
| Downstairs Bathroom  |  4.50   1/2   |  4.50   1/2 |
| Kitchen              |  4.50   1/2   |  1.50   1/2 |
| Half Bathroom        |  0.75   1/2   |  3.75   1/2 |
|----------------------------------------------------|
</pre>

<p>So you can see that the pipes feeding each group of your fixtures will only need to be 1/2"". Each individual fixture would also be 1/2"". However, depending on how the groups of fixtures are located relative to each other, you may require 3/4"" pipes to feed more then one group. The total FU of your house is 14.25 Hot FU (3/4""), 21.25 Cold FU (1"") and 28.00 Combined FU (1""). The Combined FU is used to size the section of pipping from the cold line into the house to the hot water tank. Don't be alarmed that the cold and combined are sized at 1"". This is due to the allowance of the hose bib, which our code now calls for 7 FU. This is too high and has been causing issues in large buildings with hose bibs on small decks, in that the lines are oversized and do not properly flow, allowing for growth in the water. Without the hose bib, your cold is only 3/4"".</p>

","<p>If the metal frames are rotted to the point of being unusable you can remove them. It will not be easy. They may have anchors embedded into the foundation. Until you remove the frame you can't tell what the size of the opening will be. You may also need some masonary skills to repair or prepare the opening to accept the new windows. Then you have to decide how the windows will mount to the concrete. You can frame the opening with P/T wood and then anchor the new windows to the wood or metal frames anchored to the original masonary opening. The opening may require a bit of work to set new metal windows.  Another option is glass block set diectly into the opening if ventilation isn't required.</p>

It could dampen and ruin the drywall. If left too long, mold or mildew could result.  The snow coming through the vents is probably an isolated event.  Don't close the vent.  Maybe just lay a sheet of 4 mil plastic over the insulation to keep snow off your insulation.  Keep an eye on it.

","<p>The two things (starting in the middle and avoiding slivers) are NOT related.</p>

<p>You can start in the middle and end up with idiotic cuts on both edges - or you can start in the corner and not do that...</p>

<p>What you SHOULD do is measure enough that you know where to put the SENSIBLE cuts on the edges, regardless if you are starting at a wall, corner, or the middle of the floor. When starting in a corner or at a wall, your very first tile might well be a cut tile. By planning, you know what cuts you are making and can place the whole and cut tiles as you like. In your case, the first two-and-a bit tiles at the door should probably be cut so that there's not a large gap at the threshold (or you need to get the door molding cut so they can slide under it.) Depending how the (invisible) far wall (opposite the door) comes out, you might want to take enough off the ""door"" tiles that the wall parallel to the door does not have what looks to be a 1-1/2"" slice running along it.</p>

<p>The main argument I've seen for starting in the middle is to avoid following an irregular wall - but you can do the same thing by striking a chalk-line where the first grout line from the wall would be, and pre-cutting all the tiles for that wall if it's irregular (or if they will be half or 1/3 tiles so the far wall isn't slivers - which you'll know because you measure it.)</p>

<p>Based on your pictures, I'd choose the ""not centered"" approach, since the visible far wall is decidedly not slivers that way, but that's purely an opinion call, not ""right"" or ""wrong.""</p>

","<p>A welded connection can always be made the same strength as the original steel by using a full penetration but weld but this all depends on the quality of the materials used for the welding and the quality of the welding itself. Therei s a very good reason why there is a lot of non destructive testing used when welded joints are being used for structural reasons. Other types of welds such as fillet welds will be weaker than the origianl material with the strength depending on the quality and the design. </p>

<p>For a bolted connection, the connection will not normally be as strong as the original material without some form of strengthening because of issues like the reduction in area caused by drilling the holes and the small lever arms caused by overlapping plates. </p>

<p>In this instance, if you are not intending to get the design professionally done, I would suggest a bolted connection would be more suitable unless you have absolute confidence on the quality of the welding and the design of the joints. A simple bolted connection should give you more confidence about the strength than a welded joint even though the capacity of the connection may be lower. </p>

<p>During assembly, the bolt holes don't necessarily line up, so you stick the tapered tail through the mating holes in the construction item, lever them around till the adjacent holes line up, slap a bolt through, affix a nut and washer and then use the wrench end to tighten.</p>

When an ocean going tug captain decides that it's more lucrative to run his boat up a slough, pull the engine and use it to power a sawmill operation, he's already been using a tapered steel rod to splice hawser cable.

"Why is a gas furnace vented but a gas dryer is not?","31075","","<p>I live in a house in Ohio and I have four appliances powered by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas"">natural gas</a>: furnace, water heater, dryer, and kitchen range.</p>

<p>Of these, only the furnace and water heater are vented to the outside of the house (chimney stack). In this context, venting refers to a flue that directs combustion byproducts outside the house as opposed to a vent for waste water or the vent that directs hot air and lint away from the dryer.</p>

<p>While I am no building contractor, I have been in quite a few houses in my life and I have always seen this same configuration when it comes to appliances powered by natural gas here in the U.S.</p>

<p>Aside from ""because code says so"" is there a reason why furnaces and water heaters require venting while dryers and ranges do not? Are there cases where building code may allow not venting furnaces or water heaters, or require venting for dryers or ranges?</p>
","<p>Byproducts of combustion of natural gas are carbon dioxide and water vapour.  Unfortunately natural gas isn't pure methane, it has other components (called condensates by the petroleum industry).  You can see these other components by watching a burning gas flame - methane burns blue, other components burn yellow, orange, red, etc.  These other components contribute to indoor pollutants.</p>

<p>Overall, it's a matter of volume, or amount of gas burned every day:
- furnace is 100,000 BTU or more
- HWT is 40,000 BTU and up
- stove burner is 3,000-7,000 BTU (""power burners"" could be up to 12,000 BTUs)</p>

<p>Besides the volume of gas that is burned by the appliance, the HWT and furnace tend to run for longer periods every day.  Besides exhaust venting, building codes also require combustion air source for these appliances.</p>

<p>Is there anything metal I could pick up as scrap that would work as a fire bowl? I don't mind the looks as I could possibly alter that</p>

"Should light bulbs above showers be ""steam proof""?","30960","","<p>In replacing the lighting in my apartment with LED bulbs, I noticed that the recessed can lighting above the shower (to be fair, the light is centered on the shower curtain) does not appear to be steam proof.</p>

<p>I'm only assuming that the bulb/fixture should be rated for use above a shower, but I could be totally wrong about that.</p>

<p>In addition to / regardless of any NEC codes that may be at play here, what kind of symptoms might one experience with a non steam proof light vs a steam proof light (if such a thing exists)?</p>

<p>The only possibly related problem I've had with the light in the three years I've lived in the place is that it seems to be in need of replacement a bit quicker than the rest, but this could easily be attributed to the fact that the light is frequently left on since it's the only bathroom light.</p>
","<p>As pointed out by others, luminaires above or near a tub/shower must be ""steam-proof"" (rated for damp locations). This means the fixture will be sealed in some way, to prevent moisture from entering the housing and causing damage and/or an unsafe environment. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NEC 2008</strong><br>
  <strong>410.10 Luminaires in Specific Locations.</strong><br>
  <strong>(D) Bathtub and Shower Areas.</strong>  No parts of cord-connected luminaires, chain-, cable-, or cord-suspended luminaires, lighting
  track, pendants, or ceiling-suspended (paddle) fans shall be located

<h1>Corrosion</h1>

<p>The major concern here would be corrosion inside the fixture, which can lead to dangerous heating, arcing, shorting, etc.  </p>

<h3>Heat</h3>

<p>Corrosion on contacts increases the resistance of the circuit, which can lead to excess heat, which in turn can lead to increased resistance.  Given the right circumstances, wires/contacts can be heated to the point of ignition. </p>

<h3>Arcing and Shorting</h3>

<p>In some fixtures, contacts can be in very close quarters with each other. If corrosion builds up causing the gap between contacts to reduce enough, arcing can become a problem.  Similarly, if the gap closes completely, a short can be created.</p>

<h3>PITA</h3>

<p>Corrosion in fixture can simply lead to a frustrating situation. If the screw base of a bulb becomes corroded enough, the bulb could become difficult or impossible to remove. This could lead to the fixture needing replacement, or at least an annoying bulb change experience. </p>

<h1>Ground Faults</h1>

<p>As we all know, water conducts electricity (in most cases). Because of this a deadly ground fault situation can be created, if luminairs are allowed to get excessively damp or wet.  If enough moisture enters the fixture to cause dripping, a solid stream of conductive water could bring electricity within reach of a well grounded individual.  In this scenario, a simple touch of the light could be deadly.  </p>

<p>Concrete will fail explosively (sudden collapse with little to no warning, which is why reinforced concrete specifically has less than the optimal amount of steel in it, so the steel goes first), but that's not normally used for shelves.</p>

"How often should I change the oil in my lawn mower","30455","","<p>I have just purchased a new lawn mower and am wondering about the maintenance.  I'm not very good at mechanical maintenance and without a small engine shop in my local home town I'm wondering what I can get away with.  The owners manual says to change the oil after the first five hours of use, but is this really required?  Will my new lawn mower stop operating of I don't do this first 5 hour oil change?</p>
","<p>It (probably) won't suddenly stop and refuse to start again after 5 hours of use, but it's a good idea to follow the recommended cycle: the parts in new engines often haven't been milled perfectly smooth, so as your new engine turns those rough bits get knocked off or cut tracks for themselves, leaving little pieces of metal in the oil.  Unless you get rid of them by changing the oil, they can cause excessive wear and tear on the engine.</p>

<p>Depending on your lawnmower, you'll either be able to drain oil out of the bottom, or tip the mower over and drain it out the top from the same hole you pour the fresh oil into (the worst part of this is lifting and tilting the mower over the catcher pan, but it's a lot easier if you have someone to help).</p>

"What size wire do I need to connect a portable generator inlet to my main panel?","30438","","<p>I am planning on installing an interlock kit and backfeeding my panel with my portable generator.

<p>I can install the outdoor inlet right outside wall with the panel, resulting in around a 6 foot run of 10-3 romex with ground.  However, while the generator fine there, it would be  little harder to get to in that location for refueling and maint.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the most convenient spot for the generator would result in about a 80 foot run of 10/3 romex.  Will that length of run affect the performance or reliability of the power? </p>
","<p>As has been discussed many times in this forum, back feeding a generator into a double or even a single pole breaker without a transfer switch is risky business. If the main  breaker is not disabled while generator is online, you will be back feeding power to the grid and pose a safety hazard to utility workers.  </p>

<p>With that said, look at the following link, <a href=""http://www.southwire.com/support/voltage-drop-calculator.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.southwire.com/support/voltage-drop-calculator.htm</a>   The wire size for an 80 run at 30 amps/120vac is 8 AWG.  Use this calculator to determine wire size or determine voltage drop. 3% drop is usually considered max for 120/240 runs. Once you start to draw amperage, the drop can become greater as you tax the voltage source with a fixed or max amp output.</p>

","<p>When you short cycle the compressor like that it's the worst thing an owner can do to shorten the lifespan of it's compressor.  </p>

<p>The refrigerator compressor uses oil to lubricate the pump. This pump runs very hot. The oil becomes dirtier and dirtier as it travels through the refrigerator tubes and clogs the refrigerant paths making it impossible for the refrigerator to cool. When you short cycle the fridge, it immediately kills the pressure behind the oil from the compressor, and the oil in the pathways must trickle back to the reservoir. with only gravity assistance, so the thicker the oil is the less likely it is to make it back without clogging.</p>

<p>However if you <em>must</em> turn it off in order to sleep, turn the cold temp to off prior to turning the fridge off. All fridge manuals recommend that you do this before unplugging the fridge when moving the fridge. This will help keep the oil flowing back to the reservoir. </p>

"What's the easiest way to carry 4x8 sheets of 70-lbs drywall by yourself?","30353","","<p>This past weekend, I had some help carrying eight 4x8 sheets of type X drywall up a flight of stairs.  It was not easy.  I know the sheets couldn't have weighed more than 80 lbs, but it felt like they weighed a ton.  I need to get more up the same flight, but won't have help this time and I am not keen to paying a few hundred bucks to have it done.</p>

<p>Some research has lead me to the Gorilla Gripper and PanelHandle.  I've read that the Gorilla Gripper can damage drywall.  Haven't found much else about the PanelHandle.  However, the demos I've seen on YouTube show them using it to carry sheets of plywood.</p>

<p>I ended up getting a hand-held panel carrier from Lowe's last week thinking it would help.  It goes under the sheet and you lift it with your right hand and hold the top of the sheet with your left (or the other way around).  It turned out not to help at all.</p>

<p>I really like the Gorilla Gripper provided that it doesn't damage drywall.</p>
","<p>I really hate to answer my own question here since Greebo and BMitch contributed well to my inquiry.</p>

<p>I have never handled full sheets of drywall before, so I did not realize that type X drywall was actually a lot heavier than regular drywall.  I figured this out when I bought a 4x8 sheet of 1/2"" regular drywall to close up a window in my house.  I was able to lift it with my bare hands with relative ease.  I can only assume that, while 5/8"" would be heavier, I would still be able to lift it myself.  BMitch's answer satisfies that situation very well, but 5/8"" type X weighing in a 72+ pounds is another story.</p>

<p>So I bought a Gorilla Gripper and it worked wonders for carrying the type X which actually appears to be as heavy or heavier than 4x8x23/32 OSB.  Since type X is so dense compared to regular drywall, I didn't have to worry about putting a protective piece of wood in between the Gorilla Gripper's clamp and the drywall.  However, if I ever did need to carry regular drywall with the Gorilla Gripper, I'd definitely consider going with Greebo's suggestion lest I choose to risk damaging the drywall due to its flimsiness, an especial hazard when turning corners.</p>

<p>You won't be able to use the Gorilla Gripper to take a full sheet up a flight of steps, though.  In this case, if you're doing it alone, set aside the Gripper, grab the drywall by the top and bottom end, and pull/slide it up the steps.  I have carpeted steps, so it was easy to slide.  If you're dealing with wood or concrete steps, I would either cover the steps with a thick dropcloth or consult the help of a friend.</p>

It gets hot very fast during hot days (even in spring). It is a fairly small room and I have computers there attributing to heat. There's a small double pane window with cloth blinds. There's a central AC but running it full time just cool a small room does not seem very efficient.</p>

<p>What are the ways to reduce amount of heat from the direct sun hitting the wall? Special paint? Drapes? Tent? Fan?</p>
","<p>A good deciduous tree helps, but it will take a while for that to work.  Just be sure not to plant it too close to the foundation.</p>

<p>Light blocking blinds are very good at blocking both heat and light.  This may not be good if you're trying to work in the room.</p>

<p>Insulation helps if you have an attic above, just don't block the ventilation from the soffits.</p>

<p>However, the important thing to realize is that cooling systems spend a significant effort overcoming the heating effects of people themselves.  And a couple computers doesn't help.  No matter how much you block the outside heat, the heat being generated is still there.  Therefore, make sure your vents are adjusted to cool the rooms you use (closing doors also helps), and direct most of your cooling to the upstairs.  If that still isn't enough, try a small fan in the doorway blowing in cool air from the floor (which will push out the hot air above).</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: Couple other thoughts.</p>

<p>Get an IR thermometer to check all your walls and various other heat sources.  You may discover a patch of uninsulated wall or find that the window it letting in more than you thought.</p>

<p>Second, check your thermostat to see if it has a setting for how much the temperature will vary before it cuts on.  Mine is an odd key combination that's buried in the back of the manual.  If you're going well over an hour between AC cycles, you'll reduce hot spots by reducing this setting.</p>

"What is involved when replacing wood paneling with drywall?","30216","","<p>In a forty-something year old home, I would like to freshen up a couple of rooms that still have wood paneling (and get rid of that ""this room used to look fashionable in the 1970s"" look). I would like to replace the wood panels with drywalls.</p>

<p>They are painted, as you see below. I'm guessing that someone at some point decided they didn't like the look of the wood panels either, but just painted over them rather than replace them.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/13U0U.jpg"" alt=""woodpanel""></p>

<p>To remove the wood panels, I'll hunt down the location of the nails, take them out, and then hopefully the panels will be easy to pull out. I am wondering:</p>

<ol>
<li>What are the chances that there is already some kind of drywall behind the panels? This would make the task considerably simpler!</li>
<li>If the panels are just a couple of millimeters thick, might it be an option to just leave them where they are and fix the drywall in front of them? It would be trickier to mark the locations of the studs behind, but all-in-all it'd be a lot simpler job... and, last, but not least:</li>
<li>Can the ""look"" of the wood panels be transformed to a drywall-pretend-to-be without actually taking the panels out? Could I for instance sand the panels, fill out the ridges (with what?), and apply primer/paint? Sanding furniture to change the paint color is a lousy and intense task. Would I be looking at a similarly troubling task to make replacing the panels with drywall look like an easy task by comparison?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I thought of adding a couple of pointers to those tackling a similar project.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In stores, you are more likely to find <em>drywall mud</em> called <em>joint compound</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Solution 2 above (adding a drywall in front of the wood panels) is illustrated in this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPfIUHgtS70"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">video</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Solution 3 (skim-coating) is illustrated in this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs3I4z0RhCM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">video</a>. I suspect that the only difference with skim coating a wood panel is that one must apply more compound to make sure that the grooves disappear.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, it's been already six months since I asked the question. Well, winter came and now I'm not sure it's reasonable to tackle such a project while the windows remain closed (or wait till Spring).</p>
","<p>Option 3 is the sanest IMHO. You can get a bucket of drywall mud for $15 and do a ""skim coat"" over the panels to create a flat surface. No need to sand first; this stuff will stick to anything! Once the mud is dry, you can sand it to get a smooth look, or texture it. Texturing can be done with cans of spray-on texture you get at big box stores, or using a texture sprayer gun. A pro will be able to do the texture part much better than a novice, so if you want a textured wall, I recommend hiring that part out for $100 or so. With the right equipment and an operator of moderate skill, it's a 30 minute job. If you've already got an air compressor, you can have a go yourself with a sprayer attachment that has a hopper.</p>

<p>But whatever you do, match the texture or lack thereof to any drywall that abuts the paneled wall. Nothing screams ""I used to be wood paneling!!!!!"" like strange, awkward texture on a few walls that, upon further investigation, have more give to them when pushed on.</p>

<p>This is the approach I took on my wood paneled walls and today you'd never know the difference.</p>

"Cut a granite counter top","30162","","<p>What's the best way for a DIY granite counter top to be cut?  What tools do I need that will do the job without breaking the bank?</p>
","<p>I have done this with granite tiles in two different sizes, 12 by 12 inches (30x30cm) and 18 by 26 inches (45x65cm).  Not a full slab, but it should basically work the same.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>You have two tasks involved: cutting it, and smoothing/polishing the edges.</p>

<p>For both cutting and polishing, I used an angle grinder.  In my case, I bought a 4-1/2 inch grinder like this one for very cheap from a discount tool import store (about US$20; works great).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z6aXQ.jpg"" alt=""angle grinder""></p>

<p>For straight cuts, I used a diamond blade (metal blade embedded with diamond chips).  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zdeqb.jpg"" alt=""diamond blade""></p>

<p>I clamped a board to the granite to use as a guide rail or fence, and ran the grinder along using a guard like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gQjhF.jpg"" alt=""angle grinder guard""></p>

<p>For the round sink opening, I cut out most of it with a series of straight cuts using the diamond blade (inside my desired line), and then smoothed out the curve using a masonry grinding wheel on the angle grinder.</p>

<p>I wore a respirator dust mask and ran the shop vac while cutting, to collect as much dust as possible.</p>

<p>To smooth and polish the edges, I used polishing/""surface conditioning disks"" designed for stone and masonry, in the angle grinder.  They come in a set of various grains from coarse to fine.  Just like sanding, start with the coarse and work your way up to the fine.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TTblu.jpg"" alt=""stone polishing disks""></p>

<p>All of the above parts were done dry; no water involved.</p>

<p>I finished by hand with some diamond polishing pads that come mounted on spongy rubber holders.  These are done wet; using water to lubricate the process and wash away grit while you are doing it.  I used an old plastic milk jug and poked a pin-hole in the side near the bottom, and let it dribble out water continuously while polishing.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ye8pH.jpg"" alt=""diamond hand polishing pads""></p>

<p>All in all, I would say it was easy and inexpensive; it just took time and created a lot of dust.  Get a proper respirator face mask and don't use those little paper masks; your sinuses and lungs are worth proper protection.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bmJWT.png"" alt=""respirator face mask""></p>

<p>I'm sure I spent less than US$100 on the grinder and cutting/grinding/polishing supplies.  I already had the respirator but they aren't too expensive either.</p>

<p>For the 12 inch tiles, I also used a small tile wet saw, built like a tiny table saw.  It produced nice clean cuts, but since that involves moving the tiles on the saw, it didn't work for the 26 inch tiles, and would not work for slab either.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>I used granite tiles for kitchen and bathroom counter tops.  At the time I did the kitchen, I was only aware of square granite tiles in relatively small sizes like the 12 inch ones here.  When I later did the bathroom, I discovered the larger size tiles, which were large enough to run a full tile from back to front edges.  This 5 foot wide counter is only four tiles for the main surface.</p>

<p>Here is the kitchen with 12 inch granite tiles:</p>

It is a natural gas water heater if that's important. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any advice!</p>
","<p>I don't think that you <em>need</em> to turn off the gas to the hot water heater.  I believe that it is likely acceptable to leave the appliance on the 'pilot' setting.</p>

<p>Personally, I would be hesitant to leave a gas appliance unattended for more than a day or two without physically disconnecting the gas (usually a 1/4 turn valve on the feed line).  However, I feel comfortable lighting the pilot light myself.</p>

<p>Perhaps your should check with the local utility that provides your gas and see if they offer a service to visit your home and relight the pilot light upon your return?  Mine does and it is free.

"How much concrete for a fence post?","30067","","<p>We're going to build up a 4' fence around our property sometime in here in the spring or summer with 4x4 posts.</p>

<p>I've seen that you should bury 1/3 to 1/2 of the above ground post height; so this would make our hole 1.5-2' deep with gravel below. I've also seen that the diameter of the hole for a 4x4 post should be 12"".. which would make the radius 6"". After going through the math for the hole ( pi x r^2 x h ) it comes out that the hole will have a volume of 1.57 cu ft, but the post itself will take up 0.17 cu ft, so the volume to be filled with concrete will become <strong>1.4 cu ft per post</strong>. Right?</p>

<p>The question I have now is that a 50lb bag of fast-setting Quickrete apparently fills 0.375 cu ft after setting. This would mean that we'd need almost 4 bags per post (3.75) - this is also the number that comes up from Quickrete's online calculator. I'm not against this exactly, except that I've seen people saying they've used half a bag per post or a bag a post. How accurate is this and how much should we need? At that rate, we're almost looking at 100+ bags. The 80lb bags fill about 0.6 cu ft and are about a dollar cheaper, is there anything against going with it?</p>

<p>What type of concrete do I need to use, and how much?</p>
","<p>Wow! I normally use post hole diggers (6"" diameter?) 3 feet deep and ½ a bag of redi-mix per post. I did a free standing section of 6 foot privacy fencing this last summer and we just had a storm of >50mph winds and it is still standing and solid.</p>

<p>So, some of it depends on the quality of your soil but 4 bags per post would be major overbuilding in my opinion.</p>

"Wiring a fluorescent T8 fixture to a standard plug","30060","","<p>I am looking to connect a T8 fluorescent light fixture (that holds 4 bulbs) to a cord with a plug at the end so I can plug the fixture directly into a standard wall socket (or in my case a light socket adapter like <a href=""http://www.lowes.com/pd_17576-43469-6502_4294722558__?productId=3774299&amp;Ns=p_product_qty_sales_dollar%7C1&amp;pl=1&amp;currentURL=%3FNs%3Dp_product_qty_sales_dollar%7C1&amp;facetInfo="" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>.)</p>

","<p>The extra holes in the connector are for wire chaining the fixture to the next fixture.  One pair goes to power, the other pair to the next fixture.</p>

<p>You can cut off the connector and strip the two wires (black and white) and connect them directly to the cord with <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/Unbranded-Wire-Connector-Assortment-25-Pack-775128/202894260"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wire twist connectors</a>.  These are color coded for the total size of wires in them.  Yours plus a cord is likely to be the smallest (blue).</p>

<p>Black goes to black and white to white.
Be sure to use a three prong cord with a ground wire, like <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/InSinkErator-Power-Cord-Accessory-Kit-CRD-00/100041635"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>:</p>

<p>Secure the green wire to the fixture's metal with a screw (maybe one already in place), or cut the end of the wire, strip it, and use a twist connector to tie it to a ground wire in the fixture.
The clamp is a great idea if the edge of the hole in the fixture is sharp.</p>

"What is the best way to cut receptacle holes when hanging drywall?","30037","","<p>I will be installing drywall in a 10x10 room this weekend, walls only. I'm planning to use the longer sheets so there is only a single horizontal seam on each wall and install the top sheet first, flush against the existing ceiling. </p>

<p>My question is, what is the best/easiest (not usually the same thing) way to cut holes for the receptacles as I'm hanging the bottom panels of drywall? I'm considering a few options, but what is the best for someone new to this for a good result? One option is to just hang the drywall and use old-work boxes for the receptacles. I don't like to use old work for new work as it doesn't seem as secure. Personal preference. In the past, I've nailed up the boxes and then tried to cut the holes by measuring from the sides several times and then cutting out the holes before putting up the board over the boxes. That never seems to come out in the exact right spot that I don't have a gap around the box. Lastly, I've installed the boxes and then used a saw or rotary tool to cut it out with the drywall loosely fastened into place. This always seems to damage the wiring and still leaves a gap around the box where I cut. </p>

<p>So, which of these methods are mostly likely to work with practice or is there a super slick method that I haven't even thought to try?</p>
","<p>My experience says to use the rotary tool, but I have always used metal boxes with plaster rings.  I have no experience cutting drywall over plastic boxes.  I do have three pointers for cutting with a rotary tool:</p>

<ul>
<li>Put as little pressure on the box from the drywall as possible.  The more pressure against the drywall, the more likely that you'll get tearout near the edge of the box.</li>
<li>Leave any NM cable sheathed and set the depth of the cut to the minimum possible to reach the box plus a half an inch (keeping in mind that the drywall will be at an angle to the box).</li>
<li>Always take a few seconds to visualize your cut.  Have a good idea of where your corners are so you can anticipate direction changes.  Do a sanity check and make right sure you know which way counterclockwise is.  Start out going clockwise, and you'll spend a lot of time repairing drywall.  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you still don't want to use the rotary tool, there is another option.  There are tools that attach to plastic electric boxes.  You put them on and then position the drywall where it will be installed.  Press the drywall against the tool, and it will place small perforations at the outside corners of the box.  Connect the dots and cut.  The image below is of one of mine, but I haven't had the chance to use it yet.</p>

"water coming up from under cement foundation","30009","","<p>I've been living in my home for 28 years.  It's brick on a cement foundation built in 1985.  I had a patio poured at the back door in 1986. There is a approx. 1/16 inch crack that I should have sealed where the patio meets the brick but I never did and it has never been a problem.  For the last week water has been seeping from the crack in a couple of areas close to each other enough to saturate an area of approx 3 ft. x 7 ft. This area has been constantly wet for a week now.  Dont know if this is related but about a month ago the water pressure in my shower slowly decreased, got new shower head and had fair pressure for about a week and now it seem to be decreasing again.  Checked water meter and it shows no water leaking when no water is being used. The shower is on the opposite side of the leak, and the ground is not wet anywhere else around the house. Can someone please tell me what this is?</p>
","<p>OK, the water must be coming from somewhere:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Water from a leak. If you've been checking your meter and don't think you have any leaks inside that's good, but it's possible there is a crack or break in service line upstream of your meter. This might actually explain reduced water pressure in the house. If you suspect this is the problem I would call your water company and have them take a look.</p></li>
<li><p>Rainwater. If the water appears only during and shortly after a storm, then you probably have a drainage problem. Make sure all gutters are directed away from the house. You might also look at grading near the house to make sure water will flow away from the house.  Is the porch at the bottom of a slope towards the house?</p></li>
<li><p>Groundwater. I would be a little surprised if this were groundwater welling up, but it's not impossible. Have you had a very wet spring that would've raised the water table level? Or done any serious landscaping / excavation / compacting in your area?</p></li>
<li><p>Septic system. An unhappy septic system can cause water to well up, although probably not so close to the house or clear / odorless. Do you have a septic system?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(I wouldn't beat yourself up too much about not sealing that gap. If water is pooling from below I doubt a little sealant would hold it off for long.)</p>

"How can I build a long lasting low maintenance fence?","30007","","<p>I'm needing to replace a blown down fence, and have been seeking advice and quotes from fencing contractors. There seem to be two conflicting schools of thought.</p>

<p>One contractor advises that using pressure treated timber posts concreted into the ground, along with a continuous strip of feather-boarded fence (again using pressure treated timber) will result in a longer lasting fence. He specifically said that pressure treated timber will last longer than concrete posts, which are likely to crack over time due to frost. He also said that using pressure treated timber boards will mean the fence doesn't need to be treated in any way after installation.</p>

<p>Another contractor pooh-poohed that, and said concrete posts with gravel board and feather-board panels is the way to go. He said that pressure treated timber is a gimmick for applications where the timber is not in direct contact with the ground, and that it would need to be treated periodically.</p>

<p>To summarise: both options involve concreting thee posts into the ground, but the first option uses timber posts, and the second concrete. </p>

<p>Which route should I take for a long-lasting, low-maintenance fence?  Looks are not especially important, and security is not really an issue. I'm prepared to pay more if it will last well.</p>
","<p>A concrete post/form in the ground with some sort of above ground post or embedded post in the concrete is the way to go.  Depending on what you want from your fence, ie: privacy, security, looks, etc. will effect what kind of materials to use for the actual visible fence. There are many choices of composite materials and vinyl products out there that are low or no maintenance and will outlast any wooden materials. The first serious structure to fail is usually where a wood post meets the ground. You need to pay special attention to this area, keep wet dirt, leaves etc from building up around the wood posts. The concrete should be sloped away from the post so water drains away and no water stands around your posts. Use good hardware, galvanized at minimum, stainless steel screws are best, but a little pricey.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if either contractor has really given you good advise.  Tell us a bit more of what you what your fence to do and look like and we can help you more. </p>

"How do I replace a garage door spring?","29985","","<p>One of the springs on my garage door has snapped. I'd like to replace it, but it seems like I'm going to have to get the door up before I can do so.  Of course, the door is <em>extremely heavy</em> with a broken spring, so that is tricky.  Do I just need to get a jack to get the door up, or is there another solution I'm not thinking of?</p>
","<p>Depends if it is a swinging door (California) or a roll up door.  The roll up has one spring that runs across the header.  If you mess with this you are messing with death.  It's that simple.</p>

<p>The California style that swings out has two springs on each side of the door.  These springs can be changed as a DIY.  Open the door, which will be very hard, and prop the door open.  If you remove the what is propping the door it will slam very hard and maybe make you wish you were dead.  There are many different types of springs so what you buy has to be an exact match.  Changing it you takes nothing more than brawn.  I've done a few over the years because they are used mostly on wood doors and these dry out and then absorb water and back and forth until they weigh almost twice their weight.  The springs and openers start breaking from the extra weight.</p>

<p>Is it possible that the water supply line is broken at the nut?  Should I get a new one?  The supply line I have has a plastic nut and is flexible. </p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<p>There was actually a hairline crack in the plastic tube that comes out of the tank to the outside.  The plastic pipe was replaced with a brass one to fix the issue.</p>
","<p>The washer under the nut is probably leaking and the easiest/best solution's would to be replace the pipe. </p>

<p><strong>Why</strong></p>

<p>The reason it only leaks when you have the supply on is that there is no significant back pressure on the fittings from the tank as the tank has an air gap and the filler is at the top of the tank not submerged at the bottom ( which would cause back pressure)</p>

<p><em>P.S.</em> <strong>DON'T</strong> use mutigrips, use a spanner or shifting spanner, on a plastic nut (or even brass) you can deform the nut by the crushing force of the mutigrips as you tighten the nut.</p>

<p>How am I supposed to hook up the waste line? Do I need to drill out that center hole?</p>
","<p>It should be a knockout, meaning that a hard sharp blow will pop it out. The plumber should have done this before he glued the drain line in place, since knocking it out now could cause the plug to fall down the drain. This could lead to clogs in the future, since the trap is glued and cannot be disassembled.</p>

<p>Put the tip of a flathead screw driver on the knockout, and tap the back of the screwdriver with your hand or a hammer. Try to get it so that only part of the knockout breaks free. Then grab the loosened disk with a pair of pliers, and twist it free. Be very careful not to drop it down the drain.</p>

<p>Once the hole is open, simply hang the washing machines waste line in the hole. The washer should come with a piece of plastic used to make a hook in the waste line. Install that, and hang the waste line in the hole.</p>

<p>I came up with the idea to use my oscilating tool with wood blade, but this oak is tough to cut through.  I've only been able to shave off about 5"" before I gave up.

But everywhere I look, I see remarks to the effect that its use is mostly confined to low-voltage wiring (communications, alarms, audio/video), and some localities forbid its use for 120 V electrical purposes. Why?</p>

<p>I am planning to install a couple exterior weatherproof boxes. The wires will be run from the basement, through the sole plate, into the wall space, and out through a hole drilled through a brick veneer into the back of the box.</p>

<p>To make the bridge from wall to box watertight, I plan to run the wire in conduit. Options here seem to be liquidtight flexible metallic/non-metallic conduit, PVC, or some of the heavier metal conduits like intermediate metallic conduit. All of these seem like a pain to run through finished walls aside from the liquidtight flexible stuff, and that seems like a pain because of its weight and fittings.</p>

<p>ENT seems very attractive next to these: lightweight, easy to flex, easy to attach, works great with non-metallic boxes. It's allowed in damp locations (362.10(4)); the conduit run will be entirely within the wall and terminating in the rear of the box, so none of it will be exposed to the exterior or direct water.

<p>Because the house will be built according to my wishes (including electrical plans), I can pretty much choose whatever I want. But ... what do I want?</p>

<p>I want to provide at least 2 LAN sockets in each room, plus some more in the living room and underneath the staircase for central infrastructure (DSL modem, NAS, WiFi, media center). I will also have at least 2 desktop computers, three <a href=""http://slimdevices.com"">audio devices</a>, and a handful of wireless devices (laptop, smartphones).

<p><strong>What considerations should I include in my network planning?</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>I guess it would be smart to have a <strong>switch</strong>, right? I'd place it under the staircase along with the DSL modem, WiFi AP, NAS, and other central headless equipment.</li>
<li>Would a <strong>patch panel</strong> be useful, or is that only used in large office buildings?</li>

<li>What am I <strong>forgetting??</strong> There's always something that you only learn from bitter experience. I'd like a head start.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My goal</strong> is not a show-and-tell geek project. It needs to be reasonably affordable but also future-proof for the next 10-25 years as best as possible without introducing fiber or some such. </p>
","<p>You have good answers so far, but I have several items that I don't think have been covered yet. I will start by recapping.</p>

<p><strong>Number of Cables per room</strong></p>

<p>Cat5e (and cat6) can be used for telephone, both the old school phone and VoIP phones. This makes it easier to not have to worry about running as many different types of cables. I would highly suggest going with 2 cat5e + coax to every room and maybe even more to ""special"" locations. I use a TV service that can run over my network and the extra switches in each room add enough delay to cause the TV service issues. Having 2 connections in each room would have allowed me to plug the TV receiver in directly with out the extra switch, unfortunately I only have 1 cable per room so I have had to be creative with my setup.</p>

<p>The special locations to add additional cables would be places that you plan on having lots of electronics, like maybe in your living room. In my living room I have the TV, XBox, Wii, Blu-Ray player, TV receiver, and media center PC all with network capability. 6 lines probably would have been over-kill, but 4 lines would have been nice at that location. Some people also like to add extra coax in rooms that they have TVs. This can allow you to use multiple technologies such as satellite, cable, or antenna.</p>

<p>In a prior house I added 3 cat5e and 1 coax to every plate. Every room got 1 plate except for the living room and the office which both got 2 plates. This setup worked out very well for me.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gsr3m.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Location of the ""Rack""</strong></p>

<p>As for the location of the ""server closet"", a patch panel does make things much easier to plug in. It also makes it easier if you need to connect it to an old school POTS phone line. There are some structured wiring solutions (see <a href=""http://www.smarthome.com/_/Cable_Structured_Wiring/Structured_Panels_Accessories/_/v/1P3/nav.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">examples</a>) that will make your wiring a bit more geared toward home use over a patch panel. There really isn't and huge advantages of one over the other though.</p>

<p>In a prior house, I added network cables and a patch panel to a closet. This picture was taken way before I finished the job, but you will get the general idea of it. I dropped all of the cat5e out of the left conduit, the coax out of the right conduit, and the middle conduit was the ""service"" lines (ie cable from the phone company, cable company, and eventually my antenna). The conduit didn't really go anywhere other than up into the attic, it just provided a neat way to transition from the attic to the closet while being able to get above my insulation and not having it falling down into the closet. I eventually used some spray foam in the conduit to seal off the heat that I had leaking into the room from the attic.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/roLQW.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I then mounted my router and wireless access point to the wall.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2lYDj.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>There was already a shelf that is just off the bottom of the image that I placed things like my battery backup on.</p>

<p>I would recommend thinking about where your electronics will be placed. Will they be able to get enough circulation with cooled air? The last thing you want is to be replacing a modem every few months because it keeps over heating. You will also want to make sure that it is some what centrally located. This will help keep the run lengths down and thus save you money. It will also allow for you to place the wireless access point near the source of the rest of your equipment while still being in the center of the area that you are trying to cover it with. The pictures I showed were in a front entry closet that was very centralized. I had great WiFi coverage, but it would get pretty hot since there was no circulation. I did have 1 router fail, but I am not sure if it was because of the heat or not.</p>

<p><strong>Distance between Power and Data</strong></p>

<p>This distance between power and cat5e isn't a huge deal. 1 foot apart is probably more than enough, but to be safe you could go 16 inches or more. I am not sure how your house can have no studs, but getting it to the other side of what ever is supporting your walls is typically plenty.</p>

<p><strong>Future Proofing</strong></p>

<p>If you are really wanting to be future proof, you could run conduit to every location that you have Cat5e running to. This will make it very easy to add new cabling if in lets say 20 years everyone is running fiber to everything. It will add more cost, but potentially you could run less of the ""just in case lines"" and wait to run those until you actually need them. Probably wont offset the cost completely, but at least something to think about.</p>

<p>Depending on your setup, a straight run of conduit into the attic might work perfectly fine, or you might need to run it all of the way back to the ""rack"". Whatever the case is, make sure you will be able to easily get new cable into the conduit. This may be leaving a pull line in the conduit or enough room to use a pull rod in the conduit.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>As a side note, my personal feel is to put everything wired as I possibly can. This makes the performance of my wireless devices (laptops, phones, etc) much better and the wired devices much much better. As for the switches used to get up to the number of hardwired connections you need, the rule of thumb you should follow is the less switches the better. You would be a lot better off spending some money on a single larger switch than to have a bunch of smaller switches wired together to get you up to the count you need. It will typically work having many switches, but it is a nightmare to troubleshoot if anything starts acting up.</p>

My concern about this is wont the bleach run off the roof and kill my grass?  Or worse get into my septic tank or well water?</p>

<p>Is the bleach mix safe or is there another method?</p>
","<p>The bleach mix will be dilute enough that it will not be of harm. I've used it myself at least a few times to kill off algae that has accumulated.</p>

<p>You can also use things like Oxy-Boost and Stain Solver, a bleach substitute which I believe contains some hydrogen peroxide. It will also work against light moss and algae, yet perhaps be less harmful to plant life underneath.</p>

<p>More importantly is to fix the source of the moss. Roofs that gather moss tend to be too shaded, under big trees that stop it from drying out. You may need to open things up, just by a bit, but enough to let it dry out. Yes, those trees are a natural source of air conditioning, but trees tend to grow. So trim off branches that overhang the roof. Cut a few others out to let the sun in.</p>

<p>For roofs that have only a bit of green, you may find it is sufficient to add zinc strips along the top. The zinc leaches out, keeping the roof clean of moss accumulation. There are also shingles with a moss inhibiting additive that prevents moss from growing. Copper strips should also work, and copper flashing is easily available. I've even read that you can glue (use silicone) copper pennies just under the edge of the top row of shingles. They are mainly zinc anyway.</p>

<p>If the moss had accumulated heavily, the problem is your roof likely needs repair, as it will have been too wet for too long. The shingles will need to be stripped off and replaced, but probably the roof decking will be soft and need some repair too. This can best be judged by a professional who will inspect the roof carefully.</p>

"How to prevent heavy rainwater from jumping the gutter?","29341","","<p>During heavy rain, the water collects from my second floor roof and runs onto the first floor roof as it should. The problem is that since all this water is now concentrated from the second floor downspout, the heavy volume causes it to race down the first floor roof and ""jump over"" the gutter.</p>

<p>Is there any way to prevent this from happening and to what extent is this a normal, unavoidable result of the heavy rainfall?</p>

<p>I've looked at ""gusher guards"" but was warned that these might cause damage to the gutters once Winter hits from the snow and ice pulling at them. I'm in Michigan, so lots of snow and ice. I've also considered adding an extension to the second floor downspout so the water is dumped directly where it should be, but I'm afraid it'll stick out like a sore thumb and look janky.</p>

<p>Any suggestions? Is there a ""standard"" way of dealing with this situation?</p>

","<p>This is a common mistake, which will lead to premature roof wear.  What the installer <strong>should</strong> have done, was to install an A to B transition elbow, and continued down the roof with a section of down spout. Then used an A elbow to have the water dump directly into the lower gutter.</p>

<p>It should end up similar to this</p>

<p><img src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.sidebox.com/0AD85FDB-E00F-4D84-8F04-C75D80586817/154764.jpg"" alt=""proper downspout on roof""></p>

<p>Allowing the high volume of water to flow over the roof, will damage the shingles and cause them to wear prematurely.  Even if you turn the spout adjacent to the slope, it will still cause damage to the roofing. Spreading the flow over the roof in this way, will not alleviate the damage that is caused.  In either case, you're allowing all the water shed from the upper roof, to flow over a small section of the lower roof. It's a terrible idea, and should be avoided.</p>

<p>I'm not sure exactly when builders decided to try and save the $10, by not installing the downspout along the roof. But it makes me so sick every time I see it, I just want to climb up there and fix it myself.</p>

"How do I deal with Particle Board Subfloors and Hardwood Flooring?","29239","","<p>The house I recently purchased, built in 1973, has particle board subfloors.  To clarify, this is not OSB and this is not just a particle board overlay over plywood -- the entire subfloor is 3/4"" particle board (looks like oatmeal).</p>

<p>There are several issues with this subfloor: the floors are creaky and warped in places and I've been strongly advised not to install hardwood floors over particle board, as they cannot hold nails and will deteriorate if water is spilled.  I purchased hardwood floors (pre-finished 3/4"").  Now I need to either 1.  remove the particle board or 2. nail plywood over the particle board.  I'm opting to remove it because with option ""2"" I'll end up with undesirable height differences in places.  </p>

<p>The problem with removing it is the existing subfloor runs under the interior walls, so once I cut it out and add new, there won't be any support where it overlaps the joists.  Additionally, if the interior wall is not sitting on a joist, it could drop.  This problem also occurs for doors and closets.  To solve this I could install blocking, but then this could get very labor intensive.  Another option is to cut along the joist and leave a margin of particle board along the walls.  I could leave particle board in the closets since there is no load there.</p>

<p>Another component to this problem is in the kitchen.  The previous seller put in new cabinetry and granite counter tops.  I don't really want to tear out the cabinets due to the expense.  I could cut the subfloor out around the cabinet but then have the problem of what is supporting the cabinets (parallel with joists).</p>

<p>I'd appreciate to hear from anyone that has ideas on the best way to proceed.</p>
","<p>If possible, try framing out the edges. I would remove all of the existing sub floor (since it is particle board) and then add addition framing along the edges as needed for the new plywood.  In cases where you can't meet a joist, go perpindicular and create a nice foundation for the floor to attach too.</p>

<p>I would make sure the floor has a firm foundation.  It might be extra work to do it, but I would take those extra steps if possible.</p>

","<p>There is quite the extreme possibility there has been permanent damage done. 4 cycle engines do not need oil mixed with the gas to provide lubrication, since it has oil in the crankcase.
Two cycle engines have to have oil mixed in the gas to provide the lubrication needed, since there is no oil in the sump. When you used the 4 cycle gas, there was no much needed oil mixed with the gas.

","<p>The only place tape is to be used is on threads, to be exact, tapered threads, the kind that are on pipe nipples, or the male threaded ends of valves for example. These are the kind that get tighter as you twist the parts together. If you look at the threaded end you can see the pipe is smaller at the end than farther down the length. Pipe dope can be used on these threads too. Pipe dope, otherwise can be used on the various types of compression fittings, the type that use a ferrule. When using metal pipe the type of pipe dope is not that critical, but if using plastic, be careful, there is pipe dope NOT for plastic.<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aEMxk.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In a nut shell, tape is for tapered threads only, dope can be used too. and either must be used or a leak will occur. Dope is to be used only on mating surfaces, flat, smooth or rounded. It is mainly insurance in my opinion, and I use it too, but the mating surfaces should make a tight fit on their own. I have had a many a leak before using dope, now the leaks are non-existent.

"How often do septic tanks typically need to be pumped?","29144","","<p>At the risk of potentially asking an off-topic question, I'd like to better understand the maintenance of a septic tank.  I've never had one before and am unfamiliar with how to manage one. </p>

<p>My primary question is: how often do septic tanks need to be pumped? We're looking to buy a 4/2 house with a concrete septic tank ""supposedly"" with a capacity of 2250. </p>

<p>My secondary question is: how should septic tanks monitored? Just an annual scheduled service check-up? I don't want to spend money needlessly but also don't want to neglect something that needs regular attention. </p>
","<p>The pumping question depends on your local codes.  In our area, a brand new tank is good for 5 years before it needs to be pumped.  A non-new tank must be pumped every 3 years.  This is pretty typical.</p>

<p>I would say that tank monitoring will vary depending on your system.  A septic tank is a pretty simple system.  You have a primary tank (some call it a settling tank) that settles any solids out of the wastewater, and where most of your breakdown occurs (a well operating system will have natural occurring bacteria that do a good job of breaking down ""solid"" waste).  As an aside, this settled goo is the majority of what is pumped out when the pump guy comes.</p>

<p>Usually, there is a second tank that is gravity fed, where the now ""grey water"" flows.  From here, the grey water sits for a while (more breakdown occurs here) and it either feeds by gravity to a drain field, where it filters through the ground, or, it is pumped to a mound/elevated drain field.</p>

<p>In a simple non-pump system, you want to watch out for clogging in the outlets to the secondary tank and to the drain field.  This can be done pretty easily- when you have the manhole covers replaced, ask the guy doing the work for you to tell you how for down from the top of the manhole, the drain is.  Now, as often as you want, put a stick down the manhole, and see how deep the water is.  If the water is above the drain, you have a blockage, and it should be serviced.</p>

<p>If you have a system with a pump, I'd highly recommend getting an alarm if one isn't installed already.  The alarms will alert you if the level of the water goes above a specified height, which indicates a clogged pump or filter.</p>

<p>My recommendation would be to do your own monitoring (checking water level) as often as makes you comfortable, and have a scheduled service every 2-3 years.</p>

<p>More important than monitoring however, is making sure you are diligent with prevention.  Use as little toilet paper as is practical, and stay away from quilted TP.  Additionally, nothing but toilet waste, water, and TP should EVER go down your drains (the exception to this is if you have a food disposer, but even then, I'd use the disposal sparingly).  Also, try not to use too harsh of chemicals when doing cleaning of your sinks/toilets/showers, and NEVER use draino.. there are cleaning products that are septic friendly, and septic friendly drain de-cloggers.  Use them.  This keeps the bacterial ecosystem breaking down your waste, nice and happy, which is a good thing.</p>

Here is what I tried:</p>

<p>So Far:</p>

<li>Check Air Filter / intake for clogs</li>
<li>Check Fuel Filter / to cylinder.</li>

","<p>Most two cycle engines are sensitive to the newer gasoline blends that can contain up to 10% ethanol. Get a small bottle of fuel additive for small engines and add a small amount of that into your gas tank. It should run a lot better after that.

<p>If you are still having trouble and you have already checked the spark plugs, sometimes the magneto can have a buildup of rust on the surface that prevents it from generating enough current to sustain repeated firing of the spark plug as the engine turns.  Take apart the pull start mechanism on the chainsaw until the magneto is exposed, and take a fine grit sandpaper to it to rub off all the rust that has formed on it by sitting all these years.  To clarify the magneto is the part that is magnetic, it should grab your screwdriver.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lumber - Comes most commonly in 2 inch (2x4,6,8,10,12,16) and 4 inch (4x4,4x6) varieties. </li>
<li>Plywood - Almost always 4x8 feet </li>
<li>Drywall/Plasterboard - Various 4 foot varieties (4x8,10,12) and sometimes 5 foot.</li>
</ul>

<p>Walls are typically framed with studs 16 inches on center, rafters and joists usually the same, but sometimes 24 inches on center.  Ceilings are usually 8 feet high, or 10 feet in lots of newer construction.</p>

<p>How does this work in the metric world?</p>
","<p>In Canada, while officially we are metric, all the construction work I've been around is done almost entirely in imperial. Everything comes in the same dimensions, and is referred to in feet and inches. Framing is done 16 or 24"" on center, standard ceilings are 8' high. </p>

<p>Part of this may just be a hold-over from years of everyone doing that way, and then passing that on as they teach younger tradespeople. In school, I grew up learning the metric system, with the most exposure to feet/inches while doing fractions in math class. </p>

<p>I think part of it has to do with convenience and standardization as well: a ""1.22 x 2.44m plywood"" is awkward to say, and changing the dimensions slightly to 1.25 x 2.5 m would be strange. 16"" (0.406m) centers is about the right distance for drywall, and so if you had 1.25m sheets of drywall, your centers would have to be 0.416m (or 16.4"") to work out.. that's awkward to deal with. </p>

<p>Personally, I use a tape measure that has both centimeters and feet/inches on it, and often use cm if I'm measuring any more accurately than 1/8"". One thing imperial has going for it, is the foot is a very handy size. There is no equivalent in metric (the decimeter (10cm / 0.1m / 3.9"") is too small (plus no one ever says the word ""decimeter""), while the meter (3.28ft) is too big).</p>

","<p>My immediate vote is for a pressure washer. They are relatively cheap these days. Lacking that, a simple high pressure hose nozzle and a good stiff brush will do well too. Various oxidizing bleaches will also work, all of which will last for only a limited time.</p>

<p>To stop it from returning is difficult, since any moist, shady spot under a tree or bush is likely to grow moss and algae of this sort.</p>

<p>One idea is to remove the overhanging growth from the planters. Trim them back. This will help the brick pavers to dry out, and will reduce the tendency for unwanted growth.</p>

<p>Another idea is to get creative, and buy some zinc strips. Copper flashing might work too, but they sell zinc strips specifically for roofing applications, where moss and algae tends to grow on roofs. The elemental zinc leaches out (very slowly) when it rains, which in turn inhibits growth of the algae where it leaches out. So you could afix these strips to the bottom edges of your planter. Make it decorative and it should help, although I cannot assure it will work perfectly. At least this will inhibit the moss.</p>

<p>Another idea is to buy/make a few copper pots or planters. Place them decoratively right on top of the problem spots. As the copper leaches out from weathering over the years, it too will inhibit growth on the walkway, you not be a problem for larger plants in the area. If you cannot find a pot you like, you can make a planter from wood, but then wrap copper flashing around it, nailing it in place.</p>

<p>Be creative if you wish to inhibit the growth.</p>

"low voltage from circuit - bad breaker?","28895","","<p><strong>Background:</strong> I'm doing some rewiring work in the kitchen. There were three circuits coming into a junction box that controlled the sink disposal, dishwasher, a few receptacles and a light. So I got everything the way I want, and the dishwasher circuit seems like it's dead. First thought is bad wiring, so I rechecked everything - no issues. Next thought, there's a GFCI upstream that I tripped while I was working (I've wasted a few hours on that problem before). But an ohmmeter check on the common/ground says no GFCI tripped. So I recalibrated my voltmeter and tested the line again and lo and behold, there is some power, but only about 20V.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: could the breaker really have gone bad while I was working on the junction box? Everything I know says it's <em>possible</em> but extraordinarily unlikely. I've even replaced a breaker before thinking it had gone bad, and it turned out not to be the problem after all. So before I do it again, is there anything else I'm missing?</p>
","<p>These kinds of problems are very difficult to diagnose without being on site. Rather than guessing at a single fix, let me give you a process to follow.  Think of electricity as a closed water system, with hot water coming in and cold water draining out. What we are looking for is a leak in the system. I'd start at the breaker. Check the load screw to the ground/neutral buss. 120vac ok? yes, then we move further down the line to the next possible junction point. At each subsequent point, check your hot side to neutral and to ground until you find the point where there is no longer a proper 120vac measurement. When you find this point, if you have 120 hot to ground, but not to the neutral, you have an open neutral. Turn OFF the power and check the neutral to ground with an ohm meter. It should be very close to 0 ohms.  If you see no voltage to either neutral or ground, and the neutral to ground is 0 ohms, then you have an open hot.  Check the input side of the GFIC and the load side in a similar method.  If you try to follow a very straight logic, testing the three possibilites at each point,(open ground/open neutral/open hot) hopefully you will find the culprit.   Good Luck </p>

<p>Edit:  I live in Colorado if that makes any difference and I think the wire size is #6 for THHN and #4 for NM-B.</p>
","<p>The wiring will have to be in some form of raceway the entire run. If you're using Non-metallic sheathed cable, the jacket fulfills this requirement. If you're running individual conductors, you'll have to use conduit or some other approved raceway.</p>

<p>As for conductor size. If you can meet all the requirements for using the 90&deg;C column, you'll be able to use 6 AWG copper for the run. However, since you're less than 100 amperes, you're likely going to be using the 60&deg;C column. This means whether you use single conductors or a cable assembly, you're still going to have to use 4 AWG conductors.</p>

<p>What's the best/most logical order of operations?  Should I dig out the weeds and plant grass seed?  What other steps would be required?

"Persistent sewage smell coming from basement drain","28846","","<p>I've recently purchased a house and am now learning all the ins and outs of home maintenance.  This summer, I've noticed that I have a very smelly basement drain.  Particularly, it smells like sewage.</p>

<p>I figured that this wasn't a problem, in that the majority of things I've read state that it simply needs to have water poured in (with or without Mr. Clean) to replace the dried out water in the trap.</p>

<p>This worked fine last year, however this year the smell is back, and far worse.  Now, I am essentially pouring water down the pipe every other day to flush the smell.  The problem, however, is that it is also ridiculously hot where I am, so we have to run the A/C quite often.  As the drain stinks up the basement, that lovely smell gets pulled into the A/C ducts in the basement and then vented throughout the house.</p>

<p>My question is....is this common for this sort of drain?  I can't really get my hand into the pipe itself (probably about 3in in diameter), so I can't really see if there is a plug that needs to be checked.  I hesitate to call a plumber if it is trivial, but the persistent poo smell is starting to drive us nuts.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>My wife and I went through the house, flushing toilets and watching the water in the drains.  Not a ripple for any flushes.</p>

<p><strong>Second edit</strong></p>

<p>Flushed down some Mr. Clean / water mixture and, while it kept the smell at bay for a few days, it is starting to come back.  I believe that a plumber is definitely in our future, as I've exhausted the helpful advice provided.</p>
","<p>You are correct that floor drains do need to be monitored and occasionally the trap refilled with water.</p>

<p>So the first thing to check is that your floor drain actually has a trap. The way to do that is to slowly pour water in to the drain. You should notice the water level rise and stay there. If the water disappears quickly then it's likely you don't have a trap.</p>

<p>Provided that the drain does have a trap, the next thing to figure out is why the trap is emptying so quickly. A common cause is something wrong with your vent stack. Problems can range from a blockage, to an improperly vented drain elsewhere, to no venting at all.</p>

<p>A good way to test your vent stack is to flush each toilet one at a time. Enlist a helper and keep an eye on the water in the trap. If one toilet causes the water in the trap to move significantly or drain completely, you have found your problem fixture or vent stack. Fixing this could be as simple as running a garden hose up to your roof and down that vent stack to clear the blockage.</p>

<p>If climbing on the roof is not for you, then a standard house-call charge from a plumber will likely fix it, and that's not usually too expensive.</p>

<p>But if a fixture is incorrectly plumbed or inadequately vented, that can get pricey.</p>

"Why does hot water come from the faucet when only the cold water tap is on?","28785","","<p>On occasion, when I open the cold water tap on the kitchen sink, the flow from the faucet briefly becomes warm: it starts cool, becomes warm for about 30 seconds, and then returns to the desired cold temperature.</p>

<p>I have only observed this to happen early in the morning, when the plumbing has not been in use all night.  It seems to happen no more than once in a day.  What could be the reason for this?</p>
","<p>There are a few possible reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some hot water recirculation systems use the cold water as a return. In these systems, warm water is returned in the cold water pipe until hot water reaches the the temperature valve that controls the recirculation. Or, perhaps the one-way valve near the pump is failing.</p></li>
<li><p>Hot water pipes could be touching a cold water pipe (probably near the water heater). The two pipes touching would heat up the cold water pipe.</p></li>
<li><p>Cold water pipes could be touching a ventilation duct. In the winter, the duct would be warm and would heat up the cold water.</p></li>
<li><p>No heat trap in the water heater inlet. Hot water might flow up out of the water heater into the cold water pipes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the morning, try to feel which parts of the cold water pipe are hot, and that'll be your answer.</p>

<p>Another thing to check, but is likely unrelated, is the condition of a water expansion tank (generally mounted near the water heater) if you have one, or contemplate installing one if you do not (they're needed if you have a pressure reducing valve or a one-way valve in your water meter).</p>

"Is it bad to turn off the water while on vacation?","28734","","<p>I'm a little OCD when it comes to traveling. I have learned from experience that when I am away, I constantly have visions that a pipe in the wall had burst and that the water is slowly filling the house.

","<p>Nothing bad should happen and it's not an irrational thing to do. </p>

<p>Turn the main valve slowly (both when turning off and on) to avoid possible water hammer effect that could stress pipe connections. </p>

"How do I safely get glue off of wood that's to be stained?","28731","","<p>I'm building a closet and I've just made doors for it.

I was a little careless and some of the wood glue (Titebond) escaped through the joints and are visible outside (see the picture on the right). </p>

<p>Normally, I would just sand it off if it was on a flat surface, but given that they're in the corners (and a little on the sides), it'll be harder to sand without gouging. I plan on staining it and am wondering what would be the best approach to removing the glue so that the wood will absorb the stain without any patchiness.</p>

<p>I was thinking that some cotton wool lightly dipped in mineral spirits should be sufficient to remove the glue, without any effect on the wood. Is this a good approach? Are there alternatives to this?</p>

","<p>The best time to remove glue that squeezes out is about 30-60 minutes after the glue-up.  At this point it's still soft enough that you can easily scrape it off but it's stiff enough that it won't smear and make more of a mess.  When it's past that point and you realize you still missed some, the best solution is still to scrape with a card scraper and/or sand it.   </p>

<p>Scraping works really well if it has only been a day or less and the glue is not yet rock hard.  You should be able to sand by hand if you are worried about overdoing the sanding and gouging the wood.  Use a flat sanding block for the flat areas and a foam-backed block for the curved parts.  For the corners you can fold your sandpaper and back it with your fingers.</p>

<p>I don't think mineral spirits are likely to remove dried Titebond, and if you get a solvent that can dissolve it, how will you keep from just smearing it around into larger patches?  This will be especially a problem on red oak, because of the large pores of the wood that will trap the dissolved glue.  If you go this route anyway, I suggest trying it on some scrap before the real project to make sure it works as desired.</p>

"Is there a length limit on grounding conductor to ground rod?","28660","","<p>My service panel is over a concrete patio, it was improperly grounded  in the crawlspace. I cannot drive a proper ground rod in the crawlspace so I would like to drive one into the earth on the side of the house. This would place the rod about 20' away.</p>

<p>Is there a limit to the length of the ground conductor from the panel to the rod?</p>
","<p>This answer is mostly based on the United States electrical system, and the answer may vary depending on where you are.</p>

<p>The NEC code specifies that a solid copper wire used to connect to a ground rod must be at least either #6 or #8 gauge (depending on the size of your electrical service cable). #6 cable cable will always satisfy the sizing requirement, though in some cases larger is desirable. The NEC doesn't specify a limit as to the maximum length. Of course, shorter is better.</p>

<p>Aluminum cable is permissible with larger minimum sizes, though I'd avoid it due its corrosion properties.</p>

<p>The grounding system serves a few different purposes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make the voltage of the land around your house be at approximately the same voltage as your power line neutral. This means that you can't shock yourself by holding an appliance in one hand and touching the earth with your feet.</li>
<li>A fault path during lightning storms. When lightning strikes near your house, it energizes your electrical lines. Surge suppressors will try to shunt the voltage to the neutral or ground line. Having a good ground will maximize the power transfer out of your house.</li>
<li>Safety. If the neutral going to your house is disconnected and you don't have a ground to neutral bond in your main panel, both prongs of each electric outlet in your house will have the full line voltage on it. Older appliances will connect their chassis to neutral, causing their chassis to hold 120V. With the grounding system properly connected, the ground will pull the neutral closer to 0 V, reducing the risk of shock.</li>
<li>Radio antenna. Many radio antennas use the ground to help transmit their signals.</li>
<li>Noise reduction. The power lines have a lot of ""noise"" on them. Having a good ground connection will reduce the noise that your equipment has to deal with.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, what resistance to ground should you want? The smaller, the better. The electrical code states that with one ground rod, it must have a maximum resistance of 25 ohms to the earth.  According to a <a href=""http://support.fluke.com/find-sales/Download/Asset/2633834_6115_ENG_A_W.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">Fluke brochure</a>, you should try to have a ground to earth resistance of less than 25 ohms, or less than 5 ohms for sensitive electrical equipment.</p>

<p>#6 gauge solid copper is approx <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge"" rel=""nofollow"">0.4 ohm/thousand feet</a>, so having a run of thirty feet will add minimal extra resistance (about 0.008 ohm). But, it will somewhat reduce the effectiveness of your system during a lightning storm. For the best lightning protection, your grounding wires should not have any sharp bends. This is because lightning is a very high frequency signal, and the wire's impedance increases with frequency. The 0.4 ohm/thousand feet figure is only valid at DC (zero frequency). While sharp bends do not increase the DC resistance, it does increase the high frequency impedance.</p>

<p>As far as a suggestion, for a ""normal"" house, I'd use solid #4 copper to two 8 foot long copper-plated ground rods which are placed 16 feet apart, and driven so that they are completely underground. Welding your ground wire to your ground rods is best (for example, with a product such as CadWeld's One Shot), but ""Acorn"" clamps are acceptable to use. The welded connection is more corrosion resistant than the mechanical clamp conection. Also, ensure that your water pipes are also attached to your grounding system. Your neutral should connect to the grounding system at the service entrance (generally the main breaker panel), and in no other location.</p>

<p>There is a limit on the length of the wire connecting a cable TV co-ax shield to your house's grounding system. It must be no more than 20 ft long, unless there is an additional ground rod (see NEC 220.100 for details), though I'm not sure if this would be the distance to your main panel, or to your ground rod.</p>

<p>There are many other rules that I have not mentioned (read the NEC book (NFPA 70) or your local code for details). As always, use caution when working around electrical systems.</p>

This would be the most outwardly visible solution however it should fix it. The item looks like a vacuum relief valve but works a bit differently; it's a valve that is 3-way valve that has a pass through, your main water flow, and a vent. The vent is open when there isn't any pressure, or very low, to allow any small pressure build ups after the shower to simply vent and it would close with pressure so it wouldn't spray water during your shower. This should be installed at the highest point of the water, right before your faucet should be fine, and pointed up as it should only vent air. After you shut your shower off this would open and allow you to drain the line, just lower the head/wand; now if you have any water leak past the valve it would have to fill the line before over flowing, a ball valve one wouldn't even overflow.

Since the window didn't have trim around the outside, the chair rail kind of dead ends without any end piece. </p>

<p>Here's a photo:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vDVCG.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to finish this? I know it would typically be cut at a 45° bevel, but since it's hollow behind the rail, it wouldn't look right unless it was caulked or spackled.</p>
","<p>You could do this as an outside corner, with just a little piece of rail. </p>

<p>I did this with some baseboard right beside a closet (that I didn't want to put trim around), and it turned out well. (Taking this picture also reminds me, I never did quite finish cleaning this all up). </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RcJL6.png"" alt=""baseboard outside corner""></p>

<p>The hardest part of doing this is cutting the edge piece so you get a perfect corner. </p>

<ol>
<li>Cut the piece (usually there's a scarp piece around that will work). Go longer rather than shorter.</li>
<li>Use wood glue or a construction adhesive (like No More Nails) and a clamp to attach it, with the edges meeting. Let it sit overnight to dry.</li>
<li>Sand off any excess glue that came out.</li>
<li>If needed, sand down the back side so it's flat (if you cut it a bit too long). A couple seconds on a belt sander is perfect.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's really all there is to it. In your case, you may want to also sand down the front corner a bit so it's smoother, rather than sharp and likely to poke someone.</p>

<p>In my research into the above it has become apparant that I should consider replacing the old thermostat with a programmable one for energy savings. How does a programmable thermostat produce savings? I assumed the whole point of the thermostat in the first place was that the heating wouldn't be on if it was below the desired level anyway.</p>
","<p>To answer the first question:</p>

<p>Replacing the thermostat is equivalent to changing a light switch.</p>

<p>You need to turn the power to the central heating off before you start work.</p>

<p>Unscrew the old thermostat, disconnect and then reconnect the new one. What you will need to make sure before you do this is that the new thermostat has the same terminals as the old.</p>

"Are generator interlock kits permitted in residential applications?","28239","","<p>There have been some questions on the site lately, that reference using interlock kits with portable generators. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XiLFQ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XiLFQm.jpg"" alt=""Interlock in service panel""></a></p>

<p>This has inspired me to read through article <em>702 Optional Standby Systems</em> of the NEC (which is short so it wasn't much effort), where I found the following items that seem relevant. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NEC 2008</strong><br>
  <strong>702.5 Capacity and Rating.</strong><br>
  <strong>(B) System Capacity.</strong><br>
  <strong>(1) Manual Transfer Equipment.</strong>  Where manual transfer equipment is used, an optional standby system shall have adequate capacity and
  rating for the supply of all equipment intended to be operated at one
  time. The user of the optional standby system shall be permitted to
  select the load connected to the system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in the case of an interlock, would the generator have to be rated to supply the whole house, or only the items the user wants to run (which could change at any time)?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>702.6 Transfer Equipment.</strong> Transfer equipment shall be suitable for the intended use and designed and installed so as to prevent the
  inadvertent interconnection of normal and alternate sources of supply
  in any operation of the transfer equipment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A properly installed interlock seems to meet this requirement, so there's nothing here to prevent one. However, there is an exception to this section which may disallow the use of interlocks in residential systems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Exception:</strong> Temporary connection of a portable generator without transfer equipment shall be permitted where conditions of maintenance
  and supervision ensure that only qualified persons service the
  installation and where the normal supply is physically isolated by a
  lockable disconnecting means or by disconnection of the normal supply
  conductors.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my mind, this sentence ""<em>where conditions of maintenance and supervision ensure that only qualified persons service the installation</em>"". Would mean an interlock cannot be installed in a residential panel, because there is no way to prevent the homeowner from servicing the installation.</p>

<p>Are interlocks a cheap and easy solution for homeowners, or can they not be used in residential situations?</p>

<h1>Update</h1>

<p>I found this interesting response in <a href=""http://www.electrical-contractor.net/forums/ubbthreads.php/topics/75334/2/Generator_Interlock.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this thread</a>, on the <a href=""http://www.electrical-contractor.net/forums/ubbthreads.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Electrical Contractor Network Forum</a>.

<p>Which basically says the device is NEC compliant because it's the user that is the transfer equipment, not the device. </p>

<p>I also found this semi-related, not relevant to the question at hand, section in the NEC.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>408.36 Overcurrent Protection.</strong><br>
  <strong>(D) Back-Fed Devices.</strong> Plug-in-type overcurrent protection devices or plug-in type main lug assemblies that are backfed and used to
  terminate field-installed ungrounded supply conductors shall be
  secured in place by an additional fastener that requires other than a
  pull to release the device from the mounting means on the panel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which means if you're backfeeding through a breaker, you'll need to strap the breaker in place somehow.</p>
","<p>It seems the decision is ultimately in the hands of the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ), as long as ""<em>equivalent objectives can be achieved</em>"" using the device.</p>

<blockquote>

<h1>WARNING</h1>

<p>While these devices may or may not be approved by the AHJ, they are not the best solution available.  They do not prevent the user from overloading the generator, since the load selection is made by the user dynamically during operation. The better, safer solution, is to install manual or automatic transfer switches. This allows you to pre-select the loads making it a more user friendly solution.</p>

<p>Last worked one month ago.<br>
Now, I pull and pull, but engine won't start (doesn't even sound like it tries)</p>

<p>This <a href=""https://youtu.be/NU_ClhSoaQM?t=172"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube video</a> @ 2:53 is how my lawn mower sounds and acts. Later on the guy sprays some stuff into the engine and shows how it will start and cut off. My lawn mower won't even do that.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Aside from checking/changing the spark plug, is there anything else I can do or should I just figure out how to load the thing in my car and have it serviced?</p>

<p>Troubleshooting steps I've done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drained the oil and put new SAE 30 in.</li>
<li>Drained the fuel and put new fuel in (fresh from gas station).</li>
<li>Watched a youtube video saying use 13/16 inch spark plug </li>
<li>Looked up accessories for mower on Home Depot and was recommended <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/Champion-13-16-in-RJ19LM-Spark-Plug-for-4-Cycle-Engines-868-1/202323892?quantity=1&amp;str_nbr=0585"" rel=""nofollow"">13/16 spark plug</a></li>
<li><strong>Purchased</strong> the spark plug and a 13/16 spark plug socket</li>
<li>Tried to remove the spark plug with purchased socket and the socket was too damn big</li>
<li>Much shakes fist, very frustration</li>
<li>Plugged the spark plug wire back into spark plug and tried to start</li>
<li>Pulled a few times and back at square one</li>
</ul>

<p>More troubleshooting with DIY users help:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've verified blue spark by unscrewing the spark plug from the engine, stuck it back into the ""lead"" (the cable that was plugged into the spark plug), and pulled a few times. </li>
</ul>

<p>I can turn it in for warranty but its heavy and I'd prefer to know how to fix this instead of having to lug it back to Home Depot and wait who knows how long for them to fix it. Next thing I'm going to do is see if I can at least get the socket right so I can check the spark plug. Local Home Depot does not sell the spark plug itself, gotta order it.</p>

<p>EDIT: while I was at home depot to get a new socket and some cleaner, the dude told me i needed to look at the spark plug in order to see which one it is. Turns out its an AUTOLITE 3924 in case anyone else needs to get one. Alts are the <code>Champion 5/8in RC12YC</code> and the <code>E3.20</code></p>
","<p>We need to divide the problem in half. In the case of an engine we need to decide if it's not starting because of gas or spark. Too test the engine for spark your going to need an extra set of hands or some electrical tools. If you have help you can have some one hold the spark plug wire close to the spark plug while you pull the string. If electricity is getting to the spark plug you will see a spark jump from the wire too the sparkplug. IF you see a spark we can now trouble shoot the fuel.</p>

<p>The easiest way to check the fuel would be to buy a can of ether, that is what the guy in the video sprayed into the engine. If it runs for a couple seconds (or even acts like its about to start) then we know the problem is with the carburetor or fuel system in general. </p>

<p>If you complete these next steps please come back and +1 my answer(so I get a notification) and I will continue to assist you in trouble shooting. Regardless if it's spark on fuel the trouble shooting only get more and more complex from here. I would replace the spark plug and if that doesn't work I would look at calling Home Depot, they might even pick the lawn mover up for you. They are good people.</p>

"Can I install recessed lighting in vaulted ceiling with 6"" rafters?","28143","","<p>I would like to install recessed lighting in my vaulted ceiling.  One contractor I spoke with suggested not doing that because the rafters are shallow (only 6 inches), which does not leave much room for the light housing and not much room for insulation and a channel for moisture to escape.  Basically it will compromise the insulation of the roof. I already have ice dams that build up when there is heavy snow, so I don't want to add to the insulation problems. Any ideas as to if this can be done safely with 6"" of roof to work with?  I would be using insulated lighting (ICAT).</p>
","<p>You can install a shallow 6"" can made for 2x6 construction.  Halo H27ICAT is the 6"" you can use.  Lots of manufacturers make these shallow cans.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7C52B.jpg"" alt=""H27ICAT""> </p>

<p>You can use regular incandescent, fluorescent and LED lamps and have a large selection of trims.  The only drawback is you can't use taller lamps or they might stick out the bottom.  The most common is the 50PAR30 / 75R30 style lamps.  These are also made in remodel style in case the ceiling is already up.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cooperindustries.com/content/dam/public/lighting/products/documents/halo/spec_sheets/adv051278.pdf"">Here is the spec sheet for the H27</a></p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT</em></strong></p>

<p>I'll give this another try.  I originally deleted this answer because it is not a slope can.  Where I work, some people use regular can lights and use adjustable trims.  Because of the depth you have, 8 inches, this can is 5-1/2 inches.  I suggest you use a gimbal ring trim.  It works like a eyeball, but the lamp is recessed so you don't get that 'bug eye' some people associate with eyeball trims.  You can get the above can in 5 inch or 6 inch round cans, both IC rated, depending on the manufacturer your supplier uses.  Think about a trim like this.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjMtr.jpg"" alt=""Gimbal Ring""></p>

<p>Make sure you use the same manufacturer as the can and trim to cover yourself.  This gives you 2-1/2 inches for your channel and insulation.  If this doesn't float your boat try going to a local lighting showroom and look at what they might have.  If you want recessed you will find what you want. Consider LEDs to keep from getting the ladder out if your slope gives you a tall ceiling.  While considerably more, doing it all together will be less painful.  Either way PAR30 Halogen or PAR30 LEDs offer different beam spreads, so you can at least do something with the lighting.The biggest problem is you can't shine the light back to the wall, mostly straight down or with the angle the can is hung, not backwards.  If you choose this, don't forget the dimmers!</p>

"Is there a motion sensor light switch that does not need ground?","28126","","<p>My house was built in early 1950's and all electrical switches do not have a ground.
This was found out with an electrician when I asked them to install <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B005WM3C42"" rel=""nofollow"">Lutron Maestro</a>, but it would not power on since there was no ground to connect it to.</p>

<p>His suggestion was to find a motion sensing light switch that did not need ground, but he could not make a recommendation off-hand.</p>

<p>Do motion sensing light switches that do not require ground exist? Or do I have to build/rig them somehow. Unfortunately, due to cost, I cannot afford to add ground wires to the areas of the house that I need these at.</p>

<p>EDIT
The electrician connected the Meastro unit then attempted to turn it on. Pressing the button or moving in front of the sensor did not turn it on. He also attempted to connect the unit's ground to either neutral or hot, but did not work either (I can't recall which). Guess I have to spend the loot and run ground wire :(</p>
","<p>Occupancy sensors, timers, dimmers, and other ""smart"" switches often are required to be independently powered. If you look at this diagram from the <a href=""http://www.lutron.com/TechnicalDocumentLibrary/369666.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">devices documentation (PDF)</a>, you'll see that there are three ways this requirement is achieved.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xOujm.png"" alt=""Selection Matrix""></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Neutral Wire Required</h1>

<p>The first method, is to simply require a neural wire.  In this configuration, the device draws power using the ungrounded (hot) conductor and grounded (neutral) conductor. It also has a separate switched conductor, that it uses to control the load.</p>

<p>This setup would be wired like this...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0LySs.png"" alt=""Neutral Wire Required Wiring""></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Minimum Load Required</h1>

<p>This method draws power using the ungrounded (hot) conductor, and the switched conductor.  So the device is actually in line with the load.</p>

<p>This setup is wired like this...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vEYBW.png"" alt=""Load Required Wiring""></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Ground Wire Required</h1>

<p>This method draws power using the ungrounded (hot) conductor, and the grounding conductor.  It's wired similar to the <strong>Neutral Required</strong> devices, however, it uses the grounding conductor instead of the grounded conductor.  This means that there will be a small amount of current on the grounding conductor, and that the grounding conductor is required for the device to operate.</p>

<p>This setup would be wired like this...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/O72DX.png"" alt=""Ground Required Wiring""></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Notice there's a bare, <strong>and</strong> green wire connected to ground in this diagram.</em></p>

<hr>

<h1>tl;dr</h1>

<h2>Your device</h2>

<p>The device you're using (MS-OPS5M-XX) requires a ground to operate, according to the documentation.  </p>

<h2>Solutions</h2>

<h3>Install grounding conductors</h3>

<p>One solution, would be to install a grounding conductor with this circuit. This will likely require quite a bit of work, and might be quite costly.</p>

<h3>Install a grounded conductor</h3>

<p>It may be possible to extend a grounded (neutral) conductor from the light to the switch box, which could then be used to power the device. In this case you'd have to purchase a different device (one that requires a neutral rather than a ground).</p>

"How to finish room with protruding concrete ledge/foundation?","28092","","<p>I am finishing a basement room and have a concrete ledge which is part of the foundation. It protrudes into the room about 2.5 inches and is about 6 inches high. This ledge is the result of a particular way of pouring the foundation which results (as I am told) in higher ceilings in the basement, but leaves this rather annoying ledge. (See photos).</p>

<p>Apparently there are multiple ways of working with this type of thing, which I learned from looking at similar homes in my neighborhood: Some people frame the walls inside the ledge completely, effectively shrinking the finished room by that amount; others have framed up to the window sill height and created a shelf in the room at that height.</p>

<p>I've chosen to maximize space in the room and finished the walls above the ledge intending to create an exaggerated baseboard around the concrete ledge. However, exactly how to do that is proving difficult.</p>

<p>First, the concrete thickness (protrusion into the room) is not consistent. It's 2.5 inches in the middle, but is nearly 2.75 at one end and 2.25 at the other. Whatever I cover it with will have to compensate. The height of 6 inches is fairly consistent.</p>

<p>Next the concrete is not smooth, there are many small protrusions which will have to be worked around or removed with a chisel or hammer.</p>

<p>Finally, I'd like to have a small measure of insulation so that the room is isolated from the cold concrete.</p>

<p>So, I've come up with two ideas that might work:</p>

<ul>
<li>A. Use an adhesive to attach dense insulating foam, about 1/2 thick, to top and side of ledge. Attach MDF to these surfaces using adhesive, and router the corner to a rounded edge. Prime and paint.</li>
<li>B. Rip some 2x4's to a 1/2 to 3/4 inch thickness and attach to ledge face every 16 inches, using concrete anchors. The thickness of the 2x4 would vary so that the end result is square with the room and makes up for the irregular shape of the concrete. Attach MDF to these. Fill air gaps with expanding foam insulation. Finish MDF with with a routered corner, prime and paint.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not sure if there is a better or common way of building around such concrete ledges. The heart of the question: <strong>Is there a recommended way to build around a concrete ledge like this?</strong></p>

<p>Factoids that may or may not matter:</p>

<ul>
<li>The basement is at ground level.</li>
<li>The room is 11 ft. by 9.5 ft. (105 sq. ft.) The ledge is only on two exterior sides.</li>
<li>The flooring will be laminate.</li>
<li>The existing walls are insulated, framed, and already have finished drywall with texture and primer.</li>
</ul>

<p>I decided to go with plan ""A"" and thought I would post an in-progress picture. Thanks for the suggestions and tips.</p>

<p>For those interested, here are some pictures several years later. I installed cabinets and notched the bottom/back to install flush with the wall. It protrudes inside the cabinet, but not overly so. Notching was quite a bit of work. The ledge doubles as a footrest. ;)</p>

","<p>We had an almost identical situation in a former garage that we refinished to be an office. Our contractor suggested this and we liked the result: he installed a piece of wood about an inch out from the concrete, putting insulation between them and keeping the wood a consistent and level height - a little higher than the concrete. I can't remember if it was pink fluffy insulation or spray stuff. Then a shelf about 6 inches out from the wall - nice and level by being a bit up from the concrete and supported by the vertical wood, and there's insulation under the shelf too. The whole thing is a good looking clear pine and is well varnished.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/X25jc.jpg"" alt=""low shelf""></p>

<p>Looking from the side gives an idea of the distance from the wall:</p>

And it goes without saying that you should minimize any bumps while the mud is still drying to avoid having to sand it later. Some even recommend using the premix joint compound on the last coat and, just before it dries, going over it with a slightly damp sponge to take off any bumps.</p>

"What are the consequences of building without a permit?","28085","","<p>Suppose someone decided to build a house without getting the required permits. What are the possible consequences?</p>

<p>I'm not talking about slipshod workmanship, or ignoring safety of structure, fire, and sewage. I'm talking about doing good quality work that generally meets or exceeds code requirements, but without going through the ""proper channels"".</p>

<p>(I'm sure you'll want more context; ask and I'll edit later.)</p>
","<p>This wil depend on where exactly you live. There're many possible outcomes, including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>nothing bad happens</li>
<li>you can be fined</li>
<li>the house can be demolished and you'll have to pay for that</li>
<li>you'll be forced to go through the ""proper channels"" later</li>
<li>you'll face minor or major problems when you try to sell/lease/insure the house</li>
</ul>

<p>Also don't forget that the codes can impose some limitations that are specific to your exact location. For example, the maximum height or pressure onto the ground could need approval from some certified state organization.</p>

<p>So if you ignore the procedure the following could happen. You will not know that you house will be limited in electric power or pressure onto the ground (since that data is not obviously available until you contact the organization responsible for that) and you'll only face problems when it is too late - so you will be unable to heat your house properly or it will excert too much pressure and collapse and even damage the surrounding buildings. Or your neighbours might file a lawsuit agains you because your house casts too dense shadow on their land.</p>

<p>The bottom line is - consult a qualified specialist in your location. Building without permit might be a Very Bad Idea™.</p>

"How do I unclog my dishwasher?","28072","","<p>Our dishwasher, which is only about 5 years old, has been finishing its cycle with quite a bit of water in the bottom that doesn't drain.

"What is the method to seal a concrete roof?","28062","","<p>We are staying in a home which has a concrete roof. Now we are facing leakage in the roof during rainy seasons. What do we have to do? How do we protect the roof from leaks?</p>
","<p>Concrete itself is not waterproof, in fact, it's more like a sponge, so concrete alone is never used to create an impermeable surface. You haven't provided much info - is the roof flat, sloped? What is already up there?  There are tons of different waterproofing methods available.</p>

<p>Going under the assumption that it was properly waterproofed at some point, you need to figure out why it's leaking.   Maybe there is damage to the roof, or maybe there is a drainage problem and water is just building up and finding its way in. Also possible is that the flashing around a vent or access hole has been bent away and water is getting behind it. Either way, you will first need to investigate and resolve the root problem and then fix it in-line with how it was already constructed.  If the roof is tarred, you are not going to put down some other barrier.</p>

<p>You will without a doubt have to go on the roof to check it out. If you're not comfortable with this, its best to call a roofing expert.</p>

"How many wires is too many for an outlet?","28033","","<p>I keep finding outlets in my house that are wired in ways I've never seen.</p>

<p>Today's find is an outlet in a bedroom with 4 hots and 4 neutrals. All connected to one outlet using the push-in connectors. It's not a switched outlet, so all one circuit.</p>

<p>Is this bad? Acceptable?</p>

<p>If acceptable, how should I put in the new outlet but not have to rely on push-ins? Can I twist two of each together then attach those pairs to each post? Should I pigtail?</p>

<p>My hunch is that this particular outlet is being used to branch circuits into the bathroom next door. </p>
","<p>The receptacle manufacturer should document how many wires can be put where. In general, if there are screws, you can use at most one wire per screw. For quickwire/backwire holes, you can only use one wire per hole, and further, that one wire can only be 14 gauge. Previously, 12 and 14 gauge were allowed for quickwiring, but not any more. The only kind of receptacle where you can directly attach a whole bunch of wires are those where the screws tighten down a bar onto another bar. Then, you stick stripped wires between the two bars and tighten the top one down to clamp them between the two bars; you can run quite a few through there.</p>

<p>Another limiting factor is box sizes. Boxes have a fixed wiring volume, and there are rules for working out the minimum volume box needed to accommodate a given number of wires, devices, and clamps. Assuming you're working with 14 AWG grounded cable, I'd expect the box to accommodate 4 hot + 4 neutral + 1 device + ground wires, so 10 wire volumes, and 14 AWG is 2 cubic inches per wire, so you'd need a 20 cubic inch box. That's a bit on the large size for a box holding a single receptacle, but there are boxes and box configurations (box + mud ring) that would accommodate that many wires, so it's not unreasonable.</p>

<p>As for wiring everything together, you should pigtail everything and then hook up the pigtails to the receptacle. The pigtail presents a single wire for slipping under the screw terminal. Remember to wind the J-hook you'll slip around the screw in the direction that you'll turn the screw to tighten it, so down on the left side and up on the right side.</p>

"Is my toilet refill issue more likely a problem with the fill valve or supply pipe?","27996","","<p>This question may be a duplicate of <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/5639/toilet-supply-line-and-valve-leaking"">Toilet Supply Line and Valve Leaking</a>, but I have some different symptoms/troubleshooting steps, and the answer supplied for that question doesn't quite fit (though it may be a lack of knowledge on my part).</p>

<p>So one day (maybe two weeks ago), the toilet stopped filling properly. I knew enough about the basic mechanics of a toilet to take the tank lid off and check that the flush valve chain was connected and the valve itself was closing. Both were fine.</p>

<p>While I was in there, I noticed that the overflow hose wasn't running (didn't know what that meant, but had seen the inside of a working toilet tank to know this was suspicious). Also, the fill valve at the top was trickling water (down the arm bit).  So I knew enough to know that, for whatever reason, the toilet wasn't refilling properly. To confirm, I filled it manually with water from the sink using a pitcher. Sure enough, flushed fine.</p>

<p>We made plans to call the landlord (this is a rental, by the way, which is why I'm hesitant to go much further than I have. Don't want to officially have it be ""my fault"" and get stuck with the bill). But we've put it off and mostly just rely on the trickle to take its toll until we can flush in an hour.</p>

<p>Tonight I decided enough is enough.  We probably won't get around to calling the landlord because of other issues, and I'm tired of apologizing for the not-so-little surprises my wife keeps discovering.</p>

<p>So I read up on how toilets work, both at howstuffworks and at the Home Depot DIY site.</p>

<p>It seemed clear that I need to replace the fill valve, which costs 6 dollars and would make me feel like a champ and avoid a call to the super. But there was also a mention of it just being the washer and how it's easy enough to just pop off the valve and replace just that part (which is 2 dollars less and an easier job).</p>

<p>Well, before doing all that, I thought I'd check the washer to see if it was worn out. I turned off the water first, then loosened the valve. The washer looked fine, but there was some dirt in outer perimeter of the bit next in line (not sure what it's called). I ran a qtip around and knocked some out.  I put it all back together and was about to turn the water back on when I thought to tighten the nut under the tank connecting the supply line.</p>

<p>I flushed and voila, overflow hose runs, tank filled in under a minute. Everything looked great.  Then I flushed again (once it was done filling), and it was back to a trickle. I turned off the water, tightened the nut as far as I could (it's a simple hand-twist nut, no hardware but my hands involved so far in this story).  Turned the water back on and got another good flush. Waited a few minutes after refill was done, flush tested, got the trickle.</p>

<p>So this time I turned the water off and back on, doing nothing else (which, by the way, I had tried 2 weeks ago with no luck, just to see if it would do anything).  Turned it off and back on, nothing. Turned it off and back on a second time, refill kicks in like normal.</p>

<p>So now I'm at a loss.  I have a much easier workaround then refilling manually (turning the water off and then back on 1-3 times will kick the refill back into action after several tests, including a ""live"" one hours later), but obviously there is still an issue.</p>

<p>With the workaround being related to cutting the supply line off and on a few times, it has me thinking there is an issue in the actual line (or in the wall), which I'm not going to even try to tangle with. I know I could spend the 6 dollars to confirm, but I wanted to see if anyone could confirm from all of the above details and steps if the issue was in the tank or pre-tank before I go to the trouble of replacing something that isn't broken just to avoid dealing with my landlord.</p>

<p>Also, there are no signs of leaking around the supply valve or the line or the connection to the tank.</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>I have tried running the water without the head fill valve attached to clear out any dirt. I can see sediment in there, but it can't get through the inset washer. I tried popping it out  with a screwdriver, but it's about an inch deep into the fill pipe, so I don't want to crack it.</p>

<p>Also, I am noticing the following, in terms of the workaround:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I turn water off and back on, overflow hose kicks in, normal refill.</p></li>
<li><p>Re-flush. After tank is empty, the trickle begins, no hose.</p></li>
<li><p>If I turn water off and back on quickly, no fix.</p></li>
<li><p>If I turn water off, wait for trickle to totally stop, turn back on, hose kicks in.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So I'm definitely inclined to think it's in the tank/fill line/valve. But now I'm just curious if anyone knows a definitive cause/fix for the issue.</p>
","<p>It seems as if you have an obstruction that may be floating around in the pipe or valve. Sometimes it obstructs sometimes it flows clear. I would start with changing the water valve. If this is the old style ""gate"" valve there are several things that can clog the line. I would replace it with a 1/4 turn ball valve. That will give you much better flow than a gate valve. You will need to shut down the water probably at the main. The old valve is probably soldered, but you could cut it off and use a compression type valve instead. <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/SharkBite/h_d1/N-5yc1vZ4n3/R-202270487/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10051"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Sharkbite""</a> is one such supplier. Although I have never used their compression valve, I have used their end caps and found them to work well.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XQJD8.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If you can have someone hold a bucket under the pipe once you cut off the valve and then a second person turns on the water main to fill the bucket to purge the line of any debris. With cast iron pipes it is common to get clogs from rust build up. The rust may not pass the small opening in the old gate valve when you first purged the line.. Although you did not mention what type of pipes you have, if it's copper than you won't normally find rust obstructions..</p>

My first instinct was thinking that a breaker had tripped, so I went to the breaker box and checked everything. Nothing out of order. I started investigating a little bit more and discovered that the power was not actually out... just flickering. If I turned on lights, they would occasionally flick and try to come on and then go back out. The dishwasher kept clicking like a relay was opening and shutting continuously. I went downstairs to discover that the fan for the heat kept trying to spin up and then dying.</p>

If you use a small 2"" cutting paintbrush, and apply by pulling the paintbursh at an angle toward you, keeping the smallest amount of bristles near the corner / edge, you will be fine.  The only time i apply painters tape is around trim - and this is more to prevent drippings and splatter, than to protect a clean edge.</p>

","<p>There are huge differences.  I am sure a professional tradesman can go over the exact specifics but here is my common man take (even though I have drywalled too many houses to remember):</p>

<ul>
<li>plaster generally sets more quickly</li>
<li>plaster is thicker</li>
<li>plaster can be applied more thickly (joint compound you get about 1/8"")</li>
<li>plaster to me is like working with thinset except you will see the plaster as thinset is almost always hidden</li>
<li>joint compound can be sanded more easily</li>
<li>joint compound is more prone to cracking (this is about application too)</li>
<li>I would personally only use plaster for a very small area that is having cracking problems.  I have done some plaster work and literally drove me nuts.  Also I do not consider myself artistic.  When applying plaster it is an art.  If you over apply sanding it down is way harder than joint compound.  I would never think about plastering all of a drywall in a house.  </li>
</ul>

<p>The only thing else I can add is I don't know what they consider <em>slow plaster</em>.  I am sure that refers to the setting time.

"What is causing my gas water heater to squeal?","27483","","<p>I have a gas water heater. Starting yesterday, when the flame is on, the unit makes a squealing noise of moderate volume. The noise stops <em>immediately</em> when the flame turns off. This means it is not caused by water pressure in the tank, which would take at least a moment to stop after the flame switched off. What causes this sound?</p>
","<p>My guess is that something in the gas supply line of the heater is whistling (a vibration is being induced from the flow of gas). This could indicate a blockage or deformation of one or more of the gas jets. It's unlikely to be any problem with the exhaust flue or with the water in the tank, as you say.</p>

<p>The other thing it might be, depending on the tank's proximity to your gas meter, is that the gas reg on the meter (which steps down pressure from the gas main to a level suitable for your home's appliances) is starting to fail, and the heater, being closest to the gas reg, is picking up a vibration through the gas line that is induced by the failing reg. This is less likely especially if no other appliance makes the slightest noise, and the reg itself isn't making any noise when gas is flowing.</p>

<p>As far as fixing it, this is something I'd leave to a pro, but that's just because I know enough about gas to know I can seriously screw it up. The fix would likely be to replace any obviously crushed or deteriorated gas pipes and fittings in the HWH installation, and possibly disassemble the line back to the wall to make sure there aren't any nicks or dents in the pipe ends from where the installer dropped and damaged one, then installed it anyway.</p>

"Furniture needs to be attached to the wall, but my tenancy agreement doesn't allow it","27361","","<p>I've just rented an unfurnished apartment. Obviously I need some furniture.

A few holes for a noble cause (keeping your bookshelf from crushing a toddler for example) is not an evict-able offense, unless your landlord is out of his/her mind, so the worst thing that can happen is getting dinged on your damage deposit when you move out. And if you properly patch and paint your holes that won't be an issue either.

The Nest website says that it's <em>currently only available in the US</em> but I'm wondering whether that is just a sales/marketing choice of if there might be technical reasons for the US limitation.</p>

<p>The Nest website has a widget where you can tick what cables you've got and it then tells you whether the Nest will work with that.

<p>At $250 it's just expensive enough that I hesitate to just order one and try if it works. Even if I did, I would also be afraid of damaging it by connecting the wires wrong.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do the markings/colors on cables of gas heaters/thermostats follow an international standard?</li>
<li>Can I expect that a Nest would work in Europe, when connected to a European brand model?</li>

","<p>One big thing to remember about Nest is that it is a <em>low voltage</em> thermostat. Therefore, it can't be used on a typical heating system in the UK (say) as we tend to have 240V connections to thermostats and timers.</p>

"How suitable is a reciprocating saw for cutting lengths of firewood (at home)?","27309","","<p>I have a heap of untreated reject timber from a portable mill which I intend to use for firewood. It's in long pieces, often with bark on one side, and some are up to about 20cm (8"") thick.</p>

<p>It is probably too thick for a circular skill saw, so my other options seem to be a chainsaw or maybe a reciprocating saw (I'd go with a corded electric model for either case). I've never seen anyone use a reciprocating saw at all, so I have no idea what they are capable of; would one cut through 20cm of timber without too much trouble? </p>

<p>Are there any other problems I might run into using one for firewood (other than having to replace a blade occasionally if I hit a nail or stone)?</p>

<p><a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/q/10480/3576"">This question</a> was a good introduction to my investigation, but only provided a small amount of detail about the reciprocating saw option (and it's hard to know how seriously to take it when it's the ""most fun"" option).</p>
","<p>A reciprocating saw WILL do the job. If that is what you have and you do not wish to buy/borrow/rent a chainsaw, then you can use it. Get a long blade, designed for cutting wood. These blades have large, sharp teeth with wide gullets between them.</p>

<p>The reciprocating saw will take longer to do the job, and it does have some vibration issues, but I can assert that you can use it for hours at a time. A good saw is a beast, designed for heavy duty work. (I did so to cut up the wood after we had an ice storm once. It left piles of wood behind that can only be measured as many cubic yards. My chainsaw was dead, and was painfully unwilling to be revived. Amazingly, I used only 3 blades for the entire job. The final pile of wood and brush was roughly 10 feet wide, 6 feet high, and 60 feet long.)</p>

<p>If you do use a reciprocating saw for this purpose, you might buy some gloves with padding in the palms. Good gloves will be a necessity anyway, so use them. Ear protection is a good idea too.</p>

<p>If you already have a reciprocating saw and a circular saw, and want to just buy the right blades ... I'd consider a carbide blade in the circular saw, using it for wood that is up to 3 inches thick. Choose a blade with few teeth and large gullets. Then use the reciprocating saw with a wood blade only for those pieces that are too thick.</p>

<p>Having said all that, perhaps another solution if you do not wish to buy a gas powered chainsaw, is an electric chainsaw. These saws have no issues with gasoline, so are slightly simpler to deal with. It is still a chainsaw though. You will still need to use oil, and kickbacks are still a problem to watch out for, but a circular saw can also be dangerous if used unwisely.</p>

<p>Replace or sharpen dull blades as appropriate. A dull blade is a dangerous blade. It takes more effort to use, so you push harder. A good saw with a sharp blade should almost glide through the wood.</p>

<p>Finally, if you are cutting up a large amount of wood, then be careful. Do not work when you are tired. This is true using ANY saw. Stop and finish the job another day, a far better idea than spending time in the emergency room.</p>

"Is it safe to use a portable microwave in a confined shelfspace?","27201","","<p>I have an 900 watt emerson microwave that looks similar to this one: 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vt4A1.jpg"" alt=""emerson microwave""></p>

<p>It weighs about 30 pounds and the outside dimensions are about 19"" (W) x 16"" (D) x 12"" (H).</p>

<p>We normally have it sitting on the kitchen counter space but my significant other would like it put in a more discrete location and suggested moving it to a semi-permanent location in the cupboard shelf. </p>

<p>I'm reasonably certain that it'll fit in the shelf and am confident that the shelf could hold the weight (and any heavy items we cook) but I'm concerned about ventilation.  The manual says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ventilation: Do not block air vents. If they are blocked during
  operation, the oven may overheat and eventually cause oven failure.
  For proper ventilation, keep three inches of space between the oven’s
  top, sides, rear and the area where the unit is to be installed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The shelf would have that 3"" breather room but not much more.  Does that sound OK? Am I worrying over nothing? Is there anything else I need to be conscious of here? </p>
","<p>Microwave ovens do not generate heat themselves, but cause the food itself to heat up. As such there is not a lot of heat output from the unit, but there is expanding air as the food warms the air in the chamber.</p>

<p>Reputable manufacturers are fairly conservative about their venting requirements. If you meet those requirements, you should be OK. </p>

<p>Another consideration is clearance for the door swing and for moving dishes in and out of the unit. Make sure that its positioning does not cause you to be handling a hot dish at an awkward angle. Also high shelves are a bit risky since you would be handling hot food at head and face level. A singed hand pulled back could lead to a bad scalding.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to be sure that there is an outlet nearby of the proper amperage. A 900 watt microwave draws about 8 amps. A line with a number of other heavy duty appliances on it may pop circuit breakers.</p>

"What cement product should I use to fix a hole in my slab?","27195","","<p>I was removing old thinset and self-leveling cement in an area in preparation to tile it when the 6"" chisel and demo hammer I was using sunk in to a specific spot. I found that this specific spot had been filled with debris and had about 1"" of cement poured on top of it. Quite obviously, this wasn't sufficient, and the end result was a series of cracks in this area and a hollow sound here. I removed the debris and was left with about a 2' by 3' hole. It's obvious that someone made a (bad) patch here in the past. There was even a discarded bandaid wrapper and fibers from orange shag carpeting in the hole. </p>

<p>There's no plumbing that I can find below and the plastic 6mil vapor barrier is in good condition with a few minor tears that could be repaired with tuck tape. There are two roots running below; they are rotting and probably belong to something long dead. There is a crack running from the door to the right of the picture to the hole. I plan to repair this crack at the same time by broadening and deepening the crack slightly and using a cement patching compound. </p>

<p>What product should I use to fill the larger hole? Plain ol' Quickrete, or some other form of cement? Aggregate or not? Any specific PSI ratings I should look for, or other prep work that I should do besides washing the areas that I hope the new concrete will bond to and making sure that there's enough clearance under the wire for the cement to engage it? </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fRCyM.jpg"" alt=""Hole in the floor""></p>
","<p>Ok, I went to the big blue box store, read every bag they had there, and answered my own question. </p>

<p>As Cory (properly) pointed out, the mesh in the bottom of the hole isn't doing much good. It seems that this is a 'peak' in the sand that forms the substrate for my foundation; the sand slopes downhill to a depth of about ten inches on either side. I'm not sure why it's built this way, but as I can't really fix it now without doing a lot more work that I don't want to do to the vapor barrier and other aspects, I levered up the wire so that I could fit stones underneath it and there's now about 1/2 to 3/4 inch clearance between the wire and the bottom of the Chasm. </p>

<p>I just finished scrubbing it down with water and will let it dry overnight, and then tomorrow when I'm ready to mix I'll apply a primer that should help the concrete adhere. </p>

<p>I purchased this bag of fiber-reinforced high strength quickrete because over an area of the slab the size I'm patching, it shouldn't need to interact with the wire mesh much to gain the strength that I'm looking for. The sand should keep it from sinking any, and even if it cracks around the edge, it won't have much of a place to go given what will be paved over it when the DITRA gets installed. </p>

","<p>The item referred to as a ""rope"" is likely to be either the drive belt or the felt strip that the drum rides on. </p>

<p>If the dryer drum still turns when the unit is turned on then what you pulled out is not the drive belt! On the other hand the belt could have torn in which case the motor will no longer be able to turn the drum. Clearly you would not be able to ignore and run the dryer without the belt. </p>

<p>The felt strip is typically fitted around the front periphery of the drum where it fits into a round track on the front housing of the dryer. The felt acts as a low friction bearing surface for the front support of the drum. If this is what you pulled out of your dryer then you do not want to attempt to operate the dryer without replacing the felt strip. To do so would lead to more serious damage as the drum became a metal to metal or metal to plastic bearing surface in the drum track.</p>

<p>For most dryers the replacement of the drive belt or the felt strip is relatively easy. You typically have to remove the front loading door assembly and the front housing of the dryer. (There may be other pre-steps to get to the point of being able to remove the front housing). Once you have access to the front of the drum it is easy to slide a new drive belt around the drum and onto the motor shaft and belt tightener/idler assembly. If it is the felt strip being replaced it is necessary to clean away any of the old felt debris and then afix the replacement strip into place on the drum. Note that the felt strip could be installed either on the drum itself or on the round track that is part of the front housing. It is typical for the opposing surface the runs in the track where the felt is placed is lined with a surface made of a hard slippery type of plastic.</p>

"How do I properly jack up one side of my house?","27083","","<p>As I write this, I have a slight lean as I walk on my floor in some parts of my house, and it's even worse on the upper floor. In some parts upstairs, it feels almost like you have to grab something. Visitors don't notice this, but I do. The lean was noticed by my dad as well when he stayed with us, got up, walked in the dark across the floor upstairs, and ended up in my bedroom when he was expecting it to be the bathroom. He said, ""Yeah, you're right. The floor leans up here.""</p>

<p>About ten years ago, I built my 4500sq ft house and the scammers who built my foundation flew the coop and are no longer found. All was fine for the first couple months, but then a long ridge appeared down the middle of the house floor, lifting that small section up about a little under a quarter inch. So, I called the builder out to remove the ridge. He brought his jacking equipment and was doing great in removing the ridge until we got to the kitchen, which was the remaining part. When we got there, it was pretty finicky and didn't want to go down. He called out his assistant and I heard a sledgehammering going on. Then, the whole house shook like an earthquake, an entire wall sunk down about 2 inches, and huge cracks appeared in several parts of the house. As well, the back of the house seemed to have gone down about 1.5 inches.</p>

<p>In this emergency, I fired the builder and told him never to come back. I then called out RamJack. They gave me an estimate on the entire thing for $17,000 USD and brought out stainless steel piers. They are stainless in that they rust on the outside patina -- so, the cheap stainless, they told me. </p>

<p>What they found when they inspected was that my foundation was done by fly-by-night scammers who basically only gave the impression of a foundation. It was pretty good in some parts, but in other parts they failed to use rebar, pour concrete, and only had the sunk-in part of the foundation going down about 2 feet, rather than 3 or more feet. A couple columns were only about 1.5 feet down into the earth!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, RamJack also discovered that my water table was high, and recommended that I get a drainage expert involved. They said they could dig down about 3 feet and hit water. (Later, a Charleston architect engineer visited my house and said that high water tables were common and that he had seen worse. He said that I should work towards improving drainage, but that for the most part the house will be okay because I had so many piers (about 36 of them) and several of the key ones were RamJack steel piers.)</p>

<p>Anyway, they managed to repair much of the house and I thought all was great. But then they got to the back of the house, and said they under-estimated and needed to request another $20,000 USD to finish! So, I fired them too. They only got $17,000 USD out of me.</p>

<p>So now all is well except that I need to bring up the entire back wall of my house, which is about 50ft long, up about 1.5 inches. I used a laser measure to figure this out from multiple locations, following the instructions on the box. More than 4 years has passed since the RamJack guys were here, and the house has stayed steady with no more sinking.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Therefore, what's the proper way that a contractor needs to raise the 50ft back wall of my 4500sq ft house about 1.5 inches, as affordable as possible?</strong> I mean, as I interview contractors, I want to see how close they will be to your assessment.</p>

<p>Any idea how to fix it, or what I can check? Or just call a professional?</p>

<p><strong>Now for some visual clarification:</strong></p>

<p>First the button. When pressing it halfway it doesn't keep on running, but it's not a good flush like that. Pressing it all the way makes it stuck in 'open' or so it seems.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qd3lm.jpg"" alt=""button front""></p>

<p>Inside of the button-set (seems like air-pressure makes it work?)
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QPd08.jpg"" alt=""the buttons""></p>

<p>So this blue-topped cylinder keeps stuck in the 'up' position</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YXhYb.jpg"" alt=""inside of the flushing mechanism""></p>

<p>About to press it down to make it stop flushing. An easy fix, but annoying obviously</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lwt4c.jpg"" alt=""stuck flushing""></p>
","<p>There were 2 (or maybe 3) things I needed to know:</p>

<ol>
<li>(easy) the fact that these things can be disassembled easily</li>
<li><p>(harder) how the flushing actually works</p>

<p>and the third, the cause in this case:</p></li>
<li><p>calcium is evil</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So after a friendly plumber who 'refused' to come by for such a trivial matter had proposed I'd take apart the thing, find something that was wrong, fix that, and assemble it first helped me get going, I removed a lot of parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>front plate (see above)</li>
<li>Screws and the 2 platic rectangles keeping the front in place (see above)</li>
<li>The water 'hose' (iron thing, again, see above)</li>
<li>I removed the piece that starts/stops water flow with the floater (was on the left, no picuture) and gently set it down inside.</li>
<li>The plastic base was the trickiest to remove: one side had a mechanism, the other side neede to slide up (but needed some force). See picture below.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qS5RG.jpg"" alt=""Removeing the base""></p>

<p>Now that we finally have some picture, this is what happens: The blue part on the big cilinder (also featured above) is the one that stops the flow of water, but the smaller (white) one is the one that pushes it up when you press the button (airpressure). That one was the one that didn't come down again, due to caclium buildup. Cleaning this fixed it! see picture of the problem before cleaning it.</p>

<p>Strange that a relalitvely new toilet (house is from 2008) will have this as a problem, so I suppose this will come back sometimes ;(</p>

"What is causing the SUPER loud noise from my dryer","26887","","<p>I have a maytag gas dryer. It is about 20 years old. Model number DG7500</p>

<p>It sounds like an jet engine taking off. I've noticed that it starts off quiet than builds up to a very lour roar. </p>

<p>I googled -> rollers are bad. Bought new rollers, bearings,idle wheel,etc (150 CAD can be returned if unopened). </p>

<p>Pull off the access panels, look at idle wheel and roller, they don't look much different than the new ones. </p>

<p>So, I put in some wet laundry, ran it to see if I could spot the cause of the noise (of course, if it is resonant noise this probably wouldn't work). It didn't really get super loud this time. All the rollers and the idle wheel spun. </p>

<p>So, before I open the packages and take everything apart I'd like to get your thoughts on whether or not this is the problem. Any ideas? </p>

<p>Photos of current rollers &amp; idle wheel:</p>

<p>UPDATE 1:</p>

<ul>
<li>WD40'd the roller: no real change</li>
<li>fluff for 10 mins, loud but I think it is normal for this one</li>
<li>DRY for 10 mins: 3-4 minutes in gets super loud again. So heat is probably playing a factor in this</li>
<li>Describe the noise: not a whine. Very loud rumble. </li>
</ul>

<p>UPDATE 2: 
- After buying all the parts suggested (Roller x2, gliderx2, idle wheel and belt) I took the cover, bulkhead, and drum all off. The problem was a dryer sheet caught in the blower. Removed, cleaned and replaced the belt (old one was pretty close to its last days) and it's all good now. Thanks!</p>
","<p>It's difficult to say without actually standing in front of it and observing the noise, but I'm going to guess you have some shot bearings somewhere. It's easier to point to them in an image to suggest where they may be descriptively:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/R7bBu.png"" alt=""shot-bearings""></p>

<p>To the left you have casters to keep the dryer on course. Applying some Teflon (or silicone) may cure it. To the right, the motor - and the sound you're hearing may mean that it is dying. That's not something you can really service beyond replacing it.</p>

<p>It could also simply be the belt that's attached to the motor. The same 'belt dressing' that you can buy in an auto parts store to cure a fan noise in your car will likely show (or eliminate) the belt as the culprit. It is probably quite old if it hasn't been replaced since being purchased. The inside of a dryer can get quite humid, so those belts can last for a really long time.</p>

<p>So check lube or 'dress' anything that helps the dryer spin, <em>except</em> the motor, first. If that fails, then look into getting a replacement motor (or new dryer, possibly). Rule out anything that has steel bearings first, and the belt.</p>

"How do I fix window jams that are not even with drywall?","26753","","<p>We recently bought a house that was in the midst of a remodel. The PO had replaced 80% of the windows but had not gotten to the trim. The issue I have is the jam does not match with the drywall. In some places it is even but mostly it is 1/4-1/2"" below the drywall grade. I can build and install jam extensions but on 1/2"" of the windows, the grade varies from being even to 1/2 below from top-to-bottom of the window.</p>

<p>Do any contractors have any tricks to fixing this? What would you do?</p>
","<p>A buddy of mine does trim work for a living.  In the place we re-modeled, he did much of our trim work, and like the OP, we had many jams that were not parallel nor flush with the walls.  What he ended up doing is to extend the jam in order to split the difference (i.e.- at maximum the jam was 1/8"" past the DW, at minimum, 1/8"" behind).  Then he had a few tricks to get the trim installed-</p>

<p>For areas where the jam was slightly short, he would take a razor blade, and score the drywall about 1/4"" in from the edge of where the trim would sit, then take a hammer, and punch down the DW even with the jam.  So the outside edge of the trim would be on intact DW, but under the bulk of the trim the DW was smashed down.</p>

<p>In areas where the jam was sticking out too far, he would do one of two things- in most of our rooms we were painting the trim, so he would use a paintable caulk behind the trim to seal it against the wall, then use a piece of square wood dipped in some soapy water to make the caulk flush with the trim.  After painting over it, you can't see where the trim stops and caulk starts.  </p>

<p>For the one room with stained maple trim, he shimmed behind the trim when cutting the miters, and played with the thickness of shim until the trim would ""rock back"" against the drywall but still meet up with the trim it was mitered against.  This seemed much more an art than a science.</p>

<p>Overall, the process is not easy, and I doubt I would be able to duplicate the quality of his joints, for the exposed wood trim with jams extending past the drywall.</p>

"AC Coolant pipe has condensation and leaks inside wall","26743","","<p>I've got an old AC unit (probably 13+ years old) that came with the house that I bought. This summer I noticed some water damage on the drywall in the basement, so I cut the damaged drywall away, and found that the pipe coming from my AC unit to my furnace had a bunch of condensation on it that would collect and leak out onto the drywall.</p>

<p>It seems like the spot it's dripping from is the lowest point in the pipe (left and right of this point both bend up)</p>

<p>How safe is it to try and bend this pipe (which I'm assuming has freon in it?) so that it's more level?</p>

<p>Is there some other kind of insulation I can put on this to prevent the condensation. Right now its the standard foam tube that you wrap around.</p>
","<p>Did the problem just start?  Is the condensation on the pipe frozen?  If so, this is an indication that the compressor is overworked (possibly low on coolant).  If you are seeing any frost, you should turn off the system before the compressor burns out and call an HVAC professional.</p>

<p>Insulation is wrapped around the coolant line to prevent condensation from forming and causing damage.  That insulation may have started to fail.  If so, replacing it is an easy enough job.</p>

<p>I reccomend you turn off the system for a little while so the coolant line can warm up.  Pull off as much of the old insulation as you can and wipe it down to remove any leftover condensation.  Then replace it with the tightest-fitting and highest R-value insulation you can find.</p>

<p>When re-insulating, be sure to seal all of of the crevices.  If the pipe insulation tubes have an open slit in the side, make sure you seal the slits with insulated tape.  If any copper is exposed, it is a point for condensation to form.  The coolant line should be completely covered from end to end.</p>

<p>I reccomend that you don't bend the pipe.  The coolant pressure is somewhat higher than your generic water supply, and if you damage/crack the line, it won't be pretty.</p>

"How do I seal my shower escutcheon plate to prevent it from leaking?","26629","","<p>I have a leak that's going from my upstairs bathroom tub/shower to my downstairs bathroom ceiling.  The leak occurs only when someone is using the shower or tub.  I had someone open up the ceiling and inspect was going on from below.  A PVC pipe was found to be leaking and was repaired.  I proceeded to re-grout all the tile where water may be wanted to go through the tile.  I also re-caulked, using silicone, the corners of the wall where the tile and the tub meet.</p>

<p>That pipe no longer leaks, but amazingly, I appear to still have some leak somewhere else in the ceiling. </p>

<p>My shower head is detachable like a wand.  I detached it and began applying water in various areas to see if I could reproduce the leak.  I think I found that when I apply it on my escutcheon plate, it appears to reproduce the leak.  I have a small hole there that I discovered in the grout, perhaps 2 mm thick.  I am thinking to apply silicone to seal the plate.  It is currently flush against the wall, and with the exception of the 2mm thick hole, I see no gaps.  There is no silicone however, I suppose this was never sealed.</p>

<p>When researching how to silicone seal this, I found that some people recommend opening it up and putting plumbers putty, something I'm not sure is necessary in my case.  I am planning to apply the silicone.</p>

<p>When applying silicone to the escutcheon plate, some people recommend putting it only on the top area where the plate meets the tile wall, where water would flow down into on top of the plate from the top of the shower.  I suppose the rationale is that if water gets stuck there, it may somehow escape into the shower down the tile, rather than behind the wall.  I'm not sure though.</p>

<p>I don't know what's the standard way to handle such scenario beautifully. Any advice is appreciated very much.</p>
","<p>This can be a tough problem to work out in a situation like this. Particularly if you are trying to run the same type and size of molding from one floor area through to the other. What I have done in instances where the height changes are small is to simply trim the bottom of the molding so it fit into place over a distance such that the it slopes from one height to the other. If the slope is small and over enough of a distance it will never be noticed by anyone but you (unless you point it out to others :^) ).</p>

<p>Installing the sloped molding piece does impose some interesting work with making the miter cuts on the ends. It may also involve some planing and sanding of the molding surfaces at the joint to blend it around the corner. (BTW you will be a long way ahead with this type of ""blend to fit"" with real wooden baseboard. MDF or plastic foam type baseboard fails miserably when this is attempted). </p>

<p>I see that the existing darker colored floor has baseboard without any base shoe molding. You may want to consider the addition of base shoe molding in the new area because it can play an essential role of covering up what you have to do along the bottom of the baseboard to slope it from one height to the other across the transition zone. It is acceptable to bring the base shoe molding up through the transition zone and then just cut it back off at an angle at the end of its run. </p>

"Should I superchlorinate a freshly filled pool?","26520","","<p>I have a small (2000 gallon) pool that I recently filled.  I put a couple of 1"" chlorine tablets into the skimmer 24 hours ago, and even after running the pump all day, my test strips are not registering any chlorine.</p>

<p>Am I supposed to superchlorinate a new pool to get an initial chlorine level, and then use tablets to maintain it?  Or perhaps I should be using more than 2 chlorine tablets?</p>
","<p>2000 gals is a lot for a couple of 1"" tabs to chlorinate. I put one to two tablets into a 350-gallon hot tub and sometimes even that isn't enough to maintain proper chlorination. I'd be looking at one to two 3"" tablets for pretty much anything you'd call a ""pool"".</p>

<p>The short answer to your question is, yes, you want to put a ""start-up"" dose of chlorinating agent into your pool to get it to the proper chlorine level (or slightly higher); from there, a ""maintenance"" dose of chlorine such as from the tablets will keep the proper level.</p>

<p>The longer answer is that there is more to conditioning a pool than chlorinating it. The chemistry beneath the surface has been the subject of many a doctoral dissertation, but the products available commercially, while not idiot-proof, are hard to get wrong if you follow the instructions. The steps you follow, in order, are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Balance pH</strong> - The water should generally be slightly higher pH than neutral, generally between 7.2 and 7.6. Too low and you risk an acidic environment which can damage metal parts like your pump. Too high and the water will cause ichy, dry skin (or in the extreme, chemical burns) because the high pH breaks down natural body oils (a process called saponification, which is the same as is used to make soap).</p>

<p>The typical ""pH Down"" (acidifying) product for home use is sodium bisulfate, NaHSO<sub>4</sub>, which is an ""acid salt"" based on a partially-neutralized strong acid (sulfuric), which works as a weak acid in water. This product, in powder form, is safer to use and store than liquid muriatic (hydrochloric) acid, HCl, which is commonly used in large public pools where you don't have time to mess around with dissolving several pounds of a powdered product. Muriatic acid also reduces total alkalinity (useful if your water comes from an aquifer, less so if you're already fighting soft water from a marsh or river). ""pH Up"" is typically a weak base, such as sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), while lye (sodium hydroxide) is used commercially; sodium bicarbonate also increases total alkalinity.</p>

<p>Work in small amounts and let the chemical dissolve and mix thoroughly in the water as you go. Also, <em>never</em> pour acidifying products directly into your skimmer; the concentration needed to balance a full pool will make the water in the circulation loop highly acidic for long enough to cause serious damage to your pump's impeller and other circulation parts. Alkaline products, not so much; the alkali metal cation already attached to the hydroxide or carbonate anion is more attractive than the transition metals of the impeller, heater etc, so these are typically skimmer-safe. Just don't ever put any balancing product (any maintenance product, really) in the water while anyone's in it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Buffer</strong> - You need the right amount of alkali metal in the water, and of a ""chlorine buffer"". Basically, you want the water ""hard"", but not so hard that you have to deal with scaling on a regular basis. Chloride salts, like calcium and magnesium chloride, both add some chlorine to the water, and more importantly provide a pH buffer with the alkali metal, giving acidic compounds (like many chlorinating compounds) something to dissolve besides the metal parts in your pump. Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), in addition to increasing pH, also increases total alkalinity. Too little alkalinity can cause large swings in pH as chlorinating agent is added and then burns off. Too much alkalinity raises pH, reduces the amount of ""free"" chlorine that can actually do the disinfecting work, and causes cloudy water, scaling, and itchy dry skin. </p>

<p>As for the chlorine buffer (often called a ""stabilizer""), cyanuric acid is generally used. Cyanuric acid reacts with chlorine to form stable ""chlorinated cyanurates"", which are good disinfecting agents and also prevent the chlorine being lost from the water as gaseous chloramines. These products are generally skimmer-safe; you may avoid putting straight cyanuric acid in the skimmer, but cyanuric acid is a weaker acid than hydrochloric (enough that it has a negligible net effect on pH when added to properly-balanced water). Watch the amount of cyanuric acid you put in; unlike the chlorine compounds, cyanuric acid is ridiculously stable and will not ""boil off"" (which is why it's used), and won't readily react with the alkalinity in the water, so too much of it cannot be negated by adding something else; the only way to get rid of it is a partial drain and refill to dilute it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shock</strong> - The general goal of ""shocking"" the pool is to temporarily superchlorinate it, which kills bacteria and algae; the normal level of chlorination is a deterrent to bacterial growth, but certain nasties are chlorine-resistant, and the amount needed to guarantee the water is sanitary is a bit much for humans (and their swimsuits). Shock is also designed to ""burn off"" relatively quickly, carrying the organic byproducts of bacterial destruction with them (that ""chlorine smell"" of a pool is the smell of organic chloramines evaporating, the result of the shock doing its job to clean the water). The end result should be clear, blue water, free of chloramines which turn the water green, and with a free chlorine level (unattached Cl<sup>-</sup> ions) of between 3-5ppm.</p>

<p>A variety of actual chemicals are used to shock water; sodium hypochlorite (chlorine bleach) and the related calcium hypochlorite are definitely effective, but tend to have detrimental effects on swimmers' skin, hair and swimsuits, and the distinctive ""bleach smell"" which is good for laundry, bad for swimming. Many powdered shocks have more complex, tailored chlorinating chemicals that act as disinfectants but not bleaches. Many powdered shock compounds also include a ""clarifier"", which is a substance that causes small particles (which normally have a small negative charge and repel each other) to group together into bigger particles, so they won't remain suspended in the water and can get caught in the filter. Most shocks also include a dedicated algaecide (see below). Shock is almost always skimmer-safe, but chlorinating agents can lower pH if there is an insufficient amount of an alkali buffer. </p>

<p>Once these three steps are performed, dip a test strip and verify that the water has the proper pH, hardness/alkalinity, total chlorine, and free chlorine. If there is too much chlorine and slightly low pH immediately after adding the shock, that's normal; within a couple hours of sunlight the chlorine level should go down to swimmable levels (and the pH should go up as the chlorine ions are removed). If there's WAY too much you added too much shock; make sure the pH isn't too acidic (still above 7; add some baking soda to counteract the acidity if it's too low, and you'll need to keep an eye on the pH balance) and keep people out of the water until free chlorine comes back down to 3-5ppm. There are ""shock and swim"" products designed to be swim-safe very soon after adding them; these usually use a ""self-buffering"" chlorinating chemical that reduces pH swings and the severity of the free chlorine spike, to prevent harmful levels of free chlorine while still being enough to ""shock"" the water free of contaminants.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chlorinate</strong> - Most of the chlorine in your water at any given time should be added by shocking it. However, shock is generally short-lived and the amount of chlorine in the water will rapidly decrease after shock is added. To combat the loss of chlorine and stabilize the total/free chlorine levels, you use chlorine tablets, which dissolve in a time-release manner to add chlorine back into the system at a relatively constant rate. The number/size of chlorine tablets you need depends on the size of your pool, whether it normally stays covered or open, how much cyanuric acid you have, whether you have a dispenser (which further controls the amount of chlorine released into the pool by controlling the flow of water into the dispenser chamber with the dissolving tablets) etc. Like I said, chlorine tablets are not a replacement for shock and vice-versa. A chlorine tablet in the skimmer won't harm anything, but it may cause the tablet to dissolve too quickly, over-chlorinating the pool.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Algaecide</strong> - Included in many shock products and also available separately, the typical algaecide is a quaternary sanitizer that is more effective against multi-cellular algaes than chlorine alone, and is generally less harmful to humans (quat sanitizers are food-safe where bleach is not). If the test strip says the water's good, but the pool walls feel slimy, a dose of algaecide is usually the answer. Too much algaecide can cause a loss of chlorine (quaternary sanitizers are based on ammonia, and those chloramine gases I mentioned earlier that cause ""burn-off"" are chlorinated ammonium compounds) and can also mess with pH (remove chlorine from a balanced mixture, and the alkali metals left behind will react with the water itself to form hydroxides, raising pH).

"Downsides of Linoleum (in kitchen specifically)","26487","","<p>I am thinking of replacing tiled floor in my kitchen with linoleum (in Canada). I see a few benefits to it, 1) easy to wash 2) fallen glassware doesn't always break. However, there seems to be unexplained negative attitude towards linoleums. (At least from my experience.) What are real downsides of linoleum?</p>
","<p>Do they still make Linoleum?  lol.  Today there are many types of sheet flooring goods. the most common is vinyl sheet flooring. The newest style which is gaining popularity very quickly is fiberglass sheet flooring. This fiberglass flooring is very different than vinyl. If has a padded backing and is set with removable adhesive or with no adhesive at all. Some of the tile patterns look so much like real tile, you have to get on your hands and knees to check it out.  It also give you a softer feel under your feet.  They are no wax and clean with simple mild cleansers. It comes in 12 and 16 foot widths, is very easy to work with even in cold temps, and best of all, it is very competitively priced. </p>

<p>If your tile floor is becoming unservicable or you really want to change it, you may be able to level right over it with a flooring compound. This will level the grout lines and allow you to put sheet goods directly over it without having to remove the tile or overcoat with plywood. If your existing tile is sound, it would make a good stable base if prepared properly. </p>

"How do I fix a shutoff valve that isn't opening?","26351","","<p>My dishwasher started leaking over the weekend. I turned off the water at the shutoff in the basement, it's a standard faucet type in the copper piping. </p>

<p>I then replaced the rubber heater hose used to feed water to the dishwasher, which had sprung the leak.</p>

<p>Trying to turn the water back on, I realized that the valve isn't opening. It turns repeated, and I've turned it many many times, but no water is flowing. </p>

<p>Is it possible that while turning off the water I stripped the thread, broke a washer, etc, stopping it from opening?</p>

<p>How can I fix this? Is it like a normal faucet that I can turn off the water to it, remove the packing nut, and replace the valve or whatever has broken underneath?</p>

<hr>

<p>Also, valve and shutoff are new tag, so I can't create them, but would probably be relevant.</p>
","<p>From the way you describe it, it sounds like it's a regular gate valve.  You might be able to repair it as you describe by removing the packing nut and replacing whatever is broken or stripped out inside.  </p>

<p>The only exception to that would be a ball type valve, but those will just have a handle that makes only a 1/4 turn.  Those generally aren't repairable, but then again they almost never fail either.</p>

<p>Personally, I would just remove and replace the gate valve with a good ball valve.  Gate valves have a tendency to rot out or seize up from lack of use.  I actually had one once that disintegrated in my hand when I tried to turn it off (spraying water everywhere and making a nice mess).  Ball valves are just much more reliable.</p>

"How to prevent batteries leaking out in devices?","26283","","<p>Is there a common method of preventing batteries from leaking out and destroying the device?  Why does this happen in the first place?  I have laid another head lamp to waste because it was sitting in my truck unused for several months.  Could it be because of the lack of use?  In that case, should the batteries be taken out in anticipation of less use?</p>
","<p>Acid cell and Alkaline Batteries function by a process of controlled corrosion of two different elements which creates a voltage potential and a current if the circuit is completed.</p>

<p>This process is in continuous motion from the day of manufacture, while it sits on the shelf in its packaging, while installed in the equipment during off/idle periods. It accelerates with higher discharge rate during use, and continues after the cell is unable to produce useful power to run the device</p>

<p>Alkaline batteries have a sealed container that serves as one of the electrodes. While it undergoes a lot slower corrosion than the case on the old Acid cells, it still corrodes. It is part of the process that allows the battery to function. You don't prevent it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Dead batteries should never be left in equipment, their process is nearly complete and the shell is close to breach.</li>
<li>Live batteries have a date on them for a reason. Chemical reaction occurs even if the battery is live and able to run the equipment. Often with today's LED technology, for example, the batteries will corrode through and start leaking long before they become too weak to run the flashlight.</li>
<li>Prevention is worth a pound of cure. Remove batteries from the device when not in use for extended periods of time. If it is part of a crash kit where you need batteries with the device at all times for emergency use, store them in a separate ziplock bag and check their dates periodically as well as for leakage.</li>
<li>Don't mix different cells in a device which takes more then one cell. Alkaline cells tend to leak when a potential voltage is applied, i.e. when you try to charge them. This can happen in devices with more than one cell in series if some of the cells have less capacity than others. This is why one should never mix cells by type, brand or age in devices where the cells are connected in series (which is virtually all devices that take cells in the same compartment).</li>

"How do I easily separate unglued PVC pipe from joints?","26164","","<p>I've been retrofitting an existing PVC irrigation system around my house. Part of that work requires that I work in shallow holes adding T joints and elbows in places where there were none before.

More often than not however I'm running into issues separating the slip joints and pipes despite the fact they aren't yet glued. </p>

<p>What's the best way to separate these joints? Should I be applying some sort of lubricant beforehand (that won't affect gluing later on) or is there a trick beyond forcing things? With too much force I'm afraid I'm going to break pre-existing joints or mangle the existing fittings.</p>
","<p>The best lubrication I've found is some good ol' <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_grease"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Elbow Grease™</a>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hx5st.jpg"" alt=""Elbow Grease""></p>

<p>Actually, you should measure the proper lengths and just cut. Then glue it up and install. You can mark on the PVC how far it should go into the fitting if you want to be really precise. However PVC itself expands and contracts a lot with temperature change and is fairly flexible anyway. So, in my opinion,  being extremely precise doesn't mean all that much anyway. Also, The solvent melts the PVC surface to weld them together, so the fittings will likely fit differently while gluing, thus making the dry-fit method even worse than just measuring.</p>

<p>Another solution could be to mark how far in the fitting the piece should go and lay them next to each-other in that position, even tape them together, to check your layout. That seems pretty time-intensive, though. I still think it would be better to just measure accurately and double check your measurements.</p>

<li>the lightweight is easier to sand but I hardly sand... so this hardly ever helps me</li>

<p>I've never done this before so I'm guessing I screwed up somewhere or am using a bad brand of polyurethane... or maybe just need to apply more coats.</p>
","<p>First of all, I'm assuming you already sanded the surface smooth enough before you started. If you put polyurethane on a rough surface you will get a rough finish.</p>

<p>Second, as @keshlam says, make sure there is no dust at all on the surface before you apply the finish. A slightly damp cloth can help pick up anything remaining (but make sure the wood is dry before you apply). Also, don't bother trying to apply a finish in a dusty environment, that's just asking for frustration.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that you kept brushing over the finish as it dried, which is a common beginner mistake. Moving quickly, do a thin coat over the surface and then <strong>don't go back to touch it up</strong>. Small bubbles may form on the surface as air comes out but it will be OK. If you keep re-brushing over the finish as it gets tacky you will leave the surface rough.</p>

<p>Finally, your chosen brand (Minwax) is perfectly fine, so no particular concerns there. If the can has been sitting a while make sure you stir it before using, but <strong>don't shake</strong>. You don't want to introduce unnecessary air into the poly.</p>

<p>My question is, why is 40/60 the highest these switches go? Can I adjust it higher without damaging the pump or tank? For example, as long as I increase the air pressure in the bladder to 48 psi, can I set the switch to 50/70?</p>
","<p>It's not a free pass going to higher pressure.</p>

<p>First off, any given pressure tank has a larger drawdown (tidal volume, amount of useful water stored) at 20/40 than any higher setting. Unless you increase the size of, or add additional pressure tanks, at a higher pressure your pump will stop and start more frequently (which is usually considered to be a large factor in how fast it wears out - running longer and starting less is better than running less each time, but starting more.) As you can see from the example chart below, for a given tank, 40/60 is already less than half the volume stored at 20/40.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/19VZH.jpg"" alt=""tankchart""> </p>

<p>This version is not quite as bad (they do vary a bit):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/meQ0n.png"" alt=""another tank chart""></p>

<p>You will need to check your tank, but most pressure tanks are good to 100 or 125 PSI (the ones in the upper chart are only 75 though), so that's probably not the limiting factor. You'll need to check what the pressure on your hot water heater's temperature-pressure valve is, but it's probably also fine. My pump supplier suggested (and I installed) a 100PSI overpressure valve on the system as the pipe entered the house.</p>

<p>Many common items (toilet valves, etc) don't really like pressure over 80 PSI (yes, I know you only proposed 70.) 60/80 is about as high as you can expect to adjust most pump control valves to.</p>

<p>It's not the most common situation, but if your well pump is marginal for the depth you may reach a situation where it's cannot reach the higher setpoint as you use water and draw the well level down - so it will sit and spin but not reach the shutoff pressure.</p>

<p>If your system was designed for 20/40, I'd suggest doubling or tripling your tank capacity if going to 40/60, and tripling if going to 50/70. How important that is may be influenced by how deep and inconvenient and expensive your pump will be to change when its time comes. Cheap and easy, maybe you don't bother increasing the tank at all. Expensive and a major hassle - you might consider more tankage a good investment.</p>

"How do outdoor mist-cooling A\C units fare in real-world usage?","25746","","<p>I live in Phoenix where summer outdoor temperatures regularly exceed 110&deg;F and humidity around 15% or lower is not uncommon. In this environment a mist system can easily pull the temperature down 20 to 30 or even 40 degrees in some cases. I've been toying with the idea of cooling my outdoor AC unit using mist, and did a little research.</p>

<p>There are several commercially-available systems to do precisely this such as <a href=""http://smartmistsystems.com/"">this industrial unit</a> and <a href=""http://coolnsave.com/"">this residential one</a>. But I wanted to get an idea of what other people think of these systems. In particular, I'm interested in the long-term effects of using these systems, especially with respect to mineral build-up and corrosion. The vendors of the commercial systems claim to have these factors under control, but I'd rather hear it from a neutral POV.</p>

<p>I'm not particularly interested in unfounded FUD or enthusiasm, and comments like, <em>""if it works so well then we'd all be using it""</em> are particularly unhelpful.  Instead, I would like to know how these units <em>actually</em> fare in real-world usage. Also, bear in mind that this is Phoenix, not New Orleans; in the dry summer heat nothing stays wet for more than a few seconds. Factors like mold are an absolute non-issue.</p>
","<p>Mineral build-up is going to be dependent on your water. Do you have a Water Quality Report? Mine looks like this:</p>

<p>Hard water starts around 10 grains per gallon or 170 ppm. In other words, 1 liter of water will have 0.17 grams of calcium/magnesium. I didn't see any water usage estimates for coolnsave aside from 6 cents per day. Also, they sell a water treatment filter which could take some of the minerals out but there aren't any details provided.</p>

<p>The thermodynamics behind coolnsave are sound and the price is reasonable. Your best bet if no one here has any personal experience is to just try it yourself, keeping a daily inspection schedule for the first month to be sure you aren't coating your condenser with something that you can't remove.</p>

<p>I remember back in my college days, having a badly damaged outlet plug on a built-in dresser/vanity right above my bed (the face had cracked away exposing the metal contacts for the hot and ground). My solution, not needing the plug at all, was simply to tape over it.

<p>How then would an electrician or maintenance guy attempt to replace the outlet while keeping it live? Obviously the average joe working on his home wiring should ALWAYS kill the breaker (because otherwise he can kill himself), but if you HAD to work on a live circuit, as a professional electrician, how would you prepare/protect yourself?</p>

"Am I having trouble finding studs because my walls are lath and plaster?","25644","","<p>I picked a TV mount from Ikea. The TV itself is being mounted to some paneling which in turn is mounted to set of wooden draws. In addition, it gives you hardware to mount the panels to the walls. It's not really meant to support any weight, just to keep it from swaying back and forth. So I picked up a cheap stud sensor (Zircon E30) but I'm not having very good luck with it. As soon as I start sliding it, it usually just starts indicating an error. Occasionally it tells me there's a stud, but on subsequent passes the results are far from exact. Right now I think I have an idea of where two studs are but it's a very rough guess.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if this is because this model is junk, or could I have lath and plaster walls? I'm pretty sure the walls are not drywall, just judging from the way they have crumbled when I tried to put a screw in them previously. Usually the paper coating on plaster doesn't allow it to crumble like that. Plus drywall usually seems to crumble more into a fine powder and this crumbles more into sand or little pebbles.</p>

<p>So does anyone know if there's a way I can tell if the walls are lath and plaster? Or does anyone know if this stud finder is no good? They do make a slightly more expensive model which is supposed to work better with lath and plaster walls. I just don't want to go and spend the money buying if it I don't really need it. Plus I'll probably wind up using it this one time and never see it again.</p>

<p>Any suggestions? I did try knocking on the walls and trying to hear a difference, but that wasn't really working for me.</p>

<p>edit: I just wanted to let people know I used this sensor: <a href=""http://zircon.com/products/metal_m40.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zircon.com/products/metal_m40.html</a> and it seemed to work pretty well. So if you have lath and plaster walls, might want to give that one a try.</p>
","<p>From your description of putting a screw into the walls, it certainly sounds as if you have lath-and-plaster.  Another sign is the color of the dust: with drywall, it will be very white and uniform, whereas with lath-and-plaster, it's greyish and has darker flecks.</p>

<p>A lot of stud finders work by detecting the change in the dielectric constant of the wall as you move horizontally across the wall.  Stud finders have a hard time with lath-and-plaster because the plaster is solid and can often be 1/2"" thick, then underneath the plaster you there are only small gaps between the wood lath, so you never really get the sharp change in capacitance that they look for.  On the other hand, drywall is spongy so there's less material between the stud finder and the stud that it's supposed to be sensing.</p>

<p>I had a deep-scan stud finder, and it wasn't that reliable, but I developed a technique that I had reasonable success with: do several scans at different heights and different starting points on the wall, noting where it said there was a stud.  I also found that scanning slowly was better than faster.  Eventually, I would get to an ""average"" location that was a pretty good guess.</p>

<p>I later learned (at least in my house) is that there's a stud on each interior wall right where it runs into an exterior wall.  I could then mark 16"", 32"", etc.  back from that stud and be OK.</p>

","<p><strong>Patching:</strong></p>

<p>When patching smaller holes, a 6"" taping knife should suffice.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5tZli.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Apply the compound in a few light coats rather than a single heavy coat, and sand between each coat. </p>

<p>You can either sand the patch using a sanding block like the <a href=""http://www.acehardware.com/product/index.jsp?productId=4023681&amp;CAWELAID=474520372"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3M® Fine/Medium Large Drywall Sanding Sponge</a>,</p>

<p>or wet sand using a slightly damp rag. If you choose to wet sand, let the area dry before applying the next coat.</p>

<p>For larger holes, you'll have to fill the hole with something solid before you apply compound (don't try to fill the hole with mud). Once the hole is filled, start with a 6"" taping knife for the first coat. Next, apply a few thin coats using a 10"" taping knife</p>

<p>feathering the compound out to blend into the wall.</p>

<p>When working with drywall compound it's a good idea to use a Hawk, or a mud pan instead of working directly from the bucket. This will insure that you don't end up with little bits of junk in the compound, and that the compound in the bucket won't dry out too much while you're working. They are also good for catching falling mud.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jTqrx.jpg"" alt=""Adapter Installation""></p>

<p>Is this really designed as a grounding device, or is it there simply as an attachment means to insure the thing doesn't fall out of the receptacle?</p>
","<h1>Grounding from plug to Box</h1>

<p>Looking at the second picture in the question, makes the grounding path to the box evident.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r2tfZ.png"" alt=""Grounding path to box""></p>

<p>While the yoke of the device may not be a great (or approved) grounding path (unless it's a self grounding device), it may well serve as a grounding path in an emergency. Which when it comes down to it, is the purpose of the equipment grounding conductor.</p>

<h1>Grounding from box to earth</h1>

<p>In some situations conductors leading to the box may be either in metallic conduit, or cable assemblies sheathed in a metallic covering.  In some cases, these metallic pathways can provide and adequate grounding path. In these situations, the grounding ring on the adapter can indeed provide and adequate grounding path.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are a lot of situations where nonmetallic cable is used to supply nongrounding type receptacles.  In these cases, the grounding ring will not provide a path to ground. </p>

<h1>Potential Hazards</h1>

<p>Without an adequate path to ground from the box, this setup could actually be <strong>more</strong> dangerous.  </p>

<h2>Short to ground inside the box</h2>

<p>If for some reason the ungrounded (hot) conductor comes into contact with the metallic box, the box can become energized.  If this adapter is connected, the grounding conductor of the plugged in device can also be energized. In this case, if the grounding conductor is attached to a metallic outer covering of the plugged in device. The outer covering can be energized, and becomes a potential shock/electrocution hazard.</p>

<h2>Inadequate grounding path</h2>

<p>If the box is supplied using older armored cable, the cable sheathing may actually be a high resistance path to ground.  This could lead to heating of the cable sheath, in some cases to the point of ignition of surrounding building materials. Modern armored cables provide a low resistance path to ground, and are often approved to be used as a grounding means. So if newer cable is used, this may not be a problem.</p>

<h2>Broken grounding path</h2>

<p>The box containing the receptacle may be supplied using modern cabling, and a grounding path may be present. However, the modern cabling may be connected to older cabling that does not provide a grounding path. In this case, fault current will follow the grounding path back to the junction between old and new cabling, and lead to potential hazards at that location.</p>

<h1>tl;dr</h1>

<p>In some cases these devices work as intended, and provide an adequate path to ground.  In other cases they do not, and can potentially introduce other hazards.  Though we must keep in mind, the equipment grounding conductor is a safety device. Under normal operating conditions, this path will never have current flowing through it.  Because of this, the dangers from a device like this are limited.</p>

"How can I attach a ledger board to my house?","25416","","<p>Spring is here so I finally started to take measurements for materials I will need to build a new deck on my recently constructed home. I just realized that this isn't going to be quite so simple as I originally planned.</p>

<p>My house was constructed with engineered I beams and what I believe is an engineered OSB rim joist perpendicular to those (looking from the back of the house). Knowing this I knew that lag screws or even carriage bolts to hold a ledger board would not be sufficient.  Upon my own research it seemed the accepted way to handle this is to take a piece of 2 by into the inside of the I of the joist, and run a carriage bolt, through the ledger board, sheathing, rim joist and finally the added block, and to do this twice, staggered and 16"" OC for each joist after that.</p>

<p>My father-in-law who has built several decks and is critical to this DIY project refuses to do this and he has his reasons which I respect and won't get into.</p>

<p>A better plan in his opinion would be something similar to what is described <a href=""http://joneakes.com/jons-fixit-database/1224-Attaching-a-deck-to-a-house"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in this article</a></p>

<p>In the old days when he built decks with his dad, they used to lag and anchor ledger boards to the concrete foundation and then toenail the joists on top. They apparently make special ties now for this purpose that is an improvement on the old toe-nail method. It seems like a much better idea and if I use 2x10 or 2x12 joists then the deck will be pretty much at the bottom of the kitchen door where it needs to be.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1: I assume that if these clips are still being produced that it must be code assuming proper lag screws and spacing have secured the ledger board?</strong></p>

<p>My second complication... assuming I go this route, only 1 deck ledger board will be attached to a poured concrete wall (the garage).  The very back of the house is actually not a poured foundation wall but a 2x6 framed exterior wall with sheathing, and a decorative stone masonry product.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2: If I were to cut away the masonry and lag into the 2x6 studs for the ledger support, would this be a sturdy code compliant ledger board?</strong></p>

<p>And finally, if applicable, if I were to cut away the masonry to mount a ledger board, I would be worried about water possibly penetrating and getting behind the decorative masonry.</p>

If I can't find a clear cut answer then I will probably just hire somebody to do this because the aggravation this is causing me is not worth it.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter how the joists have bearing, whether it is a hanger, ledger, or beam. Just use the appropriate hardware/fasteners for the application.</p>

<p>Back in the ""good old days"" when homes were <a href=""http://oikos.com/esb/27/balloon_framing.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">balloon-framed</a> they would use let-in ledgers or ribbon boards to support the floor framing (which was also nailed to the studs, though).

<p>Again, flashing is the most important part (aside from proper fastening). You have to lap the flashing properly with the building paper. Just remember the direction water flows so the surfaces have to lap the same way a shingle would. See image below for a good illustration of proper flashing. You can also read <a href=""http://www.finehomebuilding.com/tool-guide/departments/what-is-the-difference/ledger-flashing.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this short article</a> describing some of the flashing material choices.</p>

"How much should replacing septic tank lids cost, and what is involved?","25263","","<p>My wife and I may be possibly buying a house with a septic tank.  We had it inspected and the report showed that the tank was in good condition however the ""tank lids"" would need to be replaced. </p>

<p>I'm going to call around to get prices for service however I was hoping to have a ballpark figure so I know what I would be getting myself into... can someone provide me with some estimated costs? Are we talking hundreds of dollars here? Thousands of dollars? </p>

<p>In addition, how complicated of a process is it to replace the lids? </p>
","<p>To some extent, this is going to depend on the lids required by the manhole material, and local codes.  In our area, for example, both concrete manhole covers, as well as bolted down plastic covers are acceptable.  That being said, either way it shouldn't be terribly expensive, if it is only the lid that needs to be replaced.  For example- I just had a pump tank and elevated drain field added to my system.  The tanks that were put in had plastic corrugated manholes, and I opted for plastic lids (the manhole can then be brought down to ground level, and you can mow right over the lid).  IIRC the lids themselves were $75/each or so.  They just use a 6"" lag screw that goes into the plastic manhole (if it is a matter of simply replacing existing plastic lids, you can probably do it yourself).</p>

<p>From my conversation with the installer, he said that using the concrete lids (same type that we have for the primary tank) would be around the same price.  I have no idea what the old steel lids cost, but I would guess they are a bit more pricey.</p>

<p>In terms of the labor- if it is just replacing the lids, and no work needs to be done to the manhole, I would guess an hour job at most.  If the existing lids are plastic- just unscrew the lag screw, pull the old lid off, put the new one on, and screw down the lag screw.  If it is a concrete lid, just dig up the lid (ours were a couple inches under ground, except for the PVC pump tube), pull up the handles, pull off the old lid, place in the new lid.  Throw the dirt/sod back on top.</p>

"PEX for hot water tank","25195","","<p>I was just replacing an electrical hot water tank.</p>

<p>Had to call a plumber because I didn't fancy my soldering skills on something that could flood the house. The plumber simply cut off the old copper lines (after the shutoff valve) and used pex to connect the tank and as a vent pipe.</p>

<p>Apart from if I'd known you could do that I would have done it myself - is this OK?<br>
Seems to have been tightened with proper synch connectors and it certainly works.</p>
","<p>PEX is usually rated at 180° F (82° C) -- it should say on the side of the pipe what the actual rating is. As long as your water heater temperature is below that, you're fine.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_heating"" rel=""nofollow"">From wikipedia</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two seemingly conflicting safety issues around water heater temperature—the risk of scalding from excessively hot water greater than 55 °C (131 °F), and the risk of incubating bacteria colonies, particularly Legionella, in water that is not hot enough to kill them. Both risks are potentially life threatening and are balanced by setting the water heater's thermostat to at least 54.4 °C (130 °F). The European Guidelines for Control and Prevention of Travel Associated Legionnaires’ Disease recommend that hot water should be stored at 60 °C (140 °F) and distributed such that a temperature of at least 50 °C and preferably 55 °C is achieved within one minute at outlets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As @Michael points out, a T&amp;P safety valve is rated to go off at 210°F (100°C), so if something does go wrong and your water heater overheats, there is a possibility the PEX will fail. If the PEX does fail, it almost certainly will happen right above the tank (which will be the hottest place, obviously). It will also serve somewhat the same job as the T&amp;P valve, except that a T&amp;P valve will close once the temperature/pressure has lowered, while a burst pipe will just keep gushing water until someone shuts off the supply.</p>

<p>The chances of water heater overheating like this are quite low: electrical heaters have thermal fuses in them that serve as an electronic safety (very hard to find the temperature rating of these: seems like it's anywhere from 167 to 210°F). In addition, the electronics are pretty reliable, and just very unlikely to fail ""on"", and without drawing too much current that would cause the breaker to trip. </p>

"How should I run speaker, HDMI and electrical wiring for my ceiling mounted projector theater room?","25071","","<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>

<p>New house built 5 years ago.  I have a basement theater room with 12 foot drywall ceilings that have HVAC conduit and recessed lighting (in other words there is some space behind/above the drywall).  I have a projector I need to ceiling mount and a surround sound system to run front and rear speakers.</p>

<p>I plan to have the projector in the ceiling and the other electronics (receiver, etc) off to the side of the room on the ground (receiver cabinet).  So I need to run power and HDMI from the receiver cabinet to the projector as well as speaker wire from the receiver cabinet to the four corners of the room.  I have a 25 foot HDMI, speaker wire and an indoor/outdoor extension cord.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>

<p><strong>My primary concern is how to run the HDMI and power to the projector.</strong>  Should I run some sort of conduit or channel in the ceiling (exposed or hidden) -- like a server room runs ethernet cable?  If behind the wall, is it safe/code to run an extension cord behind the drywall in the ceiling to power the projector?  </p>

<p>I may run the speaker along the baseboard simply to avoid extensive wiring/holes in my ceiling so I'm less concerned about how to do that.</p>
","<p>HDMI and speaker wire are basically signal wires, not power wires. Both the voltage and amperage is very low.  Indoors it is safe to run these hidden or exposed without channel or conduit <em>if they are properly rated</em>. See <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/16028/what-should-i-use-to-secure-organize-data-cable-runs/16073#16073"">this Q&amp;A</a> for a discussion of proper rating. </p>

<p>When channel or conduit is used, it is either for convenience in handling, and to keep the wires away from other materials, or it is used to improve the aesthetics - channel can be painted and looks neater than cables.</p>

<p>There are limits as to how much signal wire can be run in cable or conduit, but this is generally a function of pure physical space and ability to pull wire, rather than heat or safety. Speaker wire can be tacked to baseboards or other molding if that works. be careful to avoid breaking the insulation or the inner wires when stapling, and if you put wire under moldings, be careful not to nail through.  Its not a danger issue, is a broken wire/no signal issue.</p>

<p>Power, including extensions to run a projector, is very different.  No code allows extension cords to be buried in wall. I don't think any codes allow extensions to be tacked to baseboards. Also power cables should not run parallel to signal wires - they can cause interference even though many signal wires (like HDMI) are shielded.</p>

<p>You need to bring a regular, properly installed power line to the projector. This can be properly installed NM cable inside a wall to an outlet box.  It can be surface wiring, but this requires standard metalic surface channels and boxes such as <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-100669776/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1&amp;keyword=surface%20wiring&amp;storeId=10051"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> and <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=100657485&amp;storeId=10051&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;MERCH=REC-_-product-1-_-surface;wiring;100657470-_-100657485-_-N"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>:</p>

<p>One other note.  Lampcord is often used as speaker wire. It is the same as is used for AC power cords and small extension cords. If you are using such wire, be careful, if you are burying in walls or stapling, that it is speaker wire rather than power carrying wire.</p>

<li><em>For example, if it's sticking out when it's off and likely for someone to accidentally bump into or get caught on it, then install it the other way so that doesn't happen.</em> </li>
</ul></li>
<li>If clearance and safety are non-issues, and there are other valves present, then <strong>follow the convention of existing valves</strong>. 

<ul>
<li><em>If you have pipes that flow in opposite directions it's very handy to ensure the valves indicate this.</em> </li>

"How does a microwave door interlock work and is a DIY repair feasible?","25048","","<p>Our microwave has developed a problem.  If the door isn't shut just so, the microwave thinks that it is open.  The door can be shut too lightly or too hard to exhibit the problem.  Recently it has began to pause right in the middle of cooking because it thinks the door has suddenly opened when it is still shut tightly.</p>

<p>From what I've read, the problem is likely with the ""door interlock"", a kind of sensor (or multiple sensors) that let the microwave know when the door is open or closed.</p>

<p>How do these sensors work, and is it possible to fix them yourself?  (I don't mind taking things apart.)</p>

<p>The specific microwave in question is a GE Profile PVM1790 over the range model.</p>
","<p>The door interlock circuit is typically at least 3 microswitches which have to close/open in a specific sequence and arrive at a specific end-configuraton to convince the controller that the door was actually closed properly, rather than a crude attempt at bypassing the switches being made.</p>

<p>The switches themselves are normally very reliable (they are one of the nearly always salvageable parts of dead microwave ovens) but if the door-latch has worn or broken it may not contact them correctly.</p>

<p>In short, I suspect the sensors (switches) are probably fine, but the mechanical parts that actuate them are more likely to be the problem.</p>

<p>As for testing the switches, just check for continuity - the NO contact should be not connected until the switch is pressed, the NC contact should be connected until the switch is pressed, and both should change to the other condition when the switch is pressed. Pay attention to what wires are connected and where the switches are - it's typical for a contact to be cut off if not used, and which switch goes where (and which wires connect to it, where) are important for the whole business working correctly.</p>

"How can I test network and coax jacks?","24878","","<p>We bought new house and I need to test network (RJ45) and coax jacks to see which ones are working. How can I do that without actually connecting computers/cable boxes?</p>
","<p>Very good question but you need to find out more information.</p>

<p>The very first question on my mind is.. Where do they connect to ? if they are connected to anything else at all?</p>

<p><strong>A simple solution</strong></p>

<p>Find the starting point(A) and the end point(B) of either cable.</p>

<p>Using a multimeter and a *return cable** you test continuity of the cable. Either using Ohms = 0 which means short circuit(in this case good because the cable is good) or some meters have buzzer if there is continuity.</p>

<p>You can also test the cable without a return cable, by joining the ends (centre and shield- or a pair) at one side and testing the centre core and shield on the other. This will test the entire continuity. If there is no continuity - which means the cable is broken - then you would not know if its the core or shield. But at least you will know the cable needs replacing.</p>

<p><strong>RJ45 Network cable used for 10/100Base Networks.</strong></p>

<p>This is very time consuming because RJ45 have several strands of cable so testing one after the other can be beach. But one clever solution is to make a loopback on point B and test the corresponding points on PointA. If it does not loop back then the cable is most likely broken.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/buAP9.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>There are also network testing equipment that do the same as mentioned above.. but you have nice flashy lights and a nice loopback box supplied.Ebay a few bucks each for el cheapo ones.</p>

<p><strong>COAX</strong></p>

<p>Coax is a funny one and depends on what you need it for. Coax for TV, satellite or CCTV again. On digital signals you might get choppy or images cutting in and out if there interference. On analog you will see allot of ""snow"" or shadows. It is best to replace or check the fittings to see that the connections are good.</p>

<p>But you can test the cable also ...</p>

<ol>
<li>Center to shield (No Ohm reading - No beep)</li>
<li>Center to Center (Short/Continuity - Beep)</li>
<li>Shield to Shield (Short/Continuity - Beep)</li>
</ol>

<p>An extra step here (1) is to test for short circuit between single(centre) and (shield) without and return cable or joining any end. This will check if there is a short circuit on the coax.Possibly a nail or screw when right through the cable. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/u05Ml.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The other part if its used for a network then it all has to be connected and terminated to test it(but its unlikely its used for network because these types or network have been eradicated because of unreliability) </p>

<h2>REMEMBER</h2>

<p>This will only test if the cables are in an operable state. So you connect it and it will work. The bandwidth, noise-to-signal and interference will greatly depend on the quality of the cable, workmanship during installations, etc.</p>

<p>EG
The RJ45 could be rated for Gigabit but your bandwidth could a mere 250mbs(1/4 bandwidth) because the shielding has not been done properly, or the ends have been poorly installed, the cable is near high voltage lines, the cable is severely bent ins several places along the way.</p>

<p>COAX in general either works or not.But for Analog Video; again many factors come into play. For digital(eg satellites) it should be ok</p>

<p>*return cable - A long piece of wire that you know is OK. You will attach this at Point B and run it freely back to your meter. This way you can test the continuity of a single core.</p>

<p>However, the last week has been a wet one. Today, especially, has been near flood conditions to the point that they are closing many local schools. <strong>I still have not seen or heard the pump come on</strong>.</p>

<p>The sump pump power runs into the power cord from a switch, which then plugs directly into the dedicated circuit. The switch cord connects to a float set up in the sump pit, along with the pump itself.</p>

<p>The sump pit is a 25+ gallon pit with several drainage lines feeding into it at various levels. It has standing water in the pit, which I, as I understand things, does not necessarily indicate a problem. However, the water has risen above the highest drainage pipe, to within six inches of the lip. Still, the pump has not switched on.</p>

<p>I tried manually running the pump, and it operates fine, draining fairly quickly - half an inch or so in under 60s even during a moderate amount of rainfall. So my concern isn't that there are problems with the pump. Rather, I am concerned about the switch.</p>

<p>I do not see the float anywhere in the water. How high can the water get before it is certain that there is a problem?</p>

<p>Note that my fiancee and I are leaving town on Saturday to get married. We will be gone for two weeks. More rain is anticipated, so if I need to replace the switch, it must be tonight or tomorrow.</p>

<p>Edit to include pics:</p>

<p>This is what the pit looks like currently:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/K9kLE.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>This is the water-level of the pit. The brown line on the stick marks the water-line. The paint-can is a full-size paint can, used to show scale:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vzwaS.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>
","<p>It should definately come on before the water gets to that level. Is the float the kind that has its cord clamped to a pipe and it swings up and down? If its that kind, make sure that its not hung up on anything. You may need to manually run the pump to empty the water and troubleshoot the float. Lift it and see if the pump comes on. Does the float have a separate cord that plugs into the outlet and then the pump plugs into the back of the floats plug?</p>

<p>I agree that it should pump more than a half inch per minute. I would think it would be normal to empty the tank in around 20-30 seconds.</p>

"Should I use a roller or a brush for painting exterior walls?","24804","","<p>I'm about to embark on painting my house. I have researched all the info here and on painting sites I can find about preparation and safety etc., but I'm still not sure the best choice regarding applying the actual paint itself.</p>

<p>I'm wondering should I just get a Big Brushes (125mm?) or should I cut in under each plank and around windows, then roller what I can, or just do the lot with brushes?</p>
","<p>You absolutely want to use a brush for most exterior surfaces, and definitely the siding and trim.  The only time to ever use a roller is on a large flat surface (think drywall, or plywood paneling) -- in the image you provided I might use a roller for the white soffit, but that's it and only if it's a large house.</p>

<p>Aside from avoiding unsightly ""orange peel"" effect that a roller will undoubtedly case, applying the paint back and forth with a paintbrush will work the paint into the surface of the product in a way that a pass over the top with a roller will not.  This is especially true with wood surfaces, but generally true with most surfaces.  Just imagine being paint on a relatively smooth surface.  Wouldn't it be easier to peel if you were rolled on in one large sheet, than if you were brushed on and worked into the surface with each brushstroke?</p>

<p>Exceptions to the rule, for exterior surfaces are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Concrete - I roll foundations and cement block with 1"" nap roller</li>
<li>""Cedar Shake"" siding (think Cape Cod) where I apply the paint with a 1-1.25"" nap roller, then backbrush to work it into the siding and catch drips (this is much faster than brushing, and higher quality than spraying)</li>
<li>Large soffits or areas where I'm working over my head for long periods</li>
<li>T111 siding, vertical barn siding, etc, but in all cases I backbrush</li>
</ul>

<p>Definitely buy a 4"" brush for this project.</p>

"Can I modify the vent from my high efficiency furnace to prevent possible damage to the exterior of my home?","24760","","<p>is my high efficiency furnace vent installed properly? I'm based in Toronto, Canada. In some recent cold winter weather, the exhaust is causing a lot of ice buildup on the surrounding brick. To my limited knowledge, lots of freeze / thaw cycles for brick is a bad thing, which can cause brick to deteriorate rapidly. So is this an issue? If so, is it worth correcting and are there any easy DIY solutions that you would recommend? </p>

<p>Could I change the venting to just be one vent, instead of two (right now the exhaust vents both up and down)? And maybe aim the exhaust a bit further from the brick? </p>

","<p>I am a Local HVAC Tech in the Toronto area. As stated, this exhaust is not installed according to local codes and the manufacturers installation instructions. There is no surprise that you are getting freezing condensation on the brick of the house. The reason for having the vent terminate straight out and away from the building is to avoid this. The facing of the brick will chip off after a few years of this. Another issue i see is that any exhaust for a high efficiency gas appliance must be insulated when being run in an unconditioned space (such as in a garage or running under a deck). Now if the termination is 2ft or less, you do not need to insulate the exhaust. However, in your situation there is a long termination, which requires it being insulated to prevent freezing. </p>

<p>My solution would be to cut off the tee at the end of the termination, slide on armaflex pipe insulation around the exhaust. You should have from where the tee started, to where the pipe enters the house fully insulated. Then using system 636 PVC glue and primer if doing it in cold weather, glue a system 636 PVC elbow onto the end of the termination so that it is blowing the exhaust straight away from the house. Then cut a 6"" piece of system 636 2"" PVC pipe and glue that into the elbow to help throw the exhaust further away from the structure. Doing all of the above would solve all the termination issues, and bring it back up to code.</p>

"What are some cost-effective tips for reducing external sound from entering a room?","24711","","<p>I have a small office room that shares a wall with our living room.  When we have guests over, their voices travel fairly well; they sound somewhat muffled but are still audible.  As I work from home occasionally, I'd like to reduce any/all noise as much as I can. </p>

<p>I'm not sure where exactly the noise is coming from... we do have central heating air ducts but the register is on the opposite wall... there's not much of a gap for the office door... maybe it's just coming through the wall itself? </p>

","<p>Step 1: <strong>Prevent air transmission</strong> between the rooms. Sweeps for the door or a heavier door; look at the heating registers and windows; things like that. You're saying the sound is muffled, which implies the high frequencies aren't making it in, so I don't think this is the major problem.</p>

<p>Step 2: <strong>Damp the transmitted vibration</strong>. Put big heavy bookcases on the wall between the two rooms (which side doesn't matter so much). Blow heavy insulation into the wall between. Hang a heavy quilt on the wall.</p>

<p>Step 3: <strong>Break up the sound</strong> in the source room. Use natural diffusers (heavy sofas with heavy foam pillows work great, or the aforementioned bookcase with loads of stuff on it), or buy foam diffusers to stick in the corners/edges of the room.</p>

<p>Step 4: Give up and wear <strong>sound-cancellation headphones</strong>...or install a <strong>white-noise generator</strong> in your office (either a fan-type one, or a water feature if you like more 'natural' sounds).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gtbZ5.jpg"" alt=""Wood floor cover in shower""></p>
","<p>There are woods used in wet environments, mostly those that are fairly impervious to rot - teak, cedar, redwood, mahogony (less so).</p>

<p><strong>Untreated:</strong> Sometimes cedar, redwood and teak are left natural. In almost all these cases, they are not exposed to prolonged soaking.  Even in saunas they are misted and then dried, not soaked the way a shower soaks. On Boats they get spashed, they dry.  When they are left untreated, the wood weathers, loses its color and eventually becomes somewhat rough. Cedar and redwood are fairly soft, and on a floor will wear out, probably quickly. Teak will last longer but will roughen up and wear out eventually. Also untreated wood tends to hold water and is more prone to developing mold or organic growths, such as bacteria, especially in a shower that is not exposed to sunlight.</p>

<p><strong>Treated:</strong> These woods can be finished with a penetrating sealer or a hard marine finish, like spar varnish or the harder polyurethanes, or even an epoxy finish. Even then, these finishes need to be redone often, sometimes every year, depending on the amount of soaking and other wear.</p>

<p>Finished or sealed Wood can be used in bathrooms where there is just an occasional spash or where the wet is quickly mopped up. I have hard pine floors finished with several coats of poly in my bathroom that works fine. My shower is a porcelain tub.</p>

<p>On the whole, it would be very questionable to put wood in a shower floor.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> There are some newer exotics used on outdoor decks such as ipe. I am not familiar with their waterproof characteristics, but even in deck use, the soaking is probably not as complete and frequent as a shower.</p>

<p>So can someone give me a brief summary of the different schedules of PVC pipes available and what each one should be used for?</p>
","<p>The schedule is the wall thickness of the pipe (essentially how much pressure it can withstand).  Wikipedia has a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_Pipe_Size#NPS_tables_for_selected_sizes"">Nominal Pipe Size Table</a> (and the article goes into the description of the size and the why behind them).</p>

<p>From this article <a href=""http://www.ehow.com/facts_5575151_difference-between-schedule-schedule-pipe.html"">http://www.ehow.com/facts_5575151_difference-between-schedule-schedule-pipe.html</a>:</p>

  <p>Schedule 40 pipe is typically used in
  construction. However, if a stronger
  pipe is needed, then Schedule 80 can

  should be considered is if the pipe is
  exposed during construction. The
  stronger pipe is more resistant to
  incidental bumping by workers or

"Why am I measuring 16 volts on a wire that should be at 0 volts?","24483","","<p>I am replacing a power receptacle at my apartment. It has the standard four wires, with one of the two reds going to a nearby toggle switch.</p>

<p>I am concerned because when the toggle switch is off, I measure 16V between one of the red wires and a white. (The other red wire always measures 0 V, so I assume it doesn't go to anything.)</p>

<p>I don't want to wire up the red if it's going to sit at 16 V when it's supposed to be off. Any ideas why this is happening or what I can do? Or is 16 sufficiently close to 0?</p>
","<p>The 16 V is likely an induced/stray/phantom voltage. That power line is ""receiving"" a voltage just like a radio would, since it is bundled along with a live wire (~120-130 V). The other red wire may be connected to ground (or neutral) somewhere, so that it is held at ~0 V.</p>

<p>If my assumption of it being an phantom voltage is true, the 16 V wouldn't be able to power any devices, and can be considered safe. It is mostly caused by the capacitance between the two wires. When you attach the multimeter to the system, you create a current path between the ""open"" wire and the neutral. The AC current then can flow between the wires (AC goes through capacitors), and then through the multimeter (which has a finite input impedance). The current flowing through your multimeter determines the voltage that you are measuring.</p>

<p>You may want to look at how the switch is wired in order to fully understand the circuit before replacing the power receptacle. Also, remember that the switch should connect/disconnect the LINE (~120 V) and not the neutral. The neutral and ground should always be connected to the outlet (and be unswitched).</p>

<p>One way to avoid this problem is to use a low-input-impedance voltmeter. Modern digital voltmeters usually have input impedances of around 10 MΩ. Using a meter with an input impedance of less than 500 kΩ will load the unconnected wire enough that it will not be able to develop a substantial phantom voltage. Adding a 500 kΩ - 1MΩ resistor in parallel with your voltmeter's input would be a reasonable way to dispell the phantom voltages (but be careful that you you are within the power rating of the resistor, power=V^2/R).</p>

<p>Old analog voltmeters often have a low enough input impedance that they will not be able to measure the phantom voltage. Also, there are some modern digital multimeters that are designed to have low enough input impedances that the phantom voltages cannot be measured. These multimeters often use PTC thermistors in parallel with their input.</p>

<h1>Lab experiment</h1>

<p>As an example, I've connected about 1 meter of NM 12/2 cable in a way similar to your situation. I connected neutral and line to the outside two conductors of the NM cable, and left the ground floating. I measured 31 V between neutral and the ground wire:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aDwX0.jpg"" alt=""Overall setup""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mO3IA.jpg"" alt=""Source connections""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4guST.jpg"" alt=""Voltage measurement""></p>

<h1>Theoretical calculation</h1>

<p>Here's an example calculation (with many simplifications, worst case scenario, etc), showing that this ""phantom"" can be quite large, written in Matlab code. It assumes that the ""red"" connector is between the ""hot"" and grounded wires, that you're using 12-gauge wire, 19 mil of insulation on each wire, dielectric constant of PVC, your multimeter's input impediance is 10 Mohm, and no inductive coupling (only capacitive coupling). It uses the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitance"" rel=""noreferrer"">capacitance formula on Wikipedia</a> for a pair of parallel wires. The assumed wire length is one meter. The result is that you see a phantom voltage of 33.4 V, similar to what I measured in ""real life"". This shows that 16 V is a ""reasonable"" phantom voltage that could be measured with modern, high input impedance, voltmeters.</p>

<p>This calculation is based on assuming that your 12/3 cable looks something like:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/O0q7X.gif"" alt=""Flat 12/3 cable""></p>

<p>This would produce a voltage divider circuit (assuming no inductive coupling) something like:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WDCA7.png"" alt=""Voltage divider circuit""></p>

<p>The phantom voltage is the voltage across Rmm (on the right side of the diagram). For AC circuits, complex numbers can be used to represent the impedance of each element in the circuit. The impedance of a capacitor is 1/(jωC). <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia has more information on voltage dividers.</a> The magnitude of the output voltage is what a multimeter would measure, and its phase can be discarded.</p>

<li>Wooden pickets (balusters): $5 each, you'll want at least one per stair and maybe two; I count at least 10 stairs that would need balusters so $50-$100</li>
<li>Handrail: $35 for 8' ($55 for 12'; you'll be cutting it down to fit rather than joining pieces)</li>
<li>Misc glue, nails, screws to put everything together; paint/stain/finish for raw wood.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, materials cost would probably run you about $250-$300; the rest of that quote is direct labor and overhead. Not being a GC you can take this next part with a grain of salt, but I would expect this to take two or three guys one day to do, so at $50/hr (that may be high or low as a standard rate for the average construction jack, but for a master tradesman that's about right) you're looking at $800-1200 for the labor. So, I'd more realistically expect a total estimate between $1200-$1500. A $2000 estimate isn't terribly excessive, depending on what your buddy had in mind, but I would get competing bids including a basic design.</p>

<p>The design I'm thinking of for this bid is very simple; put the newel post in at the bottom stair and anchor it in, bring the rail up to the bottom plate of that ceiling-to-wall transition (that has to be pretty darn solid to meet code so there's plenty of lumber to tie into) and then cut and nail the balusters down directly into each stair. The major complication would be the need to pull back the carpet from the outside edge of the stairs to install everything, then cut and re-seam the carpet around each of the balusters. Not impossible, but it adds an extra twist to the job.</p>

<p>If the contractor looking at this wanted to add a runner down the side of the staircase that would form the base for the balusters and the newel post, that's considerably more effort. That requires de-carpeting all the stairs, and possibly building in supports under the outside edge of this staircase for the extra weight, then building the runner, THEN putting in the newel post, handrail and balusters, before recarpeting the stairs. That could <em>easily</em> be a $2000 job.</p>

"How do I wire a brand new cooktop that has no white neutral wire?","24420","","<p>My old cooktop which is being replaced connects to a j-box with black, red, white, and bare ground wires, which goes to a 40 amp circuit breaker (US here, noticed this site is popular with Europe too).</p>

<p>We just bought a brand-new Bosch cooktop which only has black, red, and bare ground wires and says, ""Connect only to a 3-wire, 120/240-volt power supply; the neutral conductor is not required for the operation of the appliance. The potential at the power supply electrical connections shall be 150-volts-to-ground or less."" It also mentions wanting a 30 amp circuit breaker and being compatible with 240 or 208 volts (which I believe means it can handle single or 3-phase current, which is good since I don't know which we have).</p>

<p>I may be mixing up two questions here (circuit breaker amps and neutral wire issue) but can I wire this to the existing setup, or do I need to have the electrician come in and change something at the breaker box?</p>

<p>Note that I am fully aware the right answer is to call the electrician in to handle this and double-check everything -- I feel it is important for me to understand how this all works before calling someone in so when I talk to them I can make sure we are on the same page.</p>
","<p>In this case, you would simply not hook up the neutral wire.  Instead you can just put a wirenut on it and tuck it neatly into the electrical box.</p>

<p>Typically 240V appliances require the neutral wire so that they can run the electronics at 120v or provide a plug on the appliance.  In this case, these devices are hooked up to one leg of the hot and the neutral, giving 120V.  </p>

<p>If no neutral is required, then the device can only operate on 240V/208V, though at 208V you should expect the oven to take longer to heat up.</p>

<p>What it means by ""Connect only to a 3-wire, 120/240-volt power supply; the neutral conductor is not required for the operation of the appliance,""  is that the 240V needs to come from two legs of 120V service; this device won't function on 240V mains like you'd find in Europe.</p>

"What does a surge protector do that a breaker doesn't?","24328","","<p>The circuit breakers in my home are 120VAC, 15A or 20A breakers.</p>

<p>What would a surge protector (e.g. <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000U3FZ1G"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> or a power strip with surge protection) do that a breaker wouldn't do already?</p>
","<p>Surge protectors and circuit breakers both cut off power during exceptional conditions, but they have different purposes and react to different events:</p>

<p><strong>Circuit breakers</strong></p>

<p>Circuit breakers have only one job: <em>to prevent the wiring inside your house from catching on fire</em>. That's it, they do nothing else. They don't protect you from shocking yourself, or from lightning, or from your cat chewing through a power cord.</p>

<p>Circuit breakers work by monitoring the current (number of electrons) flowing through the wiring, and cutting off the power if the current is too high for too long (which puts the wiring in your house at risk of overheating). The higher the current, the quicker a breaker will trip: it may be just a split second or it might be hours. The idea is that a transient burst of power (e.g. when your fridge turns on) is not particularly dangerous.</p>

<p>The rating of a breaker depends only on the size and type of wire used in your house (which in turn is based on the expected usage). Typical sizes would be 15 or 20 amps for outlets and standard lighting, and higher, dedicated breakers for high-use appliances like stoves or hot water heaters.</p>

<p><strong>Surge Protectors</strong></p>

<p>Surge protectors have a very different goal: to quickly disconnect equipment from the power supply if there is a power surge. Surge protectors don't monitor the quantity of electricity, but rather it's <em>voltage</em>. An unexpectedly high voltage can force power into appliances beyond their specifications. Typically surge protectors cut off power when the voltage reaches 300V or 400V, which may be indicative of a lightning strike.</p>

<p>Surge protectors also have the job of absorbing energy due to a voltage spike. </p>

<p>Neither surge protectors nor circuit breakers do anything to regular minor fluctuations in voltage like a brownout.</p>

<p>In my opinion the need for surge protectors is somewhat overblown, since harmful power surges are relatively rare and there's no guarantee that a surge protector will be robust enough to prevent damage anyways. But they are convenient if you need extra outlets.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
@Ecnerwal's answer is correct that technically surge protectors don't disconnect the power, they redirect (or absorb) it. And his answer has much more technical detail about the types and purposes of surge protectors.</p>

"Are electrical outlets usually positioned on studs?","24315","","<p>I lack a studfinder at the moment, and I'm considering getting a wall lamp that I think is just too chic.

","<p>Yes, in general electrical outlets are installed directly next to a stud.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1rN2a.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>However, apartments may have some different things going on:</p>

<ul>
<li>There may be metal studs. These are much harder to find by knocking.</li>
<li>Outside walls especially, may be a sheet of drywall on thin strapping with concrete behind, or even the drywall right on the concrete. These walls can still have outlets (they usually install them prior to pouring), and so to hang something up, you need a hammer drill with concrete bits, and a wall plug. I'd be cautious about even using a tapcon, because you don't really know what the concrete is like underneath (poured or block - and if it's block, you may be right on a mortar joint). With a wall plug, it's mostly the drywall that will hold it up.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Do you actually need a stud? How heavy is this lamp? Certainly a stud is better, but you can always use a wall plug. Put a screw in where you suspect you have a stud and want to mount the light, and if you get it wrong, put in a plug.</p>

<p>If it's light enough, as you suggest, some of the adhesive-based hooks are probably good enough (assuming the light can be hung that way). </p>

"How can I efficiently heat a pool?","24226","","<p>Continuously heating a pool can be expensive and the best ways to lower the cost are to have a cumbersome pool cover in addition to the equipment needed (solar or an AC-like heat pump). There must be a way to say, raise the temp of my pool 5-10 degrees using propane and a well crafted ""heat exchanger"". We don't go in the pool every day so if it cools off and we need to reheat we'll know the cost to do that is a tank of propane or so.</p>

<p>Does a propane heat exchanger exist? Can I make one myself? Can I use the same pump or should I set up a separate one just for heating?</p>
","<p>Very late in answering here, but solar pool heating systems are great and pay themselves off in 1-1.5 years vs. propane and electric heaters.  They are -- by a large margin -- the most cost-efficient renewable energy application that I know of.</p>

<p>Edit: After reading your question again, I see that you said solar pool heating requires a pool cover.  It does not.  A pool cover helps greatly, especially in a cold or dry climate: almost all of the heat a pool loses is from evaporation.  However, it isn't really needed for solar.  Is an uncovered solar-heated pool going to be 95 degrees Fahrenheit pool in the Winter?  No, but it is going to give you 8-20 (depending on the size of the array) degrees Fahrenheit for free, which would costs thousands each year if done with propane.</p>

<p>Also, solar pool heating and propane are not mutually exclusive.  You can easily get a system that uses both, heating the pool at all times with solar (provided that the panels are hot enough -- properly installed solar pool-heating systems bypass the solar if the panels are cold,) but if that isn't adequate, you can turn the propane on.  As stated earlier, this setup saves thousands a year vs. propane.  The solar portion of the system will pay itself off in ~1 year vs. propane, and it will save you $10,000-$60,000 over the life of the panels.</p>

"Why do some free-standing ice makers need floor drains?","24216","","<p>I am about to begin a bar installation project. I need an ice maker. There appear to be two kinds of free standing ice makers - those that <strong>do</strong> and <strong>do not</strong> require drains.</p>

<p>Why does one type need a drain?</p>

<p>Are there other differences between these two types? </p>

<p>Are there any definitive advantages of one type over the other?</p>

<p>Is there standard placement for floor drains, or do I need to purchase and have the specific unit on hand before the plumber places the drain?</p>
","<p>Most commercial-grade ice makers don't maintain freezing temperatures in the actual ice bin; the ice itself keeps the temperature cold in the bin, and the refrigerator coil then only has to freeze the ice tray. This strategy has several advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ""cold"" side of the refrigeration coil can be placed inside the bin, right against the tray, so it makes ice faster than your ""frost-free"" kitchen freezer icemaker, without needing to be defrosted (because it doesn't have to maintain freezing temperatures, it defrosts itself automatically between batches).</li>
<li>The coil and overall refrigeration system is thus more efficient at what it does (making ice quickly).</li>
<li>The ice is easier to scoop as it doesn't melt and refreeze when exposed to the bin door opening and closing.</li>
<li>The ice is ""warm ice"" which, again, won't try to refreeze after it melts in your drink (forming that big ice ball you get from cubes or crushed ice from your kitchen freezer.)</li>
</ul>

<p>But, the downside is that the ice is continually melting and must be replaced with new ice, and the melting water has to be drained. Commercially, the amount of water lost to melting is usually pretty low because the ice is consumed relatively fast, but there is some and it does have to go somewhere. Your kitchen freezer, at about 0*F, can maintain hard frozen ice indefinitely, so it doesn't need a drain and it only has to replace the ice at the rate it's used, which is a good thing because the ice tray relies on ambient air temperature to freeze the water, instead of active transport of heat by the clooling loop in contact with the tray. Similar ""home-grade"" ice makers are smaller in size and keep the ice frozen. These are good for the occasional large party, but they just don't make ice fast enough for a drink station at a restaurant or concessions stand.</p>

<p>As far as placement, the drain line can pretty much be anywhere and go anywhere, <em>as long as</em> it goes into the sanitary sewer and obeys all other code regarding slope, length to the nearest vent stack, etc. There is a <em>big</em> difference between your basement floor drain and the one in a professional kitchen; the one in your basement was designed to drain relatively clean water either from a plumbing failure or from weeping through the basement walls. It ties into the municipal storm sewer, an ""open"" sewer designed for precipitation, which will dump any water you put in it directly to the nearest creek. Professional kitchen floor drains tie into the sanitary line, which is the ""sealed"" sewer that carries food and bodily wastes and cleanser residues from most of your interior drains out to the wastewater treatment plant where those wastes are removed. So, if you buy an ice maker that needs a floor drain, you will need to have a drain specially installed that feeds into the sanitary line. The design is pretty standard; a 3 or 4-inch line, with or without a grate over it, that drops straight down about a foot into a J-trap, and from there to the main sanitary trunk line. This drain will need a backflow preventer on it.</p>

Footers with some gravel (more was added before the floor).</p>
","<p>Well this is a pretty big deal because we don't know the cause.  </p>

<p>First let's go over common reasons we get cracks on new floors.</p>

<ol>
<li>Soil wasn't properly compacted.  Soil should be compacted with a rock bed on top.</li>
<li>Bad mixing at site.  Especially in the summer contractors pump too much water in the mix.  The water makes the concrete weaker and it does crack easier.</li>
<li>Bad mix at plant.  Just a poor mix of materials coming in.</li>
<li>Bad environment for mix.  Too hot, rain, too long to site, whatever.</li>
<li>They didn't cut the concrete or didn't cut it quick enough.  The concrete needs to be cut (I suggest every 10x10 foot area) to allow for expansion.  It really needs to be cut the first day.  </li>
<li>Didn't use rebar.  This is a common cost cutter and I have seen rebar pulled before pour.</li>
<li>House was built on unstable land.  Could have been a landfill, could have springs underneath, whatever.  </li>
<li>Soil type wasn't conducive to their install method.  Really too many things to list here but basically different types of soil expand and contract more due to moisture levels.  Also it is possible that it was pushed even further by either a lot of rain or a drought.  </li>
</ol>

<p>Those are what I got off the top of my head.  I am positive there are more reasons for cracks in your basement.  If I were to totally guess I would say they didn't prep right in that corner - It seems like the corner is dropping on you already and maybe it wasn't floor wasn't compacted correctly.  The crack starts on the outward ""L corner"" which is normal but heads right across the corner - most insignificant cracks in concrete tend to be straight.  This crack has its shape for a reason.</p>

<p>What do I think you should do?  First ask questions.  See if the contractor knows why it cracked.  ""It happens"" is not an answer.  My reply would be ""Me not paying you happens too.""  If the contractor/builder doesn't want to take blame (it is their fault) then you need to get a psi reading on the floor, measure its thickness, and also prove that the floor is rebarred/reinforced correctly.  You will almost certainly need an engineer.  Even if the problem is obvious your builder is less likely to move until it is proved from a creditable source.  </p>

<p>You cannot sit on this.  If the mix was bad - well did they use the same mix for the walls too?  If it was bad prep, what happens when you have issues in a couple years?  I have seen basements that have had to be repoured and it is a mess.  Also will set you back 10K in the states.  </p>

<p>Again, no matter what anyone tells you - cracks in a fresh floor are not acceptable.  This is a sizable crack.  Even if an engineer checks everything out I would demand a longer warranty on the basement floor and to have them seal it.  Either that or they start over.</p>

<p><strong>Note (based on additional pictures:</strong> I am not there so it is a bit of conjecture.  But it is not a good sign when an area is relatively dry and you have a corner that is not only wet but it seems dropped too.  It is a guessing game for me too at this point, not seeing what you have going on.  My top 2 guess (and they are guesses) - </p>

<p>#1 - They dug and compacted.  While digging they left over dug out that corner and then filled it.  Then they never compacted it correctly.  After it rained a few times, the corner started dropping.  Also when I have a slab compacted the rock is part of the equation.  I don't see any rock in your pictures.  </p>

<p>#2 - You have some sort of natural underground current or spring.  I have a stream that is 3 feet under, about a foot from my house - and I can't imagine if it where a foot over and 2 more feet down.</p>

With the jambs, the new door is 31 3/8"" wide.  However, the original rough opening is between 32 1/2"" and 32 3/4"" wide, leaving me a big gap between the old frame and new jambs.

<p>Can I fill a gap that big with shims, or should I think about nailing a 1x4 to the latch-side stud first?  If I use shims, I think I would need several to make up the right thickness: is there a trick to holding them in place while I secure the door jamb to them?</p>
","<p>From you description, it sounds like you have a hair over 1 1/2 inches of extra space to make up. If this is correct consider this method. Place a full 1x4 (or whatever the depth of the wall may be) on both sides, as long as the new door frame will still fit comfortably in the new opening. When ever possible, I like to mount the hinge side to a solid petition without excessive shims. This makes it more solid without having to bridge a large gap with your finish nails, and makes it a lot easier to perfectly plumb the hinge jam.  I often replace the center hinge screw on the jam side with a longer matching screw that will attach to the jam. This does a few things for you. One, you don't need as many nails, gives a much more solid  feeling and sounding door, and gives you a tool to fine adjust the plumb if necessary.(especially on heavier solid wood doors. Just like with security screws on an entry door. After you are sure you are happy with the plumb on the hinge side, simply use visual to get an even gap on the top and latch side, in that order. You can then use shims on the latch side and shoot your finish nail just below your shims. this keeps the shims from dropping as you work down the jam. i don't usually shoot through the shims because they often split and I may want to slightly adjust them before the trim casings are installed. </p>

"Why isn't the spark gap lighting the pilot on my furnace?","23975","","<p>I've got a Carrier 58GS natural draft furnace, which has a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark_gap"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">spark gap</a> for igniting the pilot. Unfortunately, the spark gap has not been successfully doing its job. The spark clicks away as the gas rushes past, but the fuel never ignites.</p>

<h1>Normal Ignition Sequence:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Thermostat calls for heat.</li>
<li>Pilot valve opens.</li>
<li>Spark gap produces spark.</li>
<li>Pilot ignites.</li>
<li>Bi-metal switch heated by pilot.</li>
<li>Pilot proves.</li>
<li>Main valve opens.</li>
<li>Main burners light.</li>
<li>Blower starts after time delay.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Current Ignition Sequence:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Thermostat calls for heat.</li>
<li>Pilot valve opens.</li>
<li>Spark gap produces spark for 90 seconds.</li>
<li>Pilot does not prove.</li>
<li>Pilot valve closes, and furnace shuts down.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've lit the pilot manually using a grill lighter, and once it's lit everything else works fine.  If the pilot is lit manually, the furnace cycles properly. It has even cycled on/off for a whole day after being lit manually, but will not ignite when cold (not used for extended time).</p>

<p>This morning I noticed the thermostat was calling for heat, but the furnace was again in the shut down state.  I reset the thermostat, and removed the access panel from the furnace.  I let the spark gap spark for a bit, to see if it would ignite the gas on its own. After about 45 seconds of failure I gently blew on the spark, and what do you know, a flame danced into existence.  The flame started off very orange as I blew, but settled to a stable blue flame quickly. </p>

<p>Here is a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-4_txyypY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">YouTube video</a> of a <strong>similar</strong> model furnace exhibiting <strong>similar</strong> behavior. Note: My spark gap does not sound erratic, and has a steady tic-tic-tic.</p>

<p>Here's what the pilot assembly looks like:</p>

<p>I'm assuming the furnace is original to the house, which would put the installation around 1990.  Other than this issue the furnace is in good repair, so I'm not looking to replace the entire unit. I'm just baffled by what could be causing the pilot to not ignite?</p>
","<p>I finally found some time yesterday to take a closer look at the furnace. </p>

<h1>Gas Pressure</h1>

<p>I started by measuring the incoming gas pressure using a gas pressure gauge. I found it to be 6 WC (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch_of_water"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">inch water column</a>), which is well within the acceptable range specified on the furnace.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4yyH0.jpg"" alt=""Gas pressure gauge""></p>

<h1>Dirty Gap</h1>

<p>Next I took a closer look at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark_gap"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">spark gap</a> itself, and watched closely as the spark was generated.  I even recorded the spark with my video camera, which allowed me to zoom in fairly close.  This is when I noticed a bit of carbon buildup on the electrodes, and wondered if it could be that simple...</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/29FVH.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/29FVH.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<h1>Cleaning the Gap</h1>

<p>I grabbed a bit of 220 grit <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandpaper"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sandpaper</a>, and cleaned the electrodes up a bit. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_wool"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">steel wool</a> is probably the tool of choice for this job, but I didn't happen to have any on hand at the moment (not yet unpacked).</p>

<h1>Success!</h1>

<p>After testing the pilot ignition a few times, the problem seems to be fixed. We had a cold night last night, and the furnace fired up fine all night. As I write this, the furnace has just cycled successfully yet again.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Update</h1>

<p>I found <a href=""https://youtu.be/JFoVcYpq1p8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this YouTube video</a> from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCchpiPYTBEg4DpK6mKfYi2A"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grayfurnaceman</a> that describes the problem exactly, and says that the only solution is to replace the assembly. I'll be replacing the pilot assembly once the weather warms up, so we'll see if that solves the problem.   </p>

"How should I level (flatten) ceiling joists for drywall?","23968","","<p>My kitchen ceiling joists are old and at varying heights. I'm trying to make it level, or at least flat, in preparation for drywall installation. Would you suggest installing strips of wood to the side of the joists or stacked to the bottom of the joists in order to even them out? Which is easier and faster? Which is stronger?</p>
","<p>The way we do it is to strap the joists perpendicular with 1X3 cheap strapping.  Find the lowest point in the existing field of joists and that will be your level reference. We use a laser 360 degree level , but you can get by with a good 6 foot standard bubble level. Mark off the joists in 16"" on center with an extra piece of strapping along each wall edge. Then set the first piece of strapping closest to the lowest point of the ceiling.  Use simple shims under the strapping as you go to keep each piece of strapping level side to side and row or strapping to row of strapping.  Secure the strapping with 4d or 6d ring nails to the joists.  It will take a little time, but you should get the hang of it very quickly.  The result should be a nice flat and level ceiling. I know this is a quick description, but I will be happy to give you more info and hints if you decide to use this method. BTW, this is definitely a 2 or 3 person job, and an air nailer will really help.</p>

"Why are there so many different types of screws (phillps/flat/hex/star/etc)?","23929","","<p>Newbie question.</p>

<p>Why is it that there's a bazillion different types of screws? Why can't we just always use one standard screw type? Are there advantages/disadvantages to the different types? Are there times when one type is preferred over another?</p>

<p>Help me understand why there isn't one screw to rule them all.</p>
","<p>Shamelessly ripped off from <a href=""http://msgboard.snopes.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=56;t=002496;p=0"">here</a>, looks like the primary reason why we still have ""bad"" screws (flat head and Phillips) is that the ""better"" types of screws are simply more difficult/expensive to manufacture:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason for the different styles is
  cost and torque.</p>
  
  <p>The slotted head screws are cheap and
  easy to make. But they're completely
  useless for powered screwdrivers and
  you can't put much torque on the screw
  without it either slipping out or
  stripping the head (and maring the
  surface of whatever you're screwing).
  [Mad]</p>
  
  <p>Phillips screws are self-centering,
  making powered screwdrivers possible.
  They're somewhat more expensive to
  produce than slotted-head. They tend
  to 'cam-out' easily under torque,
  making it hard to apply much torque.
  I've heard they were designed that way
  to prevent overtightning. However,
  it's not good for exposed fasteners to
  look stripped.</p>
  
  <p>Robertson-head and allen-head
  fasteners can handle more torque than
  phillips-head fasteners, but are more
  expensive. Because the bottom of the
  hole is flat (unlike the pointed end
  of the phillips), there's more contact
  area and so it's less likely to
  cam-out. The robertson-head is cheaper
  than the allen-head, but the
  allen-head has six points of contact
  rather than 4, making it less prone to
  rounding out the hole.</p>
  
  <p>The Torx-head fasteners solve the
  problem of rounding/stripping by
  having the flat bottom of the
  robertson/allen that reduces cam-out,
  but it has much better contact with
  the driving bit to prevent stripping
  the head. The points of the 'star' on
  the driving bit engage the recesses on
  the screw at nearly right angles, so
  it has a very positive contact. Torx
  is becoming more and more popular
  because of that, particularly in
  assembly-line work.</p>
  
  <p>Because they're less likely than a
  phillips to be damaged when
  tightening, the allen (internal hex)
  heads are often used for exposed
  ('decorative') fasteners on 'some
  assembly required' furniture. It's
  also very cheap to make the allen
  keys, so they usually include one with
  the fasteners. </p>

"How can I speed up the rate at which putty dries?","23864","","<p>We're (slowly) renovating the sash windows in our house and the current window is causing problems. What should have been a quick job (especially at this time of year!) has turned into a marathon because the putty won't dry.</p>

<p>We had to replace a couple of panes of glass (one was cracked and we broke another when using a heat gun to remove the paint) so we knew it would take a little while. On a previous window the putty took over three weeks to dry enough to paint partly because (as we thought) there was too much oil. So this time we rolled the putty on newspaper first to try to remove the excess oil. It seemed to work, but after two weeks the putty is still soft to the touch.</p>

<p>We've tried standing the windows next to a radiator but all that seemed to do was make it softer (which was obviously going to happen in hindsight).</p>

<p>So given that we don't want to reputty the windows what can we do to speed up the drying process.</p>

<p>We've had to seal off the room and cover the window as best we can in the meantime.</p>

<p>I've found <a href=""http://www.doityourself.com/stry/5-ways-to-speed-up-the-drying-of-glazing-putty"" rel=""nofollow"">this advice</a> on DoItYourself.com which doesn't really help as it says use other materials!</p>

<p>The answers to <a href=""http://www.diy-forum.net/any-way-speed-up-putty-drying-t19763.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this post</a> on DIY-Forums are confusing at best and possibly contradictory as one recommends exposing the putty to moisture(!) to speed the drying process.</p>
","<p>Heat will make the putty softer, which is why you can heat it up to remove it.  Putty pretty much stays soft for years.  Initially, it doesn't really dry out so much as oxidize which forms a skin on it. </p>

<p>If you absolutely must paint it right away, you'll probably has to use one of the latex based glazing compounds. If you want to use a traditional one, paint it as soon as it forms enough of a skin that the paint will stick to it.  Also, I think you probably should be using oil based paints, but check the instructions on the putty.</p>

<p>If you let use know specifically which putty you are using, that might help get better answers.</p>

"Where should I start tiling my bathroom wall?","23863","","<p>The bathroom I'm about to tile has a complex layout, and I've never put tile on a wall before.  Let me see if I can paint a verbal picture...</p>

<p>The room is approx. 6'(""short side"") by 10'(""long side"").  The short side has the door on one end, and a window centered above the tub on the far end.  The window is about 3' above the tub and (used to be) a typical household window.  The tub stretches from one side of the room to the other.  Toilet and sink are along the long side.</p>

<p>The tile would extend from the door jamb about 5' from the floor, over the tub where it goes up to near the celing, around the back wall over the window, then back down again and across behind the toilet and sink.</p>

<p>So I have a couple features that influence, I believe, where I start tiling--the window and the tub.</p>

<p>I believe I should start at the window and tile outward, which ensures the tile is centered on that spot.  However I'll probably end up with oddly cut tiles at every single corner in the bathroom.</p>

<p>Another option is to start centered directly above the tub.  That way the tile grows up with regular sized tiles until the window, which would end up with oddly cut tile around it.</p>

<p>I'm afraid that when I get down to the nasty business I'll end up picking the wrong way, and every time I go in the damned bathroom I'll look at it and obsess about my decision.</p>

<p>Which is it--window outwards, or tub upwards?  Or is there even a third option I should pick?</p>
","<p>Two things: </p>

<ol>
<li>Most corners or window frames aren't square, so don't use them as the guide.</li>
<li>You will have odd-cut tiles at the edges and around the window. </li>
</ol>

<p>What you really want to avoid is having the un-cut edge of a tile close to a corner or the window frame. If it's not square then you'll have the straight grout line right next to the not-square line of the wall or window. Your eye will be drawn to this, and you'll indeed get cross every time you lie in the bath. Worse, you may have to cut a tiny sliver of tile to fill an annoying large gap...</p>

<p>In the ideal situation the width of the wall will be an exact multiple of the width of a tile plus the grout line. Then you can adjust things so you have half-a-tile width at the left and half-a-tile at the right. In this case, draw a vertical line dead-centre of the wall and work in both directions from there. </p>

<p>If your wall isn't an exact multiple of the width of a tile plus grout line, start between one-quarter to one-half of a tile to the left or right of this line. It may be best to lay out the tiles on the floor (with spacers!) so you can get a good picture of where the verticals will end up.</p>

<p>Finally, rent or purchase a good diamond tile cutter. Being able to cut tiles easily and quickly is really important, especially if your tiles are large!</p>

"why did my mower suddenly start running slower?","23853","","<p>This mower has an odd history, but appeared to be in good shape.

"Is there any legitimate reason you would NOT connect the ground wire on a circuit?","23844","","<p>I've been doing some remodeling on my house and had the need to move some electrical outlets. While doing so, I noticed that the ground wire wasn't hooked up on any of the outlets in the circuit (through a bathroom, no less). It was three wire cable, so the ground wire was there. It was just bent back or snipped off at each box and not connected to the outgoing ground line in any way.</p>

<p>If it were 2-wire cable, I could chalk it up to someone being cheap, but I can't imagine someone being so lazy that they didn't connect the ground wires when they were right there and available. Most of the other circuits in the house seem correct, so maybe this is intentional?</p>

<p>Does anyone know a legitimate reason you would wire up a circuit and not connect the ground wires?</p>
","<p>No, there is no reason not to have the ground connected. Even with armored (BX) cable, you should connect the ground. There is an older style of armored cable that uses a wide metallic strip (inside) as the ground which is a bit flaky since it's hard to get a good connection (it is just supposed to connect with the box connector). The actual armor though is not designed for grounding, and should not be used or relied on as a ground (though in most cases, the electrical connection exists for it to work as ground).</p>

<p>Let me be clear though -- you should check what is on the other side of the wire, and make sure it actually is grounded (or, possibly, not connected -- which you can fix), and that it is not being used for some other purpose. Just a red flag for me: when someone snips off the ground it means they didn't know what they were doing, so don't assume that anything is correct.</p>

<p>One thing to look for - there should only be one common ground in your house, and everything should be tied together. If you have, for example, two separate ground rods and circuits mixed, you can have ground loops and noise issues, especially if you have sensitive electronics (TVs, amplifiers, computers) connected. All grounds should be connected together at or near the main panel.</p>

<p>On the same topic, you should have a ground wire connecting your electrical grounding wire to all copper pipes in your house, and to any gas lines. Be careful with placement, as often you need a jumper wire to go around a non-conductive water meter to connect both sets of pipes together.</p>

"Renovating interior stone basement walls","23830","","<p>We have a 100 year old house, and I would like to finish the basement but leave the stone walls exposed.  I believe the stone <em>can</em> look great, but the mortar needs some work, and I am mostly focused on keeping the airflow to prevent any moisture problems.  I'm aware that it is important to manage moisture outside the foundation.  But when it comes to the inside, is it ok to somehow 'seal' the stone, or would that create an unwanted moisture barrier?  In general, what is the best way to renovate the stone on the inside to make it look good without causing any other issues?</p>
","<p>You can do it. Certainly.</p>

<p>There was a recent episode on this for ""this old house"". They basically suggested cleaning out the loose fill and then replacing the old mortar with fresh mortar. It looked tedious more than anything else - but doable by a homeowner. I've re-mortared and chinked stone foundations. It's a surprisingly high maintenance experience compared to poured walls. </p>

<p>The good news about stone foundations is that with proper bracing, you can fix up almost anything well enough to sell it to someone else who enjoys huffing dust, cobwebs, squirrel mummies and Radon Gas. But for the most part, it's like fight club - we just don't talk about it.</p>

<p>With improper bracing, you can experience the joy of being crushed to death, or lose an eye due to the magic of newtonian physics while you learn about shear loads and amateur metallurgy using those hydraulic jacks you bought at Harbour Freight. It's very educational. </p>

<p>A well built stone wall can always be repaired with less trouble than concrete foundations. The mortar and chinking is mostly for aesthetics, anyway.</p>

<p>Sealing the walls is fine, as long as you do it on the outside first, and then and only then do the inside. You'll have to dig down to the foundation to do this, and that bracing is an issue on the outside as well. </p>

<p>Now the part you won't like. I did this in high school for a relative who had a nearly 200 year old house with a sandstone &amp; rock foundation, in a damp (flood plain) area. It looked great, but ultimately it was wasted effort. Exposed rock and mortar foundations will always breath, sweat and disappoint anyone expecting a modern basement experience. You can apply gallons of sealer, but it will simply create areas where it perforates.</p>

<p>These foundations were designed to keep out animals, hold up your house so it doesn't rot all that quickly and very little else. </p>

<p>They will always be home to spiders. You can seal it with gunnite or epoxy and it will still allow infiltration. It might look OK, in that ""I love Halloween"" fashion so popular with the gothic/serial killer/lonely artist set, but it will never be a comfortable space.</p>

<p>You might build a second wall that can be plumbed, framed and sheet rocked, but it won't solve much over the long run, even with substantial vapor barriers and ducting. The walls will still slowly shift, moisture will come and go, and you'll never be happy with the low ceilings.</p>

<p>So in summary: You can redo the walls. You can seal them. You can even box them in and add ducting, insulation, AC and lighting. It's still going to be a basement that weeps moisture due to temp and pressure differentials.</p>

<p>If capping, is it a matter of replacing the rotor with a cap. If removal is necessary, will I need to remove that whole spur pipeline, or can that branch just stay in ground full of water?</p>
","<p>It depends on where the sprinkler head is located within that zone.  If the sprinkler head that you are capping is not a dead end on the line, then you can cap it at this sprinkler head.  If it is a dead end, then you need to go to the prior sprinkler head to cap the line. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A dead end occurs with the last
  sprinkler in a series. Capping a dead
  end leaves water in the underground
  line with nowhere to go. If the
  sprinklers are spaced far apart, this
  wastes water pressure. In areas prone
  to freezing, it can cause water in the
  line to ice and damage the pipe. Dead
  ends should be capped at the preceding
  or next-to-last sprinkler head.<br>

<p>And you do not replace the rotor with a cap but actually just remove the sprinkler head and cap the line.  Removing the sprinkler head is very easy to do.  Just get a trowel and dig down around the sprinkler head until you have enough clearance to unscrew the current sprinkler head without getting soil in the line.  </p>

<p><strong>But before you start</strong> the work on capping/removing this sprinkler head, I would try adjusting either the current sprinkler head or the other zones sprinkler head to reduce the amount of water being delivered to that spot.  Depending on the type of sprinkler heads you have, you might be able to replace/adjust one or both of the sprinkler nozzles to reduce the flow.  Or look into adjusting the pattern on the sprinkler to deliver less water in your area.  Or you can even reduce the amount of time that one of these zones is watering.  My point is that someone already did all that work to install the line and sprinkler so try some other steps first.  There have been plenty of times that I have planted a tree or plant or did some other landscaping that blocked a sprinkler heads spray area and then wished I had another head in that location.</p>

"How can I fix flickering and continuous-clicking with a UPS on an inverter-supplied circuit?","23782","","<p>My whole house has been backed up by an inverter for a few months now. My computer is still connected to a UPS so that it gets clean power - I don't trust the inverter alone to provide ultra-stable voltage. </p>

<p>Now whenever the computer is turned on during a power outage (and when the inverter is running), the UPS starts to ""flicker"" or click like mad. By flickering, what I mean is that it appears to switch several times a second between battery source and AC, making a clicking sound, anywhere between 1 to 4-5Hz, sometimes more, as if the relay is constantly switching several times a second.</p>

<p>Now the inverter handles all the load I try to throw at it otherwise. Having every light and fan on in the house doesn't challenge the inverter. So it's not an issue of the inverter's power capacity.</p>

<p>But when the UPS turns on, and it starts flickering/clicking, it also makes all the lights flicker. So I guessed (this was a pure guess, not an educated one) that perhaps this flicker was the result of a frequency mismatch between AC (as provided by the inverter) and the UPS. Perhaps I was seeing the 'beat' frequency of these two signals.</p>

<p>To test this - I mean if the devices were <em>that</em> fickle - I figured changing the impedance load of the overall circuit might affect the frequency relationship. And it did! </p>

<p>Turning on just the right number of lights/fans would eliminate (what I believe to be) the frequency mismatch and the UPS would keep working fine.</p>

<p>However this solution has proven to be fickle as well - perhaps the inverter is too wild in its frequency deviations and the impedance <em>correction</em> is not enough sometimes.</p>

<p>So here is the final question.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can tweak in the UPS in order to better handle this frequency mismatch?</p>

<p>P.S: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Am I right in the first place? Is this a frequency problem? If not, please explain. I do have a bit of theoretical knowledge of how electrical circuits/transformers etc should work, so please don't hold back in your analysis. </p></li>
<li><p>Even if the inverter with its (alleged) frequency fluctuations is the root of the problem, replacing it is not an option (cost). Hence the question.</p></li>
<li><p>Once I understand the problem theoretically, I should be able to bully an electrician into getting the necessary done to the UPS.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not a hardware hacker, so unfortunately I don't have a multimeter at home or see myself getting one in the next few days. I might if absolutely needed. So, sorry, I can't help with actual (experimentally measured) facts and figures on the frequency, voltage etc in the short term.</p></li>
<li><p>Both the UPS and inverter are supposed to work at 220V/50Hz (India). If the amperage of both matters I can find out and post back. Note: As I have mentioned I don't think it's a case of the UPS somehow overloading the inverter, as I have thrown all other appliances (About 5 fluorescent lights, 4 ceiling fans, 4-5 old-fashioned 60W-ish bulbs) on at the same time, and it has stood quite well.</p></li>
<li><p>The UPS brand is not an issue since I've tried multiple (reputed ones such as APC, local brands, etc) and they've all had issues in one form or another. So simply replacing the UPS won't suffice.</p></li>
<li><p>Considering (1) and (4) and the absence of facts/figures is there another SE that's a better fit for this? I do need a practical solution eventually though (even if it means a delay if I HAVE to measure the frequency/voltages to be sure), so this still feels like the right place. But I'll leave it to the mods.</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>My APC UPS has a setting to be more tolerant of the input power.  I found it necessary to enable this when running from a generator during power outages.    Without the setting, the behavior was just as you describe -- constant switching between line and UPS power.   Read the documentation for your UPS carefully -- there is probably a similar option.</p>

Here's an excerpt from the <a href=""http://www.apcmedia.com/salestools/SCON-89HM7B/SCON-89HM7B_R4_EN.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">APC BE450G UPS manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Voltage Sensitivity Adjustment (optional) The Back-UPS detects and reacts to line voltage distortions by transferring to battery  backup power to protect connected equipment.  In situations where either the Back-UPS or the connected equipment is too sensitive for the input voltage level it is necessary to adjust the transfer voltage.<br>
       1. Connect the Back-UPS to a wall outlet. The Back-UPS will be in Standby mode, no  indicators will be illuminated.<br>
       2. Press and hold the ON/OFF button for 10 seconds. The OnLine LED will illuminate alternately green-amber-red, to indicate that the Back-UPS is in Program mode.<br>
       3. The Power On/Replace Battery LED will flash either green, amber, or red to indicate the current sensitivity level. Refer to the table for an explanation of the transfer voltage sensitivity levels.<br>
       4. To select LOW sensitivity, press and hold the ON/OFF button until the LED flashes green.<br>
       5. To select MEDIUM sensitivity, press and hold the ON/OFF button until the LED flashes red.<br>
       6. To select HIGH sensitivity, press and hold the ON/OFF button until the LED flashes  amber.<br>

Part of the laminate would be directly next to the brick base of the fireplace. What kind of base-board or base-piece would I use to secure the edge of the laminate against the fireplace?</p>

<p>-M </p>
","<p>One way of accomplishing this is to undercut the brick and slide the flooring in underneath.  Two advantages are that the brick ends up holding down your floating floor, and you end up with a very clean looking transition between the brick and laminate.</p>

<p>To do this, you'd of course need something that can cut brick.  You could potentially use an angle grinder or jamb saw with a diamond blade, but either of those would be pretty dusty.  To cut down on the dust somewhat (or at least reduce the degree to which it gets blown around the room), I'd recommend a multifunction oscillating tool.  Fein makes the original one but it's pricey at ~$300.  I have a kit from Rockwell that's about half that and love it, and you can get a version from <a href=""http://www.harborfreight.com/multifunction-power-tool-67256.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Harbor Freight</a> for about $35 but it's got some iffy reviews and it doesn't appear to come with a diamond stone-cutting blade.

"What is a shear wall and what is it for?","23727","","<p>I have a wall in the middle of my house which I have been told is a shear wall.  The image below is a diagram I put together real quick to show what it looks like.  The grey lines on the right are perpendicular exterior walls.  The orange-ish section on the right is actually exterior since the foundation jogs a bit there.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/09dOZ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>It doesn't seem like the 1x6 that crosses in the middle does much.  I intend to put French Doors in this wall but need to know what I'm getting myself into.</p>

<p>The wall runs parallel to all the joists and trusses in the house and sits directly under one truss.  The far left side of the wall actually has a vent running up through it directly through the truss above.  When they built the house, they cut a 12"" gap in the truss, which makes me not so sure if the wall is load bearing or not.</p>

<p>Oh, and I live in Seattle.</p>
","<p>The brace is providing lateral support. If you build a wall with the top and bottom plate plus some studs, it's easy to shift the wall out of square and turn it into a parallelogram. Under load, a house would take an 8' shift to one side and flatten to the ground. With the brace, the wall remains square and holds perpendicular walls plumb.</p>

<p>In typical construction and low risk areas, the exterior wood sheathing and interior drywall provides this lateral support and avoids the need for any lateral bracing. However, in older homes or in higher risk areas, particularly where there are hurricanes or earthquakes, extra support may be added. In my own home, this was done with a metal T that was installed into a grove that was cut in the studs, but older homes will more likely notch the studs and install a piece of lumber.</p>

<p>Before removing this, I'd want to consult with a structural engineer. They may require that you relocate the brace to one or both sides of the doorway, and that will require opening up your walls even more. Removing this structure will likely show little signs of danger until there is extreme weather or a seismic event, so if you were to remove it without proper adjustments to the rest of your structure, don't assume that everything will be ok.</p>

<p>Note that with a truss resting directly on top of this wall, you should assume there is some load passing through, especially if there's any structure above that truss in your house. The fact that it's been cut for ducting may mean that the wall is the only thing keeping that truss from collapsing. When you create a doorway, it's best to install some temporary bracing and make the header a load bearing structure that appropriate for the span.</p>

"What could be causing an orange flame on all appliances?","23705","","<p>I have an orange flame in all my gas appliances (gas furnace, gas water heater, and gas stove) and cannot seem to determine the cause. </p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>So far, I have had the gas company come out. I had an appliance tech look at our stove, and tomorrow, I am having a guy check it out on the furnace.</p>

<p>When the gas company (XCel energy) checked it out yesterday, they measured the pressure on with appliances running and without. In both situations things measured fine. Our meter was making some noise, so the gas company put in a new one. They also measured Carbon Monoxide (CO) levels and found nothing wrong throughout the house.</p>

<p>Today, I had an appliance tech come check it out. He checked our stove and he said everything checks out fine. He also checked CO levels throughout the house. In any case, his tests revealed no cause for the issue. </p>

<p>Tomorrow, I am having a furnace guy come in, this is the big one, because the orange flame seems to be causing the furnace to short cycle. </p>

<p><strong>My hypothesis</strong></p>

<p>My hunch is that something must be entering the line elsewhere. No gas inside the house makes me think the natural gas lines coming into the house have the problem. However, the gas company says everything is fine.</p>

<p><strong>What I am looking for</strong></p>

<p>Anyway, I am seeking direction on the course of action to take here. From my perspective, I cannot see how all three appliances would have issues that cause an orange flame at the same time. This seems very clear that something is going on with the gas lines, but I am at a loss of who to call to actually fix the core issue. </p>
","<p>It is (very) surprising that the gas company (Xcel) says ""everything's fine."" <a href=""https://www.duke-energy.com/pdfs/100483-natural-gas-safety.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">This document from a different gas company</a> certainly calls out non-blue flames as an issue that needs to be resolved. As does <a href=""http://www.appliance411.com/faq/gas_range_flames.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">this site</a>. And <a href=""http://www.xcelenergy.com/staticfiles/xe/Marketing/Managed%20Documents/wi-mi-res-bus-welcome-info-sheet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Xcel themselves.</a></p>

<p>Happening on all appliances does seem a bit less likely to be ""and suddenly the air adjustments on all three went whacky"" than a contamination issue - possibly water in the gas line? </p>

<p>I wonder how your furnace tech visit went, and what your neighbor's flames look like.</p>

<p><strong>Editing post-comments:</strong> Ultrasonic humidifiers make small water droplets (without evaporating the water first) and then those small droplets evaporate while floating around - if the water contains salts or minerals, any salts or minerals in the water will end up floating around the house as tiny specks when the water evaporates from the tiny droplets. Those, evidently, are what is contaminating your gas flames as they are sucked in along with the air required to burn the gas. Old-style ""sponge"" dehumdifiers (should) only result in water vapor in the air, as they actually evaporate the water (and this eventually leads to a build-up of scale and salts in the humidifier and its sponge element, as those do not evaporate.)</p>

"Should I add a return air vent in a refinished basement?","23693","","<p>We are refinishing our basement, and are nearing competition.  The walls are drywalled, and the ceiling is dropped.  There will be about 500 sq ft of finished space, including a full bathroom, and about 300 sq ft of unfinished space.

"How to properly insulate a garage?","23688","","<p>I'm considering insulating (and drywalling) my garage, which already has insulated garage doors.  My main goal is to keep it from getting much below freezing during the winter.</p>

<p>I'm not too worried about insulating the walls, but wonder: Do I need a vapor barrier?</p>

<p>For the ceiling (rafters 24"" oc) would it be easiest to place normal batting between the rafters and then hang the drywall, or hang the drywall first and then lay the insulation afterwards?  Or would blown-in insulation be better?  Which is typically cheaper?  And again, do I need a vapor barrier?</p>

","<p>I have a few questions and observations that will effect what you should do.  First, I see that the peak (ridge) seems to be over the existing framed and drywalled wall.  What is on the other side of this wall? Is this garage attached to the house or free standing? Do you have or intend to put any heat or heat dump register in this space? </p>

<p>I also noticed that the roof framing is standard trusses, not attic trusses. Where is the attic space going to be located? If the attic space is going to be over the bay you pictured, then you are limited in the amount of insulation you can install and still have a floor for storage. If the collar ties are 2X6, then the most blanket type insulation you can install is R19.  2X4= R11. Fiberglass blanket would definitely be the most cost effective in a small space such as you have. I would use unfaced F/G, and a 4 or 6 mil plastic vapor barrier installed before you drywall. As for installing drywall, you really should install strapping at a max of 16"" on center to mount your 5/8"" fire rated rock to. 24"" inch on center is too large for hanging rock overhead, especially 5/8"" rock.  If garage is attached, 5/8"" drywall is minimum code in most areas.</p>

<p>I also noticed that you have a metal roof. Metal roofs are great, but are notorious for condensation. This makes it absolutely necessary to have a good vapor barrier and good venting to avoid potential interior ""rain storms"" lol. </p>

<p>My other consideration would be insulating the exterior walls. Since there seems to be only one long wall and very little framed cavity wall on the gable ends, it would be advantageous to go ahead and finish the job by insulating and drywalling these walls. If you only do the ceiling, you will not have a good barrier to air, heat and humidity leaking by the ends of the ceiling at the wall plates and entering the attic area. This kinda defeats the whole idea of what you are doing.  </p>

"HE Front End Washer vibrations on wood floors: any tried-and-true solutions?","23590","","<p>We recently purchased a new washer and dryer set. It's a High Efficiency front loader washer with the high speed spin cycles.</p>

<p>It's causing us grief. It vibrates like crazy. To the point where it's walking across the floor and you can feel it throughout much of the first floor.</p>

<p>I've 'tuned' the feet to make sure it's perfectly level, and it helps, but is not a cure-all. </p>

<p>There seems to be a lot of chatter online and theories, though I have yet to find anything definitive (maybe I'm adding to the chatter...)</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>is it true these really should only be purchased if used on concrete slabs? Seems that's a common statement about these HE washers. </li>
<li>is there a tried-and-true way to beef up the floor? Seems that one solution is to rip out the hardwood and then glue-and-screw two layers of high quality sub-floor products together. Then add lots of cross-bracing to the joists underneath. However, I still read that this doesn't fix all situations. And given how much work that'd be, I'd like to be a bit more confident in the solution before beginning.</li>
<li>we have a plastic 'leak pan' underneath that the feet sit on. Should I omit this? This is obviously an easy thing to try so will probably give it a go--though we do end up losing the (albeit small) benefit of having the leak pan. </li>
<li>or should I just give up and see if Home Depot will allow a return and swap it out for a lower efficiency top-loader? </li>
</ul>

<p>Note I have researched the rubber pads. However, my own experience with them previously (on a top loader) and feedback from plenty of people online is that they really don't do much, if anything.</p>
","<p>After spending several hours researching, there still appears to be little consensus on this topic. But here is a summary of potential solutions.</p>

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>But first, <strong>the problem</strong>: the issue with High Efficiency Front loaders is that the vibrations are vertical. The drum spins horizontally so the vibration is all in an up-and-down motion. It's also incredibly high speed. The problem is that wood framed houses aren't designed to withstand the vertical vibrations of these newer washers that well. a HE top loader, while also fast, transfers the vibrations horizontally, which the floor framing of a house is better suited to handle. </p>

<h1>The List of Possible Remedies</h1>

<h2>Get a top-loader instead.</h2>

<p>A traditional top loader (agitator) spins, but not nearly at the same speed as a front loader. It also does it horizontally so doesn't transfer nearly the vibrations that a HE FL will. </p>

<p>The catch is that these are harder to find and more and more top loaders are now HE top loaders. Instead of an agitator, it uses jets of water. Reviews of HE top loaders seem to be mixed. However, there seems to be consensus that they don't clean quite as well as front loaders (a con) but that they also don't vibrate as violently as a front loader (a pro if vibration is an issue in your house). </p>

<h2>Only put HE Front Loader washers on top of concrete slabs.</h2>

<p>10 years ago, this was supposedly the only option. Apparently technology has improved to allow these to be installed on wood framing--however many professionals still do not recommend installing it on a second floor (as second floors tend to not be built to handle the same loads as the first floor). </p>

<h2>Make sure the washer's feet are all level.</h2>

<p>This is the easiest/first thing to check. I thought mine were but on careful examination I was able to improve things further by adjusting the feet. The easiest way to check this is to reach to the back of each rear corner and try shaking it towards the opposite front corner. You're are testing the diagonals to figure out if one of the corners needs to be raised. I had one ever-so-slightly out and adjusting it helped quite a bit (I suggest grabbing the rear corner is that is likely sheet metal and rigid rather than the front, which is often plastic and hard to 'feel' for wobble).</p>

<h2>Move the appliance towards a wall/corner</h2>

<p>The closer to a corner, the more rigid the structure may be (might be closer to a support beam, walls may add lateral rigity, etc.) I moved ours closer to the corner of the laundry closet and it seems to have helped. </p>

<h2>Use rubber vibration feet/pads/matts</h2>

<p>There are dozens upon dozens of companies selling anti-vibration feet. A majority of people claim that these help, but a strong majority claim it makes things <strong>worse</strong>. My (non-physics-expert-mind's) opinion is that when they <em>do</em> work, though you may reduce the <em>transfer</em> of vibration to the structure, you are likely increasing the <em>total amount</em> of vibration the appliance, itself, now has to absorb (reducing its lifespan). </p>

<h2>Use pool noodles on the sides</h2>

<p>A common youtube/facebook suggestion is to take the pool noodle foam floaties and cram one between each side of the washer. This will only work, of course, if your washer sits close enough to the wall on one side and the dryer on the other. I haven't tried this yet. My (again, non-physics-expert-mind's) theory is that this spreads the vibration load out to more planes/points of contact. </p>

<h2>Reinforce the floor</h2>

<p>I see many suggestions of this, but not necessarily any first-hand reports as to how succesful it is. I'm guessing it's just because it's likely a pain to deal with. The suggestions are to tear out the floor and then glue-and-screw two layers of subfloor together with a tight screw schedule. The subfloor being plywood or dedicated subfloor products. </p>

<p>In addition, add blocking to the joists underneath and, in extreme cases, ass a support beam/post directly under the laundry area. </p>

<h1>My conclusion</h1>

<p>As previously mentioned, double checking the level of the feet has helped considerably. And while I'm happy with the improvements, it still vibrates hard enough on its final spin cycle that you physically feel uncomfortable standing in front of it. </p>

<p>I'm now narrowing it down to two options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Try a HE Top Loader. The problem is that I really do like the front loader's performance. It uses less water and cleans better that the top loaders apparently due. And because of the extreme spin cycle, we save a lot of energy with the dryer. As such, I think I'm going to...</p></li>
<li><p>...reinforce the floor. Right now the sub floor is chipboard with hardwood flooring. Neither is all that sturdy. I'm going to take out the hardwood (bonus is that we can use this to patch parts of the kitchen later) and possibly the existing subfloor if it's not too difficult. I'm then going to glue-and-screw down one or two layers of 3/4"" plywood (I may use maple ply for the top one and apply poly on top to make it a 'finished' surface). I'm also going to add blocking between the joists. </p></li>
</ol>

<h1>What we ultimately ended up doing</h1>

<p>I bought a 4x6 and created a beam in the crawlspace under the washer/dryer area with two lolly columns. Alas, that still didn't seem to remedy the situation.</p>

<p>So, we gave up. I hired an electrician to wire up a space in the garage and I plumbed a new drain line and vent stack and we moved the entire thing into the garage onto concrete. </p>

<p>And things are good now. I do believe that these HE front loaders are truly only really designed for placing on concrete slabs. </p>

<p>The plus side is now we don't have to try and do laundry in a hallway closet. </p>

"What is the weight capacity of your typical 2 1/2"" drywall screw when driven 1 1/2"" into a stud?","23552","","<p><strong>Update 11/3/2012</strong>: In spite of being informed by multiple sources (here on SE, a guy at the Genie Clip Canada office, someone at the SE physics site, and even my own personal test) that I <em>should</em> be safe with this 500-lb wall being supported by 25 drywall screws, I have found that I could not stop thinking about it.  So... I tore the wall down and will be using proper wood screws to fasten the clips.  It's all about peace of mind in the end.  I have a company coming in a few weeks to mud the walls I put up so I can prime and paint and I don't want to keep worrying about whether or not that wall is going to come crashing down, be it on me or the people who buy my townhouse when I decide to move.</p>

<p>My advice: <strong>Never use drywall screws to bear any load.</strong>  As others have already stated, they're not designed to bear load.  For that type of application, use proper screws with adequate strength.</p>

<p><strong>Original question below:</strong></p>

<p>I originally asked this question back in February and want to reword it in hopes that I can get a more obective answer.  Here are the screws in question:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.lowes.com/pd_112628-10681-S05CDW212_0__?productId=3198059"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.lowes.com/pd_112628-10681-S05CDW212_0__?productId=3198059</a></p>

<p>Late last year, I hung two layers of type-X drywall on a furring channel assembly for a soundproofing project.  The entire assembly goes like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mounted 5 rows of Genie Clips (RSIC) to studs using the above-linked 2 1/2"" drywall screws.  There are 25 clips total in the whole assembly.  The clips are 1"" thick, so 1"" of the screw is outside the stud.  However, it's fastened snug against the clip, so it's not like there's exposed screw sticking out of anything.</li>
<li>5 rows of metal furring channels (hat channels) are snapped into the clips from the top of the wall to the bottom.</li>
<li>Two layers of type-X drywall at 72 lbs per 4x8 sheet are fastened to the furring channels using the same screws.  There are 7 sheets, so 7x72 = 504 lbs.  This wall is suspended, so it's not touching the ceiling, walls, or floor.</li>
</ul>

<p>The instructions said I could use drywall or wood screws so long as they're coarse thread.  Only after I got the wall installed did I learn of ""shear strength"" and that drywall screws are very brittle, snapping under pressure rather than bending like wood screws.  This got me worried, so I came here to see if this wall is safe.</p>

<p>If the math is simple, we can take the total weight of the assembly (520 lbs if you add the approximate weight of the furring channels) and divide that by 25 (the number of clips) and arrive 20.8 lbs, the minimum average weight capcity per screw in order for the wall to hold up without anything being attached to it (dart boards, mirrors, portraits, etc).</p>

<p>But I am sure there are other factors here.  For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>If a screw has a shear strength of 20 lbs, do 25 of those screws together in an assembly average out at 20 lbs each or is there some kind of cumulative increase that would allow each screw to support more weight the more screws of its kind exist in the same assembly?</li>
<li>What is shear strength vs. shock strength?  I saw a video of a guy taking a hammer sideways against a drywall screw and snapping it off, but that seemed a little unfair since an assembly stays still.  You don't have strong and sudden downward forces occuring within your wall, so was that video a valid demonstration of a drywall screw's brittleness?</li>
</ul>

<p>I am obviously asking all this because I don't want the wall to come crashing down one day.  If I have to tear it down and remount the clips using wood screws, I will have to do just that.  However, if someone can provide a convincing argument that having all this weight supported by 25 drywall screws is okay (it's not framing or anything) then I will be able to sleep better at night.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>So I decided to do the test I talked about in my original question prior to rewriting it.  What you see in these pics is a mock Genie Clip assembly.  It's a spare 2x4 screwed into a wall stud with 3 screws.  A Genie Clip is fastened to the spare stud with one of the screws linked above.  This pic shows the assembly supporting 130 lbs of weight (total of 4 dumbells weight 50, 40, 25, and 15 lbs)!</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1hhMO.jpg"" alt=""Genie Clip supporting 130 lbs""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/E3HJ7.jpg"" alt=""Genie Clip supporting 130 lbs""></p>

<p>So if each drywall screw can support at least 130 lbs and I have 25 clip assemblies holding up this wall, I think it's safe to say that I could probably put at least 3,250 lbs on this wall.  Since it weighs no more than 525 lbs as is, I think I am more than safe.  Next time, though, I will use wood screws since that's the proper way to do it.</p>
","<p>It's difficult to model the situation with rational analysis, there's too many intangible factors. You could do an empirical test. You need to support 20 lbs per fastener. We can apply a safety factor of 3 for ultimate strength, so the fastener should support 60 lbs without actually breaking. So you would need 2-4 fasteners to support your weight. Round down to the closest whole number. Install the clips as you did in the wall, except now install a metal strap between the screw head and clip. Arrange the straps so you can step into them to weight the system. Arrange the straps such that your weight is distributed evenly to each fastener.</p>

<p>Weight the system and see if they break. If you live in a seismic area, bounce on them a bit and see if they break. You'll either be able to sleep better or you'll know what to do next, depending on the outcome. Obviously there are better ways to set up an empirical test, I chose to illustrate a quick and dirty method just as an example. Be sure you are protected from flying shards of metal.</p>

<p>Regarding an increaser for the number of fasteners. No, you can't do that. It is a valid concept though, for example you can use a higher allowable bending stress in multiple floor joists than you can in a single use situation such as a header. The concept is not generally applied to fasteners.</p>

<p><strong>Response to OP's Update</strong></p>

<p>Shear strength in relation to fasteners partly depends on what the fastener is holding. In this case it's known as a metal side plate condition, meaning the expected failure mode will either be the top of the screw failing through the shank (shear) or the wood collapsing under the compression from the screw. It's rare in reality to have a perfect shear condition, there is usually some bending and tension components as well.</p>

<p>A true shear condition would something like a metal strap screwed to the wood surface and all the force was parallel to the wood surface, exactly perpendicular to the screw shank. In your test, you mostly have the vertical shear component, but there is a tension component as the center of mass is away from the wall surface. We can safely ignore the tension component in calculating a working load since 80# in pure shear is more conservative than 80# shear and, oh... say 15# tension combined.</p>

<p>A picture of the clip was helpful, I imagined a much worse condition. Either way, the ultimate strength will not be proportional to shear alone, there are other factors difficult to model, thus testing is the best approach. The failure mode you experienced is a bending failure, but your actual installation, while having a bending component, is in fact mostly a shear condition.</p>

<p>The duration of load is a factor. The usual allowable stresses specified in construction are for permanently applied loads. The allowable stresses can be increased for shorter durations, 15% for a few months, 25% for a few weeks, 33% for a few minutes. Meaning we should reduce the allowable load determined through short term tests accordingly. But we also don't know the ultimate load since you didn't achieve failure. Just as well, uncontrolled destructive testing can be a little too exciting. You also haven't run multiple tests (I assume) to confirm you are getting consistent results.</p>

<p>Let's say you did run multiple tests and they all actually failed at 80#. When you apply the 3x safety factor, then adjust for duration of load, you end up with a working load of 20#, exactly what you need. Considering there was no failure experienced, and the installation does appear to be predominantly shear, I think your installation is safe. Barely. Next time around, use heavy ordinary wood screws ;)</p>

"Is there a globally recommended ""hardness"" setting for a water softener?","23466","","<p>On a Morton System Saver, there's a setting labelled <em>hardness</em>, but no clear indication as to what setting is ""recommended"" -- or even whether this setting is the desired ""output"" or ""input"" hardness (hardness to compensate for). The instructions simply instruct the user to ""adjust the hardness setting"" as necessary.</p>

<p>My UX intuition would suggest that this is the desired ""output hardness."" My CS intuition suggests that this is a compensation level. And neither intuition has a clue what ""normal"" would be.</p>

<p>Is there a ""normal"" value I can set to get water that leaves minimal deposits but still lets you rinse the soap off your hands easily? Or, do I need to get the water tested and set the hardness according to the test results?</p>
","<p>The setting is the ""input hardness"". The zeolite matrix resin (the part that does the water softening) will nearly completely soften the water until it runs out of sodium. The resin in the tank is good for a certain amount of ""hardness"" (measured in grains), probably in the range 10,000-50,000 grains. The setting is used to calculate when the resin will need to be refreshed (by measuring the quantity of water delivered, or using your estimated water usage).</p>

<p>If you input too low of a hardness, you'll have softened water for a while, then you will start to transition to unsoftened water. At some point, the unit will refresh itself, and you'll have soft water again.</p>

<p>If you input too high of a hardness, it'll refresh too often, wasting water and salt.</p>

<p>There's no ""standard"" hardness, it really depends on your water source. As an example, where I am in Indiana, it is about 18 grains/gallon of Calcium. If you have iron in the water, that must be factored into the hardness, usually at a rate of 4 grains per ppm of iron.</p>

<p>If you use municipal water, they probably publish the specifications of the water you receive. If you have a well, then you should have your water tested, preferably using a titration method (the paper strips work very poorly for measuring hardness).</p>

","<p>Could you do it... Yes.  There are a few problems with this setup. </p>

<p>First, if the saw does not have a locking trigger how will you turn it on when you are cutting? If it does have a locking trigger, you'll want a way to turn the tool on/off quickly and easily. This could be achieved by connecting the saw to a power strip, and mounting the strip in an easily accessible area. You'd then use the switch on the power strip to turn the saw on/off.  </p>

<p>Will mounting the saw make changing the blade difficult/impossible?</p>

<p>Mounting a jigsaw in this way could make it easier to force the wood, which could lead to binding, flexing, and even cause the blade to break (which could be deadly).</p>

<p>Lastly, why are you using a jigsaw for long straight cuts?  Long straight cuts are far easier with a table/circular saw. The great thing about a jigsaw, is that the blade can bend and flex slightly. This makes cutting contours easier, but will make long straight cuts more difficult. </p>

This is a very popular thing to do, people do it all the time without burning down their house or garage.  I may have to put another 1 or 2 foot extension between the controller and fridge cord.

<li>the connection may be in a place more accessible to children, pets, falling metallic debris, vehicle tires, etc.</li>

<p>The lighter gauge wire may lower the life of the fridge's motor by not providing full voltage especially during motor starting.

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p><strong>If running connectorized cables, you can probably get away with 2, max.</strong> However, if using bare cable, you can comfortably fit 5, but can potentially fit up to 7 without completely squishing the cables. Using the ratio of areas, we could theoretically fit ((.75^2)/(.25^2)) = 9 cables, but if we abide by the <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/a/71698/37571"">National Electrical Code's 40% rule</a>, this translates to only 3.6 cables (more accurately, ((0.203)/(pi*.125^2))=4.1). Therefore, <strong>if you go with bare cable, by code, you can only legally run 4 cables through the conduit</strong>. (I'm not sure how the NEC calculates this 0.203 although their math allows up to 4 cables - my math would limit us to only 3 cables). Although I do not endorse illegal activity, I would feel comfortable running up to 5 cables in that size conduit.</p>

The level of the deck is below the top of the basement, so I need to drill through the concrete for the ledger board. However, because there is no door, I am thinking about just building the deck as freestanding without attaching it to the house. One downside that I can think of is that the deck edge might drift relative to the house, making it look crooked. Is this is a problem? What are the downsides of making the deck freestanding? </p>
","<p>The big drawback is that your footings aren't done right or don't hold up well and you have a deck that slants a little compared to the house.  You could end up with a little dip or a lip when you walk out the door.  This may take one year or 30 years or 100 years.  If you don't have a ledger it will happen.  If you are building on very solid ground maybe your concerns aren't as bad but eventually these two things will look like they don't belong together.</p>

<p>Builders like doing it this way because as long as the footings are good the deck should generally stay where it is compared to the house for a few years.  Also what do you do if your deck is slanted 5 degrees or is pulled out from your house an inch or two.  I really doubt there is a monetary remedy for slight frustration.  And the flip side for builders is attaching.  Messing up your structure or allowing water into your structure is not only very quantifiable but could also come back to hunt them soon after a build.  So $$$ will dictate that a builder wouldn't attach to your house if it were their choice - especially if they are subcontracting it out.</p>

Do I really need to respect that disclaimer? Would not a 23 Watt CFL be just as safe to use? It still draws less power than a 60 Watt incandescent, right?</p>
","<p>As far as I know, the only risk at issue here is of overheating of the bulb. The heat comes from two sources: the output and waste heat of the bulb, and from resistive heating of the fixture wires and switch and socket contacts. CFL bulbs draw less current and produce less heat for a given light output; however, they are far less tolerant of high temperatures!</p>

<p>Therefore, the rationale of the warning label may well be to warn that the fixture is not sufficiently ventilated for a CFL bulb above that power, even if the fixture is itself capable of surviving that amount of heat.</p>

<p>However, it is also quite possible that someone converted the ""equivalent wattage"" (which is a statement of <em>light output</em> and therefore almost completely irrelevant to power/heating) without thinking about it. I recently (2016) saw a lamp which had a claimed limit like ""60W incandescent, 13W CFL, 7W LED"". That's clearly just converting, and it's not going to be accurate for the wide variety of LED bulb types available.</p>

"what is the best way to restore teak outdoor furniture?","23133","","<p>What is the best way to restore outdoor teak furniture to the original or better looking color?  Teak is so beautiful when it has not been weathered.  But after a few years in the rain and sun, it just turns grey and gets very rough.  The wood is still in very good shape, not damaged at all, just weathered in color and texture.  You can see in the second picture on the base of the table, the original color as it is not exposed to the elements.</p>

<p>I suppose the best thing to do is sand it all down, and then apply teak oil to it.  But that would be very time consuming to sand between each piece of wood for the style we have.  Do you think power washing it would give it a light sand?  What about staining it to just get it to a nice color, even if it is not the natural color?  Anything other than this ugly grey would be good.  </p>

<p>Basically, I am trying to balance the time and energy it would take with what it will take to make it look a little better.  Any other options to make it look and feel a little better?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> After the answer below and some other research, I have come to the realization that short of a good sanding, you can't get it back to the original color.

"Would there be a problem installing 20A switches on a 15A circuit?","23112","","<p>I've installed 20A switches on 15A circuits before, namely on the circuit supplying my kitchen lights. It was primarily to take advantage of the side-clamp wiring available on these beefier switches instead of the curl-and-screw flavor of side-wiring, or the push-in wiring, that you normally see on 15A S/P switches.</p>

<p>A friend of mine says that having a switch of higher capacity than the branch circuit breaker can cause the breaker to trip. I say he's full of it; a switch is a switch, and a 20A S/P will just be beefier than a 15A. As long as it's rated for at least the amperage draw of the circuit, you're fine, IMO.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>On a related note, does the same apply to outlets? He may be confusing using a 20A switch and using a 20A outlet; the outlet, unlike the switch, supports plugging in appliances that will draw >15A, and if you do, that WILL trip the breaker (though as 20A outlets support plugging in parallel-bladed 15A appliances, if you KNOW the branch is 15A and don't try to plug in a T-bladed plug, you're still OK).</p>
","<p>You are correct on both counts: </p>

<ul>
<li>There is no problem with using a 20A switch on a 15A circuit, as the breaker will trip and protect the switch from over-current. 
<ul>
<li>Using a 15A switch on a 20A circuit is potentially dangerous though: the circuit may draw up to 20A, but the switch will be overloaded at that point which may cause it to overheat/melt/start a fire. </li>
<li>Really this is the same as wiring: you can use larger wires (with higher current ratings) but not smaller wires</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A 20A outlet is not allowed on a 15A circuit. It's not really ""dangerous"" since the breaker will (should) trip at 15A anyway, but it is bad to knowingly install it this way.</li>

","<p>It is very unlikely that they won't.  Nearly all AC to DC converters, by design, draw a very small idle current when you aren't charging any devices.  Cheaper designs consume more while some good designs consume less, but unless there's a physical switch on the USB socket it will always consume some power while waiting for a device to be plugged in.</p>

<p>These are new sockets to the market, and unless you have a compelling reason to avoid a plug in USB charger I would recommend holding off anyway.  Not only do you have the continuous current draw (which, honestly, is going to be less then $5.00 per year even if the device is terribly inefficient) but there's the likelihood of the socket failing, and it's not nearly as easily or cheaply replaced as a plug in charger.  Further it may not charge all devices at their full current.  While the USB association has suggested designs for high power charging (above 500mA), many manufacturers (notably, Apple) still use their own scheme for detecting 1A and 2A charging currents.</p>

<p>Most phones and PDAs will only charge at 1A or greater when connected to their own charger, and at the slower 500mA rate when they can't detect their own charger.</p>

"Is it unsafe if some three prong outlets don't properly test as grounded?","23070","","<p>It's me again -- the pest ;-) </p>

<p>On the general inspection report for the house we're looking at buying, there's a note about the house's electrical: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some three prong outlets did not test properly grounded.  This may be an indication that the wiring in the walls is the older ungrounded type.  We recommend considering upgrading to grounded type wiring for safety enhancement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How big of a safety concern is this? Is there any other explanation for faulty ground tests? What corrective action would be necessary?  I'm concerned that fixing this would require the entire electrical lines to be replaced...  If so, any thoughts on how expensive that would be?  I'm guessing quite a bit. </p>

<p>What's strange is that the report does mention that a ground is present on the main panal: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Grounding system is present.  The grounding electrode was buried and not fully visible at the time of our inspection.  Wood screws are used to secure the dead front cover to the panel.  This is improper because they have sharp ends and can damage the protective coating in the wires inside the panel. We recommend installing proper screws. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The inspection report also recommended adding GFCI outlets.  Would that help at all? </p>
","<p>If an outlet has a ground terminal, it should be grounded.  No ifs or buts.  (And IMO, giving the illusion of ground protection is even worse than not having any protection.).  I don't think you can even get two-prong outlets any more, so I think you'll have to fix the wiring.  It sounds like you're still negotiating, so this is a good bargaining point.  And if you don't get it fixed now, when it comes time to sell, any potential buyers would be within their rights to make you fix it then.</p>

<p>An easy way to check that your wiring has a ground conductor is to open up the service panel, look for the breaker that controls those outlets, then trace the black-shielded wire to where the cable feeds into the panel.  (If it's present, ground is unshielded.)</p>

<p>If you have grounded wiring at the service panel, the next thing to check would be to look inside the outlets in question to see if the wiring there is grounded (it may just be a loose connection, and since it's common to daisy-chain outlets in a room, one faulty wire could affect several outlets).</p>

<p>If you have don't have ground at the outlets, but did at the service panel, you probably have a junction box joining the older ungrounded wiring and newer grounded wiring.  Time to go exploring in the attic or crawl-space / basement.</p>

<p>GFCIs detect a difference between current going out on the live terminal and current coming in on the neutral terminal.  If you're the easiest path to ground in an electrical fault, a GFCI will detect that and break the circuit; without a GFCI, you'd have to hope that you draw enough current -- and for long enough -- to trip a regular circuit breaker.  On the whole, though, I'd rather that current was running to ground through some copper that's intended for just that purpose.</p>

After shoveling snow each winter, the deck surface is chipped with raw wood exposed.  I have painted it twice but this seems like a poor approach going forward.  I would like to remove the paint from the surface (3 layers) and stain/seal the deck -- eliminating the need to take care of its surface each spring.</p>

<p>What do you recommend?</p>
","<p>For the main deck, I would recommend a floor sander, similar to what's used for finishing hardwood floors. Put a 100-120-grit belt on it and take it back and forth along the deck in the same direction as the planks until you see bare wood. Once you have bare wood, I would apply whatever stain or sealant you want very quickly thereafter, as you have just removed a large portion of both the artificial and natural weather and bug resistance the wood had.</p>

<p>A handheld orbital or belt sander will get most of the stuff off the vertical components (handrails and pickets). You'll need a ""corner cat"" or other detail sander, or some elbow grease, to get the paint out of crevices and detail work.</p>

<p>You will not be able to avoid taking off some wood along with the paint. Paint (especially a product designed for this kind of outdoor application) will seep into the grain of the wood, and you will be removing wood before you see the color disappear and bare wood show through.</p>

<p>By the way, you will still need to maintain the deck after staining and sealing. The stain will last for quite a while, but you'll need to re-apply the water seal at least once a year, once every 6 months if you get a lot of rain.</p>

","<p>No -- an 18 ga. nailer is ideal for attaching small pieces of trim, like shoe molding/quarter round, inside your house. Outside, the nails will quickly rust and fall off -- they aren't galvanized, they are TINY, and they have little to no head on them. If you want to use a nailer, you need to use a framing nailer like Shirlock suggested. Make sure you use hot-dipped galvanized nails. </p>

<p>Personally, when building a fence, I use coated decking/exterior screws. They won't allow boards to warp and move like nails will, they absolutely won't ever rust unless you stripped the coating off somehow, and if you need to replace a fence plank because it cracked/warped/discolored, or you need to repair storm damage, or you need to remove an entire run of fencing to get a pickup truck or a large piece of equipment into the backyard, you can just unscrew a couple of screws.

","<p>A splitter takes RF power from an input and divides it up between multiple outputs. The splitters are designed to operate at a certain range of frequencies. For cable TV, this might be from 5 MHz to 900 MHz. The important thing to note here is the lower bound, 5 MHz. This splitter would block signals that are below 5 MHz. DC, or Direct Current, is low frequency power (perhaps less than 5 kHz). This low frequency component of the signal can easily be blocked by using a capacitor is series with the port.</p>

<p>Because your splitter says DC pass, it ""passes"" DC voltages/currents from its input to its output. This does not mean that the splitter is active. The splitter likely can operate without any power (it can be passive). The DC power, if passed, can be used to power circuitry such as amplifiers that are connected to the cable.</p>

<p>Above the bathroom is an attic space.  I have read that venting out the gable side of the house is preferable to soffit vents or roof vents.  This makes sense to me because it avoids roof penetration and venting out the soffit may allow the hot, moist air to re-enter the attic through the neighboring soffit vents.  In addition, bends in the vent duct are discourage because they reduce airflow.</p>

<p>However, all ceiling mounted fans I've seen sit between the joists and the vent outlet runs parallel to the ceiling joists (toward the soffits).  In order to get to the gable end, I would need to put two bends in the duct -- one to turn up and above the joists, then another to turn and head toward the gable end.  From where the fan will be, it is no more than 10 feet to the gable end of the house.</p>

<p>Should I make these two bends and vent out the gable end?</p>

<p>Should I build a box for the fan, recess it above the joists so the vent outlet is in the direction of the gable end of the house?</p>

<p>Should I forget the ceiling vent and use a wall mounted vent?  (If I do this, I believe I will need to still vent out under the eaves which will present the same issue with the soffit vents, no)?</p>

","<p>I'd recommend venting out the gable. Run a rigid vent from the gable wall to a point near your install, and use a 2' piece of flex duct to connect the fan to the rigid vent. The flex duct makes the bends easy (don't kink it) and allows the fan to be repaired from below in the future. For that length, I don't think you need to worry.</p>

"Is it OK to borrow a ground wire from a different circuit?","22845","","<p>I've got a circuit in the basement carrying a handful of outlets.  This circuit has no ground wire.  I want to add a couple of outlets and want them to be grounded.  I may even want gfci outlets on them in the future.  I have no reasonable way of getting a ground wire to the panel but I do have easy access to another circuit that does have a ground wire.  Is it acceptable to borrow or share a ground wire between circuits?  If not, why not?</p>

<p>Both circuits are 20A with 12 AWG wire.</p>
","<h1>Yes, in most jurisdictions.</h1>

<hr>

<h1>NEC 2014</h1>

<p>The 2014 version of NEC has made a change to 250.130(C), which now allows you to connect to the equipment grounding conductor of another branch circuit, as long as it originates from the same enclosure. The new text reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>National Electrical Code 2014</h1>
  
  <h2>Article 250 - Grounding and Bonding</h2>
  
  <h3>VII. Methods of Equipment Grounding</h3>
  
  <p><strong>250.130 Equipment Grounding Conductor Connections.</strong> Equipment grounding conductor connections at the source of separately derived
  systems shall be made in accordance with 250.30(A)(1). Equipment
  grounding conductor connections at service equipment shall be made as
  indicated in 250.130(A) or (B). For replacement of non–grounding-type
  receptacles with grounding-type receptacles and for branch-circuit
  extensions only in existing installations that do not have an
  equipment grounding conductor in the branch circuit, connections shall
  be permitted as indicated in 250.130(C).</p>
  
  <p><strong>(C) Nongrounding Receptacle Replacement or Branch Circuit Extensions.</strong> The equipment grounding conductor of a grounding-type
  receptacle or a branch-circuit extension shall be permitted to be
  connected to any of the following:<br>
  <em>(1)</em> Any accessible point on the grounding electrode system as described in 250.50<br>
  <em>(2)</em> Any accessible point on the grounding electrode conductor<br>
  <em>(3)</em> The equipment grounding terminal bar within the enclosure where the branch circuit for the receptacle or branch circuit originates<br>
  <em>(4)</em> To an equipment grounding conductor that is part of another branch circuit that originates from the enclosure where the branch circuit for the receptacle or branch circuit originates<br>
  <em>(5)</em> For grounded systems, the grounded service conductor within the service equipment enclosure.<br>
  <em>(6)</em> For ungrounded systems, the grounding terminal bar within the service equipment enclosure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if your area has adopted NEC 2014, you <strong>can</strong> connect a grounding conductor to the grounding conductor from another branch circuit, as long as both circuits originate from the same panel. </p>

<hr>

<h1>NEC 2011</h1>

<p>Depending on what code has been adopted in your area, you <em>may not</em> be able to borrow the grounding conductor from another circuit.</p>

<p>Here is what NEC 2011 has to say about replacing receptacles with no equipment ground.</p>

<p>Which means you can add a grounding conductor, but only at or before the service panel. </p>

<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong><br>
<em>The grounding electrode system (of which the grounding electrode is a part), dose <strong>NOT</strong> include branch circuit equipment grounding conductors. The grounding electrode system is a collection of conductors used to connect the service equipment to earth, and is typically located at or near the service entrance only.</em> </p>

"Is it OK to leave window opened and air conditioner ON (cooling) at night?","22831","","<p>At night temperature outside is usually lower than temperature set on AC. So looks like conditioned air should not leak outside (if it does, it is replaced with even colder air) and it is fine to leave window opened. Is this correct?</p>

<p>Note: when window is opened but AC is off, temperature quickly rises because of hot walls and inside sources of heat.</p>
","<p>If you're confidant that the air leaving the house through the open window is warmer than the outside air that will come back in to replace it, I suppose it's OK to leave the window open. But I think a better solution would be to shut the AC off and use a window fan to circulate the cool outside air through the house. A window fan will be quieter and more energy efficient than an AC, and probably faster at cooling as well.</p>

<p>Which direction the fan faces doesn't matter a ton as long as you're moving the air around, but if you think about the goal of getting the hot air out of the house and the cool air in, here are some ways to think about it:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the wind is generating any air movement through a window, use the fan in the same direction. No point in fighting nature.</li>
<li>If you have a single floor, put one fan blowing in and one fan blowing out, at opposite sides of the house.</li>
<li>If you have several floors, put a fan on the lower floor blowing in, and a fan on the upper floor blowing out.</li>
<li>If you still can't decide, point the fan facing out so that the waste heat generated by the fan isn't pushed into the room.</li>

"Is there a window or portable AC system I can use with an awning window?","22760","","<p>My bedroom gets ridiculously hot and I taped tin foil over the window. It didn't help much. I'm thinking of getting an air conditioner but the ledge on the window is small and the window doesn't open very much. I was looking at the portable air conditioners on Amazon and wonder, how do they work? Does the hot air get ejected through a hose that I could put out the window?</p>

","<p>Often the actual pane unit for awning and casement windows can be removed (especially in newer and higher end windows).  If this is the case, you can install a standard window air conditioner. </p>

<p>You would use an ""L"" shaped bar, called angle ""iron"" or angle stock (actually <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202183537/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1&amp;keyword=angle%20%20stock&amp;storeId=10051#.UGzaopjAeSo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">aluminum</a> is probably more convenient), placed at the top of the unit instead of the upper sash to hold the unit in the frame. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/l0l3N.jpg"" alt=""angle stock""></p>

<p>The flat inside face of the angle iron would overlap and be screwed into the frame at the edges. The horizontal edge of the angle would be trimmed to fit inside the frame.</p>

<p>The air conditioner can be centered in the gap and the AC units side filler panels can be used to cover the gap. In the alternative, filler panels (clear plexi or any other thin weatherproof material) can be cut to fill the rectangular gaps on either side of the unit in place of the AC unit's fillers, which usually do not seal too well. In the alternative, the unit can be centered and one panel used to fill the gap. Be sure to seal around the AC edges and around the panels in either case.</p>

","<p>Yours is a not uncommon problem, so a solution does exist. For example, how might one vent a sink in an island in the center of a kitchen? I looked online, and it seems there are two common solutions. You can use what is called a vacuum breaker, which lets air into the line to prevent slow/gurgly drain problems without allowing sewer gases into the area. The second option is an island loop vent.

And if yes, what is the efficiency (the time it take to warm the room, the cost on the electrical bill, etc.) compared to an electric baseboard heater.</p>

<p>My question is general to any type of floor but if the answer depends on the type I use, I would say its for my bathroom (12' x 12') with ceramic tiles.</p>
","<p>Well it depends on the output of the radiant floor, but in general yes they are sufficient to heat a room.</p>

<p>We have underfloor heating (hot water with heat spreader plates under floorboards) in our upstairs rooms and they warm the rooms quite well. The floors are warm to touch (as would be expected). The temperature of the room is more uniform the heat is rising from all parts of the floor rather than from one section of the wall. We don't feel we need additional sources of heat in the rooms.</p>

<p>The rooms do seem to take a little longer to get warm than other rooms with a radiator, but the wooden floors may contribute to this. If you are heating tiles in a bathroom then I'd expect that to be quicker and as quick as a radiator.</p>

"One GFCI outlet to protect them all","22691","","<p>My house was built in 1981, we have a small U shaped kitchen with 5 outlets, along with a switch for the garbage disposal. </p>

<p>My question is if the outlets are all on the same line (they all go off with one switch in the breaker), can I install one GFCI outlet and it would protect al of them, or do I need to replace all 5? </p>

<p>I am fine either way, just do not want to spend the time and money if it doesn't serve a purpose.   Is there a way to identify if they are in series or parallel?  And if so would that impact if I need to replace them all or one? </p>

<p>I have read some basics on GFCI but get some conflicting reports on if one will protect them all. </p>
","<p>If you can locate the outlet at the head of the chain, then you only need to replace that outlet. Just make sure the the incoming power is connected the the LINE terminals and the downstream outlets are connected to the LOAD terminals. The instructions included with the outlet should explain this.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if the only thing on that circuit are your kitchen outlets, you could replace the breaker with a GFCI breaker.</p>
","41823"
"How should I wire a GFCI outlet and a switch to isolate the switch but provide GFCI protection further in the series?","22624","","<p>I am replacing the outlets for my garbage disposal/dishwasher circuit in my kitchen. Currently on that breaker there is one non-GFCI outlet with a pigtailed switch controlling the garbage disposal and one non-switched GFCI outlet controlling the dishwasher. The garbage disposal outlet is currently not in series with the dishwasher outlet, but is ""upstream"" of it in relation to current coming from the breaker box.</p>

<p>I want to install GFCI protection for both of these outlets. I would also like to replace the current GFCI outlet behind the dishwasher with a normal outlet, so that if it trips, I won't have to remove the dishwasher to reset the outlet. Ideally, I would like to install a GFCI outlet for the current garbage disposal outlet, and have it protect both the garbage disposal and dishwasher outlets. However, there is a catch with this plan. I still need the garbage disposal outlet to be switch-activated, but I do not want that switch to also activate the dishwasher outlet.</p>

<p>In short, how can I wire my new outlets to achieve these goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>GFCI protection for both outlets.</li>
<li>No GFCI outlet behind the dishwasher (for easy resetting without dishwasher removal).</li>
<li>The switch only toggling the garbage disposal outlet and not the dishwasher outlet.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've thought about this for several days, and it may be impossible in my current wiring situation. If it is, what other solutions would achieve the same effect as listed above? Should I investigate adding a GFCI breaker for that circuit? Am I going to need to run some more wire through the walls?</p>

<p>Edit: Here is a diagram of the current wiring situation.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bu8aD.png"" alt=""Circuit diagram of current wiring schematic""></p>
","<p>First things first, here's a link to <a href=""http://communities.leviton.com/docs/DOC-1626"" rel=""nofollow"">Leviton's 7299</a> combination switch &amp; GFCI instruction sheet.  For a tamper proof it will be a T7299. The only reason I give Leviton is because I know the part number.  Hubbell, GE or Cooper are just as good and make the same.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GFCI protection for both outlets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Follow the instructions that come with the GFCI.  There are leads for the switch and lugs for the GFCI and also the feedthru-protection of another receptacle.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No GFCI outlet behind the dishwasher (for easy resetting without dishwasher removal).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is accomplished by feeding the dishwasher receptacle using the GFCI feedthru-protection lugs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The switch only toggling the garbage disposal outlet and not the dishwasher outlet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is accomplished by using the leads on the combo switch &amp; GFCI to feed the garbage disposal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Am I going to need to run some more wire through the walls?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there are no wires between the combo switch &amp; GFCI then you will have to pull some romex between the two.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I investigate adding a GFCI breaker for that circuit?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The breaker will cost a lot more than the combo switch &amp; GFCI.  Also, if the GFCI trips then you have to go to the breaker to reset it.  At least with the GFCI receptacle feeding your dishwasher receptacle, you will be closer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What other solutions would achieve the same effect as listed above?</p>

<p>I think this is the way to go, so you don't have to pull your dishwasher out to reset the GFCI.  The nice thing about this site is some of the people either can think out of the box or have faced this problem before.</p>

<p>In the picture above, you can see the water line coming in and leading to the meter. The tubing along the wall on the left is electric conduit, grounding the service panel.

<li>Would the new concrete need to be tied into the existing floor somehow?</li>
<li>Is there a minimum clearance around the pipe that I should preserve?</li>
<li>Are there any structural concerns digging or pouring concrete here? The foundation is fieldstone parged with mortar.</li>

I am absolutely sure there are no structural issues here, how long has the house stood without concrete in the hole? There was probably not a concrete floor when it was built and for many years after.  If you want to simply keep stuff out and hide the dirt then let's do it simple.  Dig out to about a total of 4 inches below your water pipe and valve. Mix up a small bag of  Sacrete concrete mix and fill the hole to about 1 inch under the pipe. Float it smooth, you're done.  There is no need to get carried away with a special base etc. The size and weight of the concrete patch is negligible as far as settling or shrinking is concerned.

","<p>A router (along with a special guide) can be used to cut part of the inset you need, but is not the easiest tool to use if you are not experienced, and it does not cut square corners, which still require a chisel to finish.</p>

<p>Using a chisel does take care and practice, but it is not beyond the reach of even an amateur if you are willing to do a test piece first and then go very slowly. </p>

<p>You need to draw the opening with a sharp pencil (or and awl).  Many people use a utility knife to cut the outline to slightly deeper than needed, then use a small, sharp chisel, following the grain of the wood (in this case toward the top and bottom, not across the door) taking very thin layers out until you are deep enough.</p>

<p>It does not need to be perfectly flat at the bottom of the channel, just the right depth at the ends with no high spots in between.</p>

<p>If you practice on a scrap of wood first, you may be surprised that you can do it. </p>

"How do I adjust a Delta bathroom faucet that has a scald guard?","22452","","<p>I have a new Delta faucet but the water temperature is too low. The handle actually doesn't even turn all the way to ""hot"", there's something preventing it from turning the entire way. </p>

<p>Is there a way to adjust the faucet so I can get hotter water?</p>
","<p>This is a feature of the faucet called ""scald guard"" that you can set to prevent overly hot water from burning people. I have a new construction and I found that the default setting was a bit overkill, so I adjusted it.</p>

<p>You only need a small hex key (size?) to adjust the scald guard. Before you begin make sure you close the bathtub drain or put something over the shower drain, the screw is very small!</p>

<p>There's a tiny screw at the bottom of the faucet:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FrB45l.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Unscrew this and then remove the handle, you should see the plastic assembly. Take note of the circular piece, you need to slide this off in order to adjust the faucet:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YaGV8l.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/R654Ol.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now you're ready to adjust it. Note the triangular plastic bit that is at the ""4 oclock"" position. As noted on the plastic part itself, turning it counter clockwise let's the handle turn more towards hot, and clockwise turns it colder. The circle thing is in there with saw teeth, so you just can't turn it, you need to pull it out, turn it, and then push it back in. I moved mine to be closer to the ""2 oclock"" position:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AX7ial.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now you can slip the circular plastic piece back on, then the handle, and then the small hex screw again to finish it off (basically go in reverse order). Your faucet should now be able to turn to the hotter position. </p>

<p>Adjust to your liking; also be cognizant of safety, the thing is there for a reason, and the plastic bit will prevent you from adjusting it too far towards hot. My personal set up is a little bit hotter for our master shower and bath, but not as much in our guest bathroom since there might be kids, etc. </p>

"Do all garage receptacles have to be GFCI protected, and 18 inches off the ground?","22419","","<p>I have a couple quick questions about garage outlets.</p>

<p>If I recall correctly, outlets in a garage must all be GFCI.</p>

<ol>
<li>Does that include ceiling outlets for garage door openers?</li>
<li>Why? Genuinely curious the logic behind this code (not debating it, just wondering).</li>
</ol>

<p>I also remember hearing that all outlets must be 18"" off the ground because of <em>something</em> with gas fumes (I guess gas fumes don't rise higher than 18 inches?).</p>

<ol>
<li>Is that 18 inches to the bottom of the box or middle?</li>
</ol>
","<p>Yes, even the receptacle for a GDO in the ceiling is required to be GFCI protected. The exception for this was removed in the 2008 NEC. </p>

<p>IMO the reasoning behind this is that folks will plug an extension cord in anywhere they can, even the ceiling. And many folks like to install those pull-down cord reels on the ceiling in the middle of the garage. The GDO receptacle is a super convenient place to plug these things in.</p>

<p>There is no height restriction in the electric code. This may be in the building code in your area.</p>

"How do I work around a tree in my fence line?","22392","","<p>I have a fence that was built about 4 years ago.  There was a large oak tree that I wish to keep on the fence line.

<p>Notice the chunk of fence that is connected to the posts [] and just floating next to the tree.  Those are starting to come apart...</p>

<p>I'm looking for a good solution to maintain this design better.  The floating pieces are actually connected with a crazy contraption of 2x4's behind the tree where you can't see it, but it's not very solid.  I'm hoping to find a solution that will last more than a year or two. </p>
","<p>Build a wrought iron ring either around the back or depending on how big the tree is or around the whole thing.</p>

<p>Make a half circle with two horizontal 1"" strips and 1/2"" iron posts. 1 post every 8 - 12"" would be enough. The two outside posts can be longer and set in concrete. You can easily make the diameter of the ring big enough to leave 6-8"" of space for future growth. If you want to still block it off more you can string it with vinyl straps used on balconies or something that fits your style. Tabs welded to the outside posts would allow you to connect the boards coming from the wood posts to support them.</p>

<p>It would be a fairly simple build for someone with a welder.</p>

"How do I choose the correct size pump and pressure tank?","22361","","<p>I'll have a 3000 gallon water tank (around 8 feet tall) located at the same elevation as my house.
The distance between my house and the tank will be about 90 feet, with the water traveling through a 2"" line.
I use about 10000 gallons per month, or 323 gallons a day.
My house (1700 sq. ft.) has a total of 14 'water outlets' (spigots, faucets, toilets, showers etc).
The water tank is filled through the top, and water will travel to the pump through an aperture located at the bottom of the tank.
The placement of the pump in relation to the tank is show below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uAv4M.png"" alt=""Pump placement""></p>

<p>How should I choose the correct size pump and airbag?
I won't have access to the inside of the tank, and I would rather have the pump located outside of the tank.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a formula, or some general guidelines.</p>
","<p>Two factors matter: flow rate and pressure. Pressure is determined by friction loss and elevation adjustment. Since the tank and house are at the same elevation, we don't need to account for that. We do need to account for your friction loss, though. To do that, we need to know what your pipe diameter, length, and flow rate.</p>

<p>We start with flow rate because the amount of water flowing through a pipe determines its friction loss. That's what we size the pipe from. Your flow rate should be based on maximum flow: everything that could possibly ever run at one time. Your shower, dishwasher, washing machine, somebody washing their hands, etc. There's no uniform minimum standard for that, so check the fixtures around your building to find out how muh they would draw.</p>

<p>According to a <a href=""http://www.michigan.gov/documents/deq/deq-wb-dwehs-gwwfwim-section4_183029_7.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">plumbing design guide from Michigan</a>, this can vary from 7 gpm for one bathroom to 17 gpm for a 3-4 bathroom residence. After you've determined the flow rate, you must select a desired pressure for the house inlet pressure.</p>

<p>If your pump is able to fully supply your house without the aid of a tank (sufficient flow at operating pressure), then your only consideration for tank size is the cycle time of the pump. For smaller pumps, you want your tank to provide at least 2 minutes of water. For larger pumps, you may desire a higher cycle time. There is no harm in a larger tank size.</p>

<p>If your pump isn't able to provide that level service, then you'll need to size your tank to provide supply for a period of time. Remember that pump supply in gpm is also related to pressure. The more pressure the pump needs to provide, the less flow it will have. Calculate your pump flow based on the pressure needed to <strong>charge</strong> the tanks.</p>

<p>The ultimate calculation is (maximum flow * maximum minutes) > (tank capacity / minutes + pump capacity * minutes). You can use any combination of tank and pump capacity as long as the tank + pump capacity meets your demand needs. A 1 gpm pump and a pressure tank that can supply 300 gallons could probably hold you over just as well as a 14 gpm pump and 28 gallons of supply tank. Remember again that supply is not equal to full capacity: you only have supply if it is higher than your necessary pressure. Your goal is to find a combination that is most cost effective.</p>

<p>For another good resource related to tanks, see <a href=""http://www.flotecpump.com/residentialpage_resource_faq_tanks.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Flotec's pre-charged pressure tank FAQs</a>.</p>

<p>By the way, since you gain 1 psi for every 2.31 feet of elevation gain (referred to for some reason as ""feet of head""), you can get a lot of ""free"" tank supply pressure by putting your tank at a higher elevation, though that will increase your pump charging pressure.</p>

<p>For absolute luxury, keep your entire supply system able to supply above your desired household pressure and slap a pressure reducing valve on the supply line just before it reaches the first appliances. 60 psi is the ideal dream coming out of your pressure valve (fantastic showers!), but pressure does cost in terms of electric usage for lower pump capacity because, again, higher pressure means lower flow. Most systems are designed to start charging at 40, 30, or 20 psi, though. Note how the pressure corresponds to the amount of water that can be supplied in <a href=""http://www.flotecpump.com/ResidentialProduct_fl_hw_tk_FP7130.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">this example tank</a>.</p>

"How can I replace the bulb in this ceiling fan?","22268","","<p>So I moved into this house over a year ago, and upon moving in, there was a ceiling fan in the kitchen area that has continued to baffle me (and anybody I have look at it).  The core of it all seems to be 1 piece, the only thing that seems to have screws to be removed are the blades of the fan.  Here's some pictures:</p>

<p>*The little stump at the top of this picture that kind of looks like a screw is the switch to change the direction of the blades.</p>

<p>So it looks to me like the base of it is glued to the ceiling, and other than that I don't see anything.  To make matters worse, the bulb inside is very dim, and I can't for the life of me figure out how to replace the bulb, none of the pieces seem to come apart, I've tried several times and had a few other people look at it.  </p>

<p>Has anybody seen a ceiling fan like this?  I'd like to either figure out how to change the bulb, or figure out how to just get rid of it entirely and put up one that makes a little more sense.</p>
","<h1>Removing the unit</h1>

<p>As for how to remove the entire fan, I have a fan with a similar canopy. There's a decorative cover ring at the bottom, that hides two screws. You should be able to pop the cover down, then undo the screws. Once the canopy is out of the way, you should have no problem removing the entire unit.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/D2qrp.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

"How do I fill a hole under a sidewalk?","22267","","<p>The sidewalk leading up to my front door developed what looked like a sink hole under it about a year ago.  Since then, an animal of some kind has made the hole even bigger and it now runs as a tunnel under my pathway.</p>

<p>QUESTION:
How to I fill this hole most effectively?  Obviously it would be great if I could do it cheaply and without busting up the sidewalk.</p>

<p>CONCERNS:
I like in Omaha, NE.  We have extreme winters and summers.  I thought about pouring concrete into the hole, but I'm concerned that it would expand under the sidewalk and cause buckling and cracking.  I also thought about filling it with just dirt and sand, but I'm concerned that I won't be able to get the hole filled directly under the middle of the sidewalk, thus not supporting the weight load put in the walkway.</p>
","<p>Fill the hole with concrete.  Concrete doesn't expand in the cold -- you're probably thinking of frost heave, which is where moisture in the soil freezes and expands, disturbing whatever's above it.  If your sidewalk hasn't heaved by now, then the addition of new concrete below it isn't going to change anything.</p>

<p>Filling the hole with dirt or sand may in fact cause the heaving you're concerned about though -- I can imagine a situation where you're unable to properly compact the dirt underneath the sidewalk, creating a nice loosely-filled pocket for water to sit in and freeze.</p>

","<p>That styrofoam insulation will work, but it is not cheap per R-value (however it gives you a great R-value per inch).  Insulating an attic usually means you have a lot of room for insulation and you will need high R-value so that is why the cheaper options are more popular (blown cellulose or blown fiberglass).</p>

<p>Said another way, if you have a couple of feet of space in your attic, you can just fill that all up with loose insulation and get R-45 (or whatever you need).  But if you have a smaller space, say it is a finished room and the only space for insulation is between the 2x6 or 2x8s ceiling joists you may want to pay extra to get a higher R-value in that limited space.</p>

"How do I prepare a chipped, peeling, deeply cracked wall for painting?","22166","","<p>I recently moved into a new apartment where it was understood I would handle the maintenance if they provided the materials. This was an attractive proposition. I am little excited to get my hands dirty and learn some new skills. One of the first tasks is to put on a fresh coat of paint. However, the paint on the wall is really chipping. How much should I chip off? My inclination is ALL of it, but this will leave a bit of an uneven surface. How should I handle this? Painting over it will not look great.</p>

<p>I have been living in apartments the past decade and haven't really done any work in those years. I can't wait to get started, but I do not want to <em>mess</em> anything up. I Attached a picture below.</p>

<h2>UPDATE:</h2>

<p>This apartment was built in 1910. I can confirm there is no lead paint. I went ahead and chip the paint off and sanded. Most of the paint on the wall came off. However, the wall itself started chipping off in the corner. I am sort of unsure how to handle this. </p>

<p>I've attached a picture below. You can sort of see in the first picture posted above in the corner that there appears to be a crack. It gets worse.</p>

","<p>I am glad you want to learn to do this type of job yourself. Before you jump in let's answer a couple of other questions first. How old is this place? If it was build before 1978, then you must by Federal EPA Law in all non owner occupied rental apartments test the peeling paint for lead before any scraping or sanding can be done. Simple test kits can be purchased at most HI stores, however it is the owners responsibility to have these tests done. If the test is positive for lead, then the work MUST be done by a licensed EPA Renovator with the training and tools to remediate the lead hazard and dispose of the wastes. There are no exemptions to this law in rental units and failure of the landlord to comply carries a $10,000 fine.</p>

<p>Now let us assume no lead is present and you can proceed with the job. The first step is going to scrape off any and all loose paint. Using a 3 or 4 inch stiff putty knife, carefully remove as much old loose paint as possible. Applying new paint over an unstable base will lift the old paint as you roll it on and make a mess. If the surface is too rough and uneven, then a skim coat of drywall compound will be needed if the entire wall surface needs to be leveled.  If just small areas need leveling, then you can use spackle compound. If a complete skim coat is needed, the compound is best applied with a 12 inch knife about 1/16"" thick over the entire wall. Smaller repairs with spackle can be done with a 4 or 6 inch knife.  After the compound has dried, it has to be sanded smooth. Use 150 grit paper on a large sanding block. Do this gentily to remove ridges and give an overall smooth finish.  You can go over it a second time if necessary with compound and finish sand with 220 grit to achieve a very smooth finish.  Once you are happy with the smoothness of the wall, then prime it with a drywall sealer/primer, not regular primer. After you seal/prime, but before you paint, check the surfaces and make minor touchups using lightweight spackle.</p>

<p>There are several other tricks of the trade to help make a full skim coat go easier. Mix the compound well, add a little extra water and some Ivory dish soap as you mix. The idea is to make the compound a little thinner so it will be easy to spread evenly and minimize the tiny air pockets/bubbles. The larger the knife or trowel you can use will make the job go faster and leave less ridges. Do not overwork the compound or try to work it if starts to dry.</p>

<p>At this point you will be wondering why you agreed to this big job, but it will look great. So finally you can get to work painting with your selected color.</p>

I immediately thought I installed the fan upside down even though I marked it before removing it from the old unit.</p>

<p>I then took a look at the blade closely and the blade has a concave shape that is turned up. From what I understand that is indeed the direction the concave shape of the blade should point. Additionally, the blade is slightly discolored on the edges, but curiously in the counter-clockwise direction. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the arms that the blades are riveted to and the mounting hub are under the blades when looking down. So, I know it's definitely installed correctly.</p>

<p>Next, I took a look at the wiring on the contactor. When I removed the old motor, I cut the wires and left them connected so I knew exactly where they were when installing the new motor. Then, I noticed something strange on second inspection. Black was on L2 instead of L1 like on every post I found online on how to install this motor. It was this way for sure from before, I did not confuse anything. I waited until just before I installed the new one to remove it from the terminal.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if the initial installer reversed L1 and L2 to get the old motor to spin counter-clockwise. I know that's possible with DC motors, but I don't know if that was common practice. My first instinct was to just switch the directional jumper on the new motor, but if it's currently hooked up backwards, I don't want to leave it that way.</p>
","<p>Yes, the concave shape should always curve in the direction of the air flow...</p>

<hr>

<p>Switching the L1 and L2 wires wouldn't change the motor's direction and the colors are a bit arbitrary since this is a 220V circuit.  Verify that it is 220V and that neither wire is the neutral, then mark the white wire with black electrician's tape to signal that it is ""hot"" too.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ehow.com/how_6005849_reverse-single-phase-ac-motor.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">It's a common thing to switch the polarity of the <em>start</em> windings relative to the <em>run</em> windings to change an AC motor's direction</a>.  These are usually yellow and orange wires, and the previous installer may have switched these.  If you can't tell that this kind of switch was done, don't worry about it and set the new motor's jumper to get it spinning in the right direction.</p>

"What is the difference between an impact driver and an impact wrench?","22061","","<p>Obviously impact drivers and impact wrenches are designed for different purposes, but since they both work on the same principle is there some overlap? Is a small cordless impact wrench just a slightly scaled-up version of a cordless impact driver, with a 1/4"" square drive instead of a 1/4"" hex drive, or are there further differences? Could I buy adaptors to use one occasionally in place of the other, and if so what would be the disadvantages? I can guess a few downsides: the wrench would be heavy and large when used as a driver so not convenient at arms length or in tight spaces; the driver would be underpowered for really heavy-duty wrenching; the wrench might need some care to avoid twisting the heads right off your screws. Is there more to it than that?</p>
","<p>Most driver bit sets come with a 1/4"" square drive adapter (my small Milwaukee set also came with a 3/8"" drive as well, though I don't know if that's common).  With that one bit, your driver is instantly almost exactly the same as a 1/4"" impact wrench.  You'd have to look at torque specs to see if the models you're considering are comparable, but I bet they are.  Those little impact drivers have come a long way -- battery life is great and the torque is hard to believe.</p>

<p>I'd only consider a square drive impact wrench for heavier automotive (or other mechanical) use, and only in a larger size like 1/2"" so it can provide some real help in removing tough fasteners.  </p>

<p>Is a handheld drill capable of drilling these holes into aluminum up to 1"" thick?</p>
","<p>Assuming you mean an electric powered drill, it may have the guts. A 1/4 inch hole is no problem, but a 1/2 inch hole will take more work. Clear the chips from the hole as you drill. I think the biggest issue with a hand held drill is if you will keep the drill neatly vertical. This will impact the quality of the holes you drill, if you do not.</p>

<p>A problem with a hand drill for metal is getting the hole in exactly the right place. A good solution is to use a center punch. This puts a small dimple, centered at the location you want to drill. The drill bit will now get started more easily without skating around the surface.</p>

<p>Keep your bits sharp. This will be important. A lubricant is also important, both for drilling and for the thread tapping process. For aluminum, you can use WD40 or 3 in one oil for this purpose, or a kerosene based lubricant that contains some oil.

"Why does my Ring doorbell keep repeating the chime?","21874","","<p>I installed one of those fancy new Ring doorbells (the video / WiFi connected doodads) and it keeps repeating my doorbell chime. When you press the button to ""Ring"" me, the doorbell chime rings and the the app initiates a video call to my phone. <strong>Until I accept, reject, or let the video call timeout... my doorbell chime keeps repeating (dingDong, [pause], dingDong, [pause], dingDong, [pause], dingDong, [pause]. ... ).</strong> This is a huge annoyance if I'm at home and just walk to the door. Until the call times out I have to shout overtop of the ""dingDong dingDong dingDong..."". </p>

<p>I confirmed it works as you would expect it to with an old fashioned button + diode. (e.g. 1 press = 1 dingDong... hold the button down = repeating dingDong). <strong>In a nutshell, the Ring is acting like I'm holding the button down.</strong></p>

<p>I drew a <a href=""https://imgur.com/CjD3uWM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">diagram of the circuit</a>, and as far as I can tell everything is correct.</p>

<ul>
<li>Circuit is: Transformer > Ring > Diode > Ring > Chime > Transformer</li>
<li>Transformer is a 16v transformer, chime is for 16v transformers</li>
<li>Transformer reads 19.4v without load... but I understand that to be expected after some research on the net</li>
</ul>

<p>I've tried a new transformer, a new chime, and a new diode... all do the same thing. I have the diode wired up so the stripe faces the chime... which the Ring instructions say to do. </p>

<p>Any thoughts? I can't be the only idiot in the world who can't figure this out. </p>
","<p>OK, this may be a side-effect of the way the Ring powers itself.  </p>

<p>The Ring is in series with the chime.  In series circuits, the same amount of current (amps) flows around the loop through both devices.  <em>And by the way,  this problem crops up with Nest thermostats and dimmers too.</em>   </p>

<p>How does the Ring power itself? By deliberately letting a little bit of current flow through the circuit, including through the chime.  The Ring <em>(like the Nest and dimmers)</em> is betting that a small enough current won't make the chime <em>(furnace, lamp)</em> activate.  And it is guessing at how much current it can get away with.</p>

<p>So my guess is: you have a chime which is more efficient than most.  Sure, when the visitor rings the bell, the Ring shorts the two wires to simulate a doorbell push, and then it lets go of that correctly.  And then, it needs to recharge its internal battery - transmitting video over WiFi is hard work.  So it allows current to flow at that lower rate.  Unbeknownst to the Ring, that is enough to ring the chime.  The Ring isn't <em>timing out</em> when it stops; it's just finished charging. </p>

<p>Now like I say, smart thermostats have the same problem: they charge by sending <em>some</em> current down the W line, hopefully not enough to engage the furnace relay.  If that doesn't work, they give you an option to hook up the ""C"" line to power the thermostat directly.   Unfortunately it does not appear the Ring has an option like that.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR: Your chime is too efficient for the Ring to vampire-charge itself.  Get rid of one.</strong> </p>

<p>Well, if you're in love with that chime, there might be another option, but it's <em>definitely not UL-approved</em>.  You could alter your chime to be less efficient... by putting a <strong>resistor</strong> of appropriate size <strong>in parallel</strong> with the chime.  Finding the appropriate size would take some measuring or experimentation.  You would not want one which gets too hot, worst case someone holds down your doorbell button for a long time.  A fellow shouldn't be able to burn your house down by holding the doorbell button. </p>

<p>Shouldn't this appliance be a 30amp breaker? Or am I misreading ""minimum circuit rating = 30amp""?  Hope this question falls to DIY.SE.</p>
","<p>Your question is a bit convoluted, but the answer is very simple. The breaker size must match or be lower than the wire amp rating feeding the circuit, and appliances on that circuit should not exceed the max rating of the wire or breaker.  In a dedicated circuit for a dryer, for example, the normal size of the circuit would be 30 amps. 30 amps requires a minimum of #10 copper or #8 alu.  With this wire size, the breaker must not be larger than 30 amps.  Do not use a larger breaker then what the current rating of the wire is rated for. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/O7I3i.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The ballast has to generate a very high voltage to ""spark"" the tube. Once the tube is glowing the ballast can relax and give a constant power output. The state between changing from high output to regulated is very stressful for the components and the starter plug is also responsible for handling this change.</p>

<p>Tubes need to be replaced every 12-24 months because the gas inside the tube loses it health properties even though it still emits light. So technically it becomes bad for your eyes because it starts to produce unwanted UV light.</p>

<p>I would suggest removing the old light fitting and buying a new one and INSIST on an electronic ballast. The electronic ballast does not need any starter plugs and handles the initial output voltage much better. It does not cause flickering (but if there is a problem it just does not turn on). These ballasts MUST match the wattage of the tubes. Higher or lower wattage will result in shortened life of the tube or not turn on at all.</p>

","<p>There's no problem with anything you've suggested.  You can use a 15 ampere breaker to protect 14 AWG copper conductors, without a problem. If you feel that 15 amperes is not enough for the receptacles, there is no problem installing 12 AWG wire with a 20 ampere breaker. It's completely up to you what you think is best. If the cost difference is not prohibitive, it may be worth installing #12 on a 20A breaker. Especially if you think you might plug in multiple higher load items at the same time (George Foreman and electric mower for example), or may consider adding additional receptacles in the future.</p>

<p>There is also no problem using a junction box to provide power to different devices. As long as the box is properly installed, accessible, sized appropriately, and adequately sealed.</p>

<p>Nothing in electrical code says that lights and receptacles cannot be on the same circuit. It's more of a guideline than a rule. The general idea is that if the vacuum trips the breaker, you don't want to be left standing in the dark. </p>

<p>The only problem I see, is with the GFCI receptacles in your drawing.  You will not need two GFCI receptacles. You'll simply feed the second receptacle, from the load side of the GFCI receptacle. When wired this way, the GFCI receptacle provides protection to the downstream receptacle.</p>

<p>We've lived in the house for 4 years and this is the first time this has happened. I believe water caused this hole (we live in upstate NY and the cold winters and ice have chipped away at it year after year). The concrete patio was never poured correctly so it slopes (slightly) towards the house, and in the Spring when the snow melts the water funnels towards the house.</p>

<p>Some questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why is there a big hole there? Shouldn't it all be solid concrete?!?</li>
<li>If left unattended, what's the worst case scenario here (so I can justify spending money on a solution to my wife)?</li>
<li>What is the best DIY way to fix patch this hole so we can get through another winter?</li>
<li>What can I do in the long run so that this doesn't keep happening every year?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
","<p>This part of the foundation is most likely spreading out a roof load from a sizable portion of the sunroom roof. If the soil supporting the foundation has eroded away, this will need to be rectified some time next year.</p>

<p>For now, get a bag of ready mix mortar, the kind you just add water to, it has sand and cement already mixed in in the correct proportion. Mix up a small amount, keep the water to a minimum so it will stay where you put it and not slump down. Patch the hole. That's all this is right now, a temporary patch.</p>

<p>If the hole opens up beyond such that you feel like it's sort of a bottomless pit, cut a short length of something like a paint stick. Thin enough to push through the hole but long enough to wedge inside when turned 90 degrees. Tie a length of wire to the center so you can keep it pulled tight when you push mortar up against it.</p>

<p>As you suspect, water and freeze/thaw cycles chip away at the foundation over time. There was probably once a innocuous hairline crack there at one point. Water got in there and froze, opening the crack. Repeat dozens of times a winter and over the years you get what you see now.</p>

<p>The solution is keep water away from the foundation. I see you have a gutter system over this area. That is good. The patio sloping towards the house is <strong>really bad</strong>. Not only does it get into foundation cracks and erode the material, water gets under the house structure and can cause uneven settlement, stressing members in ways that was never intended. Some people think crooked floors in old houses are ""charming"". In reality it is a sign of an unstable structure. Even if the house stays stable, water can be the source of toxic mold. Water has no place in your house other than inside plumbing.</p>

<p>You need to correct the drainage issue. Ideally, it should slope by gravity away from the house at least with a 2% slope. Another solution, not nearly as good, is to place a sump at the lowest point and pump collected water away. I can't emphasize enough how a natural gravity solution is far superior to a mechanical solution. Sometimes you do what you have to do though.</p>

<p>Combine this with the possibility of needing to correct erosion under the foundation. You my be digging up the patio anyway. OTOH, if the foundation is still properly supported and you correct the drainage issue, your little mortar patch could possibly be considered a permanent fix.</p>

"Is it possible to install a ceiling fan without an electrical box?","21707","","<p>A while ago I had some electricians install a ceiling fan mount. Now that I've finally gotten around to installing a fan I've discovered that they didn't install any sort of electrical box to house the wiring. The hole they cut in the ceiling fell on a joist, so evidently they just gave up and installed a round resin adapter plate that they screwed to the joist, which the ceiling fan mount can then be screwed to.</p>

<p>Is this arrangement up to code (in MN) at all? How should I go about fixing it?</p>
","<p>Based on your description, I ""see"" the ceiling cut out, a resin disc screwed to the joist. The disc has two or more empty holes that correspond to the device mounting holes in a standard octagonal junction box. Then there's a length of romex cable just hanging loose to which you're supposed to connect the fan.</p>

<p>If your fan's installation instructions indicate some part of the fan can be used to make connections, such as the ceiling canopy, you may be in luck. Make the connections there. More than likely, they'll assume you are providing a junction box in the ceiling. First ensure the fan's mounting kit is compatible with your resin plate. You'll need to get the wires from the down pipe, through the plate and into a nearby junction box you will install. The fan wires need to be long enough that there's at least 6 extra inches after running into the box. They must not bind against anything.</p>

<p>You'll need an old work box, a blank cover plate, some wire nuts (may be part of the fan kit), a short length of 1/2"" flex conduit, a flex to box connector, and a plastic conduit bushing to protect the wire insulation where it goes into the conduit above the fan. You'll also need a romex to box connector if the box does not have them built in. Any wire running in a concealed structural space needs to be in conduit or non-metallic cable (romex), or a few other less common options.</p>

<p>You install an old work box by cutting the proper sized and shaped hole in the ceiling in a place where the box will not hit anything above the ceiling but is close to the resin plate on which the fan will be mounted. Do not install the box at this time, I'm explaining what will happen, but there's other things to do first. You would place the box in the hole, the box's flange keeps it from being pushed through. A couple retaining tabs are turned with a screwdriver so that the box will no longer be able to be pulled out.</p>

<p>If the romex cable is not attached nearby to a joist, you'll need to do so through the box hole. Locate the hole so it's close enough to do this, but not so close the wire is kinked or crimped after the box is installed. Remove an appropriate knock out in the box to connect the conduit. You can cut or drill a hole if need be. After securing the romex, feed it into the box. Feed the attached conduit through the hole and back out through the resin plate. It can be routed next to the plate as long as the fan ceiling canopy fitting will cover it. Or cut a hole in the plate if need be. Install the box and cut the conduit to length at the resin plate. Install the protective bushing. Install the fan on the resin plate. Push the fan wires through the conduit at the resin plate and into the box and make the connections. Install the fan ceiling canopy and box cover plate.</p>

"I over-fertilized my lawn. Now what do I do?","21689","","<p>So, I screwed up, and put too much turf fertilizer on my lawn. It's not completely brown/dead, but there are some pretty significant patches. Is there any way to recover from this? Or is my only option to till the soil and put down new seed?</p>
","<p>If it's not totally dead you can try to water it back to health. You should at the very least try this first. Grass is normally pretty hardy and it might survive if you clear the soil of fertilizer.</p>

<p>If it's dead and gone soak the area a few times to try and wash out most of the fertilizer and put some patch seed down. This is the stuff that has the fibers with it to make sure it's not just barren seed on the ground. You could also just put seed down. </p>

<p>If it's the entire yard, you might look into getting it hydro seeded.</p>

<p>In any event nothing is going to continue to grow if it's overly saturated with fertilizer. Fix this first, and then the grass. Water run-off is bad for the rivers and nearby ponds but nothing much can be done about it at this point. </p>

"Why does my water smell bad after the water softener?","21646","","<p>Just bought a house, and I don't really understand how the water softening system is set up. Here's my best guess:</p>

<p>Water from the well is pretty hard, and <strong>very</strong> iron filled. It smells enough to smell it across the room. But: it does not smell like sulfur.</p>

<p>First the water goes through a water softener with a brine tank. Water at this point smells faintly of iron, but is much softer and still does not smell like sulfur.</p>

<p>After that it goes into another tank that looks like a water softener, (I can even force it to do a backwash) but has no company or product names on it, and no brine tank. I'm guessing that this is an iron filter. (Though I'm not sure why it would be after the water softener, because it seems like the softener is taking the bulk of the iron out.. And can't that foul the resin? I digress.) At this point the iron smell is completely gone, but now the water smells of sulfur.</p>

<p>It seems pretty clear what the problem is: sulfur contamination in the iron filter.. But from everything I can find online, that shouldn't be possible since most iron filters are sulfur filters.</p>

<p>Anyway, how far off am I from what my actual setup is, and how can I clean this tank?</p>
","<p>It sounds like it's an activated carbon filter, which takes organics out of the water (like the sulphur smell), and that it needs to be rebedded (this needs to happen typically once every 3 to 5 years, depending on level of contamination). Once the activated carbon is 'used up', it actually becomes a good breeding ground for bacteria and is worse than completely ineffective. (Aside, this is the same reason that jug-style filters like Britta need to be replaced regularly -- and it's better to use nothing than an old one). </p>

<hr>

<p>There is not really anything called an ""iron filter"". Softeners can low levels of iron out, and greensand filters can be used for higher levels, but a greensand filter will have a small tank attached with potassium permanganate (dark purple stuff) in it:</p>

"Is a roof made out of glass viable?","21640","","<p>I have thought about that if I am ever going to build a single floor house this is what I would do. I would make the whole roof out of glass (like a greenhouse). This glass roof would be made out of double glass with as much as 20 cm between the two. In this space I imagine that there would be a very dark curtain, which would stop sunlight in the case where the temperature inside the house gets too high (I am living in Scandinavia so this would just be the case for a few months per year). It would be possible to control the ventilation in the space between the glasses by opening sections of the roof.</p>

<p>The positive effects of this would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Watching the stars from bed at night</li>
<li>Feeling like one is outside the whole day if the curtains are away</li>
<li>Less need for lighting</li>
</ul>

<p>A part of the reason for doing this is that light is a precious thing in Scandinavia during the winter. </p>

<p>What am I missing here? Why have I never heard about such a house (bad research?)?</p>
","<p>You lose more heat through ceilings than through other surfaces (because the warm air is touching it, and because of good convection currents). </p>

<p>The insulation value of glass is very low. To put it in USA terms, a single pane of glass is R-1, while many house walls are R-20 and ceilings R-30. I've seen superinsulated roofs at R-60. Even triple-pane glass is only R-3; inert gases inside help, but over time they leak; you probably can't have a good seal if you want to run a curtain through them.</p>

<p>During the day, insolation will warm your house through the ceiling (probably too much, even in your part of the world), but at night when you're only losing heat, you'll really feel it. You'll use a lot of energy to stay warm.</p>

<p>At the same time, it would be very expensive. Windows are generally an expensive feature in a house. Sloped windows should be tempered for safety, which makes them even more expensive. And you're talking about a huge area.</p>

<p>Roofs in particular get beat up pretty hard; standard roofs (asphalt shingles) around here last about 20 years. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, you lose the opportunity to put photo-voltaic panels on your roof.</p>

<p>However, you can get a lot of what you're looking for with a much less ambitious approach.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Small solar tubes bring in a huge amount of light for their size.</p></li>
<li><p>A skylight over your bed can let you stargaze in comfort. Put your bed up high for a wide viewing angle.</p></li>

"Using leveling compound on plywood subfloor (second story)","21637","","<p>I am doing an installation of 1/2"" engineered hardwood on the second story of my home.

<p>Could this be made level with stacked pieces of 15# felt or is this not appropriate? I read that online, but am not sure if I want to trust it.</p>

","<p>That looks like an <em>almost</em> non-issue (especially if the flooring will run the same direction as that level, if not you'll need to do something about it). If it's a low traffic area it might not concern me in the slightest. </p>

<p>I HATE, quote, ""self leveling"" compound. It should called: <em>aww crap, now what?</em> (you had better know how to trowel concrete) And if you're going to use nails instead of glue, then leveling compound is out of the question. It will crack when you shoot nails into it and the flooring won't sit right on all the crumbs.</p>

<p><strong>I'd either floor right over that, or lay down a new 3/8 plywood sub-floor over the whole thing</strong> (with none of the old seams lining up, and nowhere shall four corners meet; <code>T</code> junctions only).</p>

<p>I would not use felt and I wouldn't worry about having to tape that seam if you're going to use leveling compound. But you could try using strips of luan (1/8"" plywood), cut to fit that gap as large as possible, so long as they're still underneath your level (a high spot would be worse IMO).</p>

<p>I've never glued a hardwood floor down, but if you're going to, then this probably would be an appropriate use of self-leveling compound. However I recommend neither process.</p>

"How to prep existing floor for installation of self-adhesive vinyl flooring?","21561","","<p>Some quick background to preempt some discussion about quality, longevity, rental issues, etc.:  I'm in a rental that is literally ""anything goes"".  It's a long story, but suffice it to say if it does not require a building permit (or does but you can hide from the inspector), it's good to go.  This is an open layout where the bulk is laminate flooring that I installed myself.  I have an area that's approximately 18' x 8' that's an entrance and kitchen area and a bathroom that's about 6' x 6' where the original floor is still exposed.  The original floor is the old fashioned ""linoleum"" (asphalt/asbestos 12""x12"" tiles) flooring.  It's in OK shape, but looks horrible - there's no cleaning of it at this point - it will never be white again.</p>

<p>My main goal is to put the cheapest vinyl solution on top of this that I can.  A lifespan of 5 years would be beyond what I'm aiming for.  Tearing up the old floor is not an option, nor is any floor prep that involves sanding (I am not wanting to kick up asbestos).  I assume I need some type of stripper, but I'm not finding any good specifics about that online.</p>

<p>My second goal is ease of installation.  I can't see myself doing a good job with a large sheet - the kitchen/entryway is sort of an elongated ""U"" shape ( |<strong>__</strong>| ), and the bathroom is small, but I have to go around the toilet and a small vanity.  And having an open floorplan like this, I'd like to avoid stinking the place up with the adhesives required for sheet flooring.  So I'm aiming for the self-stick stuff.</p>

<p>Any recommendations on cheap stick-on that will stick, and probably even more importantly the materials to prep the existing floor are welcome!</p>
","<p>I have run into the same situation many times. Let me say first, that I don't condone doing work that requires permits without them, as it often leads to crappy quality or safety issues. I always prefer to do quality work, but occasionally budgets make it necessary to do a quicky fix. 
In your case, the most important thing is to strip away all old wax and dirt on the existing tiles.  Tack down any loose tiles, especially around the edges with ring nails or a power stapler.</p>

<p>There are many de-waxing products and can be found at any box or hardware store. An alternative cleaner is ammonia and water. Cheap and effective, but smelly. You can also use a mix of  regular bleach, TSP, and water. (BTW, never mix bleach and ammonia!!!!) Clean the existing tile with one of these products and scrub the surface well with a mesh type pad, like a 3M green scrubbie.  Be sure to rinse the area well with clean water and allow to dry. </p>

<p>You may also consider a tile primer. This product is a bit pricey at over $30 a gal, but when applied over most any hard surface gives an excellent base for any self adhesive tile product.  </p>

<p>When you get to the bathroom, remove the toilet and cut your tile around the closet flange, then reinstall the toilet. It is only two bolts, one water connection, and a replacement wax ring.  It will look 100% better and avoid tiles coming up due to the toilet sweating and wetting the edges of tiles cut around the base. Only takes a few extra minutes, but will make a big difference.   </p>

<p>The only negative I can think of is that putting your walls up first you will need some scrap wood to nail into bottom plate for more screwing surface for drywall.</p>

","<p>Three phase motors need to be fed with three phase power. It has to do with the internal configuration, each power leg must be fed power 120 degrees apart so the created magnetic field spins the rotor.</p>

<p>If you're thinking about using 240V split phase to power this motor, the effecive phase angle between each leg and neutral is 180 degrees out of phase. Expect the motor to stall if it will even begin to spin weakly, not create the proper back EMF, draw high current and release smoke.</p>

<p>If you need to run this motor off of split phase, you need to run it from 240V single phase and use a phase converter that electrically produces three phase power output. Your motor will then run perfectly. There are two types of phase converter, Motor Generator and Static (electronic).</p>

"Recommended screw fastener length","21403","","<p>Is there an industry standard for recommended screw lengths to fasten to pieces of material together?  For instance, if I need to fasten a piece of 3/4"" plywood to a vertical brick wall, how long should the Tapcons be?  What about screwing 1 1/2"" pieces of wood together vs. something like, say, a decking board?  </p>

<p>What makes sense to me is that the screw should extend the same distance into the receiving material as the thickness of the item you are attaching.  So, for example, the screw length for a 3/4"" piece of plywood should be 1 1/2"".  However, everyone seems to suggest using 3"" deck screws to fasten decking boards down.  I'm sure there are exceptions such as decks, since decks are exposed to weather and wear and tear but is there a ""standard"" or general rule of thumb to go by?  I always struggle with choosing which length of screw to use.</p>
","<p>I will to try to give a few numbers you may find useful based on what I have found over my years of connecting one thing together or the other.
On Tapcons, Philcons or Con-certs or just good old concrete screws, 1"" embedment into is the typical depth I see referred to. The screws are sold at those lengths with that in mind. 1 3/4"" for 1X material. I checked the website and it is mentioned that the depth can be as deep as 1 3/4"" bury into masonry. In my experience, in hard concrete, or brick, a screw will break after 1 1/4"" into a hard surface. If you are setting it in the joints of the brick or perhaps cinder block or a soft brick like older handmade brick that are not real dark, 1 3/4"" into the material is pretty easy to do. There are 2 different diameters to chose from too. That can be as simple as the judgment call of ""this thing is really heavy and I don't want it to move so I will use the bigger diameter one"" or, ""This will not be too tough to set, so the small one will do."" If the item you are going to secure is going to vibrate, I strongly advise against using concrete screws, unless glue can be used in some way to help keep it together. Wedge fasteners may be a better choice for that, or better still an anchor bolt with expansive concrete set into a drilled, cleaned hole will hold the most reliable if strength and resistance to vibration is what you are looking for.</p>

<p>When fastening wood, once the piece to be fastened is gone through, generally I find 1"" into the second, or the piece you are fastening to is enough to hold. Of course, there are variations on this, depending on the circumstances. On deck boards, IMHO, 3"" screws for a 5/4  deck board is way over kill, 2 1/2"" is plenty for that. For 2X deck boards, 3"" is a good fit. I have also seen 3/4"" or less, work well in thin material that you may not want to go all the way through, but there may be need for many screws needed in a given area to have a strong hold. When screwing into oak or other hardwoods, 3/4"" will hold very well. When fastening a piece to the end of another, as in making a corner for a box, I heard a long time ago the screws needed to be 3 times longer than the piece you are fastening, because end grain does not hold a screw as well as going into the wood perpendicular to the grain. The part about end grain not holding a screw well is true, but I find the screw does not need to be that long at all. A 4 1/2"" screw to hold 2X together?? A bury of 2"" works pretty good in most cases, in a joint that does not have much stress applied to it. If the screw can be slightly angled, instead of going straight into the end grain, what it can hold will be greatly increased. Whenever possible/practical, it is best in any case to use pilot holes in the piece to be fastened, to reduce or eliminate splitting. There will be cases where the pilot needs to be in the other piece as well to prevent splitting. Oak is a good example of needing properly sized pilot holes in each piece. I might add more to this when I get more time, or depending on the comments received, if clarification is needed.</p>

"How do I troubleshoot a washing machine that uses hot water on cold settings?","21387","","<p>We recently moved a 5 year old washer to a new home, connecting hot to hot and cold to cold. After a wash cycle completes, the clothes are hot.  I verified teh hose connections. By opening/closing the shutoff valves, I found that the washer pulls from both hot and cold regardless of the temperature settings. </p>

<p>How do I troubleshoot this?  I'm worried about shrinking clothes and bleeding reds with unwanted hot water.</p>
","<p>Some washers temper cold water with some amount of hot even on the ""cold"" cycle. I think this washer is one of those, and the temperature sensor has failed. Contrast this with an older washer I used to have, where ""cold"" meant it filled only from the cold water input, ""hot"" was from the hot, and ""warm"" simply mixed the two with no temperature measurement or other feedback. It just opened both valves until the fill level was reached.</p>

<p>As a temporary measure, I would turn off the hot water input. Then look at one of the many online appliance parts websites for your model, and see if there is a temperature sensor. Even if you wouldn't attempt this repair yourself, this will help confirm if there is a temp sensor, and roughly how much the part should cost.</p>

"Can I convert/adapt to PEX from copper tubing?","21382","","<p>I'm remodeling a bathroom, and some of the copper tubing needs to be replaced, due to leaks and the need to reposition fixtures.  Is it feasible and recommended to convert from copper tubing to PEX?  For instance, could I use something like <a href=""http://www.pexsupply.com/HydroPEX-H023850-3-8-PEX-x-1-2-Copper-Pipe-Brass-Adapter-13740000-p"">this</a> where the copper comes out of the slab, and run PEX the rest of the way to the fixtures?  My motivation is (perceived) ease of working with the PEX, especially the ability to position it where I need to for the shower valve assembly.  I say perceived, because I've not ever worked with PEX before - is that asking for trouble?</p>
","<p>Yes you can do that (it's the standard way of converting to/from copper), and it shouldn't cause any troubles (read <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/1331/why-would-you-use-copper-over-cpvc-or-pex"">Why would you use copper over CPVC or PEX?</a> and <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/261/does-pex-tubing-have-any-advantages-over-copper"">Does Pex tubing have any advantages over copper?</a> for some comparisons).</p>

<p>Of note: you can get the male adapters that fit on the outside of copper pipe, and also that fit on the inside of copper fittings (like a street elbow). Can be handy sometimes if you're working in a tight space, or were going to immediately make a turn anyways (since you're soldering the fitting anyways, it's barely any extra work to do an elbow+adapter, and saves a PEX elbow and couple of crimp rings).</p>

","<p>HCl can be combined with baking soda to form salt water and CO2.</p>

<p>NaHCO3 + HCl = NaCl + H2O + CO2</p>

<p>NOTE this is exothermic and effervescent, mix slowly, adding the soda to the acid. In a wide-mouth container.</p>
