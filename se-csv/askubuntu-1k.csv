"How to unzip a zip file from the Terminal?","3177883","","<p>Just downloaded a .zip file from the internet. I want to use the terminal to unzip the file. What is the correct way to do this?</p>
","<p>If the <code>unzip</code> command isn't already installed on your system, then run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install unzip

"How do I install a .tar.gz (or .tar.bz2) file?","2784756","","<p>I have downloaded tar.gz files. But I don't know how to install it. How do I install this kind of file?</p>
","<p>The first thing you need to do is extract the files from inside the tar archive to a folder. Let's copy the files to your desktop. You can extract an archive by right-clicking the archive file's icon inside your file browser and pressing the appropriate entry in the context menu.
Extracting the archive should create a new folder with a similar name. e.g. <code>program-1.2.3</code>.
Now you need to open your terminal and navigate to that directory using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>cd /home/yourusername/Desktop/program-1.2.3
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you read a file called <code>INSTALL</code>, <code>INSTALL.txt</code>, <code>README</code>, or something similar if one was extracted. You can check if such a file exists from the terminal by using the <code>ls</code> command. The file can be opened and read with the command:</p>

<pre><code>xdg-open INSTALL
</code></pre>

<p>Where INSTALL is the name of your file.
This file will contain the right steps to follow to continue the installation process. Usually, the three ""classical"" steps are:</p>

<pre><code>./configure
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>You may also need to install some dependencies if, for example, running  <code>configure</code> prompted you with an error listing which dependencies you are missing. You can also use <code>checkinstall</code> instead of <code>make install</code>.

<p>Is there a command to delete all the files in the directory and delete the directory folder?</p>
","<h3>Use the below command :</h3>

<pre><code>rm -rf lampp

<p>It deletes all files and folders contained in the <code>lampp</code> directory.</p>

<h3>In case user doesn't have the permission to delete the folder:</h3>

<p>Add <code>sudo</code> at the beginning of the command :</p>

<pre><code>sudo rm -rf folderName

<p>Otherwise, without <code>sudo</code> you will be returned permission denied. And it's a good practice to try not to use <code>-f</code> while deleting a directory:</p>

"How do I install a .deb file via the command line?","2708250","","<p>How do I install a <code>.deb</code> file via the command line?</p>
","<p>Packages are <strong>manually</strong> installed via the <strong><code>dpkg</code></strong> command (Debian Package Management System). <code>dpkg</code> is the backend to commands like <code>apt-get</code> and <code>aptitude</code>, which in turn are the backend for GUI install apps like the Software Center and Synaptic.</p>

<p>Something along the lines of:</p>

<p><code>dpkg</code> --> <code>apt-get</code>, <code>aptitude</code> --> Synaptic, Software Center</p>

<p>But of course the easiest ways to install a package would be, first, the GUI apps (Synaptic, Software Center, etc..), followed by the terminal commands <code>apt-get</code> and <code>aptitude</code> that add a very nice user friendly approach to the backend dpkg, including but not limited to packaged dependencies, control over what is installed, needs update, not installed, broken packages, etc.. Lastly the <code>dpkg</code> command which is the base for all of them.</p>

<p>Since dpkg is the base, you can use it to install packaged directly from the command line.</p>

<h3>Install a package</h3>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg -i DEB_PACKAGE
</code></pre>

<p>For example if the package file is called <code>askubuntu_2.0.deb</code> then you should do <code>sudo dpkg -i askubuntu_2.0.deb</code>. If <code>dpkg</code> reports an error due to dependency problems, you can run <code>sudo apt-get install -f</code> to download the missing dependencies and configure everything. If that reports an error, you'll have to sort out the dependencies yourself by following for example <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/140246/how-do-i-resolve-unmet-dependencies"">How do I resolve unmet dependencies after adding a PPA?</a>.</p>

<h3>Remove a package</h3>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg -r PACKAGE_NAME
</code></pre>

<p>For example if the package is called <code>askubuntu</code> then you should do <code>sudo dpkg -r askubuntu</code>.</p>

<h3>Reconfigure an existing package</h3>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure PACKAGE_NAME
</code></pre>

<p>This is useful when you need to reconfigure something related to said package. Some useful examples it the <code>keyboard-configuration</code> when you want to enable the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Backspace</kbd> in order to reset the X server, so you would the following:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
</code></pre>

<p>Another great one is when you need to set the Timezone for a server or your local testing computer, so you use use the <code>tzdata</code> package:</p>

This will install guest additions matching the Virtual Box version as obtained from the repositories. It is <strong>not recommended</strong> to install these in newer releases of Virtual Box as obtained from the Oracle repository (see below).</p>

<p>Alternatively we can install the package <strong>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</strong> in the <strong>host</strong> Ubuntu. </p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso
</code></pre>

<p>The .iso file with an image of the OSE edition of the guest additions CD will install in the host directory <code>/usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso</code>. Mount this .iso file as a CD in your virtual machine's settings. In the guest you will then have access to a CD-ROM with the installer.  </p>

<h2>Installing Guest Additions from Virtual Box Manager</h2>

<p>In case the Guest Additions fail to build we may have to install the Linux kernel headers (see <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/75709/88802"">How do I install kernel header files?</a>) or <a href=""https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/build-essential"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>build-essential</strong> <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/uRtxs.png"" alt=""Install build-essential""></a> tools in addition.

<p>Selecting <em>Devices -> Install Guest Additions</em> (or press <kbd>Host</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> from the Virtual Box Manager) the Guest Additions CD .iso will be loaded but <strong>not installed</strong> in your guest OS. To install we need to run the installer script <code>VBoxLinuxAdditions.run</code> as root or from the Autorun Prompt (see below),</p>

<p>Next step is to run the <em>autorun.sh</em> script (as root) on this <strong>mounted</strong> CD either by opening the drive or by choosing ""Open With Autorun Prompt"" from the right-click context menu as depicted above. This will build and install the vbox kernel modules needed.</p>

  <p><strong>Note 1</strong><br>
  Guest Additions need a reboot of your guest OS to take effect.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Note 2</strong><br>
  In some systems the Virtual Box Guest Additions CD icon may not be shown on the desktop, but will be accessible from the <em>Places</em> menu. If the CD still was not there you may have to manually add the VBoxGuestAdditions.iso as a CD-ROM in the Virtual Box Manager <em>Storage</em> menu.  In an Ubuntu host the disk image is in <code>/usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso</code>. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Note 3</strong><br>
  In some systems (e.g. when running <strong>Xubuntu</strong> guests) we may not have an <em>Autorun Prompt</em> for the mounted CD. Then we can install the guest additions by opening a terminal on the mounted guest additions .iso to run <code>sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run</code>. In <strong>Lubuntu</strong> or <strong>Ubuntu Server</strong> guests we additionally need to install the GNU C compiler (<a href=""https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/gcc"" rel=""noreferrer"">gcc</a> <a href=""https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/gcc"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/uRtxs.png"" alt=""Install gcc""></a>) and the <a href=""https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/make"" rel=""noreferrer"">make</a> <a href=""https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/make"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/uRtxs.png"" alt=""Install make""></a> utility in the guest system to be able to compile the guest additions.</p>

<p>For example, if somebody has two OS-es installed (Windows and Ubuntu), and then installs a third OS (Manjaro, etc) and then tries to follow the above answer, Grub Customizer changes will not work when made from the second OS (Ubuntu, in the example). The program has to be installed in the thirs OS, as it seems that Grub Customizer can only edit the Grub files created by the installation of the system on which itself is installed. </p>

<p>This one..</p>

<pre><code>sudo /etc/init.d/mysql - root -p start

<p>The arguments are wrong. an init.d script only takes <code>start</code> or <code>stop</code> or <code>restart</code> - just one word telling it what to do. You cannot give it multiple arguments as you were trying to do.</p>

<p>Anyway, the short answer is the one you actually got to work, is the recommended way. <code>service</code> is replacing all the init.d scripts over time, so you should get into the habit of using <code>service</code>. The page you link is 3 years old so has to be taken with some salt :)</p>

"What does ""sudo apt-get update"" do?","1071486","","<p>I am wondering what <code>sudo apt-get update</code> does?</p>

<p>What does it update?</p>
","<p>In a nutshell, <code>apt-get update</code> doesn't actually install new versions of software. Instead, it updates the package lists for upgrades for packages that need upgrading, as well as new packages that have just come to the repositories.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>apt-get update</code> downloads the package lists from the repositories and ""updates"" them to get information on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies. It will do this for all repositories and PPAs.
From <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Used to re-synchronize the package index files from their sources. The indexes of available packages are fetched from the location(s) specified in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>(5). An update should always be performed before an upgrade or dist-upgrade. </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><code>apt-get upgrade</code> will fetch new versions of packages existing on the machine if APT knows about these new versions by way of <code>apt-get update</code>.  </p>

<p>From <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>(5). Packages currently installed with new versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no circumstances are currently installed packages removed, nor are packages that are not already installed retrieved and installed. <strong>New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without changing the install status of another package will be left at their current version.</strong> [Emphasis mine] An update must be performed first so that apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available. </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><code>apt-get dist-upgrade</code> will do the same job which is done by <code>apt-get upgrade</code>, plus it will also intelligently handle the dependencies, so it might remove obsolete packages or add new ones. See here: <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/81585/what-is-dist-upgrade-and-why-does-it-upgrade-more-than-upgrade"">What is &quot;dist-upgrade&quot; and why does it upgrade more than &quot;upgrade&quot;?</a></p>

<p>From <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition to performing the function of upgrade, this option also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages; apt-get has a ""smart"" conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones, if necessary. 
  The <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>(5) file contains a list of locations from
  which to retrieve desired package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for over-riding the general settings for individual packages. </p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>You can combine commands with <code>&amp;&amp;</code> as follows:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install foo bar baz foo-dev foo-dbg
</code></pre>

<p>or to get newest versions possible as per version requirements of dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>You need <code>sudo</code> both times, but since <code>sudo</code> by default doesn't prompt you within 5 or so minutes since the last <code>sudo</code> operation, you will be prompted for your password only once (or not at all).</p>

"How to force a clock update using ntp?","986214","","<p>I am running Ubuntu on an ARM based embedded system that lacks a battery backed RTC. The wake-up time is somewhere during 1970. Thus, I use the NTP service to update the time to the current time.</p>

<p>I added the following line to <code>/etc/rc.local</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>sudo ntpdate -s time.nist.gov

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> I tried following the few suggestions that came in response to the 1st update, but nothing seems to actually do the job as required. Here's what I tried:</p>

<ol>
<li>Replace the server to <code>us.pool.ntp.org</code></li>
<li>Use explicit paths to the programs</li>
<li>Remove the <code>ntp</code> service altogether and leave just <code>sudo ntpdate ...</code> in <code>rc.local</code></li>
<li>Remove the <code>sudo</code> from the above command in <code>rc.local</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Using the above, the machine still starts at 1970. However, when doing this from command line once logged in (via <code>ssh</code>), the clock gets updated as soon as I invoke <code>ntpdate</code>.</p>

<p>Last thing I did was to remove that from <code>rc.local</code> and place a call to <code>ntpdate</code> in my <code>.bashrc</code> file. This does update the clock as expected, and I get the true current time once the command prompt is available.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, this means that if the machine is turned on and no user is logged in, then the time never gets updates. I can, of course, reinstall the <code>ntp</code> service so at least the clock is updated within a few minutes from startup, but then we're back at square 1.</p>

<p>So, is there a reason why placing the <code>ntpdate</code> command in <code>rc.local</code> does not perform the required task, while doing so in <code>.bashrc</code> works fine?</p>
","<p>Probably the <code>ntp</code> service is running, that's why <code>ntpdate</code> can't open the socket (port 123 UDP) and connect to ntp server.</p>

"How to enable or disable services?","909955","","<p>I read about how to enable and disable services in Ubuntu and it seems that there are different possibilities to manage them.</p>

<p>The first method I found is <code>update-rc.d</code> to add new services to startup, which aims on the <code>/etc/init.d</code> folder and its contents.</p>

<p>The other one I found is to edit <code>.conf</code> files in the <code>/etc/init</code> folder.</p>

<p>What's the recommended way to enable / disable / add services and why?</p>

<p>Could you please give a short bulletproof step by step example on how to add a service in Ubuntu and enable and disable it?</p>
","<p>There are services that can be enabled/disabled using the GUI (like the <code>startup</code> application) or the terminal.</p>

<p>For the Terminal you have several options. First, open a terminal (Type ""terminal"" in the dash, for example, and open it). Then:</p>

<h2>Temporary enabling/disabling services</h2>

<p>To stop and start services <em>temporarily</em> (Does not enable / disable them for future boots), you can type <code>service SERVICE_NAME</code>. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>sudo service apache2 stop</code> (Will <strong>STOP</strong> the Apache service until Reboot or until you start it again). </p></li>
<li><p><code>sudo service apache2 start</code> (Will <strong>START</strong> the Apache service assuming it was stopped before.).</p></li>
<li><p><code>service apache2 status</code> (Will tell you the STATUS of the service, if it is either enabled/running of disabled/NOT running.). </p></li>
<li><p><code>sudo service apache2 restart</code> (Will <strong>RESTART</strong> the service. This is most commonly used when you have changed, a config file. In this case, if you changed either a PHP configuration or an Apache configuration. Restart will save you from having to stop/start with 2 command lines)</p></li>
<li><p><code>service apache2</code> (In this case, since you did not mention the ACTION to execute for the service, it will show you all options available for that specific service.) This aspect varies depending on the service, for example, with MySQL it would only mention that it is missing a parameter. For other services like networking service it would mention the small list of all options available.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>SYSTEMD</h2>

<p>Starting with Ubuntu 15.04, Upstart will be deprecated in favor of Systemd. With Systemd to manage the services we can do the following:</p>

<p><code>systemctl start SERVICE</code> - Use it to start a service. Does not persist after reboot   </p>

<p><code>systemctl stop SERVICE</code> - Use it to stop a service. Does not persist after reboot</p>

<p><code>systemctl restart SERVICE</code> - Use it to restart a service</p>

<p><code>systemctl reload SERVICE</code> - If the service supports it, it will reload the config files related to it without interrupting any process that is using the service.</p>

<p><code>systemctl status SERVICE</code> - Shows the status of a service. Tells whether a service is currently running.</p>

<p><code>systemctl enable SERVICE</code> - Turns the service on, on the next reboot or on the next start event. It persists after reboot.</p>

<p><code>systemctl disable SERVICE</code> - Turns the service off on the next reboot or on the next stop event. It persists after reboot.</p>

<p><code>systemctl is-enabled SERVICE</code> - Check if a service is currently configured to start or not on the next reboot.</p>

<p><code>systemctl is-active SERVICE</code> - Check if a service is currently active.</p>

<p><code>systemctl show SERVICE</code> - Show all the information about the service.</p>

<p><code>sudo systemctl mask SERVICE</code> - Completely disable a service by linking it to <code>/dev/null</code>; you cannot start the service manually or enable the service.</p>

<p><code>sudo systemctl unmask SERVICE</code> - Removes the link to <code>/dev/null</code> and restores the ability to enable and or manually start the service.</p>

<hr>

<h2>UPSTART (Deprecated Since 15.04)</h2>

<p>If we want to use the official Upstart way (Note that, for the moment, not all services have been converted to Upstart), we could use the following commands:</p>

<p><code>status SERVICE</code> - This will tell us if a converted service is running or not. Note that this is deprecated in favor of <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, <code>status</code> &amp; <code>restart</code>. It will also tell us if a service has not yet been converted to upstart:</p>

<p>A converted service would typically output the current status (Starting, Running, Stopping...) and process ID. A non converted service would give an error about an <strong>unknown job</strong>.</p>

<p>Some shortcuts may only work with the <code>service</code> command above but not with the commands below unless they are 100% converted to upstart services:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>START</strong> - <code>sudo start mysql</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>STOP</strong> - <code>sudo stop mysql</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>RESTART</strong> - <code>sudo restart mysql</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>STATUS</strong> - <code>sudo status smbd</code></p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Enabling / Disabling a service</h3>

<p>To toggle a service from starting or stopping permanently you would need to:</p>

<pre><code>echo manual | sudo tee /etc/init/SERVICE.override
</code></pre>

<p>where the stanza <code>manual</code> will stop Upstart from automatically loading the service on next boot. Any service with the <code>.override</code> ending will take precedence over the original service file. You will only be able to start the service manually afterwards. If you do not want this then simply delete the <code>.override</code>. 
For example:</p>

<pre><code>echo manual | sudo tee /etc/init/mysql.override
</code></pre>

<p>Will put the MySQL service into <code>manual</code> mode. If you do not want this, afterwards you can simply do</p>

<pre><code>sudo rm /etc/init/mysql.override
</code></pre>

<p>and Reboot for the service to start automatically again. Of course to enable a service, the most common way is by installing it. If you install Apache, Nginx, MySQL or others, they automatically start upon finishing installation and will start every time the computer boots. Disabling, as mentioned above, will make use of the service <code>manual</code>.</p>

<h3>2. Create a mount point (optional)</h3>

<p>This needs to be mounted into the filesystem <em>somewhere</em>. You can usually use /mnt/ if you're being lazy and nothing else is mounted there but otherwise you'll want to create a new directory:</p>

<pre><code>sudo  mkdir /media/usb

<h3>3. Mount!</h3>

<pre><code>sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/usb

<p>When you're done, just fire off:</p>

<hr>

<p>This answer is almost 6 years old and while the core of it still works, things like <code>fdisk -l</code> aren't the most user-friendly options. There are also new mechanisms in higher stacks for mounting devices in a sane and standard way which might not always be available.</p>

While you're reading this footnote and you're doing this on a desktop system, there definitely are  arguments for <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/865453/449"">using <code>udisksctl</code>, per wecac's answer</a>. This mounts in the same way the desktop does —creating your own <code>/media/$USER/device</code> directory— but I think there are still arguments for a static mountpoint, especially when you don't want the path to change.</p>

<p>Udisks also relies on D-Bus, so might not be available everywhere.</p>

","<h1>16.04 and newer versions of Ubuntu</h1>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get autoremove
</code></pre>

<p>This command removes packages that were automatically installed to resolve a dependency, but are now no longer depended on. This includes old versions of <code>linux-headers-*</code> and <code>linux-image-*</code>. (It’s also smart about this process, leaving one spare version of the kernel around as a fallback!)</p>

<h1>11.10 and newer versions of Ubuntu</h1>

<p>The latest versions of <em>Grub2</em> installed in <em>Ubuntu</em> automatically display the latest kernel and hides the older kernels that you may have installed.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NacOm.png"" alt=""GNU GRUB""></p>

<p>If you do not see your <em>grub</em> - then remember to press <kbd>Shift</kbd> whilst booting.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GGWSl.png"" alt=""GNU GRUB Previous versions""> </p>

<h2>How to permanently delete older kernels</h2>

<p>First boot with the latest available kernel.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways to delete old kernels.  Personally, I wouldn't touch <em>Computer Janitor</em> since this is acknowledged to break your computer with its suggestions.</p>

<p><strong>synaptic</strong></p>

<p>An alternative is <em>Synaptic</em> (<code>sudo apt-get install synaptic</code>)</p>

<p>search for <em>linux-image</em>, right-click a kernel and choose complete removal and finally click the <em>Apply</em> button to delete the kernel.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WAMpk.png"" alt=""Synaptic Package Manager""></p>

<p>Repeat the search but this time for <em>linux-header</em> - you can delete the associated headers for the kernel image chosen previously.</p>

<p><em>Synaptic</em> though will not attempt to verify what you are trying to remove... you could inadvertently delete your newest kernel - or even delete all of your kernels via this tool leaving you with an unbootable <em>Ubuntu</em>!.</p>

<p>Remember to check which kernel you are using type:</p>

<pre><code>uname -r
</code></pre>

<p>The result would be similar to:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/M8DJI.png"" alt=""Terminal &lt;uname -r&gt;""></p>

<p>Remember the result and the number - make sure you don't delete the corresponding image or header.</p>

<p><strong>Ubuntu-tweak</strong></p>

<p><em>IMHO</em>, the best GUI tool is <em>Ubuntu-Tweak</em></p>

<p>It is not available from the standard repositories.  To install in <strong>13.10 and older versions</strong> you need to use the author's PPA:</p>

<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak
</code></pre>

<p>In Ubuntu <strong>14.04+</strong> you have to download .deb file from <a href=""http://ubuntu-tweak.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">official website</a> and install it using Software Center or manually.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SPrYD.png"" alt=""Computer Janitor""> </p>

<p>Choose the options shown by the arrows.</p>

<p>Select both the headers and image with the same version number.</p>

<p>It will not allow you to delete the current kernel you are booted with since the current kernel is not displayed.</p>

<h1>Recommendation</h1>

<p>My recommendation is to keep at least two or preferably three kernels including the latest.  The reason for the recommendation is that you will have at least one/two other kernels to boot with, if for what-ever reason the latest kernel you are unable to boot with or introducing a regressed capability such as broken wireless.</p>

<p>For all the numbers you can use lists eg, <code>5,34,55</code> in the first field will mean run at 5 past 34 past and 55 past what ever hour is defined.</p>

<p>You can also use intervals, they are defined like this: <code>*/20</code> this example means every 20th and if in the minutes column this will be equivalent to <code>0,20,40</code><br>

(For 14.10 and later just run <code>apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk</code>)</p>

<p>How and when can this be done?</p>

<p>(For now we will use Oracle Java - the optimal solution for me is, however, OpenJDK from the Ubuntu repositories, until Oracle Java is available directly and effortless from the Ubuntu repositories)</p>

<hr>
","<p>As of 2017-08-08 I found that this question and its answers had become a bit overwhelming to dig through to understand the issue, so I have summarized the findings in this answer.</p>

<p>The very short answer is that <strong>OpenJDK 8 as of 2017-08-08 is not officially available for Ubuntu 14.04</strong>.</p>

<p>There are however many options available:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu.  OpenJDK 8 is available from 14.10 and onwards.  (OpenJDK 9 from 16.04 LTS onwards)</li>
<li>Download and install Java from Oracle manually as a tar.gz file which just needs to be unpacked and have the license accepted before the <code>bin</code>directory can be added to your <code>$PATH</code> variable.  You might also choose to use a third party PPA.</li>
<li>Download OpenJDK 8 using a third party PPA.</li>
<li>Download a Azul certified build of OpenJDK 8 from <a href=""http://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu/zulu-linux/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu/zulu-linux/</a> (DEB)</li>
<li>Compile the source and install it yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>See other answers for details.</p>

<p>Note that Personal Package Archives (PPA) are usually made by individuals on a voluntary basis.  The contents may be out of date or go away without warning.</p>

<p>Personally I would recommend upgrading Ubuntu to 16.04 LTS, or if not possible download a Azul build.</p>

<p>Then make sure that the <code>restricted</code> and <code>universe</code> repositories are enabled. Hit <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd>, type <code>software-properties-gtk</code> and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p>

<p>Under <code>Ubuntu Software</code> tab, enable all the repositories.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cGmRz.png"" alt=""""></p></li>
<li><p>One possible cause of unmet dependencies could be corrupted package database, and/or some packages weren’t installed properly. To fix this problem, hit <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> to open terminal and try to run one of the following commands:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get clean</pre>

<p>or,</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get autoclean</pre>

<p><code>apt-get clean</code> clears out the local repository of retrieved package files (the .deb files). It removes everything but the lock file from /var/cache/apt/archives/ and /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/. <code>apt-get autoclean</code> clears out the local repository of retrieved package files, but unlike <code>apt-get clean</code>, it only removes package files that can no longer be downloaded, and are largely useless.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the most basic fixes to resolve dependencies problems is to run:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get -f install</pre>

<p>The <code>-f</code> here stands for “fix broken”. <code>Apt</code> will attempt to correct broken dependencies. If you manually installed a package that had unmet dependencies, <code>apt-get</code> will install those dependencies, if possible, otherwise it may simply remove the package that you installed in order to resolve the problem.</p>

<p>Then run:</p>

<pre>sudo dpkg --configure -a</pre>

<p>Then run this again:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get -f install</pre>

<p>If the output is:</p>

<p><code>0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded.</code></p>

<p>That means it failed.</p></li>
<li><p>Next solution is to run:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get -u dist-upgrade</pre>

<p>If it shows any held packages, it is best to eliminate them. Packages are held because of dependency conflicts that <code>apt</code> cannot resolve. Try this command to find and repair the conflicts:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get -o Debug::pkgProblemResolver=yes dist-upgrade</pre>

<p>If it cannot fix the conflicts, it will exit with:</p>

<p><code>0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 6 not upgraded.</code></p>

<p>Delete the held packages one by one, running <code>dist-upgrade</code> each time, until there are no more held packages. Then reinstall any needed packages. Be sure to use the <code>--dry-run</code> option, so that you are fully informed of consequences:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get remove --dry-run package-name</pre>

<p>Since removing the package you are trying to install may not be ideal, you might also try finding a repository that has the packages you need to satisfy the dependencies. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, if all else fails, you can attempt to satisfy the dependencies yourself, either by finding and installing the necessary packages, or by installing them from source and then creating “<a href=""http://www.webupd8.org/2010/01/how-to-create-deb-package-ubuntu-debian.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">deb</a>” packages for them.</p>

<h2>Disable/Remove/Purge PPAs:</h2>

<p>PPAs (Personal Package Archive) are repositories hosted on <a href=""https://launchpad.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Launchpad</a>. You can use PPAs to install or upgrade packages that are not available in the official Ubuntu repositories.</p>

<p>One of the most common causes of unmet dependencies are PPAs, specially when used to upgrade the existing package in Ubuntu repositories. To solve the problem you have three options: disable, purge (revert back to original package in Ubuntu repositories) or remove PPA.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Disable:</strong></p>

<p>Disabling a PPA means no more updates for the packages installed from that PPA. To disable a PPA: Open <code>Software Center &gt; Edit &gt; Software Sources</code> Or,</p>

<p>Hit <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd> and run <code>software-properties-gtk</code>.</p>

<p>Click on <code>Other Software</code> tab, you'll see that each PPA have two lines here, one for the compiled packages and one for the source, <code>Uncheck</code> both lines to disable a PPA. Here you can also add and remove PPAs.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UWtsM.png"" alt=""""></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Purge:</strong></p>

<p>Purging a PPA means, downgrading the packages in the selected PPA to the version in the official Ubuntu repositories and disabling that PPA. <a href=""https://launchpad.net/ppa-purge"" rel=""noreferrer"">PPA Purge</a> does exactly that. To install PPA Purge run the following command:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get install ppa-purge</pre></li>
</ul>

<p>But, considering the question <code>apt</code> is broken, the above command will fail. So use this command</p>

<pre><code>mkdir ppa-purge &amp;&amp; cd ppa-purge &amp;&amp; wget http://mirror.pnl.gov/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/ppa-purge/ppa-purge_0.2.8+bzr56_all.deb &amp;&amp; wget http://mirror.pnl.gov/ubuntu//pool/main/a/aptitude/aptitude_0.6.6-1ubuntu1_i386.deb &amp;&amp; sudo dpkg -i ./*.deb
</code></pre>

<p>To use PPA Purge:</p>

<p><pre>sudo ppa-purge ppa:someppa/ppa</pre></p>

<p>If 'ppa-purge' command fails for some reason, you can't run 'ppa-purge' again unless you re-enable the PPA (To enable the PPA follow the same steps as disabling a PPA and <code>Check</code> the both lines of a particular PPA to enable it).</p>

<p>Note: <code>PPA Purge</code> doesn't remove PPAs (<a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ppa-purge/+bug/945473"" rel=""noreferrer"">may be in future</a>), So you'll have to manually remove the PPA.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Remove:</strong></p>

<p>If the package installed from a PPA doesn't exist in official Ubuntu repositories then using <code>PPA Purge</code> is not recommended, because there's nothing to be downgraded and <code>PPA Purge</code> wouldn't delete it either. To remove a PPA and installed packages run the following commands: (Ignore the first command if you don't want to remove the installed packages)</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get autoremove --purge package-name
sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:someppa/ppa
sudo apt-get autoclean
</pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively you can use <code>Y PPA Manager</code> to disable/remove/purge PPA's (Details at the end of answer).</p>

<h2>Preventive Measures:</h2>

<p>So how can we avoid this from happening in the first place?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Keep Ubuntu Up to date. Ubuntu automatically notifies when updates are available, you can also check for available updates by clicking on <code>Session Indicator</code> in Unity panel:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jQ621.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>Or, Hit <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> to open terminal and run following commands:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade</pre>

<p><em>Update: Synchronizes your list of available packages with the servers in source repositories.
Upgrade: Downloads &amp; installs any newer versions of your installed packages.</em></p></li>
<li>If you decide to add other repositories to sources.list, make sure that the repository is meant to work (and known to work) with Ubuntu. Repositories that are not designed to work with your version of Ubuntu can introduce inconsistencies in your system and might force you to re-install. Also, make sure that you really need to add external repositories as the software package(s) you are looking for may already have been introduced into the official repositories! <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a></li>
<li><p>Remove duplicate PPAs. <code>Y PPA Manager</code> (installation guide at the end of answer) can easily scan and remove duplicate PPAs.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hit <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd> and run <code>y-ppa-manager</code> to open Y PPA Manager.</li>
<li>Once open, double click or hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> on <code>Advanced</code>.</li>
<li>In resulting window select <code>Scan and remove duplicate PPAs</code> and click OK.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

"How can I uninstall software?","716825","","<p>Seeing there are various ways to install on Ubuntu. What are the various ways to uninstall items?</p>

<p>Which ways always work? How can I be sure something was uninstalled?</p>
","<p>If the application has been installed via the package manager, all you have to do is run</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get remove &lt;application_name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That should always work. If the terminal isn't what stirs your tea, you could open <strong>System → Administration → Synaptic Package Manager</strong>, search for the package you want to remove, click on the checkbox next to it and select ""mark for removal"". Once you click ""Apply"", the package should be removed. There's of course also the Ubuntu Software Center. It's pretty much the same thing as Synaptic. Just search for the application name and click the ""Remove"" button.</p>

<p>Sometimes applications can be split up into multiple packages (for example, many games have a separate package for their music). To make sure that you uninstall all related packages AND configuration files, you can type</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get purge &lt;package-name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>or -in Synaptic- ""mark for complete removal"" instead of just ""mark for removal"".</p>

<p>As for applications that have been manually compiled and installed, there's not always a single way to remove them. The best thing to do is consult the README/INSTALL file that accompanied the source package - if one exists.</p>

<li>permissions problem</li>
<li>environment variables</li>

<p>This community wiki aims to aggregate the top reasons for <code>crontab</code> scripts not being executed as expected. Write each reason in a separate answer.</p>

<p>Please include one reason per answer - details about why it's not executed - and fix(es) for that one reason.</p>

<p>Please write only cron-specific issues, e.g. commands that execute as expected from the shell but execute erroneously by cron.</p>
","<p><strong>Different environment</strong></p>

<p>Cron passes a minimal set of environment variables to your jobs. To see the difference, add a dummy job like this:</p>

<pre>* * * * * env > /tmp/env.output</pre>

<p>Wait for <code>/tmp/env.output</code> to be created, then remove the job again. Now compare the contents of <code>/tmp/env.output</code> with the output of <code>env</code> run in your regular terminal.</p>

<p>A common ""gotcha"" here is the <code>PATH</code> environment variable being different. Maybe your cron script uses the command <code>somecommand</code> found in <code>/opt/someApp/bin</code>, which you've added to <code>PATH</code> in <code>/etc/environment</code>? cron ignores <code>PATH</code> from that file, so runnning <code>somecommand</code> from your script will fail when run with cron, but work when run in a terminal. It's worth noting that variables from <code>/etc/environment</code> will be passed on to cron jobs, just not the variables cron specifically sets itself, such as <code>PATH</code>.</p>

<p>To get around that, just set your own <code>PATH</code> variable at the top of the script. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
PATH=/opt/someApp/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

# rest of script follows
</code></pre>

<p>Some prefer to just use absolute paths to all the commands instead. I recommend against that. Consider what happens if you want to run your script on a different system, and on that system, the command is in <code>/opt/someAppv2.2/bin</code> instead. You'd have to go through the whole script replacing <code>/opt/someApp/bin</code> with <code>/opt/someAppv2.2/bin</code> instead of just doing a small edit on the first line of the script.</p>

<p>You can also set the PATH variable in the crontab file, which will apply to all cron jobs. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>PATH=/opt/someApp/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

","<p>A <a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/1008117"" rel=""noreferrer"">bug</a> has been filed about the Nautilus dialog you are seeing as it recommends a potentially dangerous option that could result in data loss.  Please do not run the command in this dialog unless you want to <strong>delete</strong> your saved Windows session and potentially lose unsaved work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Explanation: Why Linux can't open hibernated Windows partitions:</h2>
  
  <p>You are seeing this error because you hibernated Windows instead of
  turning it off the normal way (in newer versions of Windows, hibernate
  might be the default option).</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Hibernating saves the current state information to the hard disk and then powers down the computer.</li>
  <li>Shutting down the computer closes all programs and ends all running processes before powering down the computer.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>When you turn off Windows by hibernating it, you are essentially
  pausing the system and saving all of that information (into a big file
  called <code>hiberfil.sys</code>)  This way when you resume from hibernation all
  of your applications and files will be exactly how you left them.  It
  also sets a flag in <code>hiberfil.sys</code> to let other Operating Systems know
  that Windows is hibernated.</p>
  
  <p>Making changes to your Windows (<code>ntfs</code>) partition while it is
  hibernated could be dangerous--it could cause Windows to not resume
  from hibernation or to crash after resuming.  Because of this, the
  tool (<code>ntfs-3g</code>) that mounts (opens) the partition will not mount it
  in read-write mode if it sees a hibernation flag.  As such, Nautilus,
  the default file browser, will not be able to automatically open this
  partition--hence the error message that you see--because it is trying
  to open it in read-write mode.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Workaround for all versions of Windows:</h2>

<p>There are three ways to mount a hibernated Windows partition:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Boot into Windows and power down the system by shutting it down
completely.  You may then boot back into Ubuntu and the partition will mount in read-write mode automatically when you open it in Nautilus.  <em>Note that the ""Shut Down"" option may not be the one
displayed in your start menu by default.  You may need to click the
button next to it to see further options.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Manually mount the filesystem in read only mode.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Check to see if you have a mount point (folder for mounting your partition in) for your Windows partition in the folder <code>/media</code>
using this command:</p>

<p><code>ls /media</code></p></li>
<li><p>If you don't see a folder for your Windows partition, you should create one with the following command:</p>

<p><code>sudo mkdir /media/windows</code></p></li>
<li><p>Next, mount the partition in read-only mode onto this folder with this command:</p>

<p><code>mount -t ntfs-3g -o ro /dev/sda3 /media/windows</code></p>

<p>Note that you should change <code>/media/windows</code> if your mountpoint is called something else.</p></li>
<li>Now you will be able to view/open files on your Windows partition using any program in Ubuntu.  However you will not be able to write 
to the partition or modify any files as it is in read only mode.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If you need to mount the partition in read-write mode and are not
able to or willing to boot into Windows and shut it down completely
there is a third option.  However, it is not included here because it <strong>completely deletes</strong> <code>hiberfil.sys</code> and will cause you to lose all
unsaved information in the hibernated Windows programs.  The following is a quotation
from <code>man ntfs-3g</code> about the option that would be used to do this.</p>

<pre><code>remove_hiberfile
              Unlike in case of  read-only  mount,  the  read-write  mount  is
              denied  if  the  NTFS  volume is hibernated. One needs either to
              resume Windows and shutdown it  properly,  or  use  this  option
              which  will  remove  the  Windows hibernation file. Please note,
              this means that the saved Windows  session  will  be  completely
              lost. Use this option under your own responsibility.
</code></pre></li>

<h2>Solution (only for Windows 8 and 10):</h2>

<p>There is a new feature in Windows 8 called <a href=""http://www.typicaltips.com/2013/02/disable-fast-startup-in-windows-8.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Fast Startup</a>. If this feature is enabled (which it is by default), Windows 8 does not actually completely shutdown when you choose shutdown. Instead, it does a ""hybrid shutdown"". This is something like hibernating; it makes booting Windows 8 back up faster. So, you need to disable this feature to be able to shut it down properly, and be able to mount the Windows partitions. To do this, boot into your Windows 8 and:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: disabling Fast Startup will most likely make your Windows 8 take a longer time to boot. There are no ""exact"" numbers, but let's say that if it took you 10 seconds to boot into Windows 8, it will now take you 50 seconds after disabling this feature.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Control Panel</strong> in the small icons view and click on <strong>Power Options</strong>. (see <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/duyd8.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">screenshot 1</a>)</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Choose what the power buttons do</strong>. (see <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hkc2M.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">screenshot 2</a>)</li>

</ol>

<p>Click on <strong>Save changes</strong>. Now, shutdown Windows 8 and boot back into Ubuntu.</p>

<p>If you still aren't able to mount without getting errors, you may need to turn off hibernation completely. Open an elevated Command Prompt (right click on the shortcut, click on “Run as Administrator”), and input:</p>

","<p><em>From <a href=""http://www.serenux.com/2011/02/howto-monitor-the-progress-of-dd/"">HowTo: Monitor the progress of dd</a></em></p>

<p>You can monitor the progress of dd without halting it by using the <code>kill</code> command.</p>

<p>To see the progress of <code>dd</code> once it's running, open another terminal and enter: </p>

<pre><code>sudo kill -USR1 $(pgrep ^dd)
</code></pre>

<p>This will display <code>dd</code> progress in the <code>dd</code> terminal window without halting the process. If you're on BSD or OS X, use <code>INFO</code> instead of <code>USR1</code>. The <code>USR1</code> signal will terminate dd.</p>

<p>If you would like to get regular updates of the <code>dd</code> progress, then  enter:</p>

<pre><code>watch -n5 'sudo kill -USR1 $(pgrep ^dd)'
</code></pre>

<p><code>watch</code> will probe the <code>dd</code> process every -n seconds (<code>-n5</code> = 5 seconds) and report without halting it.</p>

Can any one please help me with some instructions? Thanks!</p>
","<h3>Using a PPA</h3>

<p>You can use <a href=""https://launchpad.net/~webupd8team/+archive/ubuntu/java"" rel=""noreferrer"">WebUpd8 PPA</a> (this will download the required files from Oracle and install JDK 8):</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/35629/33871"">Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some “red flags” to watch out for?</a></p>

<p>Also ensure your <code>JAVA_HOME</code> variable has been set to:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle
</code></pre>

<p>For this you can use the following command (see step 3 of Manual Install to see how to make it permanent):</p>

<pre><code>export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle
</code></pre>

<h3>Manual install</h3>

<p>The tar.gz provided by Oracle don't have an actual installation process. You just extract those files to a location you want and add them to your path. So the process is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download a <code>.tar.gz</code> from <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Oracle</a> (here I will be using <code>jdk-8u20-linux-x64.tar.gz</code>);</li>
<li>Extract it to somewhere;</li>
<li><p>Move the extracted folder to <code>/usr/lib/jvm</code>. This is not required but it is the place where Java runtime software is installed, and where tools like IDE's may search for it:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mv /path/to/jdk1.8.0_20 /usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Before addin this jdk as an alternative, you can see that the new alternative is not listed:</p>

<pre><code>sudo update-alternatives --query java

sudo update-alternatives --query javac
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Next, add the new jdk alternatives (2000 is the priority and feel free to pick a different number):</p>

<pre><code>sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8/jre/bin/java 2000

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8/bin/javac 2000
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Now you should see the new jdk listed and you can switch between the alternatives with this command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo update-alternatives --config java

sudo update-alternatives --config javac
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Create a file <code>/etc/profile.d/oraclejdk.sh</code> with the following content (adapt the paths to reflect the path where you stored your JDK):</p>

<pre><code>export J2SDKDIR=/usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8
export J2REDIR=/usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8/jre
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8/db/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8/jre/bin
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8
export DERBY_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8/db
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Done! Those paths will only be recognized after you logout or restart, so if you want to use them right away run <code>source /etc/profile.d/oraclejdk.sh</code>.</p>

","<h1>Customizing the <code>/etc/default/grub</code> file</h1>

<p>There are two ways of doing this using editing a grub file. These are described in the <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Configuring_GRUB_2"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ubuntu Community Documentation Grub2 page</a></p>

<p>The two ways are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Boot which ever operating system you booted last time, the ""saved method""

<ul>
<li>This is the one I use.  It lets me decide which one I going to use and will allow me to reboot into that system, handy when I'm updating.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Boot a specific operating system by default.

<ul>
<li>The answer to your exact question.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Finding the menuentry to set as the new default</h2>

<p>To start we need to find out what we are booting or want to boot. Open a terminal with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>t</kbd> and type in </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>grep menuentry /boot/grub/grub.cfg</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>user@YourComputer:~$ grep menuentry /boot/grub/grub.cfg
menuentry 'Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.35-31-generic' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {
menuentry 'Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.35-31-generic (recovery mode)' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {
menuentry 'Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.35-30-generic' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {
menuentry 'Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.35-30-generic (recovery mode)' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {
menuentry ""Memory test (memtest86+)"" {
menuentry ""Memory test (memtest86+, serial console 115200)"" {
menuentry ""Windows NT/2000/XP (loader) (on /dev/sda1)"" {
menuentry ""Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.32-34-generic (on /dev/sdb1)"" {
menuentry ""Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.32-34-generic (recovery mode) (on /dev/sdb1)"" {
menuentry ""Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.32-33-generic (on /dev/sdb1)"" {
menuentry ""Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.32-33-generic (recovery mode) (on /dev/sdb1)"" {
menuentry ""Windows Vista (loader) (on /dev/sdc1)"" {
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that the ""saved"" method can come in handy when booting multiple operating systems. Save the name of the entry you want e.g. <code>Windows NT/2000/XP (loader) (on /dev/sda1)</code>, we need it later.</p>

<h2>Editing the <code>/etc/default/grub</code> file</h2>

<p>Type in the terminal </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>sudo nano -B /etc/default/grub</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and your password if asked. The <a href=""https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/nano/"" rel=""noreferrer"">nano</a> editor will open.</p>

<p><strong>A. Saved method</strong> - In my preferred way, I made the following changes from the standard grub file.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I changed the value of <code>GRUB_DEFAULT</code> to <code>saved</code>:</p>

<pre><code>GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I enabled the <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Simple-configuration"" rel=""noreferrer"">SAVEDEFAULT functionality</a> by adding the following line:</p>

<pre><code>GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>B. Specific menuentry</strong> - In the way you are asking for </p>

<ul>
<li>Change the value of <code>GRUB_DEFAULT</code> to the name of the Windows system you want to always boot. The name of the corresponding Grub menuentry can be found as described in the previous section. </li>
<li><p>I wanted to have Window XP always set as default at boot, I would set <code>GRUB_DEFAULT</code> to <code>""Windows NT/2000/XP (loader) (on /dev/sda1)""</code>:</p>

<pre><code>GRUB_DEFAULT=""Windows NT/2000/XP (loader) (on /dev/sda1)""
</code></pre>

<p>Note: Some versions of Ubuntu require single quote (') vice double quote ("").</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You could also set <code>GRUB_DEFAULT</code> to the line number in the menu entry list (with 0 being the first), but when the kernel in Ubuntu is updated grub adds the new kernel to the top of the list, you would have to change the number, since Windows is the last one in the menu entry list.  You can see this in my menu entry list. </p>

<h2>Update the boot configuration</h2>

<p>Now you have to run </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>sudo update-grub</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>to update the system generated <code>grub.cfg</code> file in the <code>/boot/grub/</code> directory.</p>

<pre><code>user@YourComputer:~$ sudo update-grub

<h1>Addendum</h1>

<h2>Notes on nano</h2>

<p><code>nano</code> is especally easy to use in the terminal.  Move around with the arrow keys.  Type in you addtions, delete the unwanted.</p>

<p>The <code>-B</code> or <code>--backup</code> option backs up the previous version of it to the current filename suffixed with a <code>~</code>.  Very handy in case of the dreaded <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_error"" rel=""noreferrer"">Fat pfinger effect</a>.</p>

<p>When you are through, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd> will allow you to save your edits by hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> will close.  These and other options are shown at the bottom of the terminal screen with the <code>^</code> indicating <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>.</p>

<pre><code>^G Get Help    ^O WriteOut    ^R Read File   ^Y Prev Page   ^K Cut Text    ^C Cur Pos
^X Exit        ^J Justify     ^W Where Is    ^V Next Page   ^U UnCut Text  ^T To Spell
</code></pre>

<h2>Notes about nano, sudoeditor and other editors</h2>

<p>Some in the Ubuntu community suggest <code>sudoedit</code> instead of <code>nano</code>.  I recommend <code>nano</code> — which is the default sudoedit editor in later distributions of Ubuntu — instead of <code>sudoedit</code>, because the default can be overridden in non-obvious ways, unless you are an administrator.  <code>sudoedit</code> is safer in that it automatically saves a backup copy of the edited file, but the <code>-B</code> command line option in <code>nano</code> does the same thing.  <code>nano</code> is more intuitive than editors like <code>vi</code> or <code>emacs</code>, which are very flexible but require learning a lot of commands, shortcuts or different modes.</p>

<p>If you prefer not to use the <code>nano</code> editor and prefer the Gnome Text Editor, instead of <code>sudo nano -B</code> use <code>gksu gedit</code>.  I generally do this for large files, and <code>/etc/default/grub</code> could easily be considered a large file.  Thus type in <code>gksu gedit /etc/default/grub</code> instead of <code>sudo nano -B /etc/default/grub</code>.  Note that the Gnome text editor does <strong>not</strong> automatically make a backup! </p>

<h2>Notes on my grub file</h2>

<p>I made some changes to grub for my personal needs.  Such as the background picture of the moon launch.  How to do these are discussed at the <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ubuntu Community Documentation page on Grub2</a>, recommended.</p>

"Complete Installation Guide for Android SDK / ADT Bundle on Ubuntu","548944","","<p>What all needs to be done to install Android SDK / ADT Bundle on Ubuntu?</p>

<p>Each of the steps in the answer was found on some different forum as I encountered obstacles getting started with my Android SDK and posted questions in appropriate forums thereafter. So I thought this would be useful in that it is a one stop solution available, in case one ever needs to re-install Ubuntu and install the Android SDK / ADT Bundle from scratch!</p>
","<p><strong>Step 1</strong><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Check in System Settings -> Details, whether your Ubuntu is 32-bit or 64-bit<br></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(Using software centre or command lines) If your Ubuntu is a 32-bit OS then install <code>libgl1-mesa-dev</code>  </p>
    
    <p>In case of 64-bit OS install <code>ia32-libs</code> (Ubuntu 13.04 or earlier), or <code>libgl1-mesa-dev:i386</code> (Ubuntu 13.10 and above)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Install <code>openjdk-8-jdk</code>. If not compatible try <code>openjdk-7-jdk</code>, or if still not compatible <code>openjdk-6-jdk</code> </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Download the Android SDK command line tools <a href=""http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#download"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> (they're located at the bottom of the page) and unzip it to a place where you can leave it as long as you need the Android SDK, <code>/opt/</code> for instance.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Check that the unzipped ADT Bundle folder (or Android SDK folder, as the case may be) have the folders <code>tools</code> and <code>platform-tools</code>. If <code>platform-tools</code> folder is absent, you should be able to install it from the android virtual device manager, which can be run by typing the command</p>

<pre><code>   android
</code></pre>
    
    <p>in the terminal. These folders contain some important commands stored. Add them to your executable path. Adding them to the path can be done as follows:</p>
    
    <p>First execute <code>gedit ~/.pam_environment</code>. A file opens. Just add these lines to that file:</p>

<pre><code>   PATH DEFAULT=${PATH}:/path/to/tools
   PATH DEFAULT=${PATH}:/path/to/platform-tools
</code></pre>
    
    <p>Here you have to replace <code>/path/to/tools</code> and <code>/path/to/platform-tools</code> by the absolute paths according to where you unzipped the SDK or the ADT bundle download. Now all the commands <code>adb</code>, <code>android</code>, <code>emulator</code> etc can be simply executed in the terminal without giving absolute paths. That is, you will not get a ""command not found"" error if you gave it without its absolute path.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>Step 6</strong><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Type <code>android</code> into the terminal and, if <strong>Step 5</strong> was done correctly, the Android SDK Package Tool will start, where you can finish your installation.</p>

However, <code>/etc/bind</code> does not exist on the default installation of Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS server.</p>

<p>So, without installing any further software, how can configure DNS and remove dnsmasq on ubuntu server? I am quite familiar with <code>sudo</code> &amp; <code>nano</code>.</p>
","<p><strong>Set DNS Servers:</strong></p>

<p>You need to configure the /etc/network/interfaces file if you want to change your DNS server via the command line.  </p>

<p>It should look something like this: </p>

<pre><code># The loopback network interface  
auto lo  
iface lo inet loopback  


# The primary network interface  
auto eth0 
iface eth0 inet static  
address 192.168.X.X
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.X.X
dns-nameservers X.X.X.X

<p>If you have more than one DNS server, just add a space between each:</p>

<pre><code>dns-nameservers X.X.X.X Y.Y.Y.Y Z.Z.Z.Z
</code></pre>

<p>Just replace the Xs, Ys, and Zs with your own IPs of the DNS servers of choice, and when this is done, run this command to update the settings:</p>

<pre><code>sudo ifdown eth0 &amp;&amp; sudo ifup eth0

","<p>python 3.4 is installed on the stable release of Ubuntu 14.04. You need to use <code>python3</code> to use python 3.4. For example, to compile a script <code>file.py</code>, use:</p>

<pre><code>python3 file.py
</code></pre>

<p>This will use python 3.4 to interpret your program or you can use the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29"">shebang</a> to make it executable. The first line of your program should be:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3
</code></pre>

<p>and then use <code>chmod +x file.py</code> to assign executable permissions and then run your python script as <code>./file.py</code> which would use python3 to execute.</p>

<p>If you want python3 to be used when you type python on the terminal, you can use an alias. To add a new alias, open your <code>~/.bash_aliases</code> file using <code>gedit ~/.bash_aliases</code> and type the following:</p>

<pre><code>alias python=python3
</code></pre>

<p>and then save and exit and type</p>

<pre><code>source ~/.bash_aliases

</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>Then go to the <a href=""http://support.amd.com/en-us/download"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AMD website</a>, manually select the driver, and download. If you are unsure which driver to install then you could install the 'Driver detecting software' in your Windows OS and see the driver that you ought to install.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check the release notes and installer notes</strong> of whichever driver you are going to install without fail. See if your <strong>OS meets all the system requirements mentioned in the release notes.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Then <strong>follow the steps in the <a href=""http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/Catalyst-Linux-Installer-Notes.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">installer notes</a></strong> to install your driver.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>NOTE:</h2>

<p>1: If you installed the wrong driver(or made some other mistake with installing the driver), Unity might crash or you may get ""The system is running in low graphics mode"" problem (or some other issue). Whatever the problem is, you have to first delete the driver you installed. For this, start a tty session by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>. Then use this command :</p>

<pre><code>sudo aticonfig --uninstall
</code></pre>

<p>This should delete your driver. If not refer <a href=""http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/Catalyst-Linux-Installer-Notes.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> . Now use the command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo shutdown -r now
</code></pre>

<p>to reboot your system. This should help you to get back to unity without problems. Now you can again get to the AMD site, get a supported driver and install.</p>

<p>If this didn't solve your problem referring to these questions might be useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/162075/my-computer-boots-to-a-black-screen-what-options-do-i-have-to-fix-it"">My computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?</a></li>

<li><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/17381/unity-doesnt-load-no-launcher-no-dash-appears"">Unity doesn&#39;t load, no Launcher, no Dash appears</a></li>
</ul>

<p>2: Also if you don't know if your OS satisfies the system requirements of the driver mentioned in its release notes, then the following commands might help:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>uname -a</code> : will let you know about your Kernel </li>
<li><code>Xorg -version</code>  : will let you know about your Xorg</li>
<li><code>ldd --version</code>  : will let you know your glibc </li>
</ol>

<p>Also it is not necessary that your OS needs to specified in the release notes. Just see if you meet the system requirements and if your graphic card is mentioned in the release notes.</p>

<p>3: Make sure you update your OS before installing your graphics driver as stated above. While your OS might support your driver before updating, after your OS update it might not.</p>

<p>4: Also don't be startled if your driver installer appears like this (without any text):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8fSxy.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In this case see the installer notes and with the help of the screen shots provided there install your driver.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.:</strong></p>

<p>In my humble opinion, the default open source drivers serve all the normal needs of computing. So install the proprietary driver only if you really need it (like if you are a 'techy' gamer or something). Also, if you are trying to install your proprietary driver just to get your maximum screen resolution then you might refer to <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/448045/low-resolution-on-intel-g965-express/448113#448113"">this</a> answer.</p>

"How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)","511104","","<p>I installed Windows 7, which ate Ubuntu's boot file. When starting up the computer, it now goes straight to Windows, without giving me the option of booting Ubuntu. </p>

<p>How can I get Ubuntu back?</p>
","<p>When you install Windows, Windows assumes it is the only operating system (OS) on the machine, or at least it does not account for Linux. So it replaces GRUB with its own boot loader. What you have to do is replace the Windows boot loader with GRUB. I've seen various instructions for replacing GRUB by mucking around with GRUB commands or some such, but to me the easiest way is to simply <code>chroot</code> into your install and run <code>update-grub</code>. <code>chroot</code> is great because it allows you to work on your actual install, instead of trying to redirect things here and there. It is really clean.</p>

<p>Here's how:</p>

<ol>
<li>Boot from the live CD or live USB, in ""Try Ubuntu"" mode. </li>
<li><p>Determine the partition number of your main partition. <code>sudo fdisk -l</code>, <code>sudo blkid</code> or GParted (which should already be installed, by default, on the live session) can help you here. I'm going to assume in this answer that it's <code>/dev/sda2</code>, but <strong>make sure you use the correct partition number for your system!</strong></p>

<p><strong>If your main partition is in an LVM</strong>, the device will instead be located in <code>/dev/mapper/</code>, most likely, <code>/dev/mapper/{volume}--{os}-root</code> where <code>{volume}</code> is the LVM volume name and <code>{os}</code> is the operating system. Execute <code>ls /dev/mapper</code> for the exact name.</p></li>
<li><p>Mount your partition:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt  #Replace sda2 with the partition from step 2
</code></pre>

<p><strong>If you have a separate <code>/boot</code>, <code>/var</code> or <code>/usr</code> partitions</strong>, repeat steps 2 and 3 to mount these partitions to <code>/mnt/boot</code>, <code>/mnt/var</code> and <code>/mnt/usr</code> respectively. For example,</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount /dev/sdXW /mnt/boot
sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/var
sudo mount /dev/sdXZ /mnt/usr
</code></pre>

<p>replacing <code>sdXW</code>, <code>sdXY</code>, and <code>sdXZ</code> with the respective partition numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Bind mount some other necessary stuff:</p>

<pre><code>for i in /sys /proc /run /dev; do sudo mount --bind ""$i"" ""/mnt$i""; done
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If Ubuntu is installed in EFI mode (<a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/764702/13398"">see this answer if you're unsure</a>), use <code>sudo fdisk -l | grep -i efi</code> or GParted to find your EFI partition. It will have a label of <code>EFI</code>. Mount this partition, replacing <code>sdXY</code> with the actual partition number for your system:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/boot/efi
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>chroot</code> into your Ubuntu install:</p>

<pre><code>sudo chroot /mnt
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>At this point, you're in your install, not the live session, and running as root. Update grub:</p>

<pre><code>update-grub
</code></pre>

<p>If you get errors or if going up to step 7 didn't fix your problem, go to step 8. (Otherwise, it is optional.)</p></li>
<li><p>Depending on your situation, you might have to reinstall grub:</p>

<pre><code>grub-install /dev/sda
update-grub # In order to find and add windows to grub menu.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If Ubuntu is installed in EFI mode, and EFI partition UUID has changed, you may need to update it in <code>/etc/fstab</code>. Compare it:</p>

<pre><code>blkid | grep -i efi
grep -i efi /etc/fstab
</code></pre>

<p>If current EFI partition UUID (from <code>blkid</code>) differs from the one in <code>/etc/fstab</code>, update <code>/etc/fstab</code> with current UUID.</p></li>
<li><p>If everything worked without errors, then you're all set:</p>

<pre><code>exit
sudo reboot
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>At this point, you should be able to boot normally.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you cannot boot normally, and didn't do step 8 because there were no error messages, try again with step 8.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes giving GRUB2 the correct <em>configuration</em> for your partitions is not enough, and you must actually install it (or reinstall it) to the Master Boot Record, which step 8 does. Experience helping users in chat has shown that step 8 is sometimes necessary even when no error messages are shown.</li>

"How do I configure swappiness?","507078","","<p>I need a step-by-step, simple and easy way to configure swappiness.</p>
","<p>The Linux kernel provides a tweakable setting that controls how often the swap file is used, called swappiness</p>

<p>A swappiness setting of <strong>zero</strong> means that the disk will be avoided unless absolutely necessary (you run out of memory), while a swappiness setting of <strong>100</strong> means that programs will be swapped to disk almost instantly.</p>

<p>Ubuntu system comes with a default of 60, meaning that the swap file will be used fairly often if the memory usage is around half of my RAM. You can check your own system's swappiness value by running:</p>

<pre><code>one@onezero:~$ cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
60
</code></pre>

<p>As I have 4 GB of RAM, so I'd like to turn that down to 10 or 15. The swap file will then only be used when my RAM usage is around <strong>80</strong> or <strong>90</strong> percent. To change the system swappiness value, open <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> as <strong>root</strong>. Then, change or add this line to the file:</p>

<pre><code>vm.swappiness = 10
</code></pre>

<p>Reboot for the change to take effect</p>

<p>You can also change the value while your system is still running</p>

<pre><code>sysctl vm.swappiness=10
</code></pre>

<p>you can also clear your swap by running <code>swapoff -a</code> and then <code>swapon -a</code> as root instead of rebooting to achieve the same effect.</p>

<p>To calculate your swap Formula  </p>

<pre><code>free -m (total) / 100 = A

A * 10

root@onezero:/home/one# free -m
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          3950       2262       1687          0        407        952
-/+ buffers/cache:        903       3047
Swap:         1953          0       1953
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>so total is 3950 / 100 = 39.5 * 10 = 395</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so what it mean is that when <strong>10 %</strong> 395 MB of ram left then it start using swapiness</p>

<h2>                                           <strong>What is swappiness</strong></h2>

<p>The swappiness parameter controls the tendency of the kernel to move processes out of physical memory and onto the swap disk. Because disks are much slower than RAM, this can lead to slower response times for system and applications if processes are too aggressively moved out of memory.</p>

<p><strong>.</strong>     swappiness can have a value of between 0 and 100</p>

<p><strong>.</strong>     swappiness=0 : Version 3.5 and over: disables swapiness. Prior to 3.5: tells the kernel to avoid swapping processes out of physical memory for as long as possible.</p>

<p><strong>.</strong>     swappiness=1 : Version 3.5 and over: Minimum swappiness without disabling it entirely</p>

<p><strong>.</strong>     swappiness=100 tells the kernel to aggressively swap processes out of physical memory and move them to swap cache</p>

<p>See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swappiness"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swappiness</a></p>

<p>The default setting in Ubuntu is swappiness=60. Reducing the default value of swappiness will probably improve overall performance for a typical Ubuntu desktop installation. A value of swappiness=10 is recommended, but feel free to experiment. </p>

<p>Is there something else that I have to do like reload the file some how?</p>
","<p>You should <strong>never</strong> save the file with its contents starting with <code>-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----</code> on the server, that is your <strong>private</strong> key. Instead, you must put the <strong>public</strong> key into the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file.</p>

<p>This <strong>public</strong> key has the <code>.pub</code> extension when generated using <code>ssh-keygen</code> and its contents begin with <code>ssh-rsa AAAAB3</code>. (The binary format is described in the answers to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/12749858/427545"">this question</a>).</p>

<p>The permissions of <code>~/.ssh</code> on the server should be 700. The file <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> (on the server) is supposed to have a mode of 600. The permissions of the (private) key on the client-side should be 600.</p>

<p>If the private key was not protected with a password, and you put it on the server, I recommend you to generate a new one:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa

<p>You can skip this if you're fully sure that nobody can recover the deleted private key from the server.</p>

<p>If this does not help, run <code>ssh</code> with options for more verbosity:</p>

<p>I think resolv.conf is actually used indirectly, because the network manager creates the server that listens on 127.0.0.1, but I was told that this is an implementation detail that should not be counted on.  I think that if you enter DNS addresses before this entry, they might get used, but I'm not sure exactly how this works.

<li><p>In the screen that follows, an image is shown with 2 parts and each part is shown to have size equal to 80GB. There is a horizontal slider in the middle of these two images, with which I can resize the partitions. The right side partition is labeled Linux.
There is also an option to do 'advanced partitions'.</p></li>
<li><p>On clicking advanced partitions on the above screen, a new screen is shown in which the partitions existing in my computer are shown - but the labels are different. I see that there are two partitions with size = 160GB each (as expected), and so I assumed that the first 160GB would be my existing C drive and the second on would be the partition which I had labeled as linux (drive D). So I selected the linux partition and clicked on proceed/ install now, and then this error was shown -
""No root file system defined"".. and I cannot proceed after this.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Please let me know two things here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>During the screen in point number 3 above, the image with slider was shown. Which partition (drive c: or d: or anyother) is being referred to here? Which one am I actually resizing - is it the existing c: drive which has windows 7 installed already, that is getting shrunk and then ubuntu getting installed in the remaining space?</p></li>
<li><p>What does """"No root file system defined"" error mean? How do I select the proper partition and continue with the installation? </p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong>:</p>

<p>I had already partitioned my drives as mentioned above, and the D drive with 160GB was specifically left free for installing ubuntu. I would like to Select D drive during setup and install ubuntu here, while still keeping the already installed windows7 in C drive.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>To answer your first question, the partition proposed to be split on the first screen was your windows partition.  Since you already have created a partition for Ubuntu, you don't want to do that.</p>

<p>You say that you selected the partition on the advanced screen, but simply clicking on it does nothing; you need to click on the edit button and assign the partition a filesystem type ( use ext4 ) and mount point.</p>

<p>The error is because you did not assign any filesystem to be mounted in the root directory ( / ) and therefore, there is nowhere to install to.</p>

","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/69"" rel=""noreferrer"">an article on debian-administration.org</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the dependencies have changed on one of the packages you have installed so that a new package must be installed to perform the upgrade then that will be listed as ""kept-back"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Cautious solution:</strong></p>

<p>The cautious solution is to run <code>sudo apt-get install &lt;list of packages kept back&gt;</code>. In most cases this will give the kept-back packages what they need to successfully upgrade.</p>

<p><strong>Aggressive solution:</strong></p>

<p>A more aggressive solution is to run <code>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</code>, which will force the installation of those new dependencies. </p>

<p>But <code>dist-upgrade</code> <strong>can be quite dangerous</strong>. <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/194651/why-use-apt-get-upgrade-instead-of-apt-get-dist-upgrade"">Unlike upgrade</a> it may <em>remove</em> packages to resolve complex dependency situations. Unlike you, APT isn't always smart enough to know whether these additions and removals could wreak havoc. </p>

<p>So if you find yourself in a place where the ""cautious solution"" doesn't work, <code>dist-upgrade</code> <em>may</em> work... but you're probably better off learning a bit more about APT and resolving the dependency issues ""by hand"" by installing and removing packages on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Think of it like fixing a car... if you have time and are handy with a wrench, you'll get some peace of mind by reading up and doing the repair yourself. If you're feeling lucky, you can drop your car off with your cousin <code>dist-upgrade</code> and hope she knows her stuff.</p>

<ul>
<li>just one program stops responding?</li>
<li>nothing at all responds to mouse clicks or key presses?</li>
<li>the mouse stops moving entirely?</li>
<li>I have an <a href=""https://ark.intel.com/products/codename/55844/Bay-Trail#@nofilter"" rel=""noreferrer"">Intel Bay Trail CPU?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In what order should I try various solutions before deciding to pull the power plug?</p>

<p>What should I do when starting up Ubuntu fails?  Is there a diagnostic procedure I can follow?</p>
","<h2>When a single program stops working:</h2>

<p>When a program window stops responding, you can usually stop it by clicking the X-shaped close button at the top left of the window. That will generally result in a dialog box saying that the program is not responding (but you already knew that) and presenting you with the option to kill the program or to continue to wait for it to respond. </p>

<p>Sometimes this does not work as expected. If you can't close a window by normal means, you can hit <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd>, type <code>xkill</code>, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Your mouse cursor will then turn into an <strong>X</strong>. Hover over the offending window and left-click to kill it. Right clicking will cancel and return your mouse to normal.</p>

<p>If your program is running from a terminal, on the other hand, you can usually halt it with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>. If not, <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/180336/"">find the name and process ID of its command</a>, and tell the program to end as soon as possible with <code>kill [process ID here]</code>. It sends the default signal <code>SIGTERM</code> (<code>15</code>). If all else fails, as a last resort send <code>SIGKILL</code> (<code>9</code>): <code>kill -9 [process ID here]</code>. Note that you should only use <code>SIGKILL</code> as a last resort, because the process will be terminated immediately by the kernel with no opportunity for cleanup. It does not even get the signal - it just stops to exist.  </p>

<p>(Killing a process by <code>kill -9</code> allways works if you have the permission to kill. In some special cases the process is still listed by <code>ps</code> or <code>top</code> (as ""zombie"") - in this case, the program was killed, but the process table entry is kept, becuse it's needed later.)</p>

<h2>When the mouse stops working:</h2>

<p>If the keyboard still works, press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd> and run <code>gnome-terminal</code> (or, if these fail to launch, press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> and login with your <em>username</em> and <em>password</em>). From there you can troubleshoot things. I'm not going to get into mouse troubleshooting here, as I haven't researched it. If you just want to try restarting the GUI, run <code>sudo service lightdm restart</code>. This should bring down the GUI, which will then attempt to respawn, bringing you back to the login screen.</p>

<h2>When you have an Intel Bay Trail CPU</h2>

<p>See <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/803649/225694"">https://askubuntu.com/a/803649/225694</a>.</p>

<h2>When everything, keys and mouse and all, stop working:</h2>

<p>First try the Magic SysReq method outlined in <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/36717/6969"">Phoenix' answer</a>. If that doesn't work, press the <strong>Reset</strong> button on the computer case. If even that doesn't work, you'll just have to <em>power-cycle</em> the machine.<br>

"How to find the Process ID (PID) of a running terminal program?","483185","","<p>I am running a program in the terminal that I can't escape with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd> and that I want to kill. How can I find its PID?</p>
","<p>Open another terminal and run <code>ps ax  | grep foo</code> where foo is the name of the unresponsive program. This should return a line of output  that looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ ps ax | grep firefox
2222 ?        S      0:00 /bin/sh /usr/lib/firefox-3.6.9/firefox
2231 ?        Sl   514:36 /usr/lib/firefox-3.6.9/firefox-bin
30290 pts/2    S+     0:00 grep --color=auto firefox
</code></pre>

<p>The first field of each line of output is a number which represents the Process ID of the program matched by <code>grep</code> (you can safely ignore the last one, which represents <code>grep</code> itself. </p>

<p>To halt the offending process, do:
<code>kill pid</code> where pid is the Process ID of the program. You might have to use your judgment as to which of the matches needs to be <code>kill</code>ed, or you could use <code>top</code> instead. Using <code>kill</code> by itself sends SIGTERM, which you should try first as it allows the program to properly clean up after itself. If SIGTERM fails, try SIGHUP, which is stonger medicine: <code>kill -HUP pid</code>. If all else fails, send SIGKILL. But, you should only do so as a last resort, because SIGKILL causes the kernel to terminate the process immediately with no possibility for cleanup. This can at times result in data corruption or other problems. So again, only send SIGKILL as a last resort. To do so, do <code>kill -KILL pid</code> or <code>kill -9 pid</code>.</p>

<p>If you are running a graphical interface, of course, you don't have to fool with this crazy command-line stuff to get the job done. Just open ""System Monitor"", navigate to the Processes tab, choose the process you want to halt (Hm, could it be the one using 90% CPU?) and right-click it. Since the process is already stopped, (that's the problem, right?) choose End Process or Kill Process from the resulting menu.</p>

<p>Each of the issues described (and maybe even more) can be fixed by following the steps below.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>If you're installing Ubuntu, follow section 3.</strong></p>

<hr>

<h1>1. First make sure you can enter a TTY</h1>

<p>Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>  </p>

<p>If this brings you to a black screen with a login prompt, continue on. Otherwise, you will likely have to boot with a special kernel flag. Instructions are below.</p>

<hr>

<h1>2. Now for the fix</h1>

<ol>
<li>Log into your account in the TTY.</li>
<li>Run <code>sudo apt-get purge nvidia-*</code></li>
<li>Run <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa</code> and then <code>sudo apt-get update</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>sudo apt-get install nvidia-375</code>.</li>
<li>Reboot and your graphics issue should be fixed.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h1>3. If you are unable to enter a TTY or are trying to install Ubuntu</h1>

<ol>
<li>Reboot into GRUB.</li>
<li>Highlight the <code>Ubuntu</code> option and press <kbd>E</kbd>.</li>
<li>Add <code>nouveau.modeset=0</code> to the end of the line beginning with <code>linux</code>.</li>
<li>Press <kbd>F10</kbd> to boot.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions above. 

<ul>
<li>(If installing Ubuntu, ignore this step, but follow the rest of the tutorial after the installation is finished.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>This solution should fix many problems described by users after an upgrade to 16.04. If a fresh install is affected, the solution is the same.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you run into problems afterward, you should ask a different question. (Refer to this question so that we know it isn't a duplicate.) However, there are a few other small fixes you can try out before you do.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Reinstall Xorg</p>

<ul>
<li>Go back into the TTY and run <code>sudo apt-get purge xorg-* xserver-xorg; sudo apt-get install xorg xserver-xorg; sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reinstall your desktop environment</p>

<ul>
<li>If on Unity, run <code>sudo apt-get purge ubuntu-desktop; sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop</code>.</li>
<li>If on GNOME run <code>sudo apt-get purge ubuntu-gnome-desktop gnome-desktop-environment; sudo apt-get install ubuntu-gnome-desktop</code>.</li>
<li>If on MATE run <code>sudo apt-get purge ubuntu-mate-desktop mate-desktop-environment; sudo apt-get install ubuntu-mate-desktop</code></li>
<li>Each Ubuntu DE has its own package name. If you have KDE or something else, the name should be similar to the ones above.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fresh reinstall

<ul>
<li>It's not the most inviting option, but sometimes it's the best thing to do in cases like this.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Please remember that there are a lot of things that can go wrong, and this <strong><em>is not</em></strong> a guaranteed fix for everything. Even if you are experiencing something listed in the question, the solution may not fully work for you.</p>

<p>This answer is merely for driver issues with 16.04 and nVIDIA. Your issue may go deeper than a bad driver.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm using the 3.0.0-14-generic kernel.</p>
","<p>You've a lot unused kernels. Remove all but the last kernels with:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get purge linux-image-{3.0.0-12,2.6.3{1-21,2-25,8-{1[012],8}}}
</code></pre>

<p>This is shorthand for:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.0.0-12 linux-image-2.6.31-21 linux-image-2.6.32-25 linux-image-2.6.38-10 linux-image-2.6.38-11 linux-image-2.6.38-12 linux-image-2.6.38-8

<p>Removing the <code>linux-image-x.x.x-x</code> package will also remove <code>linux-image-x.x.x-x-generic</code>.</p>

<p>The headers are installed into <code>/usr/src</code> and are used when building out-tree kernel modules (like the proprietary nvidia driver and virtualbox). Most users should remove these header packages if the matching kernel package (<code>linux-image-*</code>) is not installed.</p>

<p>To list all installed kernels, run:</p>

<pre><code>dpkg -l linux-image-\* | grep ^ii
</code></pre>

<p>One command to show all kernels and headers that can be removed, excluding the <strong>current</strong> running kernel:</p>

<pre><code>kernelver=$(uname -r | sed -r 's/-[a-z]+//')
dpkg -l linux-{image,headers}-""[0-9]*"" | awk '/ii/{print $2}' | grep -ve $kernelver
</code></pre>

<p>It selects all packages named starting with <code>linux-headers-&lt;some number&gt;</code> or <code>linux-image-&lt;some number&gt;</code>, prints the package names for installed packages and then excludes the <strong>current loaded/running kernel</strong> (not necessarily the <strong>latest</strong> kernel!). This fits in the recommendation of testing a newer kernel before removing older, known-to-work kernels.</p>

<p>So, after upgrading kernels and rebooting to test it, you can remove all other kernels with:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get purge $(dpkg -l linux-{image,headers}-""[0-9]*"" | awk '/ii/{print $2}' | grep -ve ""$(uname -r | sed -r 's/-[a-z]+//')"")

","<p>The <a href=""https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/#/create-a-docker-group"" rel=""noreferrer"">docker manual</a> has this to say about it: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Giving non-root access</strong></p>
  
  <p>The docker daemon always runs as the root user, and since Docker version 0.5.2, the docker daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a TCP port. By default that Unix socket is owned by the user root, and so, by default, you can access it with sudo.</p>
  
  <p>Starting in version 0.5.3, if you (or your Docker installer) create a Unix group called docker and add users to it, then the docker daemon will make the ownership of the Unix socket read/writable by the docker group when the daemon starts. The docker daemon must always run as the root user, but if you run the docker client as a user in the docker group then you don't need to add sudo to all the client commands. As of 0.9.0, you can specify that a group other than docker should own the Unix socket with the -G option.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Warning: The docker group (or the group specified with -G) is root-equivalent; see <a href=""https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#/docker-daemon-attack-surface"" rel=""noreferrer"">Docker Daemon Attack Surface details</a> and this blogpost on <a href=""https://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2015/08/why-we-dont-let-non-root-users-run-docker-in-centos-fedora-or-rhel/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Why we don't let non-root users run Docker in CentOS, Fedora, or RHEL </a></strong> (thanks michael-n).</p>

"How do I change my username?","455937","","<p>Some time ago when I installed Ubuntu I chose a rather stupid username for my account that I do not want to use anymore. </p>

<p>How do I change this (including the name of my home directory, and the name in the terminal) without loosing settings for applications?<br>
How do I keep permissions and my keys for various authentification (e.g. email, SSH, GPG and more)?<br>
What settings could possibly get lost if I changed my username?</p>
","<p>Unix-like operating systems decouple the user name from the user identity, so you may safely change the name without affecting the ID. All permissions, files, etc are tied to your identity (uid), not your username.</p>

<p>To manage every aspect of the user database, you use the <code>usermod</code> tool.</p>

<p>To change username (it is probably best to do this without being logged in): </p>

<pre><code>sudo usermod -l newUsername oldUsername
</code></pre>

<p>This however, doesn't rename the home folder. </p>

<p>To change home-folder, use </p>

<pre><code>usermod -d /home/newHomeDir -m newUsername
</code></pre>

<p>after you changed the username.</p>

<p>For instance, you could logout, drop to a console (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>), and <code>sudo su -</code> to become true root (as opposed to <code>sudo -s</code>, where $HOME is still /home/yourname.) Maybe you also have to kill some still running processes from this user first. To do so, enter <code>ps -u username</code>, look for the matching PID and kill them by <code>kill PID-number</code>.</p>

<p>Update: as arrange mentioned, some files may reference your old home directory. You can either keep a symlink for backward compatibility, e g <code>ln -s /home/newname /home/oldname</code> or you can change the file contents with <code>sed -i.bak 's/*oldname*/*newname*/g' *list of files*</code> It creates a backup for each file with a .bak extension.</p>

<p>Some additional information for not so experienced users like me:<br>
As I only have ONE user account (administrator), it would not let me change the username (""you are already logged in"" was the response in TTY1 (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>). To get around this:</p>

"How can I dual-boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu on a UEFI HP notebook?","447553","","<p>I've got an HP Pavilion Touchsmart notebook that came with Windows 8. I've upgraded to 8.1, and now I want to dual-boot an Ubuntu distribution with Windows 10. When dual-booting with Windows 8.1, the Windows Boot Manager always took priority, even after installing GRUB. What do I need to do to get GRUB to be the default bootloader instead of Windows Boot Manager?</p>
","<p>This is the longest post I've ever made on a StackExchange site, but this process requires a lot of explanation and attention to detail. It's also somewhat specific to the hardware in question, which requires more explanation. </p>

<p>After a lot of headache, two accidental hard drive reformattings, and lots of frustration with HP's buggy firmware implementation, I finally got Xubuntu and Windows 10 running nicely side-by-side. I've done this with Windows 10, but it should also work with Windows 8.1. Both of these newer operating systems use the new(ish) UEFI firmware system, instead of the traditional BIOS system, which is where most confusions with dual-booting seem to arise. I read lots of things from lots of places with instructions for dual-booting with a BIOS system, that talk about UEFI as if it's just a different kind of BIOS, or an optional layer between BIOS and an OS. UEFI and BIOS are not the same thing; a UEFI is not a BIOS, and a BIOS is not a UEFI. They're completely different. There are some things that need to be done differently when dual-booting with a UEFI system.</p>

<p>Firstly, <strong>do not use EasyBCD</strong>. I've seen a lot of <strong>outdated</strong> dual-booting tutorials that recommend EasyBCD, but it is designed to work with traditional BIOS firmware used by Windows 7 and Windows Vista, and it does not work well with newer UEFI firmware (Windows 8, 8.1, or 10). If you have already fiddled with EasyBCD, don't worry- the worst it probably did is make a mess in your EFI boot entries by writing things to the MBR. We'll clean that up in step 4. Speaking of MBR, avoid that like the plague. The Master Boot Record is what's used in traditional BIOS firmware as a list of bootloaders stored in the boot partition (or, if written by Windows, in whichever partition is first) of your hard drive. It's meant to list the operating systems on the hard drive, and tell the firmware which one gets booted first. This does not work well with HP's UEFI firmware. It seems that if there's any MBR modification done, HP's UEFI firmware gets confused and runs back to the Windows Boot Manager, which will completely bypass GRUB.</p>

<p>What you'll need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A live USB or installation CD with your preferred Ubuntu distribution.</li>
<li>Installation media for your Windows OS. If you're upgrading from Windows 8.1, you can do it without downloading the full 3+ GB .iso for Windows 10- there is a web installer that downloads it as it installs- but, for this method, you need the .iso extracted to a CD or USB drive. It's also a good idea to have it on hand for the future, so you might as well create it now. Since this question is about dual-booting with a UEFI system, you'll need <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO"">the 64-bit OS.</a>

<ul>
<li>Make sure you have your Product Key, or you won't be able to upgrade/install.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Optional, but <strong>highly recommended</strong>: A drive large enough to back up your current Windows files.</li>
<li>Enough space on your hard drive for both operating systems, a boot partition (only 200 MB), and a linux-swap partition (usually the same size as your physical RAM).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Make a backup</h2>

<p>Back up all of your Windows files and folders that you don't want to lose. As long as you have enough free hard drive space for your new Ubuntu partition, this process should not interfere with Windows files. <em>Should</em> is a risky word, though.</p>

<p>Windows 8.1 has a ""make a recovery disk"" tool, but I found it useless and non-functional when it came to restoring the backup I made with it. The most straightforward way to preserve the files you don't want to lose is to just open Windows Explorer, and copy them to a backup disk. It takes forever, but it's worth it.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Disable Fast Startup, and shut down your computer</h2>

<p><em>You'll need to be logged in as an administrator to do this.</em></p>

<p>It's very important to disable Fast Startup before installing GRUB, because whether the Ubuntu installer can detect Windows' presence depends on how Windows represents itself in the boot partition. With Fast Startup properly disabled, it should be detected. Detection will be covered in step 4.</p>

<p>Windows 8, 8.1, and 10 use this fancy new thing called Fast Startup, which tells your firmware to load a special bootloader that restores the system to its pre-shutdown state very quickly. Pretty cool, huh? Well, because it changes the EFI system's next-boot option, this feature will have to be disabled while you're installing GRUB. This can be done by doing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open Control Panel (Windows+X->Control Panel from the desktop in Windows 8+)</li>
<li>Navigate to Power Options</li>
<li>Click ""Choose what the power button does""</li>
<li>Click ""Change settings that are currently unavailable""</li>
<li>Make sure the box that says ""Turn on fast startup (Recommended)"" at the bottom is <strong>not</strong> checked.</li>
</ol>

<p>More detailed instructions can be found <a href=""http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-disable-or-enable-fast-startup-in-windows-8-1/"">here</a>. You can re-enable Fast Startup after installing GRUB, and it seems not to cause any problems with Ubuntu/GRUB booting. Just make sure it's disabled during the installation.</p>

<p>After you've disabled Fast Startup, shut down your computer. Since Fast Startup is disabled, Windows will do a complete shutdown, and not change the next-boot option in the firmware's EFI manager. (Layman's terms: Windows won't tell your HP system to boot its Fast Startup file when it's next turned on, so it will use the EFI boot manager's list, as it should. GRUB will place itself first on this list.)</p>

<h2>Step 3: Set up the partitions with gparted</h2>

<p>Before installing Ubuntu, you'll want to use your live CD/USB to make a separate partition for it. That way, it *won't overwrite Windows.</p>

<p>*Make sure you've got a backup. No guarantees- this depends on what Windows has decided to do in your boot partition, and it may also depend on which Ubuntu version/distribution you're using- I haven't used them all.</p>

<p>To make the partitions, you need to boot to your live CD/USB, and open gparted. There are plenty of tutorials on using gparted, and it's pretty easy to figure out, so I'll leave the specifics up to you and the Internet.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You will need 4 partitions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A boot partition. If you already have Windows installed, you shouldn't need to do anything- it should already be one of the first partitions in your drive. Sometimes Windows also makes another small partition at the beginning of the disk called <em>Recovery</em>. Just leave this alone.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you're doing a new installation, and you want to start everything from scratch (<strong>this will wipe out all of your data</strong>), go ahead and delete all of the partitions on your drive, and then make this partition. It should be the <strong>first partition</strong>; its format should be <strong>FAT32</strong>; and it should be <strong>at least 200 MB</strong> in size. If gparted has an option to label it, just call it <code>boot</code>. If there's not label option, don't worry about it. You <strong>must</strong>, however, set the ""boot"" and ""esp"" flags on this partition ; without them, the Ubuntu installer will just ignore it and use a legacy mode install, and Windows (10) will refuse to install altogether with the error ""we couldn't create a new partition or locate an existing one"". Or not. It seems to depend on how Windows feels that day...</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A Windows partition. Again, if you already have Windows installed, this partition should obviously be here, after the boot and Recovery partitions. This is where you want it, but you need to resize it to make room for your Ubuntu partition, and the linux-swap partition. Use gparted's resize/move option to do this. Ubuntu needs at least 5 GB, and the linux-swap partition should be at least half the size of your physical RAM, so Resize the windows partition to make enough room for that. gparted will warn you about potential data loss- shrinking your partition should not destroy or corrupt any data, as long as you don't shrink it down into the space being used.</p>

<ul>
<li>If installing both operating systems from scratch (<strong>again, this will wipe out all of your data</strong>), <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications#sysreqs"">Microsoft says</a> you'll need at least 20 GB for the 64-bit OS, so this partition needs to be <strong>at least 20 GB</strong>. You'll probably want more than that, though: I just used half of the space after the boot partition for Windows, and half of it for Ubuntu and linux-swap. If you're going from scratch, this partition needs to be formatted as <strong>FAT32</strong>. When you install Windows, it will format it to NTFS. Do not do this with gparted; Windows' implementation of NTFS is different than gparted's implementation, and Windows may not be able to recognize the partition. In the Windows 10 installer, you should have the option to select which partition to place Windows 10 on. If it's formatted as FAT32, Windows should be able to see it and install itself there. If you can label this partition, label it <code>Windows</code>. That will make it easier for you during the Windows install. Speaking of the Windows installer- don't begin that yet. If you're doing new installations of both Ubuntu and Windows at the same time, instead of upgrading from 8 or 8.1 to 10, it's <em>much</em> easier to <strong>install Ubuntu first</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A Linux partition. Like the Windows partition, this can vary in size, but <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements"">Ubuntu's website</a> recommends <strong>at least 5 GB</strong>. Again, you'll probably want a lot more than that. If you're upgrading instead of doing a fresh install of both operating systems, you should be able to create this partition in the new ""unallocated"" space shown in gparted. Make it as big as you like but remember to <strong>leave space for a linux-swap partition</strong> if you plan on using one. It should be formatted as ext4. ext2 or ext3 should work too, if you prefer those for some reason.

<ul>
<li>If installing from scratch, make your Ubuntu partition just as described above. Make sure it's formatted as <strong>ext4, ext3, or ext2</strong>. This will allow Ubuntu to use it, but keep the Windows 10 installer from recognizing it, which should cause it to default to the FAT32 partition you made in step 3, which it can read.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Optional, but recommended: a <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq"">linux-swap partition</a>. <strong>At least half the size of your physical RAM</strong> is a good start, but I recommend reading <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq"">the details</a>. I've got 8 GB of RAM, and a 1TB hard drive, so I just made this partition the same size as my physical RAM.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 4: Install Ubuntu first</h2>

<p>Whether you're upgrading to Windows 10 from an existing Windows OS, or installing both Windows 10 and an Ubuntu distribution to a new or newly-repartitioned hard drive, it's a lot easier to install Ubuntu first. Ubuntu uses GRUB 2 as its bootloader, which does things the way an EFI bootloader should. Windows 10 uses Windows Boot Manager, which does things... well, the way Windows does them... If you install Windows first, you likely won't be able to boot to Ubuntu without holding down a special key during the boot process to stop the Windows Boot Manager from loading, because Windows Boot Manager doesn't respect GRUB when it's added to its list of bootloaders. So instead, install Ubuntu and GRUB first, then add an entry to GRUB for the Windows Boot Manager.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4.1: Cleaning out old EFI entries (optional)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Please be careful here. Deleting the wrong thing can cause huge problems.</strong></p>

<p>Before installing Ubuntu, we want to make sure that the ghosts of past OS installations aren't going to come back to haunt us in the future. In a UEFI system, operating systems use EFI (extensible firmware interface) files to tell the firmware: ""Hey, I exist. This is where you can find me."" When a new OS is installed, it adds an entry to the EFI Boot Manager's list, which gives it a unique entry number, and tells the EFI Boot Manager where it's EFI file(s) is/are (Windows registers several different EFI files- one for regular boot, one for a recovery boot, one for Fast Startup- possibly more depending on your firmware and your OS version). The EFI Boot Manager also keeps track of the boot-order: a list of entry numbers that specify what gets booted first. If you've been using EasyBCD; bcdedit; Windows' Boot Repair or Recovery tools; boot-repair in a Linux OS; or even if you've updated Windows or reinstalled it, there's a good chance that your EFI entry list now has some duplicates. At least, that was the case with mine. Having duplicates here can bog down your booting process, as the firmware sifts through the out-of-date or wrong-file entries until it finds a bootloader that works. It can also cause a boot-loop, where bootloader A points the firmware to bootloader B, which points it back to A, and then things start to take a very, very long time...</p>

<p>Anyway, to view your EFI entry list and see what needs to be cleaned, use the <code>efibootmgr</code> package with your live CD/USB. You'll need to install it using <code>sudo apt-get install efibootmgr</code> in a terminal, then run it using <code>sudo efibootmgr</code>. By default, you'll get a list of entries that looks something like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Q8Kg.png""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Q8Kg.png"" alt=""Picture of EFI Boot Manager entry list from the output of efibootmgr""></a></p>

<p>When I first used this tool after fiddling with EasyBCD and bcdedit trying to get things to boot in the right order, I had over a hundred entries here, most of them duplicates.</p>

<p><strong><em>If your boot manager list isn't too cluttered, or if you're not comfortable deciding what can be deleted and what shouldn't be deleted, just skip to step 4.2.</em></strong></p>

<p>To clean out any entries you don't need, use <code>efibootmgr -b &lt;hex_number&gt; -B</code>, where <code>hex_number</code> is replaced by the number listed with the boot entry. So, to remove the <code>USB Drive (UEFI)</code> entry (numbered Boot<strong>2001</strong>) in the picture above, I'd use <code>sudo efibootmgr -b 2001 -B</code>. You'll notice that I left some duplicates (all of the 3000+ numbered entries). You can use <code>efibootmgr</code> with different options to view some other attributes of the entries, such as the file paths they point to. Those entries look like duplicates, but they all point to different files used by my HP laptop to update its BIOS. <strong>Please be careful what you remove. It can be very difficult or impossible to replace things here.</strong> You can also use efibootmgr to change the BootOrder, which it displays. See <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/8/efibootmgr"">the man page</a> for more information on this useful tool.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4.2: Installing Ubuntu</strong></p>

<p>After you've cleaned up the EFI Boot Manager entries, if you chose to do so, it's finally time to install Ubuntu. With your live CD/USB loaded, select the install option from the bootloader menu, or launch it from the desktop after logging in. Choose your options on the first page of the installer. The second part will look something like this: (I'm using Xubuntu 14.04, so your installer may vary, but the options should be pretty similar.)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/y5Aex.png""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/y5Aex.png"" alt=""Screenshot of Xubuntu 14.04 install options""></a></p>

<p>If your installer doesn't detect your Windows installation (like mine), you'll need to select the ""Something else"" option. From there, you'll get a screen that looks similar to the gparted menu you used to set up your partitions. Simply select the partitions you made, and assign them to the correct mount point by selecting a partition and clicking ""Change"".</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>If you're installing both OSes from scratch, do the same thing. Do not use the automatic installation option.</strong> You need to make sure Ubuntu gets installed in the ext2/ext3/ext4 partition, <strong>not</strong> the FAT32 Windows partition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 5: Update or install Windows second</h2>

<p>You should have an installation disk for Windows 10. Before you start installing, make sure you have your product key nearby, or you won't be able to install/upgrade. When you boot to the installation CD/USB, the installer is pretty simple. A bit too simple for my comfort- the only button was ""Install Windows 10"" or something like that, and Windows 8, 8.1, and 10, are infamous for their behind-the-scenes installs, where it simply says ""We're getting things ready"", and provides no details about what it's actually doing to your system. If you've followed these instructions so far, it should be OK to begin installation regularly.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you're upgrading from Windows 8 or Windows 8.1, you shouldn't have to do anything special with the installation process. Get through the (very long) installation, and proceed to step 6.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're doing a fresh install, the installer will ask you where you want to install Windows 10. Make sure you select the FAT32 partition you made in step 2, and not another partition, or that partition will be wiped and formatted. Because Ubuntu is already installed, Windows 10 should be respectful of the boot partition and not reformat it. Having the rubbish entries cleaned out of the EFI Boot Manager's list will also free up space in the tiny 200 MB boot partition, lessening the chances that Windows will get confused and angry and clear the whole thing for itself.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 6: Update and (optionally) customize GRUB</h2>

<p>After installing or upgrading to Windows 10, you'll need to reboot to Ubuntu to update GRUB so it includes Windows Boot Manager on its list. <strong>Before you do this, disable Fast Startup again.</strong> This is done very similarly to how you did it in step 2. The control panel and settings UI are a bit different, but most of the options are still there.</p>

<p>After you've disabled Fast Startup again, reboot your computer.</p>

<p>If Windows boots by default, you will need to hold down the special key for your laptop to get to the system's firmware menu. On my HP Touchsmart, that key is Esc. Other common keys are F12, Delete, F10... Your computer's manual should be able to help you out here. From the firmware menu, boot into GRUB. There should be an option to ""select a boot device"" or something similar, and Ubuntu or GRUB should be listed there. If it's not listed, look for an option to boot from an EFI file, and browse to /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi or (if you have Secure Boot enabled), EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi instead. The actual paths of these files may vary depending on your options, and how your boot partition is set up, but the file names should be the same. Selecting one of these .efi files should boot to GRUB, where you can then boot to your Ubuntu distribution. Once you've logged in, open a terminal and type <code>sudo update-grub</code>. This will run the os-prober script that GRUB uses to compile grub.cfg, which tells grub's EFI file which entries to include, what colors to use, etc. The os-prober script should identify Windows Boot Manager, and automatically add it to the list.</p>

<p>Optionally, you can install Grub Customizer to change the order of menu entries and change the behavior and the color and background of the GRUB menu. You can install this from a terminal using <code>sudo apt-get install grub-customizer</code>, and then run <code>sudo grub-customizer</code>.</p>

<p><strong>When using GRUB on a UEFI system shared with a Windows OS, DO NOT install to MBR.</strong> Some tutorials list it as a crucial step to use Grub Customizer's ""Install to MBR"" option under the File menu. You should <em>not</em> do this on most UEFI systems. The MBR (Master Boot Record) is designed for BIOS firmwares, and is still used by the Windows Boot Loader to some extent. Adding GRUB to the MBR, when it's already in the EFI entry list, can cause lots of hairballs.
If you need to make sure that GRUB is the first entry in the boot-order list (i.e. if Windows is always booting, even though you did everything right), use <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/8/efibootmgr"">efibootmgr</a> (see step 4.1) to view/edit the EFI Manager's boot order.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>I haven't mentioned <strong>Secure Boot</strong> at all, because it should normally not affect Ubuntu's installation. Many dual-booting tutorials talk about disabling it, but that's usually not necessary with a current 64-bit installer. However, each PC is different, and Secure Boot is fairly new (2012), so different firmwares may implement things differently. For example, the version of my HP firmware includes a ""legacy boot"" option, which disables Secure Boot and treats installed OSes as though it were BIOS firmware: some people recommend enabling this for installing for dual-boot. Installing Ubuntu in legacy boot mode on my system prevented GRUB from adding itself to the EFI entry list, so all it could do was add itself to the MBR, which Windows Boot Manager had full control of. Windows Boot Manager took a lot of tweaking to even display the list of entries, and after all that, it would only boot the Windows entries, making GRUB unusable without manually selecting its EFI file every time I powered on.</p>

<p>See <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI#SecureBoot"">here</a> for more information on Ubuntu and Secure Boot and Legacy Boot, and information about the difference between UEFI and BIOS installations in general.</p>

<p><code>avconv</code> is introduced:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make a copy of ffmpeg under a new name -- avconv.</p>
  
  <p>It will be further developed with a few incompatible changes.</p>
  
  <p>ffmpeg.c will stay as is for some time, so any scripts using it won't be

<h2>Official announcements on libav.org</h2>

<p>The following posts are from the news section (with the oldest in last):</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>August 09 2011</h1>
  
  <p><strong>Updated on 12.09.2011.</strong></p>
  
  <p>For consistency with our new name we have renamed <strong>ffplay</strong> to <strong>avplay</strong>,
  <strong>ffserver</strong> to <strong>avserver</strong> and <strong>ffprobe</strong> to <strong>avprobe</strong>. Their behavior is the
  same, just the names were changed.</p>
  
  <p>With <strong>ffmpeg</strong> (the command line tool) we decided to use this opportunity
  to fix some longstanding usability problems, which involves breaking
  compatibility. Therefore we have added a new tool named <strong>avconv</strong> which
  is based on <strong>ffmpeg</strong>, but has a different (hopefully more powerful and
  easier to use) syntax for some options. <strong>ffmpeg</strong> will be kept in its
  current state for some time, so no scripts or frontends using it will
  break. However it will not be developed further.</p>
  
  <p>Differences between <strong>avconv</strong> and <strong>ffmpeg</strong> are:</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>Note that the <strong>avconv</strong> interface is not considered stable yet. More
  incompatible changes may come in the following weeks. We will announce
  here when <strong>avconv</strong> is stable.</p>

"How to control fan speed?","435798","","<p>How can I control the computer's fan speed?</p>

<p>On Windows there is a wonderful program called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpeedFan"">SpeedFan</a>.</p>
","<h2>Note before starting:</h2>

<p>This functionality depends on both your hardware and software. If your hardware doesn't support fan speed controls, or doesn't show them to the OS, it is very likely that you could not use this solution. If it does, but the software (aka kernel) doesn't know how to control it, you are without luck.</p>

<ol>
<li>In terminal type <code>sudo sensors-detect</code> and answer YES to all YES/no questions.</li>
<li>At the end of sensors-detect, a list of modules that need to be loaded will be displayed. Type ""yes"" to have sensors-detect insert those modules into /etc/modules, or edit /etc/modules yourself. </li>
<li>Run <code>sudo service module-init-tools restart</code>. This will read the changes you made to <code>/etc/modules</code> in step 3, and insert the new modules into the kernel.

<ul>

"Sudoers file, enable NOPASSWD for user, all commands","435682","","<h3>Preface</h3>

<p>This is a fairly complex question related to the Sudoers file and the sudo command in general.</p>

<p>NOTE: I have made these changes on a dedicated machine running Ubuntu Desktop 13.04, that I use purely for learning purposes. I understand it's a huge security risk to enable NOPASSWD sudo.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>

<p>Initially, my only change to the sudoers file (/etc/sudoers) was one line, a user specification that should have enabled 'nicholsonjf' to run all commands with sudo without having to enter a password (see the line that starts with 'nicholsonjf'):</p>

<pre><code># This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
#
# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of
# directly modifying this file.
#
# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.
#
Defaults        env_reset
Defaults        mail_badpass
Defaults        secure_path=""/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin""

# Host alias specification

# User alias specification

# Cmnd alias specification

# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
nicholsonjf    ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL

# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# See sudoers(5) for more information on ""#include"" directives:

#includedir /etc/sudoers.d
</code></pre>

<p>However, this did not work, and I was still prompted for my password every time I ran a command as 'nicholsonjf'. I was only able to start running sudo commands as 'nicholsonjf' once I removed 'nicholsonjf' from the sudo and admin groups. </p>

<p>Can anyone explain why this worked?</p>

<p>Is it because the user 'nicholsonjf' was inheriting sudo rights from the two group specifications of 'admin' and 'sudo' (seen below in the sudoers file), which were overriding the 'nicholsonjf' user specification because they were further down in the config file?</p>
","<p>Your added line was overridden. From <code>man sudoers</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When multiple entries match for a user, they are applied in order. 
  Where there are multiple matches, the last match is used (which is not
  necessarily the most specific match).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In your case <code>nicholsonjf</code> was a member of group <code>sudo</code> so for him this line applied:</p>

<pre><code>%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to override entries in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> just put the new entries after them.</p>

"How to install skype in ubuntu 16.04","435172","","<p>How to install skype in ubuntu 16.04?
Please provide step by step process for installation.</p>
","<p>tl;dr
If canonical partners have been enabled</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install skypeforlinux
</code></pre>

<h1>Requirements</h1>

<p>Skype is available via the Partner repositories in Ubuntu 16.04 - so please check if you have them enabled in the first step.</p>

<p>To enable the partner repositories:</p>

<ul>
<li>through the GUI, you have to launch <strong>Software &amp; Updates</strong> (<code>software-properties-gtk</code>), navigate to the <strong>Other software</strong> tab and activate <strong>Canonical Partners</strong> there. </li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PT8pA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PT8pA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<ul>
<li>through the terminal check out <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/14629/how-do-i-enable-the-partner-repository"">this answer</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Install Skype</h1>

<p>If you have the partner repositories enabled you can simply install by</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install skypeforlinux
</code></pre>

<p>In Lubuntu you will need to install pulseaudio in order to get the sound working (do an echo test).
Ubuntu and Mate (and probably Gnome) should be OK.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install pulseaudio
</code></pre>

<h1>Query available package version (optional)</h1>

<p>Right now  Ubuntu offers Skype 4.3.0.37 as you can see here</p>

<pre><code>apt-cache policy skype
</code></pre>

<p>outputs</p>

<pre><code>skype:
  Installed: (none)

Are there any commands to install an application?</p>

<p><strong><em>For beginning Windows users visiting this question: <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/575161/344926"">click here!</a></em></strong></p>
","<p>You can install applications different ways.  Terminal, the Ubuntu Software Center, and Synaptic.  </p>

<p>With the Ubuntu Software Center, you just open it from the Launcher, and search for the application that you want.</p>

<p>If you know the right commands to install via terminal, then you'd just press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, you can run the command(s) needed to install the application.</p>

<p>For synaptic, it has to be installed on you system.  To install it, just press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install synaptic
</code></pre>

<p>Once installed, you can open it, and search for the application that you want to install, and just mark it for installation.</p>

<p>Also in some cases, you have to download either a .deb file in case of your question about Chrome, and have to manually install it, or a .tar.gz file, and that also have to done manually.</p>

<p>Now as far as Chrome is concerned, you can install it by downloading the .deb file, or just press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:</p>

<p>For 32bit</p>

<pre><code>wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_i386.deb
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_i386.deb

<p>For 64bit</p>

<pre><code>wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
</code></pre>

<p>If you encounter any error during the installation, when its done do</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get -f install
</code></pre>

<p>For pros and cons of the different ways to install see this <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/224609/should-i-install-programs-from-a-source-tarball-tar-gz-from-the-ubuntu-sof"">Post</a>.</p>

<h1>Addition</h1>

<h2>Installing software in Ubuntu can be done several ways:</h2>

<h3>Ubuntu Software Center</h3>

<p>You can search for an application, or go through the categories:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/l89tM.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h3>Synaptic Package Manager</h3>

<p>You can search for an application, or go through the categories:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Psbc.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h3>Installing via Terminal</h3>

<p>Installing from terminal can be done in several ways:</p>

<p>APT
You can search for an application.  The command to search for software is:</p>

<pre><code>apt-cache search &lt;application_name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Adding Repositories:</p>

<p>Edit the sources list file, and add</p>

<pre><code>sudo -H gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
</code></pre>

<p>Or add from terminal</p>

<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository &lt;repository_name&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install &lt;application_name&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Others ways you can install</h3>

<p>Manual download of a .deb (Debian package):</p>

<ul>
<li>Once downloaded, you can double-click on the package to have it open in the Software Center, from where you can install it.</li>
<li><p>Or, just press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, navigate to the download location, and run the command(s) below:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg -i &lt;package_name&gt;.deb
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Other options: .rpm and .tar.gz</p>

<p>.rpm
These files are packaged for Fedora or Mandriva, but you can use alien (you can install using Synaptic) that allows you to convert .rpm files to .deb. (may not work all the time)</p>

<p>.tar.gz 
The .tar.gz file is compressed. If you see the .tar.gz, it could be compressed files that have a pre-compiled binary file, or files that have the source code allowing you to compile the application from source.  To find out how to install from a .tar.gz, see <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/25961/how-to-install-a-tar-gz-or-tar-bz2-file"">How to install from a .tar.gz</a>.</p>

","<p>No. I think you pretty much found the easiest way to recover from the state of your system using <strong>grub rescue</strong>; it is a very minimalistic system giving just enough capability to boot the system.</p>

"How can I edit/create new launcher items in Unity by hand?","426664","","<p>Will Unity allow making custom launcher icons from <code>.desktop</code> files or via menu editing system? (Right now the launcher doesn't give the option to ""keep in launcher"" on all programs.</p>

<p>For some programs I use, I have to make custom launchers or <code>.desktop</code> files.</p>

<p>For instance, daily blender builds are generally just folders with an executable.</p>

<p>In basic Gnome or KDE, I can make a new menu entry with the menu editing system. Then, I can also add it to Docky either from the menu or by dragging a <code>.desktop</code> file to it. Unity launcher doesn't support drag and drop, so thats not a bug or anything, but when I open a <code>.desktop</code> file, it has unpredictable results. Most time it will not have ""keep in launcher"". Sometime it will have a pinnable item without the <code>.desktop</code>'s icon, and if I pin the item to the launcher, it will not call upon the program again after closing it. I've also gotten it to just work with a <code>.desktop</code> file for <code>celtx</code>.</p>
","<h3>For 11.04 and earlier:</h3>

<p>Unity does support custom launchers from .desktop files. To create custom launcher from a <code>.desktop</code> file you need to create a <code>*.desktop</code> file for your program.</p>

<pre><code>gedit ~/.local/share/applications/name.desktop

<p>The <code>.desktop</code> file should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[Desktop Entry]

Exec=command to run
Icon=icon name
Terminal=false
Type=Application
StartupNotify=true

<pre><code>.gconf-&gt; desktop-&gt; unity-&gt; launcher -&gt; favourites
</code></pre>

<p>you'll see a bunch of folders starting with ""<code>app-</code>"".
you need to create a folder for your program. Use the same name.desktop you used in <code>/usr/share/applications</code>. Go into 1 of the folders for something that is already on the dock &amp; copy the xml file and paste that into your new folder. Open it with your text editor and change the name of the <code>*.desktop</code> to your <em>name</em><code>.desktop</code>.</p>

<p>Open gconf-editor (you can open gconf by running the command <strong><code>gconf-editor</code></strong> in the Terminal) &amp; go to:</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Why you need to install gdebi instead of using dpkg or Ubuntu software center.</strong></p>

<p><strong>dpkg</strong> (for Debian package) is a software tool from the command line is responsible for installing, creating, deleting, and managing Debian (packets deb), the type of packets processed by Ubuntu. It also allows the Debian package management from sources outside the apt repositories.</p>

<p>To install packages, <code>dpkg</code> has a graphical interface, <code>gdebi</code> , you can use if you prefer to avoid the command line.</p>

<p><strong>gdebi</strong> is an application installation and management of Debian (.deb) packages. This is a utility that works both in graphic mode console and allow the installation of packages outside of APT deposits : from a website, CD-ROM, portable media, etc. 
It has the same functionality as <code>apt-get</code> or <code>Ubuntu Software Center</code> : it ensures that the package to be installed is compatible with the version and architecture of the Ubuntu system in which you try to install it, and also ensures that all dependencies required by the package are satisfied. Otherwise, the dependencies are downloaded from the Internet. Using tabs, <code>gdebi</code> also provides access to important information such as folder paths in which to install the various files from .deb package.</p>

<p>Finally <code>gdebi</code> is a lightweight deb packages installer which was the default in Ubuntu Desktop. Now Ubuntu uses Ubuntu Software Center which is slow and sometimes you get <code>The package is of bad quality</code> error.
<hr></p>

<h3>Read more about <code>GDebi</code>:</h3>

<p>To install a package you have downloaded from a website, rather than from a software repository. These packages are called .deb files. Because they may have been created for a different Linux distribution, you might find that there's dependency issues with Ubuntu, meaning that they may be uninstallable.</p>

<p><code>gdebi</code> is a simple tool to install .deb files. It has a graphical user interface but can also be used in your terminal. It lets you install local deb packages <strong>resolving and installing its dependencies.. It automatically checks packages for their dependencies and will try to download them from the Ubuntu software repositories if possible</strong>. You may first need to install <code>gdebi</code> - simply install the <code>gdebi</code> package using one of the package managers like <code>dkpg</code>, <code>Synaptic</code> or open a Terminal and type <code>sudo apt-get install gdebi</code>.
Once you have installed <code>gdebi</code>, use the File Browser to find the package you want to install.</p>

<p>Double-click the package to open it with <code>gdebi</code>. If all dependencies have been met for the selected package, simply click the <code>Install package</code> button to install it. <code>gdebi</code> <strong>will warn you if there are unmet dependencies, which means that there's dependencies that aren't resolved in the repositories that you're using.</strong></p>

<p>I tried with using <code>gksudo terminal</code> and <code>gksu terminal</code> but nothing happens. and by running <code>sudo terminal</code> I get error <code>sudo: terminal: command not found</code>.</p>
","<p>The default terminal emulator on Ubuntu is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal"" rel=""noreferrer"">GNOME Terminal</a>. It's located at <code>/usr/bin/gnome-terminal</code> and can be run with the <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/gnome-terminal.1.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>gnome-terminal</code></a> command.</p>

<h1>What You Really Want</h1>

<p>What you probably want is a shell running as root, as though it were produced from a root login (for example, with all the environment variables set for root rather than for your user).</p>

<p>Assuming that's what you want, as <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/515198/run-terminal-as-root-user#comment698070_515198"">steeldriver has suggested</a>, just run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo -i
</code></pre>

<p>You'll have a root shell in which commands you enter will be run as root (without having to precede them with <code>sudo</code>).</p>

<p><em>But if you really want to run the graphical terminal emulator application as root, read on. I present two ways: with <code>gksu</code>/<code>gksdo</code>, and with the <code>sudo</code> command.</em></p>

<h1>With <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/gksu.1.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>gksu</code>/<code>gksudo</code></a></h1>

<p>Since you have the <a href=""https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/gksu"" rel=""noreferrer"">gksu <img src=""https://hostmar.co/software-small"" alt=""Install gksu""></a> package installed, you can run <code>gnome-terminal</code> as root with either of:</p>

<pre><code>gksu gnome-terminal
</code></pre>

<pre><code>gksudo gnome-terminal</code></pre>

<p>(Since <code>gksu</code> is set to sudo-mode in Ubuntu by default, these should be equivalent.)</p>

<h3>Running <code>gnome-terminal</code> as root without a controlling non-root terminal:</h3>

<p>Virtually every desktop environment provides a facility to run a command without having to open a terminal (which would then, if closed, usually cause the command to be terminated).</p>

<p>This is usually achieved with <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd>. A textbox labeled <em>Run command</em> (or similar) will appear and you can enter your command.</p>

<p>For example, it looks like this in Unity:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FM1sC.png"" alt=""Run a command textbox in Unity""></p>

<p>And like this in MATE (GNOME Flashback/Fallback, Xfce, LXDE are similar):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JyVJh.png"" alt=""Run Command dialog box in MATE""></p>

<p>Note that <em>this works with <code>gksu</code> and <code>gksudo</code> because they use a graphical authentication dialog.</em> If you were to press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd> and run <code>sudo ...</code>, you would then be unable to interact with the password prompt.</p>

<h1>With <code>sudo</code></h1>

<p>If you don't have the gksu package and you won't want to install it, you can use:</p>

<pre><code>sudo -H gnome-terminal
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>-H</code> flag is important because it sets the <code>HOME</code> environment variable to <code>/root</code> instead of your own user's home directory. You should <em>not</em> use <code>sudo gnome-terminal</code> as it can break the gnome-terminal configuration belonging to the non-root user. For more information about this, see:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo"" rel=""noreferrer"">RootSudo on the Ubuntu help wiki</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/270006/why-user-should-never-use-normal-sudo-to-start-graphical-application"">Why should users never use normal sudo to start graphical applications?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>(<code>sudo -i gnome-terminal</code> is also okay.)</p>

<h3>Getting rid of the controlling non-root terminal:</h3>

<p>If you <em>(1)</em> open a graphical terminal, <em>(2)</em> run something like <code>sudo -H gnome-terminal</code> in it, to create a new graphical root terminal, and <em>(3)</em> quit the original non-root graphical terminal ...then the root graphical terminal quits as well.</p>

<p>This is because the root graphical terminal is sent <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Termination-Signals.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">SIGHUP</a> when the terminal that owns it is exited.</p>

<p>To prevent this, you might think you could instead launch the graphical root terminal with:</p>

<pre><code>sudo -H gnome-terminal <strong>&</strong></code></pre>

<p>But this will only work if <code>sudo</code> doesn't have to prompt for a password. If it does, you won't see the password prompt.</p>

<p><strong><em>One way</em></strong> to work around this is to use:</p>

<pre><code>sudo -v
sudo -H gnome-terminal
</code></pre>

<p><code>sudo -v</code> exists for just this purpose. As explained in <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/man8/sudo.8.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>man sudo</code></a>, it ""update[s] the user's cached credentials, authenticating the user if necessary.""</p>

<p><sup>Note that this will still not work if run directly from your desktop environment's <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd> ""run command"" box, because you still need a terminal to enter your password for <code>sudo -v</code>.</sup></p>

<p><strong><em>Or</em></strong> you can do it in what might be called the traditional way, by <strong><em>suspending the job after it starts:</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Run <code>sudo -H gnome-terminal</code> from the original non-root graphical terminal.</li>
<li>Enter your password as prompted by <code>sudo</code>. The graphical terminal will start.</li>
<li><em>Still in the non-root terminal</em>, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> to suspend the root terminal. While the root terminal is suspended, you can't use it; its interface will not respond to your actions.</li>
<li>Quit the controlling non-root terminal with <code>exit</code>. The graphical root terminal job will be both unsuspended and disowned by the non-root terminal, automatically.</li>
</ol>

<p>In short:</p>

<pre><code>sudo -H gnome-terminal
^Z
exit
</code></pre>

<p>But suppose you wanted to keep using the original, non-root terminal too. Then you could run <code>bg <strong><em>N</em></strong></code>, where <strong><em><code>N</code></em></strong> is the graphical root terminal's job number, to resume the job in the background. You can run <code>jobs</code> to find <strong><em><code>N</code></em></strong> but you probably won't have to--that number was shown as <code>[<strong><em>N</em></strong>]</code> when you pressed <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>ek@Ilex:~$ sudo -H gnome-terminal
[sudo] password for ek: 
^Z
[<strong><em>1</em></strong>]+  Stopped                 sudo -H gnome-terminal

I am currently running the i386 on an amd machine, would my system work better with the amd64 download instead? (my machine was running Windows 7 64bit, but I neglected to look at that prior to installing Ubuntu).  </p>
","<p>i386 refers to the 32-bit edition and amd64 (or x86_64) refers to the 64-bit edition for Intel and AMD processors.</p>

<p>Wikipedia's i386 entry:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Intel 80386, also known as the i386, or just 386, was a 32-bit microprocessor introduced by Intel in 1985... This is termed x86, IA-32, or the i386-architecture, depending on context.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikipedia's x86_64 entry:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>x86-64 is an extension of the x86 instruction set. It supports vastly larger virtual and physical address spaces than are possible on x86, thereby allowing programmers to conveniently work with much larger data sets... After launching the architecture under the ""x86-64"" name, AMD renamed it AMD64... x86-64 is still used by many in the industry as a vendor-neutral term, while others, notably Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation) and Microsoft, use x64.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if you have an intel CPU, you should use AMD64 to install 64-bit on your computer (it uses the same instruction sets).</p>

<p>I highly recommend using it. For the most part you will not notice a difference but for large workloads (such as video editing, gaming, etc), the computer will perform faster (the computer has the ability to calculate 2+2+2=6 instead of having to do 2+2=4+2=6 in an example). In the Windows world, a 32-bit OS will not let you use more than 3.5 Gigs of RAM on your computer (even if you have 8!). You'd need to use a 64-bit OS in order to fully use all RAM. For Linux, however, there's no such limit (thanks, Uri).</p>

<p>Regardless, the world has shifted from 32 bit and it's only there to support older machines that are incapable of running 64 bit.</p>

"SSH Public Key - No supported authentication methods available (server sent public key)","419604","","<p>I have a 12.10 server setup in a virtual machine with its network set to bridged (essentially will be seen as a computer connected to my switch).</p>

"What are Unity's keyboard and mouse shortcuts?","415448","","<p>In Unity, are there any pre-defined shortcuts, e.g. to open the dash or unhide the launcher?</p>
","<p>This page will document the keyboard shortcuts and mouse tricks for Unity. Please feel free to add more!</p>

<p>Read this first to get familiar with the UI elements of Unity and to find the right keys on your keyboard:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/10228/whats-the-right-terminology-for-unitys-ui-elements"">Unity Terminology</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/19558/what-are-the-meta-super-and-hyper-"">What are the meta, super, and hyper keys?</a></li>
</ol>

<h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>

<p>Holding down the <kbd>Super</kbd> key will get you a keyboard overlay that documents most of these.</p>

<h3>Launcher</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Hold <kbd>Super</kbd> - Invoke the Launcher and display the shortcuts</p></li>
<li><p>Hold <kbd>Super</kbd>, then press <kbd>1</kbd> or <kbd>2</kbd> or <kbd>3</kbd> and so on until <kbd>0</kbd> to open or focus an application. The number corresponds to the location of the icon on the launcher from top to bottom.</p>

<ul>
<li>Adding <kbd>Shift</kbd> will open a new instance of the application if it's already open.</li>
<li>Holding the key is also useful when you want to get to the Launcher but do not want to invoke the Dash.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> - Open the rubbish bin/trash can.</li>
<li><kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F1</kbd> - Put keyboard focus on the Launcher, use arrow keys to navigate, <kbd>Enter</kbd> launches an application, Right arrow exposes the quicklists if an application has them.</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> - Launch a terminal window.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dash</h3>

<ul>
<li>Tap <kbd>Alt</kbd> - Opens <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/98132/what-is-the-unity-hud-and-how-can-i-install-it-on-my-system"">the HUD</a></li>
<li>Hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> - Reveals application menu</li>
<li><p>Tap <kbd>Super</kbd> - Opens the Dash. The open signal is sent when you let go of the key, not when you push it down, so if it feels slow just let go of the key earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>Over an item, you can hit the <kbd>Secondary</kbd> key (commonly to the left of the right <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>) to see a preview of the item, as you can do with a secondary click over it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot)</strong></p>

<pre><code> * &lt;kbd&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt; Move to the next lens (When the dash is open)
 * &lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt;-&lt;kbd&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt; Move to the previous lens (when the dash is open)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Ubuntu 12.04+</strong></p>

<pre><code> * &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;-&lt;kbd&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt; Move to the next lens (When the dash is open)
 * &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;-&lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt;-&lt;kbd&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt; Move to the previous lens (when the dash is open)
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd> - Invoke the Dash in a ""special mode"" to run a command. Typing in a folder name will find that folder in Nautilus, you can also use ~ as a shortcut in the field.</li>
<li>The Dash opens with focus on the search box to find applications and files. Using the arrow keys will navigate the results, use <kbd>Enter</kbd> to launch. Hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> twice in rapid succession after a search term will automatically launch the first match in a search, even if it's still ongoing. (Basically a dash version of ""I'm feeling lucky"").</li>
<li><kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> - Open Applications lens</li>
<li><kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> - Open Files &amp; Folders lens</li>
<li><kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> - Open the music lens</li>
<li><kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> - Open the video lens</li>
</ul>

<h3>Panel</h3>

<ul>
<li><kbd>F10</kbd> (11.10 and earlier) / <kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>F10</kbd> (12.04 and earlier) - Open the first menu on the panel, use the arrows keys to ""scrub"" across the menus. (There is no shortcut for the session menu, so hitting <kbd>F10</kbd> and left arrow is a quick way to get there)</li>
<li>Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close the menus without choosing anything.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Window Management</h3>

<ul>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> - Show desktop; hitting it again restores the windows.</li>
<li><kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd> -  Spread mode, zoom out on all windows in all workspaces, in 12.04 and 12.10 it zooms out on the windows in the current workspace.

<ul>
<li>In Spread mode of 14.04 <kbd>↑</kbd> + <kbd>↓</kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd> + <kbd>→</kbd> navigates through windows, <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F4</kbd> closes selected window, <kbd>typing any text</kbd> filters windows (for example typing ""terminal"" leaves only terminal windows), <kbd>Enter</kbd> restores selected window, <kbd>Esc</kbd> exits Spread mode</li>
</ul></li>
<li><kbd>Super</kbd>-<kbd>D</kbd> - Minimize all windows; hitting it again restores them.</li>
<li><kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> - Opens the window's accessibility menu.</li>
<li><kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> - Switch to other applications, you can hold Alt down and then hit tab to switch to the next application.</li>
<li><kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd> - Switch between an application's windows. Hitting this combo when you're already focused on an application will automatically switch only between the windows for that application. The <kbd>`</kbd> key on US layouts, but Unity will use whichever key is above your Tab key. (<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/jv5vy/ubuntu_1110_so_far_screenshot_tour_by_jono_bacon/c2fk1bs"" rel=""noreferrer"">More information</a>) (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/whiprush69#p/a/u/2/XHFNnygpvcM"" rel=""noreferrer"">Video</a>)</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>↑</kbd> - Maximize the current window</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>↓</kbd> - Restore/Minimize the current window (seems to be buggy at the moment)</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd> - Maximize current window to the left</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>→</kbd> - Maximize current window to the right</li>
</ul>

<h3>Window Placement</h3>

<p>If you cycle through the same key Unity will cycle through different placement widths, so experiment by hitting the numkey multiple times, for example <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + numpad <kbd>5</kbd> +  <kbd>5</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd>:</p>

<ul>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Numpad 7</kbd> - Place window in top left corner of screen.</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Numpad 8</kbd> - Place window in top half of screen.</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Numpad 9</kbd> - Place window in top right corner of screen.</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Numpad 5</kbd> - Center/Maximize the window in the middle of the screen. In 12.04 this toggles between maximize and restore state</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Numpad 1</kbd> - Place window in the bottom left corner of the screen.</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Numpad 2</kbd> - Place window in the bottom half of the screen.</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Numpad 3</kbd> - Place window in the bottom right corner of the screen.</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Numpad 0</kbd> - Minimize the current window (Ubuntu 12.04.1).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Workspace Management</h3>

<ul>
<li><kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> - Expo mode (for everything), zooms out on all the workspaces and lets you manage windows.</li>
<li><kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>↑</kbd> - Expo mode for all windows in the current workspace only.</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd> / <kbd>→</kbd> / <kbd>↑</kbd> / <kbd>↓</kbd> - (11.10+) - Change to a new workspace.</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd> / <kbd>→</kbd> / <kbd>↑</kbd> / <kbd>↓</kbd> - Place window to a new workspace.</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> - Lock the screen.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Screenshots</h3>

<ul>
<li><kbd>PrtScn</kbd> - Take a screenshot of the current workspace</li>
<li><kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>PrtScn</kbd> - Take a screenshot of the current window</li>
<li><kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>PrtScn</kbd> - Take a screenshot of a region traced by the mouse (shows crosshairs)</li>
</ul>

<h3>System</h3>

<ul>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Del</kbd> - Logout</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mouse Tricks</h2>

<h3>Launcher</h3>

<ul>
<li>Clicking and holding an icon and then dragging it around will allow you to reorder it on the launcher. You can also drag it off to the right of the launcher to move it around. Note that you need to make an explicit movement to the right to move the icon off the launcher before you can move it around.</li>
<li>Dragging and dropping an icon into the trash can will remove it from the Launcher. The program itself will remain installed and accessible through the dash.</li>
<li>Scrolling the mouse wheel while over the Launcher scrolls the icons if you have too many and need to move around quickly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Window Management</h3>

<ul>
<li>Maximizing - Dragging a window to the top panel, or double-clicking a window's titlebar, or <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F10</kbd> (11.10 and earlier), will maximize it.</li>
<li>Restore - There are two ways to restore, or unmaximize, the topmost maximized window of the current monitor for this workspace (not using the window controls)

<ul>
<li>Double clicking on the top panel (but not in the application's menu)</li>
<li>Dragging the top panel down.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Middle click on Maximize - Maximize window vertically.</li>
<li>Right click on Maximize - Maximize window horizontally</li>
<li>Focus the topmost maximized window of the current monitor for this workspace: Left click on the top panel (but not in the application's menu)</li>
<li>Tiling - Dragging a window to the left/right border will auto tile it to that side of the screen.</li>
<li>Middle click on an application's launcher icon - Open a new instance of the application in a new window. If the application isn't running it will just open it normally.</li>
<li>Middle click on the top panel or window title bar (but not the menu) - send the current window behind all other windows.</li>
<li><kbd>Alt</kbd>-Left drag inside a window - move the window</li>
<li><kbd>Alt</kbd>-Middle drag inside a window close to its border - resize the window</li>
<li><kbd>Alt</kbd>-Right click inside a window - window accessibility menu</li>
</ul>

<p>However, this code does what I want:</p>

<pre><code>sed -i 's/QQ/ZZ/g' $file
</code></pre>

<p>How do I use variables in <code>sed</code>?</p>
","<p>The shell is responsible for expanding variables. When you use single quotes for strings, its contents will be treated literally, so <code>sed</code> now tries to replace every occurrence of the literal <code>$var1</code> by <code>ZZ</code>.</p>

<h3>Using double quotes</h3>

<p>Use double quotes to make the shell expand variables while preserving whitespace:</p>

<pre><code>sed -i ""s/$var1/ZZ/g"" ""$file""
</code></pre>

<p>When you require the quote character in the replacement string, you have to precede it with a backslash which will be interpreted by the shell. In the following example, the string <code>quote me</code> will be replaced by <code>""quote me""</code> (the character <code>&amp;</code> is interpreted by <code>sed</code>):</p>

<pre><code>sed -i ""s/quote me/\""&amp;\""/"" ""$file""
</code></pre>

<h3>Using single quotes</h3>

<p>If you've a lot shell meta-characters, consider using single quotes for the pattern, and double quotes for the variable:</p>

<pre><code>sed -i 's,'""$pattern""',Say hurrah to &amp;: \0/,' ""$file""
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how I use <code>s,pattern,replacement,</code> instead of <code>s/pattern/replacement/</code>, I did it to avoid interference with the <code>/</code> in <code>\0/</code>.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The shell then runs the above command <code>sed</code> with the next arguments (assuming <code>pattern=bert</code> and <code>file=text.txt</code>):</p>

<pre><code>-i
s,bert,Say hurrah to &amp;: \0/,
text.txt

open-source implementation of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Standard_Edition"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Java SE</a> Platform (6 and 7). This is
the default version of Java that Ubuntu uses and is the easiest to
install.</li>
<li><strong>Sun Java</strong>: Sun Java is the reference implementation for Java&nbsp;6. Its support <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/64515/will-suns-java-be-available-from-canonicals-partner-repository/88035#88035"">has been discontinued</a> in Ubuntu.</li>
<li><strong>Oracle Java</strong>: Oracle Java is the OpenJDK Java Se Platform version 7 implementation from Oracle. Oracle introduced with this implementation <a href=""http://java.com/en/download/faq/distribution.xml#eula"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a license</a> that prevents distribution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since Ubuntu&nbsp;11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot) and <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JavaTeam"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">due to license issues</a> Ubuntu will no longer distribute Oracle's JDK and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Virtual_Machine#Execution_environment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JRE</a>.

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JaogR.png"" alt=""Enter image description here""></p>

<p>How can I fix this problem?</p>
","<p>The problem is that the <code>teamviewer_linux_x64.deb</code>, the package that was aimed to 64-bit systems, uses a obsolete package that tried to achieve multiarch previously in Debian based systems called <code>ia64-libs</code>.</p>

<p>This package had many 32-bits libraries that other 32-bit binaries could use. Since the package was removed with the introduction of multiarch. Isn't recommended for distributions using multiarch (Ubuntu 12.04 and later). For said distributions the <code>teamviewer_linux.deb</code> package should be used.</p>

<p>This is noted in the <a href=""http://www.teamviewer.com/en/help/363-How-do-I-install-TeamViewer-on-my-Linux-distribution.aspx#multiarch"">help page</a> of Teamviewer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Notes to Multiarch:</strong></p>
  
  <p>On newer 64-bit DEB-systems with Multiarch-support (Debian 7) teamviewer_linux_x64.deb cannot be installed because the package ia32-libs is not available anymore on these systems. In this case you can use teamviewer_linux.deb instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>So, how to install it?</h2>

<p>First, download it:</p>

<pre><code>wget http://download.teamviewer.com/download/teamviewer_i386.deb
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have 3 options. You can use apt-get (recommended) version 1.0.1 to solve the dependencies, gdebi, or you can solve them yourself.</p>

<h3>apt-get</h3>

<p>Just run</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ./teamviewer_i386.deb
</code></pre>

<h3>Gdebi method:</h3>

<p>First, install <code>gdebi</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gdebi
</code></pre>

<p>In the same directory you downloade the .deb file just run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gdebi teamviewer_i386.deb
</code></pre>

<p>It will list the dependencies and install it with a <code>y</code>. </p>

<h3>Manual method:</h3>

<p>Here you need to do everything manual. First, query the package dependencies so you can install them first:</p>

<pre><code>dpkg-deb -I teamviewer_i386.deb | grep Depends
</code></pre>

<p>It will return something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Depends: libc6 (&gt;= 2.4), libgcc1, libasound2, libfreetype6, zlib1g, libsm6, libxdamage1, libxext6, libxfixes3, libxrender1, libxtst6
</code></pre>

<p>Just installing such dependencies with <code>:i386</code> should be enough:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libgcc1:i386 libasound2:i386 libfreetype6:i386 zlib1g:i386 libsm6:i386 libxdamage1:i386 libxext6:i386 libxfixes3:i386 libxrender1:i386 libxtst6:i386 libxrandr2:i386
</code></pre>

<p>Then installing Teamviewer as normal:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg -i teamviewer_i386.deb
</code></pre>

<p>That should be all:</p>

<pre><code>dpkg --no-act -i Downloads/teamviewer_i386.deb

<li>start the process you want inside the started <code>tmux</code> session</li>
<li>leave/detach the <code>tmux</code> session by typing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd> and then <kbd>d</kbd>    </li>
</ul>

<p>You can now safely log off from the remote machine, your process will keep running inside <code>tmux</code>. When you come back again and want to check the status of your process you can use <code>tmux attach</code> to attach to your <code>tmux</code> session.</p>

<p>If you want to have multiple sessions running side-by-side, you should name each session using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd> and <code>$</code>. You can get a list of the currently running sessions using <code>tmux list-sessions</code>.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that you can’t login to root account on Ubuntu, this is because root doesn’t actually have a password set.</p>

<p>Type the following command:</p>

<p><code>sudo passwd</code></p>

<p>The following message will appear:</p>

<p><code>[sudo] password for [username]: [Type your user password and press return]</code></p>

<p>After that another message will appear, the following:</p>

<p><code>Type new UNIX password: [Type the root password you want]</code></p>

<p>Now the last thing you need to do, the following:</p>

<p><code>Retype new UNIX password: [Retype the root password you chosen before]</code></p>

<p>The following message will appear:</p>

<p><code>passwd: password updated successfully</code></p>

<p>If the above message showed up on your terminal, you can now use the root privileges by typing:</p>

<p><code>su</code></p>

<p>And then type the password you chosen. That's it!</p>

<p>How can I successfully share folders between Windows and Ubuntu using VirtualBox?</p>
","<h2>Access to shared folders in Virtual Box</h2>

<h3>Command line</h3>

<p>By default Virtual Box shared folders are created with read/write permission for the guest. This can be done from the command line <strong>on the host</strong> with:</p>

<pre><code>VBoxManage sharedfolder add ""VM name"" --name ""sharename"" --hostpath ""C:\test""
</code></pre>

<p>By adding the option <code>--readonly</code> we can restrict these for read only access. Use the <code>--transient</code> option if you only want the shares to appear in the present session but not persistent for follwing sessions. There are some limitations for shared folders (see <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/30396/error-mounting-virtualbox-shared-folders-in-an-ubuntu-guest/30446#30446"">this question</a> for details). If prerequisites are met we may mount these shared folders manually by running the following commands in the guest:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /home/&lt;user&gt;/vboxshare
sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 share /home/&lt;user&gt;/vboxshare
</code></pre>

<p>Of course we can also use different mount options to mount as read/only or mount with read access only to root.</p>

<h3>Auto-Mount through Virtual Box Manager</h3>

<p>In case we enabled auto-mounting on creating a shared folder from the Virtual Box Manager those shared folders will automatically be mounted in the guest with mount point <code>/media/sf_&lt;name_of_folder&gt;</code>. <strong>To have access to these folders users in the guest need to be a member of the group <code>vboxsf</code></strong>.</p>

<pre><code>sudo usermod -a -G vboxsf userName
</code></pre>

<p>The user <strong>will need to logout and log back in</strong> to see their new group added.</p>

"Why use apt-get upgrade instead of apt-get dist-upgrade?","373552","","<p>I usually use <code>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade</code> to run my updates and upgrades instead of the GUI because it seems to run more quickly. </p>

<p>However, I've noticed lately that I often get a message that one of my upgrades was held back. I then usually run <code>dist-upgrade</code> to run it through and it works fine. As far as I can tell after reading <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/81585/what-is-dist-upgrade-and-why-does-it-upgrade-more-than-upgrade"">this question</a> and its answers, <code>dist-upgrade</code> does all the same things and then some. </p>

<p>So, my question is: Why use <code>apt-get upgrade</code> at all? Why not use <code>apt-get dist-upgrade</code> all the time? Why does <code>apt-get upgrade</code> even exist?</p>
","<p>I typically upgrade my machines with:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; time sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>Below is an excerpt from <code>man apt-get</code>. <strong>Using upgrade keeps to the rule: under no circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages not already installed retrieved and installed.</strong> If that's important to you, use <code>apt-get upgrade</code>. If you want things to ""just work"", you probably want <code>apt-get dist-upgrade</code> to ensure dependencies are resolved.</p>

<p>To expand on why you'd want <em>upgrade</em> instead of <em>dist-upgrade</em>, if you are a systems administrator, you need predictability. You might be using advanced features like <a href=""http://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences"">apt pinning</a> or pulling from a collection of <a href=""https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas"">PPAs</a> (perhaps you have an in-house PPA), with various automations in place to inspect your system and available upgrades instead of always eagerly upgrading all available packages. You would get very frustrated when apt performs unscripted behavior, particularly if this leads to downtime of a production service.</p>

<pre><code>upgrade
    upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages
    currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in
    /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed with new
    versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no
    circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages
    not already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of
    currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without
    changing the install status of another package will be left at
    their current version. An update must be performed first so that
    apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available.

dist-upgrade
    dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade,
    also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions
    of packages; apt-get has a ""smart"" conflict resolution system, and
    it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the
    expense of less important ones if necessary. So, dist-upgrade
    command may remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file
    contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package
    files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for overriding
    the general settings for individual packages.

<p>In other words, why can't this be performed by <code>upgrade</code>?</p>
","<p>From <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/apt-get.8""><code>apt-get</code> manual</a>:</p>

<pre><code>upgrade
   upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages
   currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in

<p>And with the newer <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/apt.8""><code>apt</code></a> tool available from 14.04 onwards:</p>

<pre><code>full-upgrade
   full-upgrade performs the function of upgrade but may also remove
   installed packages if that is required in order to resolve a
   package conflict.
</code></pre>

<p>In your particular case, I see, for example, that <code>linux-headers</code> is a virtual package that is provided by both <code>linux-headers-3.0.0-12</code> and <code>linux-headers-3.0.0-13</code> and that sounds like the kind of package installation and removal handled by <code>dist-upgrade</code>, but not by <code>upgrade</code>.</p>

Luckily, there are text editors for the terminal. An easy one is <code>nano</code>, but I cannot understand how to work with it.</p>

</ol>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/47ERU.png""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/47ERU.png"" alt=""nano screenshot""></a></p>
","<p><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> will let you read the help. <code>nano</code> can do some pretty nice things so you might want to pootle around in there for a bit.</p>

<p>When you see <code>^G</code> (et al) it means <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd>. In the help pages, <code>M-H</code> means <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd>.</p>

<h3>How can I open text files for editing?</h3>

<p>This is the default in <code>nano</code>. Open and file and you're set to start editing:</p>

<pre><code>nano filename
</code></pre>

<p>Note: you won't be able to save unless you have write permissions for that file.</p>

<h3>How can I save the file?</h3>

<p><kbd>F3</kbd> will let you save without exiting. Otherwise, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> will prompt you if you've made changes. Press <kbd>Y</kbd> when it asks, and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to confirm the filename.</p>

<h3>How can I quit the editor without saving the changes?</h3>

<p><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd>, then <kbd>N</kbd> when it asks if you want to save.</p>

<h3>How to edit? I heard that you've to enter some commands to begin editing in vi, is this true for nano too?</h3>

<p>As above, no. <code>nano</code> is simple. It drops you in edit mode as soon as it opens. You can use arrow keys, <kbd>Page Up</kbd> / <kbd>Page Down</kbd> and <kbd>Home</kbd> / <kbd>End</kbd> as in gedit. You cannot use the mouse for moving the cursor position.</p>

<h3>Sometimes, if I manage to open a file, the text is unreadable due to its colors. How can I disable these colors?</h3>

<p>Colours are loaded through the nanorc framework. These are files that are loaded when nano loads which basically spell out the syntax highlighting. To toggle syntax highlighting, press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Y</kbd>. To disable it permanently for certain file types, edit <code>/etc/nanorc</code> and put a hash mark (<code>#</code>) before <code>include ""/usr/share/nano/*.nanorc""</code>.</p>

<h3>In the some files, lines are truncated because those do not fit in the screen. How can I prevent that from happening?</h3>

<p>Well I've been trying to find something but the best I could see was enabling soft-line-wrap with the funky key-combination of: <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>$</kbd> (<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd>).
To enable soft line wrapping by default, add the below line to <code>~/.nanorc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>set softwrap
</code></pre>

<p>Are there any other command to start stop restart service in ubuntu other than the below following.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>service --status-all</code></li>
<li><code>service &lt;service name&gt; stop</code> </li>
<li><code>sudosysv-rc-conf</code></li>
</ol>
","<p>It depends largely on the service. The new and preferred way to stop start and restart services is through <code>/etc/init.d</code>. So, for example, to stop or start the Apache Webserver, you can run</p>

<p><code>/etc/init.d/apache2 stop</code></p>

<p><code>/etc/init.d/apache2 start</code></p>

<p>The same is true of many other services, but probably not all. You can use the utility <code>sysv-rc-conf</code> to see which services you have that use an <code>init.d</code> script and manage them that way as well. Run it with <code>sudo sysv-rc-conf</code>.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a GUI application, try Boot up Manager. Install with</p>

<p><code>apt-get install bum</code></p>

<p>and run from the UI or from a terminal with</p>

<p><code>sudo bum</code></p>

"How can I uninstall a nvidia driver completely ?","359977","","<p>As expected, Nvidia drivers have reduced my customizations. I can't login to Unity 3D session. I can't find any content to help me to uninstall the driver and I don't know what to do as I have never uninstalled them before.</p>
","<p><strong>For Ubuntu 12.04</strong></p>

<p>Commands can be executed to terminal. You can open a terminal with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> keys combo.</p>

<p>If you <code>remove --purge</code> the nvidia driver you will be OK. No need to blacklist something, but sometimes maybe a force-load of the nouveau module needed.</p>

<p>First uninstall completely the driver.</p>

<p>Search what packages from nvidia you have installed.</p>

<pre><code>dpkg -l | grep -i nvidia
</code></pre>

<p><strong>except</strong> the package <code>nvidia-common</code> all other packages should be purged.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you want to be sure that you will purge everything related to nvidia you can give this command</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-*
</code></pre>

<p>the asterisk in the end means (Purge everything that begins with the name nvidia-)</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong></p>

<p>above command will also remove the <code>nvidia-common</code> package and the <code>nvidia-common</code> package has as a dependency the <code>ubuntu-desktop</code> package.</p>

<p>So after above command you should also give the installation command for <code>ubuntu-desktop</code> package</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
</code></pre>

<p>Also sometimes the nouveau driver get blacklisted from nvidia driver. With purge command it should UN-blacklisted. If you want to be sure that nouveau will be load in boot, you can force-load it by add it to /etc/modules</p>

<pre><code>echo 'nouveau' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
</code></pre>

<p>Last , search for the xorg.conf file and remove it as well</p>

<pre><code>sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf
</code></pre>

<p>In summary</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-*
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf
echo 'nouveau' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules

<p>Although all above commands not needed, this is my way to completely purge the nvidia driver and use the open source nounveau.</p>

"How to install and configure Wine?","358010","","<p>I am looking for a step by step instruction to guide me in the ways of installing, configuring and debugging many of the issues new users have when dealing with Wine in Ubuntu.</p>

<p>What is the recommended way of installing Wine, some of the issues that it has and how to solve them.</p>

<p>If I have a specific problem with an App in Wine, how do I go about solving it. What are the recommended steps to ensure that I can fix a problem related to an app I wish to use.</p>
","<p>If you want to use the latest development/staging version of Wine, please make sure to follow the guide in the <a href=""https://wiki.winehq.org/Ubuntu"" rel=""noreferrer"">Official WineHQ Guide for Ubuntu</a>, basically covering:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you are using a 64-bit Architecture, then enable 32-bit for better compatibility</p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Add the Wine Key, Wine Repository &amp; Update Repositories</p>

<pre><code>wget -nc https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/Release.key
sudo apt-key add Release.key
sudo apt-add-repository https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/
sudo apt update
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Then install the version of Wine you wish to use:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Based on Wine Development (Stable)</strong> (eg: 2.0)</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install wine-stable winehq-stable
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Based on Wine Development (Testing Stage)</strong> (eg: 2.1)</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install wine-devel winehq-devel
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Based on Wine-Staging (Bleeding Edge)</strong> (eg: 2.1.1)</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install wine-staging winehq-staging
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly run</p>

<pre><code>WINEARCH=win32 winecfg
</code></pre>

<p>in the terminal to make sure it configures Wine correctly (In that order). You will also need to install <code>winetricks</code> (Another configuration package, really helpful for installing Windows components like .NET Framework and other needed libraries). So after this, please do:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install winetricks
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h2>1. Differences between Wine Stable, Development &amp; Staging versions</h2>

<p><strong>Stable</strong> versions offer less bugs with better stability and receive updates every 3-6 months after release. </p>

<p><strong>Development</strong> version is the next stable version in development and receives updates every 2 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Staging</strong> version is the same as Development Version but includes all patches and enhancements from <a href=""https://www.wine-staging.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wine-Staging</a></p>

<p>The decision to stick with the stable version (Even number versions: 1.0, 1.2, 1.4...) or with the unstable versions (Odd number versions: 1.1, 1.3, 1.5...) is up to the user, the main difference is compatibility and performance which are both enhanced in the Development version. You get the latest fixes it offers, and also become a tester that can help in the development cycle.</p>

<h2>2. Installing the Recommended Stable Wine version (from PPA)</h2>

<p>In the terminal type the following to add the Wine PPA, update repositories, and install latest Wine &amp; Winetricks version:</p>

<pre><code>wget -nc https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/Release.key &amp;&amp; sudo apt-key add Release.key &amp;&amp; sudo apt-add-repository -y https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/ &amp;&amp; sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install wine-devel winehq-devel winetricks
</code></pre>

<p>or you could include the Wine 32-Bit Arch (Better support) and configuring winecfg (This should only be applied to new installations since it will move the existing Wine installation to a folder called winebck):</p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 &amp;&amp; wget -nc https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/Release.key &amp;&amp; sudo apt-key add Release.key &amp;&amp; sudo apt-add-repository -y https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/ &amp;&amp; sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install wine-devel winehq-devel winetricks &amp;&amp; export WINEARCH=win32 &amp;&amp; winecfg
</code></pre>

<h2>3. How to know which components an application needs</h2>

<p>To find out what components an app needs, look in the <a href=""http://appdb.winehq.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wine Application Database</a>. It lists if the application is usable, what components it needs and how to install them. </p>

<h2>4. How to install additional components, DLLS and Libraries to Wine</h2>

<p>To have a working and enhanced Wine environment for your games and apps, I suggest you use <code>winetricks</code> to install additional components which offer better compatibility with games. To have a better working system do the following here is an example for HL/HL2 (Non-Steam. For the Steam Version go here: <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/1784/how-can-i-install-steam"">How can I install Steam?</a> . Know that <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/app/70/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Half-Life</a> and HL2 are natively supported in Ubuntu):</p>

<p>To play HL/HL2 you need the Wine PPA as mentioned above. After opening <code>winecfg</code> at least once on the terminal, open <code>winetricks</code> by running <code>winetricks --gui</code> then follow this steps:</p>

<p>Select <strong>Select the default wineprefix</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zO9TV.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Select <strong>Install a windows DLL or component</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MvhTA.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Install all that I have marked (and any additional you need). This covers many apps:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GtGzo.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NJi9D.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/691J7.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8aSrF.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Right click the installer for HL/HL2 and select <strong>Open with Wine</strong>. Both games should work perfectly. This applies to apps in general and depending on the app you will need to install more or less components.</p>

<p>You can also install each component in terminal by adding the name of the component after the <code>winetricks</code> command:</p>

<p><code>winetricks vcrun2010</code> - Will install vcrun2010 using winetricks  </p>

<p><code>winetricks xna40</code> - Will install xna40  </p>

<h2>5. Troubleshooting a Wine App</h2>

<p>Sometimes, when running an App one or several of the following can actions can happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frozen App</li>
<li>Wine opens a Blue window for a moment and then closes it</li>
<li>Nothing appears to happen</li>
<li>Inside the Wine window everything is Black in the start or at some point</li>
<li><p>DLL, Video card or Component not recognized</p>

<p>For most of this problems there are solutions. Here are the recommended steps for you to start troubleshooting your way into a Wine app:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Always visit <a href=""http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&amp;sTitle=Browse%20Applications&amp;sOrderBy=appName&amp;bAscending=true"" rel=""noreferrer"">the Wine App Site</a> to see what other testers have done to make the App work. For example here is me testing <a href=""http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=28103&amp;iTestingId=78426"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dead Island: Riptide</a> which I gave it a Bronze since after the selecting the character the whole game went to a Black screen. What I did to test out what was happening was to go to the terminal and run the game from there. In the terminal some of the errors suggested I was missing a vital piece for the game to work. After reading the error output and doing what it suggested (Replacing a corrupted DLL) I could install a component the game needed and the game <a href=""http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=28103&amp;iTestingId=78466"" rel=""noreferrer"">worked perfectly</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Knowing <strong>what the game needs</strong> is crucial to getting the game working correctly. Setting the <code>winecfg</code> options and OS environment is only a small part. This is only creating the environment for the app. You need to add other functionality like DirectX, XNA, .NET Framework and more that the app might need in order to work. These are key components for some apps. Without them, even if some apps work correctly, others will not. Making sure you have all of this components gives you a higher chance of complying with what an app needs.</p></li>
<li><p>As you can see from my <a href=""http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=28103&amp;iTestingId=78466"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dead Island</a> test I added several <code>winetricks</code> packages and also installed 3 packages the games comes with (DirectX, Windows Media Format and Microsoft Visual C++ 2010). With this I managed to guarantee that the game would start and be playable.</p></li>
<li><p>Some apps are only created for certain Windows versions as seen with <a href=""http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=3696&amp;iTestingId=78741"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dungeon Keeper</a>. To specify a particular Windows Version for a particular app you can open <code>winecfg</code> navigate to <strong>Applications</strong> and select <strong>Add Application</strong>, then search for the applications executable file and click on <strong>Open</strong>. Now select the application from the list and then change the Windows Version for it. This way, only this application will have an specific version of Windows assigned to it, instead of globally changing the Windows version for all apps.</p></li>
<li><p>Changing the Windows version globally can affect apps that were installed with a different Windows version. For example, Installing <a href=""http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=24915"" rel=""noreferrer"">Terraria</a> in a Windows XP environment and then changing it after playing to Windows 7 will give you one of two errors, one, not finding the saved games and two not running the app.</p></li>
<li><p>Running an app to diagnose what the problem can be done through the terminal which is the best way by far to know what the app is doing or needing. The app can tell you information like:</p>

<ul>
<li>What missing DLL it needs to run (mscore.dll, steam_api.dll)</li>
<li>What missing component it needs to run (XNA, DirectX, .NET...)</li>
<li>If the problem is you are using a 64 Bit environment instead of a 32 Bit</li>
<li>If you need to add a parameter for the app to run  </li>
</ul>

<p>For missing DLLs I suggest using <a href=""http://www.dll-files.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">dll-files</a> to download specific DLLs missing that are needed for the APP. Normally you can paste this DLLs inside the game folder or in the Windows/System32 folder (Or both) and that should solve the problem. For missing components use <code>winetricks</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>When troubleshooting an App, always run the app in an emulated Desktop Window. Open <code>winecfg</code> go to <strong>Graphics</strong> and enable <strong>Emulate a Virtual Desktop</strong>. Then set the resolution for it. This way, if the app freezes, hijacks the keyboard and/or mouse focus, at least you have a way to eliminate the app instead of having it fullscreen where you have few choices:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GAtZC.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p>For freezing scenarios of an app at fullscreen I suggest activating the ""Kill X"" feature that is found in the Keyboard Layout Window which can save you several seconds of time when trying to get out of a frozen Wine app:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kcIAj.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p>Another technique of getting out of a frozen state is either opening a terminal and type <code>wineserver -k</code> or killing the X server. To do this firs configure it by running <code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration</code> and on the last option there that talks about killing X, say ""YES"". This will enable the <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>BACKSPACE</kbd> combination. </p></li>
<li><p>Remember that if an app needs a minimum or recommended hardware requirement in Windows, it will also need the same on Linux. If the app needs 512 MB of RAM and a 2.0 Ghz CPU, it will need the same on Linux using Wine.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes you will come across an app in an ISO or any other Image format that you can not manage to open or install. Ubuntu comes with several tools to open this files but the best one I have tried so far is CDEMU which covers several types of images that bring Multi-Sector or Protected format. This is the closest you will get to something similar to DAEMON Tools. Cases like The Sims 3, Simcity 2000 and others can only be opened and installed using this app. More info in <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/76346/apps-capable-of-mounting-unmounting-cd-dvd-images-with-multi-sector-or-protected"">Apps capable of mounting/unmounting CD/DVD Images with multi-sector or protected format</a></p></li>
<li><p>For cases where an specific app is not running, showing graphical glitches, black screen or not running with full graphics I actually recommend reading one of the following links that applies to the end user for video support:  </p>

<p><strong>Nvidia Users</strong> - <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/61396/how-to-install-nvidia-drivers"">How do I install the Nvidia drivers?</a></p>

<p><strong>Hybrid</strong> - <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/36930/how-well-do-laptops-with-nvidia-optimus-work"">Is a NVIDIA GeForce with Optimus Technology supported by Ubuntu?</a></p>

<p><strong>Ati</strong> - <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/124292/what-is-the-correct-way-to-install-ati-catalyst-video-drivers-fglrx?lq=1"">What is the correct way to install proprietary ATI Catalyst Video Drivers (fglrx) directly from AMD?</a></p>

<p>Apart from checking the above, if you have the correct drivers I would also add that you need to check if your video card has OpenGL support. For this I would first install mesa-utils if not yet installed: </p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install mesa-utils</code></p>

<p>to test for OpenGL support. Simply run a check to see if you have OpenGL support: </p>

<p><code>glxinfo|grep 'direct rendering'</code></p>

<p>which should say <strong>Yes</strong> if you do have support. Another alternative would be:</p>

<p><code>/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p</code></p>

<p>Lastly, you can run <code>glxgears</code> to give you an idea of how your video card renders and its FPS for the render. Another very important point is to run the application from the terminal as in <code>wine AppName.exe</code>, this way it will show what the problem is.  </p></li>
<li><p>If the Unity Launcher is not hiding itself when running a Wine app or is moving the app to the right you can do one of 2 things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hold the <kbd>ALT</kbd> key and click and drag the Wine to the Left</p></li>
<li><p>In the appearance option select ""Auto-Hide The Launcher"" and set the sensitivity to a level you like. This way the launcher will hide when the mouse leaves it's area.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YxaIl.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p>Shader Model 3.0 is not recognized in Wine (Including Steam games)</p>

<p>There are games that require Shader Models and output an error similar to <strong>Required OpenGL extension GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc</strong>. To fix this simply type the following in the terminal:</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0</code></p>

<p>Wine has come a LONG way from the days where newer games could not be played. It has gotten to a point where playing in Ubuntu is effortless. Wine has even some support for SM4.0 and DirectX 10/11 on Wine 1.6. If the problem persists it means that either your video card does not support this or you are missing the correct libraries.</p>

<p>Another reason that Wine might not detect Shader Model is because it might be set to <strong>Disabled</strong> in the Winetricks. Open the Dash and type <code>winetricks</code>. Select your wineprefix then <strong>Change Settings</strong>. Then look for the <strong>glsl=enabled</strong> option and select it. This should solve the Shader Model issue. Cases like the game Limbo are solved this way.</p>

<h2>6. How do I open multiple Wine apps without them using the same Window (Overlapping)</h2>

<p>You can setup multiple Wine windows by adjusting some Wine parameters before starting each individual Wine program. The fastest way is to open the terminal where the executable of the app you want to run exists. Let us assume it is the <strong>Wow.exe</strong> app. Then simply type the following:</p>

<pre><code>wine explorer /desktop=WOW,1024x768 ""Wow.exe"" -opengl -console
</code></pre>

<p>This would open the Wow.exe executable with a Window titled ""WOW"", a resolution of 1024x768 for that specific Window and it would apply the parameters -opengl and -console to the Wow executable. Now assuming you have the game installed somewhere else, you would the following change:</p>

<pre><code>wine explorer /desktop=WOW,1024x768 ""/media/cyrex/fun/wow/Wow.exe"" -opengl -console
</code></pre>

<p>This executes Wow.exe assuming it resides in the folder wow inside a partition called fun in your /media/USER folder. The output should be similar to this when running for example 4 apps:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kbsdt.png"" alt=""Wine""></p>

<p>There is a more easier way to accomplish this. The idea is to create a Desktop shortcut by right clicking on the Desktop and selecting <strong>New Document</strong> --> <strong>Empty Document</strong>. This should create an ""Untitled Document"" file on your desktop. Now open the file and paste in it the following:</p>

<pre><code>   [Desktop Entry]
   Type=Application
</code></pre>

<p>Now save it and rename the file to the application you want to open but at the end add "".desktop"". It will turn into an ""Executable Windows Icon"". Now right click the Icon again and go to <strong>Properties</strong> --> Permissions --> Activate <strong>Allow executing file as program</strong>. Now go to the <strong>Basic</strong> Tab and insert the information you need to execute that wine app. The end result should be something like this:</p>

<h2>7. Does having Ubuntu 64 bit influence Wine</h2>

<p>Yes, having Ubuntu 64 Bit will also set Wine as 64 bit. This will create several problems for many Windows apps that only work on 32 Bit, for example not being able to install several of the .NET Frameworks since they will only work on the 32-Bit version, which will result in the user not being able to run many Windows applications. To solve this you need to do the following after having succesfully installed the PPA version as I mentioned above. Immediately afer installing the PPA wine package and before opening <code>winecfg</code> open the terminal (Make sure you are at your home folder by typing <code>cd ~</code>) and type the following:</p>

<pre><code>rm -fr ~/.wine  
export WINEARCH=win32  
export WINEPREFIX=""/home/USER/.wine""  
winecfg
</code></pre>

<p>Change <strong>USER</strong> with your user account. For example in My case, that line would read <code>export WINEPREFIX=""/home/cyrex/.wine""</code></p>

<p>With this method you have changed the Wine architecture to 32 bit and on the moment you open Winecfg, it will configure all the Windows versions available to 32 Bit.</p>

<h2>8. Alternatives to Wine PPA</h2>

<p><strong>PlayOnLinux (PoL)</strong></p>

<p>Although you can actually install and configure everything you need with Wine alone and it's complementing apps (winetricks, regedit, explorer) using PoL can save you some trouble and time when installing an application. With PoL you can find a list of apps that you can select and install in it's database:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1f22V.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>and by simply selecting to install you achieve the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Creating an independent container which holds the app installed, a specific Wine version for the app installed (In some cases, a specific Wine version works better for a specific app than the current Wine version).</p></li>
<li><p>Automatically installing any additional DLL and Components the app needs to function correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>Adding the appropriate registry keys the app needs</p></li>
<li><p>Create an independent way of running multiples apps without them overlapping each other with Windows version changes, regedit changed, specific Wine versions, etc..</p>

<p>Of course, it is important to know that PoL works side by side with Wine and it needs Wine to work correctly (It is based on it). In many cases, an app might not work with PoL but will work with the default Wine configurations I have mentioned in this guide. So if you find the app you want to use in PoL, great. But if you don't find it, remember you always have the alternative to using the default Wine to install and configure the app.</p>

<p>The benefits of installing the app using Wine and installing it using PoL is that with Wine, you can access and execute the App using the DASH, like in the images below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tHEvf.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
(Terraria)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fzSYu.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
(Dead Space &amp; Dead Island)</p>

<p><strong>CodeWeavers CrossOver (CC)</strong></p>

<p>CC is very similar to PoL on how to install and configure apps. The main difference is that CC offers official support. They even have their own <a href=""http://www.codeweavers.com/compatibility/"" rel=""noreferrer"">CodeWeavers Database</a> which holds more than 10.000+ apps. Not only that but they have a ranking system similar to the one in Wine's AppDB. They have also contributed to the development of Wine some of which you can see in their <a href=""http://www.codeweavers.com/about/support_wine/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Support</a>.</p>

<p><strong>DosBox (DB)</strong></p>

<p>DB is to MS-DOS apps as Wine is to Windows apps. With DB you can run MS-DOS apps in your system. Simply install the <code>dosbox</code> package and you are done. Running an app is as simple as going to the folder where the app resides and executing the following:</p>

<p><code>dosbox ./</code></p>

<p>This will open the current folder as a drive letter on the DB environment.</p>

<p>You can also mount a folder by doing the following after opening DB:</p>

<p><code>mount x: /Absolute/Path/To/Folder/Of/App</code></p>

<p>For example</p>

<p><code>mount c: /home/cyrex/Desktop/Dune2</code></p>

<p>Will create the C: Drive letter which contains the Dune2 folder. So if I simply execute dune2.exe I get the following:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/R7Zq5.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>9. What are some special parameters and tips I can use with Wine</h2>

<p>There are a couple, for example:</p>

<p><strong>COMMANDS</strong></p>

<p><code>wine --version</code> - Shows the version of wine  </p>

<p><code>wineserver -k</code> - Kills all wine versions for the specific user. This is useful if your Wine app is frozen, took the whole screen and does not let you use Ubuntu, has the mouse or keyboard focused on it and other Wine issues that might appear with some apps.  </p>

<p><code>wine explorer</code> - Will open an explorer similar to the Windows Explorer  </p>

<p><code>wine explorer /desktop=X,Y</code> - Creates a virtual desktop where <strong>X</strong> is the name of the Desktop Window and <strong>Y</strong> is the resolution of the Window. For example: <code>wine explorer /desktop=WOW,1024x768 Wow.exe</code>  </p>

<p><code>regedit</code> - Will open the regedit version of Wine similar to the Windows one.  </p>

<p><code>wine uninstaller</code> - Will open the Add &amp; Remove of Wine similar to the one in Windows. Here you will be able not only see which apps you have install and uninstall them, but also be able to install new apps if you wish.  </p>

<p><code>winetricks</code> - Will open the winetricks app to install missing Libraries, DLLS and Components essential for the correct functionality of many Windows apps.</p>

<p><code>winecfg</code> - Will open the Wine Configuration where you can set Video, Sound and Windows version.</p>

<p><code>wine ipconfig</code> - Shows you the IP that Wine can see. Similar to ipconfig.</p>

<p><code>wine netstat</code> - Shows you the IP/Port connections made. Similar to netstat.</p>

<p><code>wine start</code> - Sets the working directory for the executable. This option helps in cases where the executable only works from the same folder and not from a full path. An example is if you wanted to run a .bat file or simply execute a command from another folder (eg: Parent folder), you would do something like this, assuming we are not in the same folder as MetroLL.exe:</p>

<pre><code> `wine start /d ""C:\\Program Files\\GMT-MAX.ORG\\Metro Last Light"" MetroLL.exe`
</code></pre>

<p>This would do two things, it will first set the directory to the <code>Metro Last Light</code> folder and then it would run the <code>MetroLL.exe</code> mentioned at the end. This is similar as running the executable from the same folder but it has the advantage of running the app from any other place. The thing to know here is that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wine does not like Unix paths, so you need to separate folders with <code>\\</code> instead of <code>\</code></li>
<li>You need to use an absolute path. You need to start from <code>C:\\</code> to make sure the executable will always work as it should. </li>
<li>If the executable is outside the <code>C:</code> drive, then add the corresponding letter. For example, to execute a Windows binary outside of Wine, you would use the <code>Z:\\</code> letter since <code>Z:</code> normally points to the Linux system's root directory.</li>
<li>If in doubt ask the command for help with the <code>/?</code> parameter, (eg: <code>wine start /?</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p><code>export WINEPREFIX</code> - This variable is used to change the Wine Prefix to another location. For example if you wish to merge PoL and Wine (Not recommended since PoL has multiple Prefixes) you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>   `export WINEPREFIX=""/home/USER/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefix/PREFIX""`
</code></pre>

<p>Where PREFIX is the one you want to merge with Wine. You would have to run winecfg again.</p>

<p><strong>TIPS</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>When dealing with a folder tha has spaces (eg: World of Warcraft), you can execute the Wow.exe file by adding the \ symbol in front of every space, this escapes the symbol. The end result would be something like ""World\ of\ Warcraft\Wow.exe"". If you do not want to add this escape symbols to your line of code, simply double quote the entire link, so it looks like:</p>

<p>wine explorer /desktop=WOW,1024x768 ""/media/cyrex/My Partition/World of Warcraft/Wow.exe"" -opengl -console</p>

<p>as you can see, there are 2 folders with spaces in them, ""My Partition"" and ""World of Warcraft"", but since I quoted the whole string, the need to include escape characters is not needed. If you wished to use the Wine Path (eg: C:/) then all slashes would be a double slash (eg: ""C:\Program Files\App"").</p></li>
<li><p>Parameters that are applied to an app should always be OUTSIDE the quoted strings. Using the example above, we can see <strong>-opengl</strong> and <strong>-console</strong> outside the quotes.</p></li>
<li><p>When dealing with apps that take hold of you mouse and/or keyboard, you can use <code>wineserver -k</code> to kill the app, or simply opening the App in Windows mode or setting the Windows mode with the <code>wine explorer /desktop</code> parameter will save you from having this mouse/keyboard problems.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>10. Stability, Performance and App Support Wine offers to end users</h2>

<p><strong>APP SUPPORT</strong></p>

<p>I have tried Wine since 2005 and seen how the developing process in Wine under Ubuntu has been quickly catching up to the latest games.</p>

<p>Before Wine 1.2 came out around 2012, it was difficult to get many apps working on Wine, but after <a href=""https://www.winehq.org/announce/1.2"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wine 1.2</a> came out it was a totally different result. Even more so after <a href=""https://www.winehq.org/announce/1.4"" rel=""noreferrer"">1.4 came out in 2012</a>, <a href=""https://www.winehq.org/announce/1.6"" rel=""noreferrer"">1.6 in 2013</a> and then <a href=""https://www.winehq.org/announce/1.8"" rel=""noreferrer"">1.8 in 2015</a>. Many cases started to appear where they would work out of the box. Cases like Deep Space 2 which is/was one of the latest games I could play at that moment and which I tested 3 days after it was released. Alice in Wonderland (The new one I mean), The Sims 3, World of Warcraft, Amnesia and others. Even Skyrim could be played. These are games that demand powerful graphics and you can play them with little to no additional setups other than the normal install provided above.</p>

<p>To know what games you can play on Wine I recommend visiting the Wine App Database: <a href=""http://appdb.winehq.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://appdb.winehq.org/</a> which holds more than 10K+. This includes information about their performance &amp; stability and it helps in knowing if a game is playable.</p>

<p>The Wine App Database also offers a <strong>Ranking</strong> which determines what games can be played with less issues, if any. When you see this ranks, you have an idea if the App will work or not. Mind that you need to also take into consideration what hardware and Wine version the tester shows on the Wine Database. The rankings are as follow:</p>

<p><strong>Platinum Rank</strong> - Means you have an almost 100% chance the app will work out of the box.</p>

<p><strong>Gold Rank</strong> - Means you might find yourself doing a little bit of configuring but it will work out at the end.</p>

<p><strong>Silver Rank</strong> - Means that the app will run, but might have graphical, sound or control issues.</p>

<p><strong>Bronze Rank</strong> - Means the app will not work correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Garbage Rank</strong> - Means the app still does not work and probably will not even install. The only way you could make it work would be when Superman starts eating kryptonian cereal in the morning.</p>

<p>For reference, a couple of years ago the amount of Platinum games was less than 50. In 2012 you could find <a href=""http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?bIsQueue=false&amp;bIsRejected=false&amp;sClass=application&amp;sTitle=Browse%20Applications&amp;iItemsPerPage=25&amp;iPage=1&amp;sOrderBy=appName&amp;bAscending=true"" rel=""noreferrer"">More than 1.5K games</a> out of which almost 200 were in the <a href=""http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?bIsQueue=false&amp;bIsRejected=false&amp;sClass=application&amp;sTitle=Browse%20Applications&amp;iItemsPerPage=25&amp;iPage=1&amp;sOrderBy=appName&amp;bAscending=true"" rel=""noreferrer"">Latest Titles</a>. Today there are more than 6K+ Games of which 4K+ are Platinum. The more people that participate in testing Wine apps, the better. Main reason I always recommend using the PPA from Wine.</p>

<p><strong>PERFORMANCE</strong></p>

<p>For performance information see <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/163903/gaming-performance-difference-between-windows-and-ubuntu/163931#163931"">Gaming performance difference between Windows and Ubuntu</a></p>

<h2>11. How to Uninstall Wine</h2>

<p>Uninstalling Wine can be done in 2 ways depending on your needs. If you only need to ""Reset"" Wine to the default values, you can simply delete the <code>.wine</code> folder and then create it again by running <code>winecfg</code>. If you have apps on the <code>.wine</code> folder that you wish to backup, now would be a good time before deleting the folder. To delete the folder simply do the following and it will take care of the whole Wine environment:</p>

<p><code>rm -fr ~/.wine</code><br>
<code>rm -fr ~/.cache/wine</code></p>

<p>Now if you want to actually uninstall Wine from Ubuntu, you can do the following, but note that this will <strong>NOT</strong> delete your <code>.wine</code> or cached folder:</p>

<p><code>sudo apt purge wine*</code></p>

<p>This would uninstall every package related to wine, including wine, wine1.9, winehq, winetricks and more. Basically removing anything related to wine.</p>

"How can I suspend/hibernate from command line?","354931","","<p>How can I suspend or hibernate my laptop using command line, without installing additional software?</p>
","<p>Traditionally ubuntu supported a fairly blunt method of suspend and hibernate. Neither would integrate well with other apps and sometimes not even work on some machines. The new method doesn't require root and notifies all applications listening for power events.</p>

<h3>Systemd Method</h3>

<p>Starting with Ubuntu 16.04, <code>systemctl</code> call must be used (See <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/777178/suspend-command-in-ubuntu-16-04"">Suspend command in Ubuntu 16.04</a>)</p>

<pre><code>systemctl suspend
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>systemctl hibernate
</code></pre>

<h3>New Method</h3>

<p>See the answer here on this page <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/131022/12637"">from Adam Paetznick regarding the use of dbus</a>. Ideally you would create a <code>~/bin/suspend</code> shortcut/script that makes the use of this action easy.</p>

<p>For use over ssh, you should <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/79927/12637"">modify policykit rules as outlined by Peter V. Mørch</a></p>

<h3>Old Method</h3>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=813387"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ubuntu Forum</a> you can use the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>pmi action suspend
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>pmi action hibernate
</code></pre>

<p>This requires that you install the powermanagement-interface package (not tested).</p>

"How do I create a script file for terminal commands?","353113","","<p>In Windows I can write a file containing commands for cmd (usually <code>.cmd</code> or <code>.bat</code> files).  When I click on those files it will open <code>cmd.exe</code> and run them commands the file contains.</p>

","<p>There are two methods.</p>

<p>First, the most common is to write a file, make sure the first line is </p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
</code></pre>

<p>Then save the file. Next mark it executable using <code>chmod +x file</code></p>

<p>Then when you click (or run the file from the terminal) the commands will be executed. By convention these files usually have no extension, however you can make them end in <code>.sh</code> or any other way.</p>

<p>A few notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any (and I mean any) file can be executed in Linux provided the first line is a path to the program that should interpret the file. Common examples include <code>/bin/python</code>,  <code>/bin/sh</code>, <code>/bin/dash</code>, but even odd ball things work like <code>/bin/mysql</code></li>
<li>Bash is a full language. It is vastly more complex than cmd.exe in windows. It has a strong programming language that supports functions, loops, conditionals, string operations, etc.</li>
<li><a href=""http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">These documents</a> may help if you run into problems.</li>
<li>If you do not wish to make the file executable then you can run it by passing it as an argument to bash: <code>bash file/to/run.sh</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A Simple Bash Example</strong></p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash  
echo ""This is a shell script""  
ls -lah  
echo ""I am done running ls""  
SOMEVAR='text stuff'  
echo ""$SOMEVAR""
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>The second method is to record commands using script. Run <code>script</code> then just do stuff. When you are done doing stuff type <code>exit</code> and script will generate a file for you with all the ""stuff"" you did. This is less used but works quite well for making things like macros. <code>man script</code> for more info.</p>

<p>Do someone know how to install the Teamviewer on 14.04?</p>
","<p>As of Ubuntu 11.10, there is no longer an <code>ia32-libs</code> package. Because of this, older x64 packages (such as the x64 version distributed on their site) will no longer be able to install.</p>

<p>TeamViewer has since removed the x64-only download, and they only offer the i386 version. </p>

<p>To install TeamViewer now, it's as simple as visiting the <a href=""https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/linux/"" rel=""noreferrer"">official download page</a>, clicking the ""Download"" button, and then running the downloaded <code>.deb</code> file. </p>

<p>If you want to use the terminal for this operation, that's still doable:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Grab the TeamViewer debfile:</p>

<pre><code> wget https://download.teamviewer.com/download/teamviewer_i386.deb
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Install the downloaded DEB file:</p>

<pre><code> sudo dpkg -i teamviewer_i386.deb
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If DPKG throws any errors, fix any dependency issues to make sure everything works fine:</p>

<pre><code> sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt -f install
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>TeamViewer will now be ready for use and will be present in your menu.</p>

","<p>I've found the answer on Serverfault: <a href=""https://serverfault.com/q/52285/51929"">Create a public SSH key from the private key?</a></p>

<p>The option <code>-y</code> outputs the public key:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa &gt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

<p>As a side note, the comment of the public key is lost. I've had a site which required the comment (Launchpad?), so you need to edit <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> and append a comment to the first line with a space between the comment and key data. An example public key is shown truncated below.</p>

<p>For keys that were added to the SSH Agent (a program that runs in the background and avoids the need for re-entering the keyfile passphrase over and over again), you can use the <code>ssh-add -L</code> command to list the public keys for keys that were added to the agent (via <code>ssh-add -l</code>). This is useful when the SSH key is stored on a smartcard (and access to the private key file is not possible).</p>

<p>How to format a pen drive in Ubuntu?<br>
I have this pen drive which I made bootable using some other system (OS).<br>
But I need to format it from my Ubuntu 12.04. Please guide me.</p>

<p>Then choose your device from left. Make sure you have selected at least one volume, and click on <strong>format</strong> as below:</p>

<h1>Method #2  (The Command-Line Way)</h1>

<p>In case you can't get your device formatted from <strong>Method #1</strong> try this way.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open the Terminal (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd>)</p></li>
<li><p>List your block storage devices by issuing the command <code>lsblk</code><br>
Then identify your pen drive by it's SIZE. In my case its <code>/dev/sdb</code></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uYOmQ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p>Erase everything in the pen drive <strong>(OPTIONAL)</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=4k &amp;&amp; sync  
</code></pre>

<p>Replace <code>/dev/sdb</code> with your corresponding device.  This will take some time. It will pretend to stuck. Just be patient.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a new partition table in the device:</p>

<pre><code>sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Then press letter <code>o</code> to create a new empty DOS partition table.  </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Make a new partition:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Press letter <code>n</code>  to add a new partition. You will be prompted for the size of the partition. Making a primary partition when prompted, if you are not sure.  </p></li>
<li><p>Then press letter <code>w</code> to  write table to disk and exit.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Format your new partition.</p>

<ul>
<li>See what is your new partition with a command <code>lsblk</code><br>
In my case it is <code>/dev/sdb1</code>  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xAOhP.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Issue the command below to format the new volume:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1  
</code></pre>

<p>Please replace <code>/dev/sdb1</code> with your corresponding device.  </p></li>

","<p><strong>If this answer does not work in Ubuntu 13.10, see <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/362499/178596"">here</a> for an alternative answer</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>You can follow official documentation <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/ubuntu-help/power-hibernate.html"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""here"">here</a>. Hibernation was <a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/policykit-desktop-privileges/+bug/812394"" rel=""noreferrer"">disabled</a> on 12.04 for machines that are not certified with Ubuntu.</p>

<p>In order to enable hibernation you need to test whether it works correctly by running <code>sudo pm-hibernate</code> in a terminal. The system will try to hibernate. If you are able to start the system again then you are more or less safe to add an override.</p>

<p>To do so, start editing:</p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla
</code></pre>

<p>Fill it with this:</p>

<pre><code>[Re-enable hibernate by default]
Identity=unix-user:*
Action=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate
ResultActive=yes
</code></pre>

<p>Or in 14.04 and later:</p>

<pre><code>[Re-enable hibernate by default for login1]
  Identity=unix-user:*
  Action=org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate
  ResultActive=yes

[Re-enable hibernate for multiple users by default in logind]
  Identity=unix-user:*
  Action=org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate-multiple-sessions
  ResultActive=yes
</code></pre>

<p>Save by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>O</kbd> then <kbd>enter</kbd> and then exit nano by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>X</kbd>.</p>

<p>Restart and hibernation is back!</p>

<p>Or run <code>killall unity-panel-service</code> to just reset the menu.</p>

<p>Some users will then need to run <code>sudo update-grub</code> to get the hibernate option to be available in the power menu.  Some users may also have to at least log out then log in to get it to appear in the (upper right) power menu.</p>

<p>It gives you so much information, I suggest you pipe it through <code>less</code> or output it to a file and open that in something you can move around in:</p>

<pre><code>sudo lshw | less

<p>Of course this is usually a <strong>lot</strong> of information. You often only need info on a small subset of your hardware and <code>lshw</code> will let you select a category. If you just wanted to see your network devices, for example, run this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo lshw -c network
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you want something graphical, I suggest you look at <code>hardinfo</code>. You'll need to install it first:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install hardinfo
</code></pre>

<p>You then just run it from the same terminal with <code>hardinfo</code>. I don't know that it has a menu location by default. </p>

<p>But it can give you slightly more information (boots, available kernels, etc) than the other options, as well as giving you similar lists of PCI and USB hardware like the first two commands.</p>

"Can I access Ubuntu from Windows remotely?","340758","","<p>I have Ubuntu installed on my work computer. I am wondering whether I could have access to it from another computer with Windows installed. If so, could you give a step by step guide, please? Thank you!</p>
","<p>Yes, you can access Ubuntu from Windows remotely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Follow these steps :</p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 1 – Install xRDP</strong></p>
  
  <p>Open Terminal (<kbd>Crtl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>) and execute the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xrdp
</code></pre>
  
  <p><strong>Step 2 – Install XFCE4</strong> ( Unity doesn't seem to support xRDP in Ubuntu 14.04; although, in Ubuntu 12.04 it was supported ). That's why we
  install Xfce4.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install xfce4
</code></pre>
  
  <p><strong>Step 3 – Configure xRDP</strong></p>
  
  <p>In this step, we modify two files to make sure xRDP uses Xfce4. First we
  need to create, or edit, our <code>.xsession</code>  file in our home directory. We
  can either use nano or simply redirect an echo statement (easier):</p>

<pre><code>echo xfce4-session &gt;~/.xsession
</code></pre>
  
  <p>The second file we need to edit is the startup file for xRDP, so it
  will start Xfce4.</p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh
</code></pre>
  
  <p>The content should look like this (pay attention to the last line and
  ignore <code>. /etc/X11/Xsession</code>):</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

if [ -r /etc/default/locale ]; then
  . /etc/default/locale
  export LANG LANGUAGE
fi

startxfce4
</code></pre>
  
  <p><strong>Step 4 – Restart xRDP</strong></p>
  
  <p>To make all these changes effective, restart xRDP as such:</p>

<pre><code>sudo service xrdp restart
</code></pre>
  
  <p><strong>Testing your xRDP connection</strong></p>
  
  <p>On the computer that will remotely control your Ubuntu machine, start
  you RDP client. Windows comes standard with a Remote Desktop client
  (mstsc.exe – you can start it from a command prompt, or find the
  shortcut to Remote Desktop under Accessories). Or Search 'remote' in
  start (Windows 7) Or 'remote' in search box in Windows 8.</p>
  
  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rRrp9.png"" alt=""Remote Desktop Connection""></p>
  
  <p>Whichever client you use, most will work with either the computer network
  name or IP address of your Ubuntu machine.</p>
  
  <p>To find the IP address on your Ubuntu box, type:</p>

<pre><code>hostname -I
</code></pre>
  
  <p><strong>(note: this is a capital “i”)</strong></p>
  
  <p>Enter IP address of your Ubuntu machine. For example:</p>
  
  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/P20Ou.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
  
  <p>Depending on your RDP client capabilities and settings (for example:
  Microsoft RDP Client allows automatic login), you might or might not
  see the login screen.
  <strong>Here we enter our Ubuntu username and password and click “OK”</strong></p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> There are some good points mentioned in comments, so I thought to sum them up.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you want to access Ubuntu from <em>outside network</em>, you'll need your Ubuntu
at work to have it's own, proper, internet IP address - a fairly
unlikely scenario. To work it otherwise, you need the externally
visible address of <em>work</em>, AND have port forwarding set to direct
incoming RDP requests to your work computer on the router. (<a href=""https://askubuntu.com/users/353176/mark-williams"">Mark Williams</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>To use the <em>Ubuntu MATE desktop</em> <code>meta-session</code>, replace last line <code>startxfce4</code> in <code>startwm.sh</code> with <code>mate-session</code>. (<a href=""https://askubuntu.com/users/479118/frank-n"">Frank N</a>) </p></li>
<li><p>You can use your actual machine name (by typing <code>hostname</code>) rather than your IP as it might be more stable on dynamic IPs in future sessions. (<a href=""https://askubuntu.com/users/479118/frank-n"">Frank N</a>)</p></li>

I would also like to know how to set up sftp-only users' home directories where they can't access upper level other directories.</p>
","<p>The best resource to help you begin setting up an ssh service on a Host machine using Ubuntu is <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH"" rel=""noreferrer"">OpenSSH Server</a>. This will allow you to use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol"" rel=""noreferrer"">SSH File Transfer Protocol</a> (also Secure File Transfer Protocol, or SFTP) to access, transfer, and manage files over SSH from a Client machine.</p>

<h2>Overview of Solution</h2>

<ul>
<li>On Ubuntu you can setup an <code>OpenSSH server</code> on a Host machine and a user can then use <code>ssh</code> to connect from Client to Host's server using only a username and password. Note, however, that public key authentication is recommended,</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Make sure you have a <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/StrongPasswords"" rel=""noreferrer"">strong password</a> before installing an SSH server (you may want to <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Configuring#disable-password-authentication"" rel=""noreferrer"">disable passwords altogether</a>)""</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Administrative User Accounts created on Host will have sudo privileges, Standard User Accounts created on Host will not.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Install and configure your OpenSSH Server on Host</h2>

<p>To install an OpenSSH server on Host:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install openssh-server
</code></pre>

<p>Give your Host a Static IP address so you can reliably connect to it:</p>

<pre><code>nm-connection-editor
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Configuring"" rel=""noreferrer"">To configure your OpenSSH server</a>, ""first, make a backup of your sshd_config file by copying it to your home directory, or by making a read-only copy in /etc/ssh by doing:""</p>

<pre><code>sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.factory-defaults
sudo chmod a-w /etc/ssh/sshd_config.factory-defaults
</code></pre>

<p>""Once you've backed up your <code>sshd_config</code> file, you can make changes with any text editor, for example:""</p>

<pre><code>sudo -H gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
</code></pre>

<p>You must restart your ssh service on Host for these changes to take effect</p>

<pre><code>sudo service ssh restart
</code></pre>

<h3>Consider the Following Security Measures</h3>

<ul>
<li>Don't enable port-forwarding on your router: When outsider asks your router to connect outsider to Port 22, etc., your router fails to comply unless you have enabled port-forwarding</li>
<li>Disable root login: Comment out <code>PermitRootLogin without-password</code>; add <code>PermitRootLogin no</code> to Host's <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code></li>
<li>Choose non-standard SSH port: Comment out <code>Port 22</code>; add <code>Port &lt;new-port-number&gt;</code> to Host's <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code></li>
<li>Allow only local connections: Add <code>ListenAddress 192.168.0.10</code></li>
<li>Allow certain users on certain ports: Add <code>AllowUsers &lt;username&gt;@&lt;IP_address_1&gt; &lt;username&gt;@&lt;IP_address_2&gt;</code> or <code>AllowUsers &lt;username&gt;@111.222.333.*</code> to Host's <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code></li>
<li>Allow only RSA key (passwordless) connections: Append the contents of <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> from each Client as a new line of Host's <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>. Then add <code>PasswordAuthentication no</code> to to Host's <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code></li>
<li>Slow attackers' cracking attempts: Use ufw (uncomplicated firewall) on Host to rate limit incoming connections to 10/minute: <code>sudo apt-get install ufw &amp;&amp; sudo ufw limit OpenSSH</code></li>
<li>For more ideas, see <a href=""http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/87"" rel=""noreferrer"">Keeping SSH Access Secure</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>If you feel you must, Enable <code>PasswordAuthentication</code> in your <code>sshd_config</code> file</h3>

<p>Find the line with the phrase <code>PasswordAuthentication</code> and make it read:</p>

<pre><code>PasswordAuthentication yes
</code></pre>

<p>Save your new <code>sshd_config</code> file and then restart Host's <code>ssh</code> service:</p>

<pre><code>sudo service ssh restart
</code></pre>

<h3>If you need access from anywhere over the internet, Setup Port Forwarding on your local router to direct traffic to your OpenSSH server</h3>

<p>Note the port Host's <code>ssh</code> service listens to in the <code>sshd_config</code> file and setup your router to forward TCP/UDP traffic aimed at this port to the IP address of your OpenSSH server.</p>

<ul>
<li>Typically, you can point your web browser to <code>192.168.1.1</code> in order to login to your router and setup port forwarding. See <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/317472/configure-openssh-server-and-router-to-accept-ssh-connection-over-internet/317513#317513"">Configure OpenSSH server and router to accept SSH connection over internet?</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Connect to Host and login via command-line or terminal</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>To open an SFTP shell terminal as <code>&lt;username&gt;</code> on Host, open a Terminal on Client and enter the following command, replacing <code>123.123.1.23</code> with Host's IP address:</p>

<pre><code>sftp &lt;username&gt;@123.123.1.23
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>If you changed the port number Host's OpenSSH server listens to, do:</p>

<pre><code>sftp -P &lt;port_number_in_Host's_sshd_config_file&gt; &lt;username&gt;@123.123.1.23
</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To open an SSH shell terminal as <code>&lt;username&gt;</code> on Host, open a Terminal on Client and enter the following command, replacing <code>123.123.1.23</code> with Host's IP address:</p>

<pre><code>ssh &lt;username&gt;@123.123.1.23
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>If you changed the port number Host's OpenSSH server listens to, do:</p>

<pre><code>ssh -p &lt;port_number_in_Host's_sshd_config_file&gt; &lt;username&gt;@123.123.1.23
</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Connect to Host and login via GUI file manager (e.g., Nautilus) for more visual SFTP access to enable file transfers</h2>

<ol>
<li>Open Nautilus on Client</li>
<li>Select File > Connect to Server</li>
<li>Type: <code>SSH</code></li>
<li>Server: Enter Host's IP address</li>
<li>Port: port number specified in Host's <code>sshd_config</code> file</li>
<li>User name: username</li>
<li>Password: password</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QvaIv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In 14.04:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open Nautilus on Client</li>
<li>Connect to Server</li>
<li>Type: `ssh @123.123.1.23:</li>
</ol>

<h2>Create Standard User Accounts on Host with limited file permissions outside their home folder</h2>

<p>Proper file permissions in place on Host guarantee that each standard user (without sudo privileges) that you create on Host will own their <code>/home/new_user</code> directory but have limited permissions with the rest of the directory structure.</p>

<ul>
<li>Limited permissions does not necessarily mean they are unable to view filenames and directory structure.</li>
</ul>

"How can I install on a non-PAE CPU? (error ""Kernel requires features not present on the CPU: PAE"")","335323","","<p>After burning Ubuntu 12.04 to a CD, I tried booting and got the message:</p>

<pre><code>This kernel requires the following features not present on the CPU:
pae

Unable to boot - please use a kernel appropriate for your CPU.
</code></pre>

<p>What does this mean?</p>
","<p>The error message means that your CPU does not support <em>PAE</em> extensions - that is a technique which allows a 32bit CPU to address more than 4GB of memory address space.</p>

<p>By default, 12.04 and later versions of Ubuntu expects a CPU with this capability:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PAE is provided by Intel Pentium Pro and above CPUs, including all
  later Pentium-series processors (except the 400 MHz-bus versions of
  the Pentium M). It is also available on other processors with similar
  or more advanced versions of the same architecture, such as the AMD
  Athlon[dubious – discuss] and later AMD processor models.
  <em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the above is strictly true, old systems which have the memory controller on the motherboard may not ""expose"" the CPU's PAE support, effectively making them non-PAE.</p>

<p>There is a heated <a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/930447"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bug report</a> about this; Canonical has decided that the default Ubuntu Desktop install will expect PAE support.</p>

<p>A few suggested workarounds:</p>

<h3>Workaround 1: Install <em>Lubuntu</em> or <em>Xubuntu</em>, then install the regular Ubuntu Desktop</h3>

<ul>
<li>Install either <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/PreviousReleases#A12.04"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lubuntu 12.04 32-bit</a> or <a href=""http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/12.04/release/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Xubuntu 12.04 32-bit</a>; both of these use a non-PAE kernel by default.</li>
<li>Once you boot into your new Lubuntu/Xubuntu, you can then switch to the default Unity desktop by installing the <code>ubuntu-desktop</code> package.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Workaround 2: Install an older version and then upgrade to 12.04</h3>

<p>Install 10.04 or 11.10 and then upgrade to 12.04.  See the linked question below for 12.10.</p>

<h3>Workaround 3: If you have a wired internet connection, use the ""net install"" mini-CD</h3>

<ul>
<li>You will need a reasonably fast <em>wired</em> connection for this method -- all packages will be downloaded over the internet.</li>
<li>Download the non-PAE netboot CD image <a href=""http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/non-pae/mini.iso"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>mini.iso</code></a> and burn it to a CD or USB.</li>
<li>Boot from it, follow the steps, and choose <code>linux-generic</code> when asked to choose a kernel, and <code>ubuntu-desktop</code> to get the ""default"" Ubuntu installation the regular Desktop CD would have given you, just with a non-PAE kernel.

<ul>
<li>You can also choose one of the other desktops. You <em>should</em> choose a desktop otherwise you will not have a GUI to play with after installation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Workaround 4: Ubuntu 12.04.5 and 14.04 (or later) on Pentium M only</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Ubuntu 12.04.5 and 14.04 support an option (""forcepae"") to enable PAE on Pentium M CPUs (where it is disabled by default). To enable it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Boot the 32-bit Ubuntu (or Xubuntu etc.) installer</li>
<li>When the image of the keyboard and little man in circle appears hit the Tab key</li>
<li>""Choose your language"" popup appears. Use the cursor keys and hit the Enter key to choose your language</li>
<li>Press F6, a grey menu will popup with some boot options</li>
<li>Press escape to close the window</li>
<li>You will now see a line that says:</li>
</ul>

<p><code>Boot Options file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash --</code></p>

<p>Edit this line and add the <code>forcepae</code> parameter with spaces twice around the <code>--</code> at the end:</p>

<p><code>Boot Options file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash forcepae -- forcepae</code></p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>forcepae -- forcepae</code> note: </p>

<p><code>forcepae</code> is required twice because it sets the boot parameters for two different kernel boots - the kernel that runs as part of the installer (left of <code>--</code>), and the kernel that runs on the installed system (right of <code>--</code>).</p>

<p>The text at the end should be <code>-- forcepae</code> not <code>--forcepae</code>. There is a space between <code>--</code> and <code>forcepae</code></p></li>
<li><p>Hit the Enter key, hopefully Ubuntu will boot and the rest of your install will be successful. If you have graphical problems with Unity, or just find it slow, try a more lightweight distribution like Xubuntu.</p></li>

<p>Does anyone else have a suggestion as to something else to try?</p>
","<p>Well, most probably your files are perfectly fine before FTP transmission.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, probably you are transferring your files using wrong FTP mode.</p>

<p>FTP do have two modes: binary and ASCII. By default most clients use ASCII mode, which breaks your binary files completely. I don't know which FTP client you are using, but for example in <a href=""http://www.ncftp.com/"">ncftp</a> you can use command ""binary"" to switch to binary mode.</p>

<p>If you want to create ZIP files using Ubuntu (or almost any other Linux), use <code>zip</code>. You can install it to Ubuntu by running</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install zip
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can create zip file by running</p>

To get an idea about AP mode hotspots, ad hoc networks and their difference, refer to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point#Wireless_access_point_vs._ad_hoc_network"">this Wikipedia page</a> and <a href=""https://support.connectify.me/article/8-what-is-the-difference-between-access-point-mode-and-ad-hoc-mode"">this article on Connectify website</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
","<h1>Ubuntu 16.04LTS &amp; 14.04LTS</h1>

<h2>Step 1: Test whether your WiFi card supports AP mode</h2>

<p>Follow the <strong>Access Point mode check</strong> in the <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/180733/how-to-setup-a-wi-fi-hotspot-access-point-mode/180734#180734"" title=""How to setup a Wi-Fi hotspot (Access Point mode)?"">answer</a> provided by <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/users/35775/web-e"" title=""Go to Web-E&#39;s profile"">Web-E</a></p>

<h2>Step 2: Start the built-in Hotspot</h2>

<p><em>Network</em> comes with a built-in option to start an Ad-Hoc hotspot. So, let's use this first, so that it could be configured and converted to an Access Point mode hotspot in the next step.</p>

<p>Search <em>Network</em> in Dash and open it.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Flm8B.png"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""Search &#39;network&#39; in Dash""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Flm8B.png"" alt=""DashSearch"" title=""Search &#39;network&#39; in Dash""></a></p>

<p>Press the ""<em>Use as Hotspot</em>"" button and <em>Network Manager</em> will start an AdHoc hotspot.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LxzIE.png"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""Ubuntu&#39;s default Hotspot""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LxzIE.png"" alt=""Hotspot"" title=""Ubuntu&#39;s default Hotspot""></a></p>

<p>But that's not what we want, is it? 😉 Stop the hotspot.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Configure Hotspot</h2>

<p>Open <em>Network Connections</em> from Dash or '<em>Edit Connections</em>' from Network Indicator menu.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dHlg9.png"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""Edit Connections...""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dHlg9.png"" alt=""Edit Connections"" title=""Edit Connections...""></a></p>

<p>In the <em>Network Connections</em> window that appears, there'll be a connection named <em>Hotspot</em> listed under the WiFi section. Select it and click the '<em>Edit</em>' button.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lQPGj.png"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""Network Connections""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lQPGj.png"" alt=""Network Connections"" title=""Network Connections""></a></p>

<p>In the window that appears, you may edit the broadcast name (SSID) of your hotspot. Now comes the most important part of this configuration: change mode to '<em>Hotspot</em>', which'll finally convert the hotspot to Access Point mode. Users of Ubuntu 14.04LTS'll notice that this mode isn't available to choose from the drop-down. Don't get disappointed, as you can still do it via an extra <em>Step 3.1</em>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vDMb0.png"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""Edit Hotspot Name and Password""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vDMb0.png"" alt=""Edit Hotspot Name and Password"" title=""Edit Hotspot Name and Password""></a></p>

<p>Save and open the same <em>Editing Hotspot</em> window again. This time go to the <em>WiFi Security</em> tab for selecting password type. If you don't want to set a password, you can set security to none and thus create an open hotspot. If you're setting a password, it's recommended to change the security key from WEP to WPA2. Once the configurations are done, don't forget to save it so that the changes could apply.</p>

<p>In the <em>General</em> tab, make sure that “Automatically connect to this network when it is available” is turned off (unless you only ever use your wifi as a hotspot). Otherwise, since the hotspot is always available, you won't see the menu entries to connect to other wifi networks in the network manager applet.</p>

<h2>Step 3.1: Only for Ubuntu 14.04LTS</h2>

<p>Since Ubuntu 14.04LTS's <em>Networks</em> (<code>network-manager v9.8.8</code>) doesn't offer a graphical setting to select AP mode, we'll manually edit it's config file to force the conversion. Copy the following command, then press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd> or open <em>Terminal</em> and paste it there:</p>

<pre><code>pkexec env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY XAUTHORITY=$XAUTHORITY gedit /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/Hotspot
</code></pre>

<p>Type your password in the authorization dialog that appears and the configuration file will be opened in text editor. Find a line beginning with <code>mode=</code>, change it to <code>mode=ap</code> and save the file.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Start Hotspot</h2>

<p>Now that the configuration part is over, we'll start the hotspot. Click on '<em>Create New Wi-Fi Network</em>' from Network Indicator menu.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/S9ULV.png"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""Create New Wi-Fi Network...""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/S9ULV.png"" alt=""Create New WiFi Connection"" title=""Create New Wi-Fi Network...""></a></p>

<p>In the window that appears, click on the connection drop-down button and change ""New..."" to ""Hotspot"". Press the ""Create"" button and your hotspot will start running. From now on, whenever you need a hotspot, you just need to do this step i.e <strong>Step 4</strong> only.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8IpCX.png"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""Start Hotspot""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8IpCX.png"" alt=""Start Hotspot"" title=""Start Hotspot""></a></p>

"How to create UEFI-only bootable USB live media?","317332","","<p>Having live media that can boot both ways can be a problem when installing Ubuntu onto currently available Windows 8 computers.</p>

<p>In other words the key advantage to creating <strong>UEFI-only</strong> bootable USB live media is: You know that it definitely booted and installed via UEFI.</p>

<p><sub> Since Valve has already been doing UEFI-only booting USB installers with their <em>Debian-based</em> Steam OS and UNetbootin — the top voted alternative to Ubuntu's Startup Disk Creator — isn't UEFI compatible and therefore misleading, I think we should have a separate topic for creating UEFI-only bootable USB live media.</sub></p>
","<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Creating UEFI-only booting USB live media is pretty straight forward. Just copy the files to your <em>FAT32-formatted</em> USB drive. <strong>That's it!</strong></p>

<p>Remember that for an installation or booting the media:</p>

<ul>
<li>You may still need to explicitly <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI#Set_up_the_BIOS_in_EFI_or_Legacy_mode"" rel=""noreferrer"">tell your computer to boot the media via UEFI</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/509006/40581"">GPT partition table</a> like in preinstallations of Windows 8 and later is recommended.</li>
<li>Use the latest <strong>AMD64</strong> (LTS) ISOs, because these definitely contain UEFI bootloaders.</li>
</ul>

<li>Creating the configuration file</li>
<li>Adding persistency</li>
<li>Checking the integrity</li>
<li>UEFI Secure Boot</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h1>1. Copy files from the ISO method</h1>

<p>This method also works for other install media that contains EFI loaders, like Windows for example.</p>

<h2>1.1. Example via terminal</h2>

<p>You can do something like the following if <code>604A-00EA</code> is your USB drive and you already have <code>p7zip</code> installed:</p>

<pre><code>$ 7z x ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.iso -o/media/$USER/604A-00EA/
</code></pre>

<p>You're done if you have only one partition on this USB drive, otherwise you need to flag the partition as bootable e.g. via <code>parted</code>:</p>

<pre><code># parted /dev/sdX set 1 boot on
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>/dev/sdX</code> would be your USB drive and <code>1</code> the partition number that should be used to boot.</p>

<h2>1.2. Example via GUI</h2>

<ol>

<h1>2. The ISO loopback method (advanced)</h1>

<p>Instead of extracting contents from an ISO image, GRUB and GRUB2 have been able to boot from ISO images directly through a loopback device. Given that the ISO image is UEFI bootable, we can set up a USB drive containing multiple ISOs with different operating systems without creating a mess on the USB drive.</p>

<p><sub>If you want to boot Windows too you might want to look at <a href=""https://superuser.com/q/267385/252532"">SARDU</a>. I remember using it with Windows PE around 2005 and it seems to have been updated to support USB drives and UEFI, but remember that this tool also supports legacy booting.</sub></p>

<p>What do we need?</p>

<ul>
<li>Very basic knowledge of GRUB configuration files.</li>
<li>Very basic knowledge of UEFI booting and GRUB, as we are going to generate our own GRUB bootloader image with a plenty of modules included.</li>
<li>A UEFI bootable ISO image, a FAT formatted USB drive and a machine that runs Linux.

<ul>
<li>No, we don't need a UEFI installation of Linux (which may be a chicken and egg situation), a traditional Linux VM like in VirtualBox is fine.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>2.1. Creating the binary</h2>

<p>On your Ubuntu machine or VM make sure the package <a href=""https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/grub-efi-amd64-bin/"" rel=""noreferrer"">grub-efi-amd64-bin</a> is installed (grub-efi-ia32-bin is also available for 32-bit Intel architectures on newer releases). The package may have a different name on another distribution, you can compare the <a href=""http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/amd64/grub-efi-amd64-bin/filelist"" rel=""noreferrer"">file listing of the package</a> to find the right package on your distribution.</p>

<p>The following command will generate the GRUB image, in this case an EFI binary that every computer with a UEFI firmware should be able to run:</p>

<pre><code>grub-mkimage -o bootx64.efi -p /efi/boot -O x86_64-efi \
 fat iso9660 part_gpt part_msdos \
 normal boot linux configfile loopback chain \
 efifwsetup efi_gop efi_uga \
 ls search search_label search_fs_uuid search_fs_file \
 gfxterm gfxterm_background gfxterm_menu test all_video loadenv \
 exfat ext2 ntfs btrfs hfsplus udf
</code></pre>

<p>Every <em>standard</em> UEFI firmware should look into <code>\EFI\BOOT\</code> for a file named <code>boot{arch}.efi</code>, so create the folders on the USB drive and copy the image we just created to this location. Other architectures instead of x64 are possible, but let's keep it simple with x64/amd64.</p>

<h2>2.2. Creating the configuration file</h2>

<p>A very basic example for a the <code>grub.cfg</code> configuration file that should be placed in the same directory as <code>bootx64.efi</code> would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>set timeout=3
set color_highlight=black/light-magenta

menuentry 'Boot Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS from ISO' {
        set isofile=""/efi/boot/ubuntu-14.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso""
        loopback loop $isofile
        linux (loop)/casper/vmlinuz.efi boot=casper iso-scan/filename=$isofile noprompt noeject quiet splash persistent --
        initrd (loop)/casper/initrd.lz
}
submenu 'Useful snippets' {
    menuentry 'Ubuntu' {
            chainloader /efi/ubuntu/grubx64.efi
    }
    menuentry 'Windows' {
            chainloader /efi/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi
    }
    menuentry 'Firmware Setup' {
            fwsetup
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The important thing is the configuration block with the title <code>Boot Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS from ISO</code>. You can change the color and timeout to your preference. I chose <code>black/light-magenta</code> as it still looks a bit Ubuntu-ish but is easily distinguishable when chainloading other configurations. You can find more examples for other distributions in the <a href=""https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Multiboot_USB_drive"" rel=""noreferrer"">Arch Wiki</a> and reading the <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Configuration"" rel=""noreferrer"">GRUB manual</a> is really worth your time if you want to go beyond that.</p>

<p>Getting back to the configuration block, it should be obvious that the ISO is referenced as <code>/efi/boot/ubuntu-14.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso</code>, so copy your ISO to <code>\EFI\BOOT\</code> and replace <code>ubuntu-14.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso</code> in the configuration with the actual filename of your ISO.</p>

<p><code>loopback loop $isofile</code> is the line, that will load our ISO file to a loopback device from which we can boot the Linux kernel directly. This is possible because our EFI GRUB image includes the loopback module. (A bit of trial and error was involved in figuring out which modules are reasonable to include. You shouldn't see any error messages, it's still not perfect though.) Speaking of the kernel you can add kernel parameters like <code>toram</code>, parameters for different languages (example <code>locale=de_DE bootkbd=de</code>) and as in the example: <code>persistent</code></p>

<h2>2.3. Adding persistency</h2>

<p>You can add a partition as described in: <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/138356/40581"">How do I get a live-USB to use a partition for persistence?</a> Or you can create a <code>casper-rw</code> file and place it at the root of your USB drive.</p>

<pre><code>dd if=/dev/zero of=casper-rw bs=1M count=4094
mkfs.ext4 -m 0 casper-rw
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't tested what the absolute maximum is, it should be somewhere between 4094 and 4096 MB. Use a partition if you intend to use more space. Note that every change to the (root) is a modification to the overlay filesystem, even deleting files.</p>

<h2>2.4. Checking the integrity</h2>

<p>You should look at answers to the following questions to verify that the Live ISO content on the USB drive is in pristine condition:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/17764/40581"">How can I check the integrity of a downloaded Ubuntu CD?</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/547332/40581"">Can an integrity check be run against a USB boot disk?</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>2.5. UEFI Secure Boot</h2>

<p>Secure Boot will become mandatory with Windows 10 machines, I suggest you have a look at the Linux Foundation's PreLoader to add Secure Boot functionality to this setup. Here is some <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/594747/40581"">ASCII art illustrating menus of the accompanying HashTool</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Congratulations, I'd say you now mastered UEFI booting and shouldn't be afraid anymore.</p>

<p>Having said that, you should realize <code>/bin/sh</code> on most systems will be a symbolic link and will not invoke <code>sh</code>.  In Ubuntu <code>/bin/sh</code> used to link to <code>bash</code>, typical behavior on Linux distributions, but now has changed to linking to <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh"">another shell called dash</a>.  I would use <code>bash</code>, as that is pretty much the standard (or at least most common, from my experience).

"Progress and speed with 'cp'?","314911","","<p>When copying files using <code>cp</code>, is it possible to display the progress and speed of the transfer? Otherwise, is there any alternative command line utility that can achieve this? </p>
","<p>While <code>cp</code> hasn't got this functionality, you can use <code>pv</code> to do this:</p>

<pre><code>pv my_big_file &gt; backup/my_big_file
</code></pre>

<p>Note: this method will lose the file's permissions and ownership. Files copied this way will have the same permissions as if you'd created them yourself and will belong to you. </p>

<p>In this example, <code>pv</code> basically just outputs the file to stdout*, which you redirect to a file using the <code>&gt;</code> operator. Simultaniously, it prints information about the progress to the terminal when you do that.</p>

<p>This is what it looks like:</p>

<pre><code>stefano@ubuntu:~/Data$ pv my_big_file &gt; backup/my_big_file
 138MB 0:00:01 [73.3MB/s] [=================================&gt;] 100% 
</code></pre>

<p>You may need to <a href=""http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/pv"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://hostmar.co/software-large"">&nbsp;Install pv</a> (alternatively, type <code>sudo apt-get install pv</code>) on your system.</p>

<hr>

<p>*: <strong>The technical bit</strong></p>

<p>There are three important streams of data in a unix-like system: stdout (standard output), stderr (standard error) and stdin (standard input). Every program has all three, so to speak. The pipe-operator redirects a programs output to another programs input. The <code>&gt;</code> operator redirects a programs standard output to a file. <code>cp</code> basically does nothing fancier than</p>

<pre><code>cat source &gt; destination
</code></pre>

<p>(where <code>cat</code> just reads a file and prints it to stdout). <code>pv</code> is just like cat, but if you redirect it's output stream somewhere else, it will print progress information to stdout instead.</p>

<p>Take a look at <code>man pv</code> to learn more about it.</p>

<p>If you're getting permission denied, then you're not using the correct username or something's amiss with the authentication. Most likely, it's because the sudo command only works locally, for starters, so it won't give you root on the remote box, so that's probably the problem. Make sure that the user you are logging in as on the remote server has write permissions to the location you're trying to write to. </p>

<p>And to replace the word you can use this <code>sed</code> command (assuming you copied the sources content in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo sed -i ""s/precise/$(lsb_release -c -s)/"" /etc/apt/sources.list

The only confusing part is the actual file-extension.</p>

<p>You can safely and freely rename them to .mpeg</p>

<p>PS. By turning it into Matroska, you just made is very hard for people on other systems to be able to play the file. I understand picking a free codec, and then choosing the appropiate container, but if you keep it at MPEG2, why change the container to something relatively obscure?</p>

"How can I tell what version of Java I have installed?","301736","","<p>I want to start toying around with java (eventually getting to the point where I can write basic little programs for android or web), but I've managed to have java messed up on my computer (from past experiments). </p>

<p>I'm not sure which version of java I have, and would like to know if there is a command to see the version of java that is installed and active. Also, which version works best? All this on 32bit Ubuntu 12.04  </p>

<p>EDIT:<br>
Ok, so it seems like I have both openjdk 6 and 7, with openjdk 7 in use. I want to use openjdk 7, so how do I uninstall openjdk 6? Is just via USC good enough or is there a command that should be run?</p>
","<p>This command should tell you what is currently providing the Java virtual machine (<code>java</code>) and the Java compiler (<code>javac</code>):</p>

<pre><code>file /etc/alternatives/java /etc/alternatives/javac
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes the ""alternatives"" system is working properly, which might not be the case, depending on how Java has been ""messed up"" in the past. To check this, run:</p>

<pre><code>file `which java javac`
</code></pre>

<p>If the alternatives system is working correctly and being used by Java, then you should see:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/bin/java:  symbolic link to `/etc/alternatives/java'
/usr/bin/javac: symbolic link to `/etc/alternatives/javac'
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise please <strong>edit your question</strong> to provide details. Then it should be possible to give a more specific answer.</p>

<hr>

<p>You can remove <code>openjdk-6</code> with the Software Center. There are multiple packages associated with it, so you may need to remove more than one packages. (All the `openjdk-6 packages are <a href=""https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6"">listed here</a>.)</p>

<p>Or you can use the command-line:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get remove openjdk-6-\* icedtea-6-\*
</code></pre>

<p>However, whichever method you use, you may want to check first to see what depends on these packages--you might have software installed that specifically needs version 6. (Probably not, but possibly.)</p>

<p>You can check for this by <em>simulating</em> the removal operation on the command-line:</p>

<pre><code>apt-get -s remove openjdk-6-\* icedtea-6-\*
</code></pre>

<p>This will show you the effects of removing those packages, including what other packages would be removed as well. (You'll notice that since this is a simulation, you don't need <code>sudo</code>.)</p>

<p>If you want to be able to continue using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet"">Java content online in your web browser</a> (this is not the same thing as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript"">JavaScript</a>), then before you remove any <code>icedtea-6-</code> or <code>openjdk-6-</code> packages (except perhaps <code>openjdk-6-jdk</code>), you should make sure you have <code>icedtea-7-</code> packages installed corresponding to whatever <code>icedtea-6-</code> packages are installed.</p>

<p>For gnome-shell/combined gnome-shell &amp; unity users, this font customisation can be done through gnome-tweak-tool as described below.</p>

<p>The move to gnome3 has <em>streamlined</em> many of the customisation features that were available in gnome2.</p>

","<p>I just found the answer <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PackageManagerTroubleshootingProcedure"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.

"How do I install Python 3.6 using apt-get?","299065","","<p>I've tried the normal way, <code>sudo apt-get install python3.6</code>, but... well... that didn't work. </p>

<p>So, how would I go about it? <em>(I'd preferably not build it on my own)</em></p>

<p>I'm using Ubuntu 16.04.</p>
","<h1>Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04</h1>

<p>If you are using Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04, you can use J Fernyhough's PPA at <a href=""https://launchpad.net/~jonathonf/+archive/ubuntu/python-3.6"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://launchpad.net/~jonathonf/+archive/ubuntu/python-3.6</a>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa

</code></pre>

<h1>Ubuntu 16.10 and 17.04</h1>

<p>If you are using Ubuntu 16.10 or 17.04, then Python 3.6 is in the universe repository, so you can just run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.6

"What is the equivalent terminal command to ipconfig /all?","298931","","<p>In windows I can use <code>ipconfig /all</code> and this displays all the info about my connection.</p>

<p>In terminal using <code>ifconfig</code> does not and only supplies limited info. I can use network manager, but it would be useful to know the command line alternative.</p>

<p>So my question is: what is the command line to supply ip address, gateway, subnet mask, DNS  the same way <code>ipconfig /all</code> supplies in Windows.</p>

<p>Thanks all</p>
","<p>The only thing missing from ifconfig are the gateway and DNS servers.</p>

<h2>15.04 and newer</h2>

<p>To get the DNS and Gateway info just type:</p>

<pre><code>nmcli dev show eth0
</code></pre>

<p>The output lists some device parameters including some <code>IP4.DNS[x]</code> entries, which show the DNS servers and a <code>IP4.ADDRESS[1]</code> line which lists the IP and Gateway used (look for the <code>gw = ???.???.???.???</code> part at the end of the line up to 15.10). On 16.04 and newer versions there is a <code>IP4.GATEWAY</code> line which is pretty self explanatory.</p>

<p>Replace <code>eth0</code> with the actual device name you're using, which may not be the same. To get a list of devices and their status type:</p>

<pre><code>nmcli dev status
</code></pre>

<h2>Up to and including 14.10</h2>

<p>You can get these with <strong>nm-tool</strong> (in Ubuntu versions <strong>prior to 15.04</strong>) which BTW is the command line version of network manager.</p>

<p>To run it just type in a terminal:</p>

<pre><code>nm-tool
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using Ubuntu <strong>15.04 or newer</strong> the <code>nm-tool</code> has been replaced by the <code>nmcli</code> command which is different. Check the section called ""15.04 and newer"" above this one in this case.</p>

<p><strong>I need these gcc features on 12.04 Precise, now. How can I get them?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Building GCC-4.8 from source:</strong></p>

<p>If you need gcc-4.8 on 12.04 now, your only option is to <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/install/"" rel=""noreferrer"">build it from source</a>.</p>

<p>Please read the <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/InstallingGCC"" rel=""noreferrer"">GCC installation FAQ</a> prior to installation.</p>

<p>You can download gcc-4.8 from one of gnu.org's <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">mirror sites</a> or directly from their <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/svn.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">SVN server</a>.</p>

<p>Here is an example of steps to compile from source (see <a href=""http://dollarvar.blogspot.com/2013/03/building-gcc-48.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> for additional details.) Note that these may vary depending on your system and preferences.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Download the <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">source code</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Make a build directory ( <code>mkdir gcc-build &amp;&amp; cd gcc-build</code>)</li>
<li>Download the source file: <code>wget http://www.netgull.com/gcc/releases/gcc-4.8.0/gcc-4.8.0.tar.bz2</code> (adjust this command to use an appropriate <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">mirror site</a>.</li>
<li>Unzip the file (<code>tar -xvjf &lt;file name&gt;</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Install some additional libraries (<code>sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev libc6-dev</code>)</p></li>
<li>Compile the source: <code>./gcc-4.8.0/configure --prefix=/app/gcc/4.8.0</code></li>
<li>Run <code>make</code> (This will take some time to complete. Go make some coffee, or bake some cookies. ;-))</li>
<li>Install the code: <code>sudo make install</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Once this process has completed, run the command <code>gcc --version</code> to verify that the installation has completed successfully. You should see something similar to the following output:</p>

<pre><code>maggotbrain@foucault:~$ gcc --version

","<h3>For 11.10 and below</h3>

<p>Ubuntu doesn't cache dns records by default so unless you've installed a dns cache there isn't anything to clear.</p>

<p>DNS records are likely cached by your provider's DNS servers so if you want to check if the DNS changes you made were successful you can interrogate a DNS server from your domain hosting service with dig:</p>

<p><code>dig -t a ns1.myhostingcompany.com @domain_registrar_dns_server</code></p>

"Install gcc on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS","291597","","<p>When I try to install gcc on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server with <code>apt-get install gcc</code>, I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 gcc : Depends: cpp (&gt;= 4:4.6.1-2ubuntu5) but it is not going to be installed
       Depends: gcc-4.6 (&gt;= 4.6.1-1) but it is not going to be installed
       Recommends: libc6-dev but it is not going to be installed or
                   libc-dev
</code></pre>

<p>When I delve deeper (i.e. try to <code>apt-get install gcc-4.6</code>), I get:</p>

<pre><code> gcc-4.6 : Depends: gcc-4.6-base (= 4.6.1-9ubuntu3) but 4.6.3-1ubuntu5 is to be installed
           Depends: cpp-4.6 (= 4.6.1-9ubuntu3) but it is not going to be installed
           Depends: libgomp1 (&gt;= 4.6.1-9ubuntu3) but it is not going to be installed

           Recommends: libc6-dev (&gt;= 2.13-0ubuntu6) but it is not going to be installed
</code></pre>

<p>So when I try to install <code>gcc-4.6=4.6.1-9ubuntu3</code> I get a list of 366 packages to remove (including e.g. <code>apt</code>). Which is craziness.</p>

<p>This is an essentially vanilla installation of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server (i.e. I installed nginx, python-flup, python-yaml, rsync, python-pkg-resources, lsof, fontconfig, iptables, ufw, scons, and grc).</p>

<p>It is very surprising to me that I cannot install gcc, so I am somewhat confused as to why attempting to install gcc fails. The only apparent fix would seem to be uninstalling 366 packages, many of which are central to the operation of Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Something doesn't add up, and I would be very grateful for assistance.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> The above is with the latest packages of course, having used <code>apt-get update; apt-get upgrade</code> before attempting the above. Sorry, I should have mentioned that.</p>
","<p>There's a metapackage called <code>build-essential</code> which should install the compiler and a bunch of related/needed packages:</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential</code></p>

<p>The suggestion to first do <code>sudo apt-get update</code> is sound, this will update package lists and all versions should match nicely.</p>

<p>That is, however, if you didn't modify your <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file manually. If so, then maybe some of the changes you made or repositories you added contain conflicting packages which cause the problems you see. If that's the case, please look at the file and fix the troublesome entries. Of course, if you want help doing so, you can post your <code>sources.list</code> file (or any fragments in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d</code>) and maybe someone can help you fix them.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It's the ""Ubuntu Error Reporting"" daemon, and is installed by default in both desktop/server installations.</p></li>
<li><p>When something crashes, <em>whoopsie</em> does two things:</p>

<ol>

<li>Can send them to Ubuntu/Canonical (specifically to <a href=""https://daisy.ubuntu.com"">https://daisy.ubuntu.com</a> :)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h3>Whoopsie won't send your crash reports without your permission!</h3>

<ul>
<li>to play around with the new(est) PHP features</li>
<li>to install older PHP version due support in the software</li>
</ul>
","<p>You could use a PPA to stay up-to-date with PHP or install previous version of PHP (f.e. PHP 5.6 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS).</p>

<p>The most widely used repositories come from Ondřej Surý, the Debian PHP maintainer:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/php"" rel=""noreferrer"">ppa:ondrej/php <img src=""https://launchpad.net/@@/launchpad.png"" alt=""Launchpad logo""></a> (for PHP 5.6/7.0/7.1 co-installable versions, PHP 5.5 is no longer supported)</li>

</ul>

<p>(<a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/4983"">Click here for instructions on using PPAs.</a>)</p>

<p>PHP PPAs previously contained Apache 2.4 update.  This is no longer a case, you need to add separate Apache 2.4 repository:</p>

sudo apt-get install php7.0   # for PHP 7.0
sudo apt-get install php5.6   # for PHP 5.6
</code></pre>

<p>To switch between installed versions use</p>

<pre><code>sudo update-alternatives --config php
</code></pre>

<p>Then you must set Apache to work with right version:</p>

<pre><code>sudo a2dismod php7.1         # unload the current version
sudo a2enmod  php5.6         # load the version you need
sudo service apache2 restart # restart webserver to apply

</code></pre>

<p>If you don't have <code>add-apt-repository</code> binary do the following:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>This is what I'm seeing when I try to run <code>sudo apt-get update</code>. I did an update on my instance yesterday and am now experiencing this.</p>
","<h2>overview</h2>

<p>There are two parts to your question:</p>

<ul>
<li>fixing <em>temporary resolve</em> messages</li>
<li>fixing the package management issues</li>
</ul>

<h3>Temporary resolve</h3>

<p>It is likely that this issue is either:</p>

<ul>
<li>temporary due to your Internet Service Provider not correctly forwarding internet naming (DNS) to either its or external DNS servers, or</li>
<li>due to a change in your network has similarly blocked this naming - for example, new router/modem, reconfiguring a switch with a new configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lets look at the possible DNS resolving issues.</p>

<p>First, temporarily add a known DNS server to your system.</p>

<pre><code>echo ""nameserver 8.8.8.8"" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf &gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>Then run <code>sudo apt-get update</code>.</p>

<p>If this fixes your <em>temporary resolving</em> messages then either wait for 24 hours to see if your ISP fixes the issue for you (or just contact your ISP) - or you can permanently add a DNS server to your system:</p>

<pre><code>echo ""nameserver 8.8.8.8"" | sudo tee /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base &gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>

<p><code>8.8.8.8</code> is Google's own DNS server.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+question/197664"">source</a></p>

<p>Another example DNS server you could use is <em><a href=""https://www.opendns.com/opendns-ip-addresses/"">OpenDNS</a></em> - for example:</p>

<pre><code>echo ""nameserver 208.67.222.222"" | sudo tee /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base &gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>

<h3>package-management issues</h3>

<p>In addition to the <em>temporary resolve</em> issues - you have a few package management issues that need to be corrected - I'm assuming you have tried recently to upgrade from one Ubuntu version to the next recommended version - in your case from Natty (11.04) to Oneiric (11.10)</p>

<p>Open a terminal and type </p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
</code></pre>

<p>Look for lines that have your a different distribution name in the list than you were expecting - in your case - you have upgraded to <code>oneiric</code> but you have another release name <code>natty</code> </p>

<p>For example, look for lines that look like <code>deb http:/archive.canonical.com/ natty backports</code></p>

<p>Add a <code>#</code> to the beginning of the line to comment it out - for example </p>

<p><code>#deb http:/archive.canonical.com/ natty backports</code></p>

<p>Save and re-run: </p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>You should not have any more release naming errors.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this, possible common <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames"">release names</a> include <code>lucid</code>, <code>maverick</code>, <code>natty</code>, <code>oneiric</code>, <code>precise</code>, <code>quantal</code>, <code>raring</code>, <code>saucy</code>, <code>trusty</code>, <code>utopic</code> and <code>vivid</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally you can run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

<p>From the <code>apt-get</code> manpage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also
  intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of
  packages; apt-get has a ""smart"" conflict resolution system, and it
  will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of
  less important ones if necessary. The dist-upgrade command may
  therefore remove some packages.</p>

<p>?</p>

<p>I often see people recommend one or the other.</p>

<p>In other words, what does <code>apt-get purge</code> remove that <code>apt-get remove</code> doesn't?</p>
","<p>As the <code>man apt-get</code> page says:</p>

<p><strong>remove</strong> - Packages installed are removed (Does NOT include configuration files)</p>

<p><strong>purge</strong> - Purge is identical to remove except that packages are removed and purged. Purge meaning that any configuration files are deleted too.</p>

<p>This of course, does not apply to packages that hold configuration files inside the user's home folder (eg: <code>/home/SexyNoJutsuUser</code>), this files will not be touched ( <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/176685/why-does-purge-not-remove-everything-related-to-an-app?rq=1"">Why does &quot;Purge&quot; not remove everything related to an app?</a> )</p>

<p>So for example, if you were to remove Chrome, Firefox, XBMC or any other that holds some configuration files inside your <code>/home</code> folder, this files will stay there.</p>

<p>On the other hand if you were to install apache, squid, mysql or any other services similar that save their files in <code>/etc</code>, this configuration files will be deleted if you use <code>purge</code>.</p>

"How do I run a 64-bit guest in VirtualBox?","286633","","<p>I would like to have an Ubuntu 11.04 64-bit test environment. When I try booting the Ubuntu 11.04 64-bit installation CD in VirtualBox, the following message is displayed by VirtualBox:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>VT-x/AMD-V hardware acceleration has
  been enabled, but is not operational.
  Your 64-bit guest will fail to detect
  a 64-bit CPU and will not be able to
  boot.</p>
  
  <p>Please ensure that you have enabled
  VT-x/AMD-V properly in the BIOS of
  your host computer.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>Details:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://paste.ubuntu.com/605523/"">VBox.log</a>, <a href=""http://paste.ubuntu.com/605525/"">ubuntu-test.vbox</a>, and <a href=""http://paste.ubuntu.com/605303/"">/proc/cpuinfo</a>.</li>

<li>The Virtualization setting in the BIOS is set to Enabled.</li>
</ul>
","<p>In order to be able to run a 64-Bit system in a VirtualBox, you need a cpu which supports virtualization. AMD calls this function AMD-V, Intel uses VT-x. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Hardware_support"">Wikipedia</a> explains this quite good. There are a couple of Pentium-4 CPUs which are able to run a 64-Bit OS, but don't offer this VT-x technologie. You can check your system by...</p>

<pre><code>$ egrep '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm syscall nx lm constant_tsc pni monitor ds_cpl vmx cid cx16 xtpr lahf_lm

</code></pre>

<p>If you don't get any output, you're not able to run a 64-Bit OS as guest inside your VirtualBox. But don't forget to check your BIOS settings. You might be able to activate these AMD-V/VT-x features inside the BIOS of your computer.</p>

<p>And finally there's a checkbox inside the VirtualBox-Settings. Start VirtualBox, select the virtual machine where you want to run your 64-Bit OS and go into the settings of this VM. Look for ""Settings -> System -> Acceleration"" and make sure that ""Enable VT-x/AMD-V"" is activated.</p>

<p>Good Luck :)

"How to extend my root (/) partition?","284942","","<p>Till today I was using ubuntu 13.04 in my windows7/ubuntu dual boot. Just now I have upgraded to ubuntu 14.04.

<p>Deleting temporary files may not be highly helpful in case of further updates and installs for I don't have too much space left in my /. I wanna extend my / partition with the help of the unallocated space in my HD. The following is my Gparted window.   </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ybeW.png"" alt=""Gparted window""></p>

<p>I got an answer <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/404361/extending-my-root-paritition"">here</a>. But it wasn't useful for me. I had two choices. But the answer wasn't working for both my chioces.</p>

<p>Choice 1: I may use the 4.25 GiB unallocated space to extend my /dev/sda10. To do so, I must need to move my linux-swap partition. But my Resize/Move option is disabled for the linux-swap partition. Choice 1 failed! </p>

<p>Choice 2: I may use the 14.35 GiB unallocated space instead. In this case I must move more than one partition. /dev/sda4  partition is the first on the list. Even that partition has the same problem. Resize/Move option is disabled. Choice 2 failed!</p>

<p>I am out of choices now.</p>

<p>What shall I do? Help me to extend my / with Gparted.     </p>
","<p>You actually can use the 4.25 GiB at the end without any reboot, because Linux supports on-line partition resizing since kernel 2.6 (meaning you can resize partitions while they're mounted, even the root partition, without any reboot).</p>

<p>I'll show you how to remove the swap partition and extend the root partition with all the free space at the end. Then I'll use the unallocated space in the beginning (14.35 GiB) for a new swap partition. Of course 14.35 GiB is a bit much so you can also choose to use some to extend your NTFS partition.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open GParted</p></li>
<li><p>Right click on <code>/dev/sda11</code> and select <code>Swapoff</code></p></li>

<li><p>Select <code>linux-swap</code> as file system</p></li>
<li><p>Click on <code>Add</code></p></li>
<li><p>Click on <code>Apply All Operations</code></p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Initially I wrote this using the command line only, but then I decided to try to use GParted as much as possible as this may be easier for you to see what's going on. You may even extend the root partition using GParted. But you need to unmount your root partition before you work on it. I mean you should work offline (using a liveUSB). In some cases your grub may get damaged. So do reinstall your grub before you leave out from your offline working.</p>

<p>I believe GParted will automatically enable the new swap partition but I'm not sure. You can always check by right clicking on it and then selecting <code>Swapon</code>. If this option is not available the swap partitions is probably already enabled.</p>

<p>Also the <code>Refresh Devices</code> step is probably unnecessary, but you should follow it just to be sure.</p>

<p>We cannot resize the extended partition (<code>sda4</code>, in this case) as it has a mounted logical partition within it. So we need to boot into the live mode of an Ubuntu USB/CD drive. From there, start GParted, turn off swap if necessary, right click on the extended partition and resize it to suit your needs. Then, follow the steps mentioned as needed to resize root and add back swap. In the event that your root partition UUID gets changed, you can update Grub by executing these steps in the live mode:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount /dev/sda10 /mnt 
sudo mount -o bind /dev/ /mnt/dev 
sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda 
sudo chroot /mnt /bin/bash 
# Now within the chroot
sudo update-grub
exit
# Now outside chroot
</code></pre>

"How do I boot into single-user mode from GRUB?","283861","","<p>After changing a few lines in xorg.conf, I can no longer boot Ubuntu (I assume it breaks when trying to load up X), so I need a way to boot into a single-user mode. However, there seems to be zero guides on the Internet how to do it, because they all assume I can actually edit files on my computer, and I obviously can't.</p>

<p>So how do I load Ubuntu in single-user mode?</p>

<p>When I turned off splash, I figured out the problem: whenever Ubuntu can't load X server due to some error, it switches to tty1 and waits for the prompt, but doesn't turn off the splash.</p>
","<p>To boot into <code>single user</code> mode you edit the boot instructions for the GRUB menu entry you wish to boot and add the kernel parameter/option <code>single</code>. Brief instructions for how to do this are below. </p>

<ol>
<li>Hold down the left <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while rebooting to bring up GRUB menu</li>
<li>Select (highlight) the GRUB boot menu entry you wish to use.</li>
<li>Press <kbd>e</kbd> to edit the GRUB boot commands for the selected boot menu entry.  </li>
<li><p>Look near the bottom of the list of commands for lines similar to  </p>

6a-64b819ccf2b7 ro  quiet splash
initrd /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-24-generic
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Change the middle line in (4) by adding the kernel boot parameter <code>single</code> to the end of the line (i.e. after <code>ro  quiet splash</code>).  </p>

<p>For this example you would change:</p>

<pre><code>6a-64b819ccf2b7 ro  quiet splash
</code></pre>

<p>to </p>

<pre><code>6a-64b819ccf2b7 ro  quiet splash single
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Press either <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> or <kbd>F10</kbd> to boot using
these kernel options.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These changes are <strong>not</strong> persistent. Any change to the kernel boot options made this way will only affect the next boot and only if you start that boot by pressing either <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> or <kbd>F10</kbd> while still in GRUB edit mode.</p>

"Kworker, what is it and why is it hogging so much CPU?","282355","","<p>I recently upgraded to the Kubuntu Natty Beta 1 and I've been having a lot of issues with the process <em>kworker</em>. At moments it uses almost half my CPU. Also, strangely enough it seems to affect my USB ports; whenever I plug in an USB drive, the process <em>kworker</em> goes into hyperdrive, leaving me unable to work.</p>

<p>I have thought about filing a bug but since I haven't even found any reasonable explanation on what <em>kworker</em> is I figured I should find out first.</p>
","<p>""kworker"" is a placeholder process for kernel worker threads, which perform most of the actual processing for the kernel, especially in cases where there are interrupts, timers, I/O, etc.  These typically correspond to the vast majority of any allocated ""system"" time to running processes.  It is not something that can be safely removed from the system in any way, and is completely unrelated to nepomuk or KDE (except in that these programs may make system calls, which may require the kernel to do something).</p>

<p>There were some reports of excessive kworker activity for relatively
idle systems starting during 2.6.36 development (<a href=""https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/3/29/2"">example discussion</a>), and wide reports of confusion and problems with 2.6.38 (although many of these reports include the word ""Natty"", so I presume these people not to have used any kernel between 2.6.35 (distributed in Ubuntu 10.10) and 2.6.38 (distributed in Ubuntu 11.04).</p>

<p>I've found many reports of something that ""fixed"" this for one or another user.  Most ""fixes"" seem to be related to updates of the kernel of various sorts.  Where the update can be tracked to a specific issue, it seems to often be some driver or kernel service that has been patched to not misbehave: I have the impression that there are a very large number of things in the kernel that can cause a behaviour which is observed as excessive kworker usage.</p>

<p>If you find the system unusable due to excessive kworker activity, I would recommend trying to do fewer things.  If you think you're not doing anything, try shutting down long-running services or timers (RSS readers, mail readers, file indexers, activity trackers, etc.).  If this doesn't work, try restarting.  If your system allows you to enable or disable hardware in a pre-boot environment, try turning off hardware you aren't using.  If it happens on every restart before you do anything, you could try uninstalling things, but at this point you'll want to be running syscall profiling tools to track down specific applications that seem to be causing this overload.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that your specific system will stop expressing this behaviour with a future kernel upgrade (and many of the most common causes of this have been solved).</p>

"How do I install Oracle JDK 6?","280184","","<p>Most of the software is not thoroughly tested with Java 7 and I would like to install Oracle's JDK 6.0 on Ubuntu 11.10.</p>

<p>Could someone please provide me the instructions for the same?</p>
","<p>Due to <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JavaTeam"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">license issues</a> Ubuntu will no longer distribute Oracle's JDK and JRE. Also previous versions supplied on PPAs suffer from security issues are are not recommended to be installed on any Ubuntu system.</p>

<p>There are no more supported <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">java releases from Ubuntu</a> - Ubuntu officially supports OpenJDK and OpenJRE implementation of Java which is the base for Oracle's own implementation.</p>

<p>To install the OpenJDK &amp; OpenJRE refer to <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/48468/how-to-install-java"">this Q&amp;A</a>.</p>

<p>The instructions below provide a guide to install the official Oracle JDK 6.  You will need to regularly update this manually to ensure your installation maintains recommended security and stability fixes.</p>

<h1>Install the Oracle JDK 6</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oracle JDK 6 is no longer maintained. It is not updated with the latest security patches and are not recommended for use in production.<br>
  You can however still download them from the <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Oracle Java Archive</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oracle themselves have the <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/install-linux-self-extracting-138783.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">official guide</a> to install their JDK - below is based upon those instructions.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Download</a> the 32bit or 64bit Linux ""compressed binary file"" - it has a "".bin"" file extension</li>
<li><p>Give it permissions to execute and extract it</p>

<p><code>chmod a+x [version]-linux-i586.bin</code></p>

<p><code>./[version]-linux-i586.bin</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>During installation it will ask you to register - press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>.  Firefox will open with the registration page.  Registration is optional.</p>

<p>JDK 6 package is extracted into <code>./jdk1.6.0_x</code> directory, for example <code>./jdk1.6.0_30</code>.</p>

<p>Lets rename it:</p>

<pre><code>mv jdk1.6.0_30 java-6-oracle
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Now move the JDK 6 directory to <code>/usr/lib</code></li>
</ul>

<p><code>sudo mkdir /usr/lib/jvm</code></p>

<p><code>sudo mv java-6-oracle /usr/lib/jvm</code></p>

<h1>switch to Oracle JDK 6</h1>

<p><em><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/webupd8/downloads/list?can=2&amp;q=&amp;sort=filename%20uploaded&amp;colspec=Filename%20Summary%20Uploaded%20ReleaseDate%20Size%20DownloadCount"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">webupd8.googlecode.com</a></em> hosts a nice-easy script to help with this.</p>

<pre><code>wget https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/webupd8/update-java-0.5b
chmod +x update-java-0.5b
sudo ./update-java-0.5b
</code></pre>

<p><em>don't worry - 0.5b refers to the script version - not the version of java!</em></p>

<p>An alternative to this is to use the <a href=""https://launchpad.net/~nilarimogard/+archive/webupd8/+index?batch=75&amp;memo=150&amp;start=150"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">webupd8 ppa</a> and the <code>update-java</code> package. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QZPrx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Finally test the switch has been successful:</p>

<pre><code>java -version
javac -version
</code></pre>

<p>These should display the oracle version installed - 1.6.0_30</p>

<h2><a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/java"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Install the Firefox/Chrome plugin</a></h2>

<p>In a terminal:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir ~/.mozilla/plugins
</code></pre>

<p>Remove the IcedTea plugin, if it has been installed.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get remove icedtea6-plugin
</code></pre>

<p>Remove a former version of the Java plugin (may or may not be present)</p>

<pre><code>rm ~/.mozilla/plugins/libnpjp2.so
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can install the plugin, by creating a symbolic link (you tell Firefox, where the plugin is located).</p>

<p>(32bit)</p>

<pre><code>ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle/jre/lib/i386/libnpjp2.so ~/.mozilla/plugins/
</code></pre>

<p>(64bit)</p>

<pre><code>ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle/jre/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so ~/.mozilla/plugins/
</code></pre>

<p>Confirm that the JRE has been successful by using the <a href=""http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">official oracle website</a>.</p>

"How can I stop being prompted to unlock the 'default' keyring on boot?","279203","","<p>Whenever Ubuntu boots up, a dialogue pops up asking me to unlock my default keyring. </p>

<p>Is there some way this can unlock automatically through PAM or some other magical way?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SeF1u.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p><strong>Be warned that this will make your keyring accessible without a password. Period. You don't have to be logged in to view it</strong></p>

<p>With that being said,</p>

<p>I think the simplest way is to set the password for the keyring to an empty password -- you will not be prompted for a password then:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open Applications -> Accessories -> Password and Encryption Keys</li>
<li>Right-click on the ""login"" keyring</li>
<li>Select ""Change password""</li>
<li>Enter your old password and leave the new password blank</li>
<li>Press ok, read the security warning, think about it and if you still want to get rid of this dialog, choose ""use unsafe storage"".</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Again, as the message says: This will expose all your passwords (e.g. email passwords) that you chose to save in the default keyring to anyone using your computer or having access to your files and is therefore not recommended.</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum for Ubuntu 11.04</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In the default Unity session, you can start the application by clicking on the Ubuntu logo in the top left corner, then typing <em>Password</em>, and selecting <em>Password and Encryption Keys</em> from the search result.</p></li>
<li><p>In the classic session the path to start the application has changed to <em>System → Preferences → Password and Encryption Keys</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Addendum for Ubuntu 11.10</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In the default Unity session, you can start the application by clicking on the Ubuntu launcher (the first item) in the Unity launcher bar on the left side, then typing <em>Password</em>, and selecting <em>Password and Encryption Keys</em> from the search result.</p></li>
<li><p>In the classic session (from the <code>gnome-session-fallback</code> package) the path to start the application has again changed to <em>Applications → Other → Password and Encryption Keys</em></p></li>

"Windows installer for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS onwards","277456","","<p>Is there any Windows installer (wubi) for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?</p>

<p>When I mount the <code>.iso</code> file with Daemon Tools and run <code>wubi.exe</code>, it just asks me if I want to reboot (I think that's useful only when the <code>.iso</code>  is burned on CD), so is there no ""real"" installation? </p>
","<p>The WUBI installer is on the <a href=""http://meta.askubuntu.com/questions/7497/wubi-discussion-again-supported-here-on-ask-ubuntu-13-04-and-later/7596#7596"">14.04 ISO</a> and works with windows up to 7. Windows 8 and Windows ME are not supported by WUBI. The only ISO that does not have WUBI is the <a href=""https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2013-April/036993.html"">13.04 version</a> (and that is end of life already)</p>

<p>Take note of the accepted upvote on the 1st link from a developer of WUBI. Copied parts from META: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... 
  <strong>It has shipped on the CD and is still shipped. Primary function is to
  be a ""cd autolauncher"" for people who pop the cd into a Windows
  machine, at that time it says ""You need to reboot, to try ubuntu!
  [reboot now]"" or some such.</strong></p>
  
  <p>If one copies the wubi.exe off the cd, it will launch and offer Wubi
  based installation.</p>
  
  <p>If one downloads wubi.exe off official release mirrors or
  releases.ubuntu.com, it also works.</p>
  
  <p>It works O.K. for all defined flavours i386/amd64 builds in BIOS mode.</p>
  
  <p>There is no confirmation if it works with UEFI, UEFI Windows 8, UEFI
  Windows 8 + SecureBoot. The last one believed to be the typical
  configurations of new computers that do not come with ubuntu
  pre-installed.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Since it's no longer an optimal solution for the default new installs, it has been de-emphasised on the ubuntu.com/download website.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Officially it is still supported - precise has 3 more years of support, and wubi has not yet been removed from any isos and is present to download for all releases and is present on all released .isos. (12.10, 13.04, 13.10 and 12.04.x point releases)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Mind the operating system noted not including 14.04 because this was posted before the release of 14.04. Support for WUBI has NOT dropped; it is no longer the preferred method though since Windows 8 does not play nice but if you have Windows 7 or older (excluding Windows ME) all you need to do is copy the installer from the ISO and it will install.</p>

"Choose gcc and g++ version","277106","","<p>So I have installed gcc-4.4 and gcc-4.3 (same for g++). Now as far as I remember there is a tool in Ubuntu which sets the symlinks for you if you just tell it which version you want. However it does not seem to work in the newest version, which I find disappointing.</p>

<pre><code>root@nexus:~# update-alternatives --config gcc

gcc-4.4
gcc-4.4-base
gcc-4.4-multilib
gcc-4.5-base
gcc-multilib
lib32gcc1

</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas?</p>
","<p>First erased the current update-alternatives setup for gcc and g++:</p>

<pre><code>sudo update-alternatives --remove-all gcc 
sudo update-alternatives --remove-all g++
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Install Packages</strong></p>

<p>It seems that both gcc-4.3 and gcc-4.4 are installed after install build-essential. However, we can explicitly install the following packages:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install gcc-4.3 gcc-4.4 g++-4.3 g++-4.4
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Install Alternatives</strong></p>

<p>Symbolic links cc and c++ are installed by default. We will install symbol links for gcc and g++, then link cc and c++ to gcc and g++ respectively.</p>

<pre><code>sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.3 10
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.4 20

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.3 10
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.4 20

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/cc cc /usr/bin/gcc 30
sudo update-alternatives --set cc /usr/bin/gcc

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/c++ c++ /usr/bin/g++ 30
sudo update-alternatives --set c++ /usr/bin/g++
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Configure Alternatives</strong></p>

<p>The last step is configuring the default commands for gcc, g++. It's easy to switch between 4.3 and 4.4 interactively:</p>

<pre><code>sudo update-alternatives --config gcc
sudo update-alternatives --config g++
</code></pre>

<p>Or switch using script:</p>

<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code>#!/bin/sh

if [ -z ""$1"" ]; then
    echo ""usage: $0 version"" 1&gt;&amp;2
    exit 1
fi

if [ ! -f ""/usr/bin/gcc-$1"" ] || [ ! -f ""/usr/bin/g++-$1"" ]; then
    echo ""no such version gcc/g++ installed"" 1&gt;&amp;2

"How can I securely erase a hard drive?","276419","","<p>I'm planning on selling a USB external hard drive that currently contains an old Ubuntu installation with stored passwords and banking information.</p>

<p>How can I securely erase the drive before selling it?</p>
","<h2>Securely erasing a storage device</h2>

<p>There's a command-line utility called <code>shred</code>, which overwrites data in a file or a whole device with random bits, making it nearly impossible to recover.</p>

<p>First of all, you need to identify the name of the device.</p>

<p>This might be something like <code>/dev/sdb</code> or <code>/dev/hdb</code> (but <strong>not</strong> like <code>/dev/sdb1</code>, that's a partition). You can use <code>sudo fdisk -l</code> to list all connected storage devices, and find your external hard drive there.</p>

<p><strong>N.B. Make sure it is the correct device, picking the wrong device will wipe it.</strong></p>

<p>Unmount all currently mounted partitions on that device, if any.
Then run the following, replacing <code>/dev/sdX</code> with the name of your device:</p>

<pre><code>sudo shred -v /dev/sdX
</code></pre>

<p>This will overwrite all the blocks on the device with random data three times, the <code>-v</code> flag is for verbose and will print the current progress. </p>

<p>You can add the option <code>-n</code><em><code>N</code></em> to only do this <em>N</em> times, to save time on large capacity devices. This might take a while, depending on the size of your external hard drive (I think it takes twenty minutes or so for my 4 GB flash drive).</p>

<p>You can also set all bits to zero after the last iteration by adding the option <code>-z</code>, I prefer to do this.</p>

<pre><code>sudo shred -v -n1 -z /dev/sdX
</code></pre>

<p>After this, you would have to repartition the device. The easiest way is to install GParted and use it:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install gparted
gksu gparted
</code></pre>

<p>Choose your device in the upper-right corner list. Then select <code>Device -&gt; Create partition table</code> to create a partition table on the device.</p>

<p>Then add a single partition that uses all of the unallocated space on the device, choosing <code>fat32</code> as the file system. Apply the changes by click the <strong>Apply</strong> button (the green checkmark) in the toolbar.</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>Read the <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man1/shred.1.html"">manpage for <code>shred</code> online</a> or by typing <code>man shred</code> in the terminal.</li>

","<p>Answers to the different updates</p>

<h1>First question</h1>

<p>You need the command</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install curl
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>install</em> is missing in the command you use: <code>sudo apt-get curl</code> won't work because apt-get does not have a command <code>curl</code>.</p>

<h1>First update</h1>

<p>Also you want to run <code>update</code> first:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>

<p>And you might want to consider using this command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libcurl3 php5-curl
</code></pre>

<p>It might also relate to the version of php you use (<code>php5-common</code>?) See <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/393522/installing-curl-on-ubuntu"">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Second update</h1>

<p>Or, to make it easier just use the command <code>wget https://install.meteor.com | sh</code>. Curl was used on earlier versions of ubuntu. It is not really an essential tool, but some tutorials use it indeed.</p>

"Grub rescue - error: unknown filesystem","271985","","<p>I have a multiboot system set up. The system has three drives. Multiboot is configured with Windows XP, Windows 7, and Ubuntu - all on the first drive. I had a lot of unpartitioned space left on the drive and was reserving it for adding other OSes and for storing files there in the future.</p>

<p>One day I went ahead and downloaded Partition Wizard and created a logical NTFS partition from within Windows 7, still some unpartitioned space left over. Everything worked fine, until I rebooted the computer a few days later.</p>

<p>Now I'm getting:  </p>

<pre><code>error: unknown filesystem.  
grub rescue&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>First of all I was surprised not to find any kind of help command, by trying:  </p>

<p><code>help</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>man</code>, <code>--help</code>, <code>-h</code>, <code>bash</code>, <code>cmd</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Now I'm stuck with non-bootable system. I have started researching the issue and finding that people usually recommend to boot to a Live CD and fix the issue from there. Is there a way to fix this issue from within grub rescue without the need for Live CD?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>By following the steps from <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/90471/persist-commands-typed-to-grub-rescue"">Persist commands typed to GRUB rescue</a>, I was able to boot to initramfs prompt. But not anywhere further than that.</p>

<p>So far from reading the manual on <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Rescue_Mode_.28.27.27grub_rescue.3E.27.27.29_Booting"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">grub rescue</a>, I was able to see my drives and partitions using <code>ls</code> command. For the first hard drive I see the following:<br>
(hd0) (hd0,msdos6) (hd0,msdos5) (hd0,msdos2) (hd0,msdos1)</p>

<p>I now know that (hd0,msdos6) contains Linux on it, since <code>ls (hd0,msdos6)/</code> lists directories. Others will give ""error: unknown filesystem.""</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p>After the following commands I am now getting to the boot menu and can boot into Windows 7 and Ubuntu, but upon reboot I have to repeat these steps.  </p>

<pre><code>ls
ls (hd0,msdos6)/
set root=(hd0,msdos6)
ls /
set prefix=(hd0,msdos6)/boot/grub
insmod /boot/grub/linux.mod
normal
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3</strong></p>

<p>Thanks Shashank Singh, with your instructions I have simplified my steps to the following. I have learned from you that I can replace msdos6 with just a 6 and that I can just do <code>insmod normal</code> instead of <code>insmod /boot/grub/linux.mod</code>. Now I just need to figure out how to save this settings from within grub itself, without booting into any OS.</p>

<pre><code>set root=(hd0,6)
set prefix=(hd0,6)/boot/grub
insmod normal
normal
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE 4</strong></p>

<p>Well, it seems like it is a requirement to boot into Linux. After booting into Ubuntu I have performed the following steps described in the <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Rescue_Mode_.28.27.27grub_rescue.3E.27.27.29_Booting"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">manual</a>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo update-grub
sudo grub-install /dev/sda
</code></pre>

<p>This did not resolve the issue. I still get the grub rescue prompt. What do I need to do to permanently fix it?</p>

<p>I have also learned that drive numbers as in hd0 need to be translated to drive letters as in /dev/sda for some commands. hd1 would be sdb, hd2 would be sdc, and so on. Partitions listed in grub as (hd0,msdos6) would be translated to /dev/sda6.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 5</strong></p>

<p>I could not figure out why the following did not fix grub:</p>

<pre><code>sudo update-grub
sudo grub-install /dev/sda
</code></pre>

<p>So I downloaded <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">boot-repair</a> based on an answer from <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair</a> post.

<li>How do I use the terminal?</li>
</ul>
","<h2>What is it:</h2>

<p>The terminal is an interface in which you can type and execute text based commands. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4WjAL.png"" alt=""terminal screenshot""></p>

<hr>

<h2>Why use it:</h2>

<p>It can be much faster to complete some tasks using a Terminal than with graphical applications and menus. Another benefit is allowing access to many more commands and scripts.</p>

<p>A common terminal task of installing an application can be achieved within a single command, compared to navigating through the Software Centre or Synaptic Manager. </p>

<p>For example the following would install Deluge bittorrent client:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install deluge
</code></pre>

<p>To save a detailed list of files in the current directory tree to a file called <code>listing.txt</code>:</p>

<pre><code>find -type f &gt; listing.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes you will also see the following notation:</p>

<pre><code>$ whoami
calum
$ ls
Downloads  Documents
</code></pre>

<p>This means that the command <code>whoami</code> is executed which gives <code>calum</code> as output. Following that command, <code>ls</code> is executed which outputs <code>Downloads  Documents</code>.</p>

<p>A similar notation is:</p>

<pre><code># apt-get update
</code></pre>

<p>This means that the command should be run as root, that is, using <code>sudo</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>#</code> character is also used for <em>comments</em>.</p>

<pre><code># this command will give your username
whoami
# the next command will show the contents of the current directory
ls
</code></pre>

<h2>How do I open a terminal:</h2>

<strong>Applications</strong> and type <code>terminal</code></p>

"How can I set up password-less SSH login?","267612","","<p>I want to be able to login to a remote via ssh without having to enter the password all the time.</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I set it up?</li>
<li>Is a different command required to execute a password-less session?</li>
</ul>
","<h3>Answer</h3>

<p>Execute this commands:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/4830/easiest-way-to-copy-ssh-keys-to-another-machine/4833#4833"">Then you'll need to copy the new key to your server</a>:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-copy-id user@host
## or if your server uses custom port no:
ssh-copy-id ""user@host -p 1234""
</code></pre>

<p>After the key is copied, ssh into the machine as normal:</p>

<pre><code>ssh user@host
</code></pre>

<p>You can now login without entering a password from the particular machine you executed the commands at.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre><code>not-marco@rinzwind-desktop:~$ ssh-keygen 
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/not-marco/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Created directory '/home/not-marco/.ssh'.

Now try logging into the machine, with ""ssh 'not-marco@server'"", and check in:

  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

to make sure we haven't added extra keys that you weren't expecting.
</code></pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p>This assumes you already can successfully connect to your server via SSH.</p>

<p>You'll need to generate an SSH Keypair which will allow you to identify you as yourself without using a password. You can opt to protect keys with a passcode if you wish, but this can be left blank allowing totally password-less SSH access.</p>

<ol>
<li>First create your SSH Keypair by running <code>ssh-keygen</code> this will create an <code>id_rsa</code> and <code>id_rsa.pub</code> file. The <code>pub</code> file is what goes on the servers, the private key (<code>id_rsa</code>) is what stays with you and is how you identify yourself.</li>
<li>Next copy the public key to your server with <code>ssh-copy-id user@server</code> replacing user with your remote user and server with the machine DNS name or IP address. It'll prompt for your SSH password, enter it and if all completes successfully you'll be able to access the machine via <code>ssh user@server</code> without needing a password.</li>

<p>UPDATED as of July 31,2016:
iptables have nothing to do with ssh as an application, but on other hand, functions as router in allow the traffic to port 22. When using iptables, the system actually understand 'ssh' however, it's a shortcut within command line but, really, it's actually <code>iptables INPUT -p udp -dport 22</code> while --dport means ""destination port"" (ssh uses port 22). This probably caused some misconception on seeing 'ssh' as if it's an appication, but really '22' as port.</p>

<p>Old answer from 2011:</p>

<p>The cleaning of <code>/tmp</code> is done by the upstart script <code>/etc/init/mounted-tmp.conf</code>. The script is run by upstart everytime <code>/tmp</code> is mounted. Practically that means at every boot.</p>

<p>The script does roughly the following: if a file in <code>/tmp</code> is older than <code>$TMPTIME</code> days it will be deleted.</p>

<p>The default value of <code>$TMPTIME</code> is 0, which means every file and directory in <code>/tmp</code> gets deleted. <code>$TMPTIME</code> is an environment variable defined in <code>/etc/default/rcS</code>.</p>

The partition I'm using was already formatted NTFS (this is the genius part: when I got this computer three years ago, I actually set it up with a 20G music partition precisely because I'd had this problem before, but I never actually organized myself to store music on it. So that's my backstory. Here's what I need now:</p>

<p>I have two partitions that I want to start mounting on startup:</p>

<pre><code>/dev/sda3   /mnt/devel  ext4    defaults    0   2
/dev/sda2   /mnt/excess ntfs    defaults    0   2

","<p>Permissions for ntfs and vfat file systems must be set with the <code>dmask</code>, <code>fmask</code> and <code>umask</code> options. <code>dmask</code> controls permissions for directories, <code>fmask</code> controls permissions for files, and <code>umask</code> controls both. Since these options set <em>masks</em>, they should be the complement of the permissions you want. For example, rwx for the owner and rx for others is 022 rather than 755.</p>

<p>To set the owner, use the <code>uid</code> and <code>gid</code> options for user and group, respectively. You can find your UID with the command <code>id -u</code>. To find your GID, use <code>id -g</code>. These values are both usually 1000.</p>

<p>A common set of mount options for ntfs is <code>uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=027,fmask=137</code>. This sets you as the owner of the drive, and sets the permissions to <code>drwxr-x---</code>.</p>

","<p>It entirely depends on what you plan to do with the machine. For example if it were a Sap server then yes, I would add 32gb swap ( we have boxes at work with 128gb ram and 32gb swap ). If you were manipulating massive pictures and video then it makes sense to have a little swap. 32gb is probably overkill. </p>

<p>However I would not say zero swap.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that you run out of RAM - perhaps opening a big file, perheps a long running tab in firefox, it doesn't matter, in that event your kernel OOM killer will kick in and start killing applications to get memory back. Under those circumstances it's entirely possible that you will lose data as applications get killed. However if you have a bit of swap then the system will carry on, grabbing swap and allowing the system to continue. System slows down as heavy swapping happens, you notice and investigate before all swap exhausted. Also disk is very cheap, so why not have swap?</p>

<p>Anyone who says ""you don't need swap"" without asking you what you're actually doing with your computer is making assumptions. Whilst you may well do very little with your computer that eats RAM, it's still best to ask the questions about what you're planning to do with it before making the rash judgement that you don't ""need"" swap.

<p>How can I do that? Is that even possible?</p>
","<p>Downgrading releases is possible to some extent. With enough fighting, it can be done (see some of the other answers here for the the technical details).</p>

<p>However the result you end up with is not the same as what you had before the upgrade. During an upgrade certain one-way changes are made to make new packages happy and downgrading them won't reverse those edits. It's impossible to guarantee a downgrade will work at all, let alone if it'll be stable.</p>

<p>In short, your easiest option is always going to be a reinstall. Don't think of it as a chore, look at it as a nice opportunity to trim down on packages and configure things better.</p>

<p>If you want to test things in the future and you fear you might have issues, always make sure you do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Test the LiveCD first. If you're going to have immediate hardware issues, this should let you know.</li>
<li>Back up before you do anything. I know everybody and their mother has already told you to do this, but it's really important if you think you're going to have issues. If you can't do without your machine for more than 20 minutes, consider some full-disk cloning tools like <a href=""http://clonezilla.org/"">Clonezilla</a> so you can just restore a previous version of the disk. There are other tools that can offer similar results.</li>
<li>Keep your data separate. Having your <code>/home/</code> within the same partition as your installation is a recipe for a headache if you're constantly upgrading/downgrading things. Push it off to another disk or at least another partition so that when you do need to reinstall, you really just need to set up the mount.</li>
<li>There was a <a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/891711"">critical bug</a> for downgrading that was fixed by the Ubuntu QA team. Make sure you read up on that, as some people will recommend you just stick in an older CD and ""upgrade"" to it, but this is a bad idea.</li>

"How to solve the phpmyadmin not found issue after upgrading php and apache?","260239","","<p>Recently I have install the PHP, Apache, MySQL, phpMyAdmin, python in my Ubuntu Desktop 12.04.3 LTS to use it as a LAMP server. The commands I used to install these are given below:</p>

<pre><code>1: sudo passwd
2: su
3: apt-get install php5
4: apt-get install apache2
5: apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client
6: apt-get install phpmyadmin
7: apt-get install python

10: /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

<p>Then everything works fine. The LAMP server runs great. Then i thought to upgrade the whole LAMP server I mean the PHP, Apahce, MySQL, phpMyAdmin etc. Then I searched in google and get some ppa which got the latest versions of these softwares. Then I added those ppa. The ppa links:</p>

<pre><code>1. https://launchpad.net/~tuxpoldo/+archive/phpmyadmin
2. https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/mysql-5.6
3. https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/apache2
4. https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/php5

<p>Then is used these ppa and firstly upgraded the phpmyadmin then MySQL server then Apache and then PHP.
After upgradation of phpmyadmin and mysql server the whole LAMP server runs well with the updated mysql server and phpmyadmin. But after the upgradation of Apache and PHP the phpmyadmin is not showing up. When I try:</p>

<pre><code>http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin

"How to empty swap if there is free RAM?","259959","","<p>When I open a RAM-intensive app (VirtualBox set at 2GB of RAM), some swap space is generally used, depending on what else I have open at the time.</p>

<p>However, when I quit that last application, the 2GB of RAM is freed up, but the same swap space use remains.</p>

<p>For example, right now, about two hours after having closed VirtualBox, I have 1.6GB free RAM and still 770MB in swap.</p>

<p>How can I tell Ubuntu to stop using that swap and to revert to using the RAM?</p>
","<p>Just because swap is allocated, doesn't mean it's being 'used'. Whilst programs like system monitor and top will show some of your swap space being allocated (in your example 770MB) that doesn't mean that the system is actively swapping in/out.</p>

"16.04 LTS wifi connection issues","259390","","<p>I discovered several issues with wifi connection after installing 16.04 LTS. </p>

<p>First, wifi doesn't reconnect normally after sleep or hibernation. Sometimes the network icon turns into a ""up and down arrows""(I don't know what it is for) after waking up but is still connected. Sometimes network is simply lost and it doesn't display any network in the list so there's simply no way to use wifi at all.</p>

<p>I first tried restarting network manager by running <code>sudo service network-manager restart</code>. It worked but was not a permanent resolution. </p>

<p>Then according to another thread, I added <code>SUSPEND_MODULES=""iwlwifi""</code>to </p>

<pre><code>/etc/pm/config.d/config
</code></pre>

<p>After doing this, the reconnect issue seems to be fixed(can automatically reconnect and icon doesn't change anymore.) However,  I find the wifi connection gets lost randomly (about every 30 minutes) even when the computer is running and the network icon remains the connected state when connection is lost.</p>

<p>Another issue after adding the code is, when I put my computer to sleep, the screen will turn off for a second but then turns back on for around 5 seconds(during which the system will cut off wifi connection). And then the computer will go to sleep after this unusual ""two-phase"" process.</p>

<p><strong>05/01/2016 Update:
I don't know what happened but the issue gets worse now. Wifi connection gets lost about every 5 minutes and I have to reconnect or restart network-manager.</strong></p>
","<p>Finally I was able to fix the issues after trying out numbers of different methods. </p>

<ol>
<li>Get details of your PCI wireless card by running <code>sudo lshw -class network</code></li>
<li><p>Get your card model info according to the product line.<br>
For instance, as you can see in the question description it says<br> <code>product: RTL8723BE PCIe Wireless Network Adapter</code> so the model of my card is <code>RTL8723BE</code></p>

<p>Or <code>product: RTL8101/2/6E PCI Express Fast/Gigabit Ethernet controller
</code>so the model of my card is <code>RTL8101/2/6E</code></p></li>
<li><p>Give the permission <code>sudo chmod 755 /etc/pm/config.d/</code></p></li>
<li><p>Open or create <code>config</code> and add <code>SUSPEND_MODULES=""rtl8723be""</code>(replace rtl8723be with your own model number)<br> 
Then run<br> <code>echo ""options rtl8723be fwlps=N"" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8723be.conf</code><br> 
Finaly restart your system.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now your system should be able to reconnect automatically after sleep, and wifi connection never got lost once for me after doing this. </p>

<p>""The up/down arrows is likely a network manager bug that results in network manager thinking the wifi device is actually ethernet."", according to Jeremy31.<a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/1576215"" rel=""noreferrer"">see bug info here</a> You should be able to fix it by installing NetworkManager-1.2.0.</p>

<p><strong>Installation Instructions [Linux Install]</strong></p>

<p>These instructions explain how to install Anaconda on a Linux system.</p>

<p>After <a href=""http://continuum.io/downloads"">downloading</a> the Anaconda installer, run the following command from a terminal:</p>

<pre><code>$ bash Anaconda-2.x.x-Linux-x86[_64].sh
</code></pre>

<p>After accepting the license terms, you will be asked to specify the install location (which defaults to <code>~/anaconda</code>).</p>

<p><sub><strong>Note</strong>: You do NOT need root privileges to install Anaconda, if you select a user writable install location, such as <code>~/anaconda.*</code> After the self extraction is finished, you should add the anaconda binary directory to your PATH environment variable.</sub></p>

<p><sub>As all of Anaconda is contained in a single directory, uninstalling Anaconda is easy (you simply remove the entire install location directory).</sub></p>

"What is ""umask"" and how does it work?","252486","","<p>I believe that umask is something that controls <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/83/6969"">file permissions</a>, but do not fully understand it.</p>

<p>After running <code>umask 0644</code> in a <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/38162/6969"">terminal</a>, I cannot read the files I create with the command-line text editor <code>nano</code>. I noticed that the permissions of that file are set to <code>0022</code> instead of the default <code>0755</code>.</p>

<p>How does umask work? I thought I could just remove the each digit in the umask from <code>0777</code>, <code>7 - 6 = 1</code> and <code>7 - 4 = 3</code>, so I expect the permissions to be <code>0133</code>, but apparently, this is not the case.</p>

<ol>
<li>What is umask exactly? Explain it to me like I was a ""Linux noob""</li>
<li>How do I calculate with umask?</li>
<li>What are use cases for umask?</li>
</ol>
","<p>The umask acts as a set of permissions that applications cannot set on files. It's a file mode creation mask for <strong>processes</strong> and cannot be set for directories itself. Most applications would not create files with execute permissions set, so they would have a default of <code>666</code>, which is then modified by the umask.</p>

<p>As you have set the umask to remove the read/write bits for the owner and the read bits for others, a default such as <code>777</code> in applications would result in the file permissions being <code>133</code>. This would mean that you (and others) could execute the file, and others would be able to write to it.</p>

<p>If you want to make files not be read/write/execute by anyone but the owner, you should use a umask like <code>077</code> to turn off those permissions for the group &amp; others.</p>

<p>In contrast, a umask of <code>000</code> will make newly created directories readable, writable and descendible for everyone (the permissions will be <code>777</code>). Such a umask is highly insecure and you should never set the umask to <code>000</code>.</p>

<p>The default umask on Ubuntu is <code>022</code> which means that newly created files are readable by everyone, but only writable by the owner:</p>

<pre><code>user@computer:~$ touch new-file-name
user@computer:~$ ls -dl new-file-name
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 0 Apr  1 19:15 new-file-name
</code></pre>

<h3>Viewing and modifying umask</h3>

<p>To view your current umask setting, <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/38162/6969"">open a terminal</a> and run the command:</p>

<pre><code>umask
</code></pre>

<p>To change the umask setting of the current shell to something else, say 077, run:</p>

<pre><code>umask 077
</code></pre>

<p>To test whether this setting works or not, you can create a <strong>new</strong> file (file permissions of an existing file won't be affected) and show information about the file, run:</p>

<pre><code>user@computer:~$ touch new-file-name
user@computer:~$ ls -dl new-file-name
-rw------- 1 user user 0 Apr  1 19:14 new-file-name
</code></pre>

<p>The umask setting is inherited by processes started from the same shell. For example, start the text editor GEdit by executing <code>gedit</code> in the terminal and save a file using gedit. You'll notice that the newly created file is affected by the same umask setting as in the terminal.</p>

<h3>Use case: multi-user system</h3>

<p>If you are on a system that's shared by multiple users, it's desired that others cannot read files in your home directory. For that, a umask is very useful. Edit <code>~/.profile</code> and add a new line with:</p>

<pre><code>umask 007
</code></pre>

<p>You need to re-login for this umask change in <code>~/.profile</code> to take effect. Next, you need to change existing file permissions of files in your home directory by removing the read, write and execute bit for the world. <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/38162/6969"">Open a terminal</a> and execute:</p>

<pre><code>chmod -R o-rwx ~
</code></pre>

<p>If you want this umask setting be applied to all users on the system, you could edit the system-wide profile file at <code>/etc/profile</code>.</p>

"What version of Python do I have?","250196","","<p>How can I find out what versions of Python I have?</p>

<p>I am using Ubuntu&nbsp;14.04 (Trusty Tahr).</p>
","<p>You can use <code>python -V</code> (et al.) to show you the version of Python that the <code>python</code> command resolves to. If that's all you need, you're done. But to see every version of python in your system takes a bit more.</p>

<p>In Ubuntu we can check the resolution with <code>readlink -f $(which python)</code>. In default cases in 14.04 this will simply point to <code>/usr/bin/python2.7</code>.</p>

<p>We can chain this in to show the version of that version of Python:</p>

<pre><code>$ readlink -f $(which python) | xargs -I % sh -c 'echo -n ""%: ""; % -V'
/usr/bin/python2.7: Python 2.7.6
</code></pre>

<p>But this is still only telling us what our current <code>python</code> resolution is. If we were in a Virtualenv (a common Python stack management system) <code>python</code> might resolve to a different version:</p>

<pre><code>$ readlink -f $(which python) | xargs -I % sh -c 'echo -n ""%: ""; % -V'
/home/oli/venv/bin/python: Python 2.7.4

<p>This is real output.</p>

<p>The fact is there could be hundreds of different versions of Python secreted around your system, either on paths that are contextually added, or living under different binary names (like <code>python3</code>).</p>

<p>If we assume that a Python binary is always going to be called <code>python&lt;something&gt;</code> and  be a binary file, we can just search the entire system for files that match those criteria:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo find / -type f -executable -iname 'python*' -exec file -i '{}' \; | awk -F: '/x-executable; charset=binary/ {print $1}' | xargs readlink -f | sort -u | xargs -I % sh -c 'echo -n ""%: ""; % -V'

"How to split larger files into smaller parts?","249039","","<p>I have a large file (8GB for Example). How can I split it into multiple parts, let's say 3 equal parts, and after that how do I integrate them later?</p>
","<p>There are several ways to accomplish this. Let's start with the basic ones.</p>

<h3>Using the <strong>split</strong> and <strong>cat</strong> commands:</h3>

<p>Lets says I have an image and its too big (10MB). All I do is:</p>

<pre><code>split --bytes=1M /path/to/image/image.jpg /path/to/image/prefixForNewImagePieces
</code></pre>

<p>and then to put it together I use cat:</p>

<pre><code>cat prefixFiles* &gt; newimage.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Assuming am inside the folder where the image is:</p>

<pre><code>split --bytes=1M myimage.jpg new
</code></pre>

<p>if the image is inside a directory called images you can also do this:</p>

<pre><code>split --bytes=1M images/myimage.jpg new
</code></pre>

<p>If the image is inside the directory /home/cyrex/images you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>split --bytes=1M /home/cyrex/images/myimage.jpg new
</code></pre>

<p>(In all the cases above it will split <code>myimage.jpg</code> in 1MB pieces and prefix the name of the pieces with the word new. So they would look like <code>newaa</code>, <code>newab</code>, <code>newac</code>, <code>newad</code>...)</p>

<p>If you are splitting a <strong>Text file</strong> and want to split it by lines you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>split -l 1000 book.txt new
</code></pre>

<p>Which will split the text file in output files of 1000 lines each. This is another way to split a file and is mostly used for text files like logs, sql dumps, csv files, etc..</p>

<p>Then I merge them   </p>

<pre><code>cat new* &gt; newimage.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>This is one way. You can even change the size of the splitted pieces. Just change the part that says <code>--bytes=1M</code> to <code>--bytes=1K</code> for 1 kilobyte or 1G for giga, or another number like <code>--bytes=4K</code> for 4KB pieces.</p>

<h3>Using <strong>Nautilus</strong></h3>

<p>Another way is the compress option in the gui of Nautilus. It gives you an option to split the file or files you want to compress into smaller megabyte sizes. Its simple and easy.</p>

<h3>Yet another way is using <strong>7z</strong></h3>

<p>Assuming you have an ISO image called <code>ubuntu.iso</code> you could do this:</p>

<pre><code>7z a -v5m -mx0 ubuntu.7z ubuntu.iso
</code></pre>

<p>This will create 5MB size files from the <code>ubuntu.iso</code>. The <code>-v5m</code> is the volume size so you can change it to 10, 12, 1, 3 and also the m can be changed to k for kilobytes, etc; the <code>-mx0</code> switch tells 7-Zip to use no compression, that is, just to split data into parts.</p>

<p>To extract just do</p>

<pre><code>7z x ubuntu.7z.001
</code></pre>

<p>this way you extract the first file and 7z starts extracting from the following files in order. You can also do</p>

<pre><code>7z e ubuntu.7z.001
</code></pre>

<p>which has the same effect here.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: </p>

<p>This happened immediately after I installed Ubuntu 12.04. I am very new to the Linux/Ubuntu world and a noob when it comes to these kind of stuff.</p>

<p>The Sources list in the Update Manager (and Software Center) settings was short. It only contained 2 lines with ""Canonical"" in it, 2 lines with ""Independent"" in it, and 2 other lines. I think the list was short because it was a freshly installed Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Connection to the internet seems fine and my friend whose laptop had just been installed with Ubuntu 12.04 around the same time as mine, seems to have no problem with his update. We share the same connection so I think internet connection issues couldn't have been the reason for the error.</p>

<p><strong>Attempted Solutions</strong>:</p>

<p>From <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/135932/apt-get-update-failure-to-fetch-cant-connect-to-any-sources"">here</a>, I explored around <code>/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d</code> and added in the <code>/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head</code> the following:</p>

<pre><code>nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
</code></pre>

<p>Error still occured.</p>

<p>From <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/128369/sudo-apt-get-update-error-on-ubuntu-12-04"">here</a> and <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/203635/cannot-update-12-04-due-to-failed-to-fetch-warning"">here</a>, I repeatedly changed which Mirror server to use in the Update manager and Software sources settings. Again, error still occured.</p>

<p>I also tried editing my sources list, unchecking the lines with ""independent"" on it(as suggested). According to <a href=""http://www.remastersys.com/forums/index.php?topic=2767.0"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>, I tried removing the <code>derb-src</code> lines in the sources list. Still, to no avail.</p>

<p>Lastly, <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/91543/apt-get-update-fails-to-fetch-files-temporary-failure-resolving-error"">this site</a> suggests running the following:</p>

<pre><code>echo ""nameserver 8.8.8.8"" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf &gt; /dev/null
or, for a permanent solution,
echo ""nameserver 8.8.8.8"" | sudo tee /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base &gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>Sadly, nothing worked for me. In all forums that I have been to, the answer related to <code>nameserver 8.8.8.8</code> seems to come up most often. Take note also that I really did not understand the solutions, what they meant or how are they done. I just simply followed them.</p>

<p>This is the output for <code>cat /etc/apt/sources.list</code>:</p>

<p>It has been pointed out that the answer is <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/208037/some-index-files-failed-to-download-while-updating"">here</a> but unfortunately that didn't work either. I tried choosing different servers but the ""choose server"" was never available. Searching for the best server yielded a ""No suitable server"" result. I think the mirror servers are fine and again, there seems to be no issue with internet connection. </p>

<p>Using <code>ping -c3 archive.ubuntu.com</code> and <code>ping -c3 8.8.8.8</code>  both yielded <code>0% packet loss</code>. The ping for 8.8.8.8 sometimes yielded <code>33% packet loss</code> but mostly 0%.</p>

<p>Typing <code>nslookup google.com</code> yields</p>

","<p><code>sudo apt-get update</code> finally worked! I just realized that the problem was not on the system but instead how the system connects and retrieves data from the internet. I just configured my Network settings and changed the proxy detection to <code>Manual</code> and filled in the <code>HTTP</code>, <code>HTTPS</code>, <code>FTP</code>, and <code>Socks Host</code> blanks the proxy that I use. When I updated again, this error output happened at first:</p>

<pre><code>E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/)
</code></pre>

<p>Well, not exactly like the same but similar to it (I copied above from <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/15433/how-do-i-fix-a-could-not-get-lock-var-lib-dpkg-lock-problem"">here</a>). But when I tried updating again, it finally worked(the reason I posted the error output above and not the exact output I saw) and I can now choose a different mirror server. If the Network proxy configuration was really the reason for my woes, well, I kinda felt stupid for such basic mistake.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks everybody for your help! :)</p>

"Running programs in the background from terminal","242302","","<p>How do I run a program in the background of a shell, with the ability to close the shell while leaving the program running?
Lets say my UI is having problems or for some reason, I need to boot up a program from the terminal window, say, <code>nm-applet</code>:</p>

<pre><code>nm-applet
</code></pre>

<p>When it's started, it occupies the foreground of the terminal window.</p>

<p>Is there any simple way to run the program in the background without needing to leave the terminal open or have it occupy the whole terminal?</p>

<p>On that note, I did find a way to run programs from the terminal and have it allow for other inputs, by appending an ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>) to the command as such:</p>

<pre><code>nm-applet &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>But this isn't much use as any processes started in the terminal are killed once the terminal is closed.
                                                                       </p>
","<p>I've recently come to like <code>setsid</code>. It starts off looking like you're just running something from the terminal but you can disconnect (close the terminal) and it just keeps going.</p>

<p>This is because the command actually forks out and while the input comes through to the current terminal, it's owned by a completely different parent (that remains alive after you close the terminal).</p>

<p>An example:</p>

<pre><code>setsid gnome-calculator
</code></pre>

<p>I'm also quite partial to <code>disown</code> which can be used to separate a process from the current tree. You use it in conjunction with the backgrounding ampersand:</p>

<pre><code>gnome-calculator &amp; disown
</code></pre>

<p>I also just learnt about spawning subshells with parenthesis. This simple method works:</p>

"How to set up USB for Virtualbox?","239536","","<p>I'm using Ubuntu Maverick and Virtual Box 3+. I have Windows 7 Ultimate. The problem is that it doesn't detect USB drives in Windows 7, but USB peripherals (mouse + keybord) are working.</p>

<p>I followed <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox/USB"">these instructions</a>, but I can't find the user group <code>vboxusers</code>. How can I continue? I would also like to upgrade to the latest version without any risk (without losing my virtual hard disk drive).</p>
","<h3>1. Install Extension Pack</h3>

<p><strong>USB 1.0</strong> is supported in the version installed from the Ubuntu repositories (from VirtualBox > 4.x).</p>

<p>For <strong>USB 2.0</strong> and <strong>USB 3.0</strong> we need to install the free (but closed source) <strong>VirtualBox Extension Pack</strong> (NOT the ""platform packages"") <a href=""http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads"" rel=""noreferrer"">from the VirtualBox download page</a>. If you had installed VirtualBox from the repositories you have to make sure to choose the extension pack for the right version of VirtualBox. You can see the version of your installed VirtualBox in the <code>help &gt; About VirtualBox</code> menu. For regular updates and bugfixes it is recommended to <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/41478/how-do-i-install-the-virtualbox-version-from-oracle-to-install-an-extension-pack"">install the most recent VirtualBox version from the Oracle repository</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>All virtual machines need to be powered off before installing the extension.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>2. Become a ""vboxuser""</h3>

<p>To be able to get access to an attached USB device, the Ubuntu <strong>host</strong> user needs to be in the <code>vboxusers</code> group. Add your user to this group by running the following command</p>

<pre><code>sudo usermod -aG vboxusers &lt;username&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>and <strong>reboot</strong> or logout/login.</p>

<h3>3. Activate USB support in VirtualBox Manager</h3>

<p>Shut down your virtual machine and open USB settings in the VirtualBox Manager. Tick <code>Enable USB Controller</code>and <code>USB 2.0 (EHCI) Controller</code> or <code>USB 3.0 (xHCI) Controller</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>If these settings are greyed out, you need to shut down the virtual machine</strong>.</p>

<h3>4. Select host USB device for access from the guest</h3>

<p>To grant access to USB devices we need to select a device to <strong>disable in the host</strong> and to <strong>enable in the guest</strong> (this is a precaution to avoid simultaneous access from host and guest). This can be done from the panel <em>Devices</em> menu or by right mouse click in the bottom panel of the VirtualBox Manager on the USB icon:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gyf5D.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Tick the device you need in the guest, untick it if you need it in the host. If you can't see your USB device in that list, it means that VirtualBox cannot access your host USB devices. Make sure your user is added to the <code>vboxusers</code> group and that you restarted your host.</p>

<p>The selected device will immediately be accessible from the guest. A Windows guest may need additional drivers.</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows 7 needs an <a href=""https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/65855/Intel-USB-3-0-eXtensible-Host-Controller-Driver"" rel=""noreferrer"">additional driver</a> for USB 3.0 support.</li>
<li>Windows 10 does not accept an NTFS formatted USB pen drive.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OgFLu.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h3>[optional] Use USB filters for permanent access in the guest</h3>

<p>By defining USB filters we can define USB devices that will automatically be presented to the guest when booting the guest OS.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aPBHN.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Click on the green <strong>+</strong> symbol on the right to add a known device. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note, that some devices may lead to a boot failure of the guest. We can not use these devices for filters.</p>

"How do I find the path to pg_hba.conf from the shell?","239159","","<p>I would like to obtain the path to pg_hba.conf from the shell. The path varies between versions of PostgreSQL. For instance, for 8.4 and 9.1:</p>

<pre><code>/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf
/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried the <code>pg_config</code> command, but it does not seem to include this information.</p>

<p>This is so that I can use a uniform command for opening <code>pg_hba.conf</code> and other PostgreSQL configuration files for editing.</p>

<p>I'm using bash.</p>
","<p><code>pg_config</code> is for compliation information, to help extensions and client programs compile and link against PostgreSQL. It knows nothing about the active PostgreSQL instance(s) on the machine, only the binaries.</p>

<p><code>pg_hba.conf</code> can appear in many other places depending on how Pg was installed. The standard location is <code>pg_hba.conf</code> within the <code>data_directory</code> of the database (which could be in <code>/home</code>, <code>/var/lib/pgsql</code>, <code>/var/lib/postgresql/[version]/</code>, <code>/opt/postgres/</code>, etc etc etc) but users and packagers can put it wherever they like. Unfortunately.</p>

<p>The only valid ways find <code>pg_hba.conf</code> is to ask a running PostgreSQL instance where it's <code>pg_hba.conf</code> is, or ask the sysadmin where it is. You can't even rely on asking where the datadir is and parsing <code>postgresql.conf</code> because an init script might passed a param like <code>-c hba_file=/some/other/path</code> when starting Pg.</p>

<p>What you want to do is ask PostgreSQL:</p>

<pre><code>SHOW hba_file;
</code></pre>

<p>This command must be run on a superuser session, so for shell scripting you might write something like:</p>

<pre><code>psql -t -P format=unaligned -c 'show hba_file';
</code></pre>

<p>and set the environment variables <code>PGUSER</code>, <code>PGDATABASE</code>, etc to ensure that the connection is right.</p>

<p>Yes, this is somewhat of a chicken-and-egg problem, in that if the user can't connect (say, after screwing up editing <code>pg_hba.conf</code>) you can't find <code>pg_hba.conf</code> in order to fix it.</p>

<p>Another option is to look at the <code>ps</code> command's output and see if the postmaster data directory argument <code>-D</code> is visible there, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>ps aux  | grep 'postgres *-D'
</code></pre>

<p>since <code>pg_hba.conf</code> will be inside the data directory (unless you're on Debian/Ubuntu or some derivative and using their packages).</p>

<p>If you're targeting specifically Ubuntu systems with PostgreSQL installed from Debian/Ubuntu packages it gets a little easier. You don't have to deal with hand-compiled-from-source Pg that someone's <code>initdb</code>'d a datadir for in their home dir, or an EnterpriseDB Pg install in /opt, etc. You can ask <code>pg_wrapper</code>, the Debian/Ubuntu multi-version Pg manager, where PostgreSQL is using <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/karmic/man1/pg_lsclusters.1.html"">the <code>pg_lsclusters</code> command</a> from <code>pg_wrapper</code>.</p>

<p>If you can't connect (Pg isn't running, or you need to edit <code>pg_hba.conf</code> to connect) you'll have to search the system for <code>pg_hba.conf</code> files. On Mac and Linux something like <code>sudo find / -type f -name pg_hba.conf</code> will do. Then check the <code>PG_VERSION</code> file in the same directory to make sure it's the right PostgreSQL version if you have more than one. (If <code>pg_hba.conf</code> is in <code>/etc</code>/, ignore this, it's the parent directory name instead). If you have more than one data directory for the same PostgreSQL version you'll have to look at database size, check the command line of the running postgres from <code>ps</code> to see if it's data directory <code>-D</code> argument matches where you're editing, etc.</p>

"How to install Google Drive on Ubuntu 14.04?","234538","","<p>I am using Ubuntu 14.04, I tried to search for Google Drive on Ubuntu Software Center, but couldnot find it.

","<p><strong>Updated 9/15/2015</strong> Due to Google's changing API you might be having problem during installation of Grive. So the site I was referencing have also changed their tutorial for installing Grive2. </p>

sudo apt-get update

"Where is the Ubuntu file system root directory in Windows NT subsystem and vice versa?","233378","","<p>I have installed Ubuntu subsystem on Windows 10 (after enabling feature in settings), but where is the Ubuntu file system root directory located in the drive?</p>
","<p>For Ubuntu installed from the Windows store:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each distribution you install through the store is installed to that
  application's appdata directory. For example:
  <code>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState</code> <a href=""https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/402#issuecomment-321853125"" rel=""noreferrer"">- benhillis</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In earlier iterations of Windows Subsystem for Linux, the Ubuntu file system was at <code>%localappdata%\Lxss</code> (e.g., <code>C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Lxss</code> - replace the <strong>Username</strong> with your Username on Windows). See <a href=""https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/2016/06/15/wsl-file-system-support/"" rel=""noreferrer"">the WSL blog post on File System Support</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The primary file system used by WSL is VolFs. It is used to store the
  Linux system files, as well as the content of your Linux home
  directory. As such, VolFs supports most features the Linux VFS
  provides, including Linux permissions, symbolic links, FIFOs, sockets,
  and device files.</p>
  
  <p>VolFs is used to mount the VFS root directory, using
  <code>%LocalAppData%\lxss\rootfs</code> as the backing storage. In addition, a
  few additional VolFs mount points exist, most notably <code>/root</code> and
  <code>/home</code> which are mounted using <code>%LocalAppData%\lxss\root</code> and
  <code>%LocalAppData%\lxss\home</code> respectively. The reason for these separate
  mounts is that when you uninstall WSL, the home directories are not
  removed by default, so any personal files stored there will be
  preserved.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>CAUTION</h2>

<p>Creating/modifying any files within the Linux subsystem using Windows apps &amp; tools can cause Data corruption and data loss in Ubuntu subsystem! (Thanks to <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/759880/where-is-the-ubuntu-file-system-root-directory-in-windows-nt-subsystem-and-vice/759885#comment1299704_759885"">Rich Turner</a> for suggesting these words of caution!) <strong>This is absolutely <em>not</em> supported.</strong> From the same blog post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Interoperability with Windows</h3>
  
  <p>While VolFs files are stored in regular files on Windows in the
  directories mentioned above, interoperability with Windows is not
  supported. If a new file is added to one of these directories from
  Windows, it lacks the EAs needed by VolFs, so VolFs doesn’t know what
  to do with the file and simply ignores it. Many editors will also
  strip the EAs when saving an existing file, again making the file
  unusable in WSL.</p>

<p>Your Windows file system is located at <code>/mnt/c</code> in the Bash shell environment.</p>

<p>Editing the resolution in system settings via <em>right click > appearance -> all settings</em> (since I can only partially see the desktop) the actual resolution changes but the whole desktop still does not fit.</p>

<p>Is there a way to start a GUI software on a remote Linux PC via SSH?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>Yes. You just need to run <code>export DISPLAY=:0</code> (or whatever the remote display is numbered as) in your ssh session and programs run will run on the remote display. A quick example:</p>

<pre><code>oli@bert:~$ ssh tim
oli@tim:~$ export DISPLAY=:0
oli@tim:~$ firefox
</code></pre>

<p>Firefox is now running on <code>tim</code>'s display.</p>

<p>However when you close your ssh session, most of the time the remote application will close. If you want to disconnect from ssh but leave the application running you need to launch it in a special way using something like screen (keeps the ssh session running in the background) or <code>nohup</code>, or another method.

<p>I need a step-by-step tutorial if somebody has one.</p>
","<p>The first thing You need to do is install the packages we need. </p>

<p>Open up a terminal and type:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
</code></pre>

<p>There are two main files <code>/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server</code> and <code>/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</code> which we will need to configure so lets take the first. </p>

<p>Open up a terminal and using your favorite text editor type:</p>

<pre><code>sudo vim /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
</code></pre>

<p>You should get the following:</p>

<pre><code>#Defaults for dhcp initscript
#sourced by /etc/init.d/dhcp
#installed at /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server by the maintainer scripts
#
#This is a POSIX shell fragment
#
#On what interfaces should the DHCP server (dhcpd) serve DHCP requests""
#Separate multiple interfaces with spaces, e.g. “eth0 eth1"".
INTERFACES=""eth0""
</code></pre>

<p>Replace <strong>eth0</strong> above with the name of your network interface that you want the server to lease addresses on. Onto the next file.<br></p>

<p>Open up a terminal and type:</p>

<pre><code>sudo vim /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
</code></pre>

<p>which should give you the output below.</p>

<pre><code>#
#Sample configuration file for ISC dhcpd for Debian
#
#Attention: If /etc/ltsp/dhcpd.conf exists, that will be used as
#configuration file instead of this file.
#
#

option domain-name-servers ns1.example.org, ns2.example.org;
option domain-name “comtech.com”;

max-lease-time 7200;
log-facility local7;
subnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {

option ntp-servers 10.0.0.1;
option netbios-name-servers 10.0.0.1;
option netbios-node-type 8;
 ......
}
</code></pre>

<p>This needs a little bit of explaining.<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Adjust your settings according to your network requirements.<br></li>
  <li>The option domain name is your dns zone name. For example mine is set to comtech.com.<br></li>
  <li>Range should be the range of ip addresses that you want the server to give out to clients.<br></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Now restart the dhcp service by typing:</p>

<pre><code>sudo service isc-dhcp-server restart

<p><strong>UPD</strong>: Key idea is that file names can be long so I actually dont want to type them.</p>
","<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>rm -f 2.mp3 blabla.mp3
</code></pre>

<p><code>rm</code> removes files, and <code>-f</code> forces it to (so that it wont stop, asking you if you want to delete the file). If this not in your home directory, prepend <code>sudo</code>. Here is another way that might require less typing (a bit harder to read though)</p>

<pre><code>rm -f {2,blabla}.mp3
</code></pre>

<p>This expands to <code>2.mp3 blabla.mp3</code>. If you want to use larger filenames, you can use the wildcard character (<code>*</code>), which will return all items starting/ending with the filename you chose. For example:</p>

<pre><code>rm -f bla*
</code></pre>

<p>will remove all files starting with <code>bla</code>. If you used this:</p>

<pre><code>rm -f *.mp3
</code></pre>

<p>It will remove all files ending with <code>.mp3</code>. If you used this:</p>

<pre><code>rm -f bla*.mp3
</code></pre>

<p>It will remove all files starting with <code>bla</code> and ending with <code>.mp3</code>. Possibilities are nearly endless with the <code>*</code> character :P</p>

"What is LVM and what is it used for?","227485","","<p>As a Linux/Ubuntu newbie, what is LVM and what is it used for?</p>

<p>In terms of a web server installation, what benefits does it provide?</p>

<p>Would you recommend using it?</p>
","<h1>Benefits</h1>

<p>You can think of LVM as ""dynamic partitions"", meaning that you can
create/resize/delete LVM ""partitions"" (they're called ""Logical
Volumes"" in LVM-speak) from the command line <em>while your Linux system
is running</em>: no need to reboot the system to make the kernel aware of
the newly-created or resized partitions.</p>

<p>Other nice features that LVM ""Logical Volumes"" provide are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you have more than one hard-disk, Logical Volumes can extend
 over more than one disk: i.e., they are not limited by the size of
 one single disk, rather by the total aggregate size.</p></li>
<li><p>You can set up ""striped""  LVs, so that I/O can be distributed to
 all disks hosting the LV in parallel. (Similar to RAID-0, but a
 bit easier to set-up.)</p></li>
<li><p>You can create a (read-only) snapshot of any LV.  You can revert
 the original LV to the snapshot at a later time, or delete the
 snapshot if you no longer need it.  This is handy for server
 backups for instance (you cannot stop all your applications from
 writing, so you create a snapshot and backup the snapshot LV),
 but can also be used to provide a ""safety net"" before a critical
 system upgrade (clone the root partition, upgrade, revert if
 something went wrong).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>While being most useful on server systems, I think that features
1. and 3., combined with LVM's ability to create/resize/delete LVs on
the fly, are quite handy on desktop systems as well.  (Especially if
you experiment a lot with the system.)</p>

<h1>Downsides</h1>

<p>Of course, all of this comes at a price: the initial setup of LVM is
more complex than just partitioning a disk, and you will definitely
need to understand the LVM terminology and model (Logical Volumes,
Physical Volumes, Volume Groups) before you can <em>start</em> using it.
(Once it is set up, using it is much easier, though.)</p>

<p>Also, if you use LVM across hard drives, you may lose all your data when only one drive fails.</p>

"How to uninstall a .deb package?","226985","","<p>Suppose I download a .deb package from a website and install it. (I assume that when I double click the .deb file, the package is installed through a GUI that interfaces with dpkg right?)</p>

<p>How can I uninstall it?</p>
","<p>Manually installed packages appear in the Software Centre, along with all the others. Just search the software centre for your package and remove it there. </p>

<p>You may have to click on ""Show N technical items""</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tIkxx.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Along with this, there are a few other methods:</p>

<p>Synaptic:</p>

<ul>
<li>Go to System → Administration → Synaptic Package Manager</li>
<li>Click the <em>Status</em> button and select ""Installed (local or obsolete)""</li>
<li>Right click a package and select ""mark for removal"".</li>
<li><p>Click the <em>Apply</em> button.</p>

<p>This will have the benefit of listing all of your manually installed packages:</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jBsNM.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Command Line</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can either use <code>sudo apt-get remove packagename</code> if you know the name of the package, or if you don't, search for it using <code>apt-cache search crazy-app</code> and then remove it using apt get</p></li>
<li><p>You can also use <code>dpkg --remove packagename</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qKsmx.png"" alt=""@GorgeEdison it&#39;s a security risk! :P @EveryoneElse, never mind I&#39;m kidding :)""></p>

<p>This will also let you know if there are any unneeded packages left on your system, which were possibly installed as dependencies of your .deb package. Use <code>sudo apt-get autoremove</code> to get rid of them.</p>

","<h1>Wireless Info Script</h1>

<p>The easiest and most complete method of gathering information to help diagnose wireless issues is to run the <a href=""https://github.com/UbuntuForums/wireless-info"" rel=""noreferrer"">wireless info script</a> we created at the Ubuntu Forums to collect all the most common information needed while <em>masking all sensitive data</em>.</p>

<p>Open a terminal with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> and run these commands:</p>

<pre><code>wget -N -t 5 -T 10 https://github.com/UbuntuForums/wireless-info/raw/master/wireless-info &amp;&amp;
  chmod +x wireless-info &amp;&amp;
  ./wireless-info
</code></pre>

<p>This will create the file ""wireless-info.txt"" at the location it is run from, and depending on its size, an additional archive called ""wireless-info.tar.gz"". Sensitive information like MAC addresses and WPA/WEP keys are masked automatically.</p>

<p><strong>If you cannot connect to the internet</strong> with the affected system, including via a wired connection, you will have to move files between it and a system connected to the internet. A USB stick would likely be the easiest method for this.</p>

<p>Post the results on <a href=""http://paste.ubuntu.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">paste.ubuntu.com</a> or <a href=""http://pastebin.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">pastebin.com</a>, and link to it here in your question.</p>

<p>Further details on the script: <a href=""https://github.com/UbuntuForums/wireless-info"" rel=""noreferrer"">GitHub page</a>.</p>

"How do I use the latest GCC on Ubuntu?","225926","","<p>I want to compile my program with the latest version of <code>gcc</code>.</p>

<p>Ubuntu 14.04 comes with gcc 4.8.2, however there's 4.9.0 available, moreover, I see that it is available as a package: <a href=""https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gcc-4.9""><code>gcc-4.9</code></a>. I tried to install it</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Looks like it is already installed, just not as the default one? How do I utilize it to build my program?</p>
","<p>The best way to correctly install gcc-4.9 and set it as your default gcc version use:</p>

<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-4.9 g++-4.9
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.9 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.9
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>--slave</code>, with <code>g++</code>, will cause <code>g++</code> to be switched along with <code>gcc</code>, to the same version. But, at this point gcc-4.9 will be your only version configured in <code>update-alternatives</code>, so add 4.8 to <code>update-alternatives</code>, so there actually is an alternative, by using:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install gcc-4.8 g++-4.8
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can check which one that is set, and change back and forth using:</p>

<pre><code>sudo update-alternatives --config gcc
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: You could skip installing the PPA Repository and just use <code>/usr/bin/gcc-4.9-base</code> but I prefer using the fresh updated toolchains.</p>

<hr>

<p>For GCC 5.X or 6, the packages (and correspondingly, the commands) are just called <code>gcc-5</code>, <code>gcc-6</code>, etc. This is due to the change in <a href=""https://gcc.gnu.org/develop.html#num_scheme"">GCC's version scheme</a>, where 5.1 is the first GCC 5 release, and <a href=""https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-announce/2015/msg00000.html"">future 5.X releases are for bug fixes</a>.</p>

Since Ubuntu version 11.10 (Oneiric), <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MultiarchSpec"">Multi Arch</a> has been added. One of the objectives for it is removing the <code>ia32-libs</code> package.

<p>You don't have to worry about this for packages in the standard repositories (e.g. the <code>wine</code> package).

"In SSH, how do I mv to my local system?","222183","","<p>I <code>ssh</code>-ed into my webhost's directory, and <code>tar</code>-ed the webapp to download. When I try to <code>mv</code> to <code>~/mydirectory/backups</code> or <code>/home/mydirectory/backups</code>, it defines the ""home"" as my root on the webhost that I'm ssh'ed into.</p>

<p>How do I mv in ssh to a local drive while still being inside the webhost's system?</p>
","<p>First things first: ssh is a way to remotely login to another computer. The shell (command line) you get after you ssh is (pretty much) the same as if you had opened a xterm in the remote machine. If offers no such way to move files.</p>

<p>However, the fact that the remote computer accepts ssh connections gives you some options to exchange files:</p>

<p><strong>Use scp</strong> 
To copy from your local computer to the remote, type, in the local computer:</p>

<p><code>scp /tmp/file user@example.com:/home/name/dir</code></p>

<p>(where /tmp/file can be replaced with any local file and /home/name/dir with any remote directory)</p>

<p>To copy from the remote computer to the local one, type, in the <em>local</em> computer:</p>

<p><code>scp user@example.com:/home/name/dir/file /tmp</code></p>

<p><strong>Use sshfs</strong>
This is a little more advanced but much, much nicer (when the internet connection of both computers is good. If not, stick to scp)</p>

<p>You can ""link"" a directory from the remote computer to an (empty) directory of the local computer. Say you ""link"" the /some/remote/dir from the remote computer to /home/youruser/remotecomp in your computer. If there is a file /some/remote/dir/file in the remote computer, you can see it on /home/youruser/remotecomp/file. You can copy and mv as usual, and you can even alter remote files and dirs. </p>

<p>Note however, that when the connection ends, /home/youruser/remotecomp becomes an empty dir again, and you only keep in the local computer the files you copied to other directories</p>

<p>To achieve this:</p>

<p>1) install sshfs:</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install sshfs</code></p>

<p>2) create a empty dir </p>

<p><code>mkdir /home/youruser/remotecomp</code></p>

<p>3) ""link"" the two directories (the right term is mount)</p>

<p><code>sshfs user@server.com:/some/remote/dir /home/youruser/remotecomp</code></p>

<p>4) Enjoy</p>

<p>5) ""unlink"" the dirs</p>

<p><code>fusermount -u /home/youruser/remotecomp</code></p>

"What are the differences between ""su"", ""sudo -s"", ""sudo -i"", ""sudo su""?","220107","","<p>I already read it from manual but I can't see difference..</p>

<p><code>su</code> - change user ID or become superuser</p>

<pre><code>sudo -s [command]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>-s</code> (shell) option runs the shell specified by the SHELL environment variable if it is set or the shell as specified in passwd(5).  If a
                   command is specified, it is passed to the shell for execution.  Otherwise, an interactive shell is executed.</p>

<p><code>sudo -i</code> <em>disappear description in manual</em></p>
","<p>The main difference between these commands is in the way they restrict access to their functions.</p>

<p><code>su</code> <em>(which means ""substitute user"" or ""switch user"")</em> - does exactly that, it starts another shell instance with privileges of the target user. To ensure you have the rights to do that, it asks you for the password <strong>of the target user</strong>. So, to become root, you need to know root password. If there are several users on your machine who need to run commands as root, they all need to know root password - note that it'll be the same password. If you need to revoke admin permissions from one of the users, you need to change root password and tell it only to those people who need to keep access - messy.</p>

<p><code>sudo</code> <em>(hmm... what's the mnemonic? Super-User-DO?)</em> is completely different. It uses a config file (/etc/sudoers) which lists which users have rights to specific actions (run commands as root, etc.) When invoked, it asks for <strong>the password of the user who started it</strong>  - to ensure the person at the terminal is really the same ""joe"" who's listed in <code>/etc/sudoers</code>. To revoke admin privileges from a person, you just need to edit the config file (or remove the user from a group which is listed in that config). This results in much cleaner management of privileges.</p>

<p>As a result of this, in many Debian-based systems <code>root</code> user has no password set - i.e. it's not possible to login as root directly.</p>

<p>Also, <code>/etc/sudoers</code> allows to specify some additional options - i.e. user X is only able to run program Y etc.</p>

<p>The often-used <code>sudo su</code> combination works as follows: first <code>sudo</code> asks you for <em>your</em> password, and, if you're allowed to do so, invokes the next command (<code>su</code>) as a super-user. Because <code>su</code> is invoked by <code>root</code>, it does not require you to enter the target user's password. So, <code>sudo su</code> allows you to open a shell as another user (including root), if you're allowed super-user access by the <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file.</p>

"How do I install fonts?","219722","","<p>Question says it all. I need them to be available in gimp.</p>
","<p>Many fonts are packaged for Ubuntu and available via the ""Fonts"" category of the Ubuntu Software Center. If you prefer <code>apt-get</code>, search for packages starting with <em>otf-</em> or <em>ttf-</em>.</p>

<p>Font files that are placed in the hidden <code>.fonts</code> directory of your home folder will automatically be available. You can also place them in the <code>.local/share/fonts</code> directory on newer versions of Ubuntu per the comments below.</p>

<p>You can also double-click on the font file (or select <em>Open with Font Viewer</em> in the right-click menu). Then click the <strong>Install Font</strong> button.</p>

<p>If you need the fonts to be available system-wide, you'll need to copy them to <code>/usr/local/share/fonts</code> and reboot (or manually rebuild the font cache with <code>fc-cache -f -v</code>).</p>

<p>You can confirm they are installed correctly by running <code>fc-list | grep ""Source Code Pro""</code></p>

<p>You may need to restart some programs, like OpenOffice Writer, before they actually show the new fonts (usually such programs are caching the font list when they start up).</p>

<p>Anyway, if autologon is disabled, the last used session is launched, and that's fine. I just want to choose which is default with autologon.</p>
","<p>The list of sessions is described in the directory <code>/usr/share/xsessions</code>.</p>

<li>For gnome-classic the session file is called <em>gnome-classic.desktop</em></li>
<li>For gnome-classic (no effects) aka gnome-fallback the session file is called <em>gnome-fallback.desktop</em></li>
<li>For unity-3d the session file is called <em>ubuntu.desktop</em></li>
<li>For Lubuntu the session file is called <em>Lubuntu.desktop</em></li>
<li>For LXDE the session file is called <em>LXDE.desktop</em></li>

<pre><code>curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolargo/glancesautoinstall/master/install.sh | sudo /bin/bash
</code></pre>

<p>OR</p>

<pre><code>wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolargo/glancesautoinstall/master/install.sh | sudo /bin/bash
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Manual Installation</strong> </p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install python-pip build-essential python-dev lm-sensors
sudo pip install psutil logutils bottle batinfo https://bitbucket.org/gleb_zhulik/py3sensors/get/tip.tar.gz zeroconf netifaces pymdstat influxdb elasticsearch potsdb statsd pystache docker-py pysnmp pika py-cpuinfo bernhard
sudo pip install glances
</code></pre>

<h3>Basic usage</h3>

<p>To start <code>glances</code> simply type <code>glances</code> in terminal.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6u3bs.jpg"" alt=""screenshot""></p>

<p>In glances you’ll see a lot of information about the resources of your system: CPU, Load, Memory, Swap Network, Disk I/O and Processes all in one page, by default the color code means:</p>

<pre><code>GREEN : the statistic is “OK”
BLUE : the statistic is “CAREFUL” (to watch)
VIOLET : the statistic is “WARNING” (alert)
RED : the statistic is “CRITICAL” (critical)
</code></pre>

<p>When Glances is running, you can press some special keys to give commands to it:</p>

<pre><code>c: Sort processes by CPU%  
m: Sort processes by MEM%  
p: Sort processes by name  
i: Sort processes by IO Rate  
d: Show/hide disk I/O stats  
f: Show/hide file system stats  
n: Show/hide network stats  
s: Show/hide sensors stats  
b: Bit/s or Byte/s for network IO  
w: Delete warning logs  
x: Delete warning and critical logs  
1: Global CPU or Per Core stats  
h: Show/hide this help message  
q: Quit (Esc and Ctrl-C also work)  
l: Show/hide log messages
</code></pre>

<h3>Disk Monitoring</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dOhiX.jpg"" alt=""screenshot""></p>

<h3>System Heat Monitoring</h3>

<p>If you type <code>glances --help</code> you will find ( <code>-e</code> Enable the sensors module (Linux-only) )</p>

<pre><code>glances -e

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CMHTb.jpg"" alt=""screenshot""></p>

<h3>Configuration file</h3>

<p>You can set your thresholds in Glances configuration file, on GNU/Linux, the default configuration file is located in <code>/etc/glances/glances.conf</code>. </p>

<h3>Client/server mode</h3>

<p>Another interesting feature of this monitoring tool is that you can start it in server mode just typing <code>glances -s</code>, this will give an output like Glances server is running on 0.0.0.0:61209 and now you can connect to it from another computer using glances -c @server where @server is the IP address or hostname of the server.</p>

<p>Glances uses a XML/RPC server and can be used by another client software.
In server mode, you can set the bind address (-B ADDRESS) and listening TCP port (-p PORT), the default binding address is 0.0.0.0 (Glances will listen on all the networks interfaces) and TCP port is 61209.
In client mode, you can set the TCP port of the server (-p port).
In client/server mode, limits are set by the server side.
The version 1.6 introduces a optional password to access to the server (-P password) that if set on the server must be used also on the client.</p>

"How to install specific Ubuntu packages, with exact version?","215979","","<p>I want to setup a new virtual machine with some specified packages (name and version), that are provided.</p>

<p>For example apache2 in version <code>2.2.20-1ubuntu1</code> with all dependencies. Even if there is a new version of this package on the servers this one should be installed.</p>

<p>The solution has to work/scale with multiple (n) ""setups"". Another virtual machine might need an older version of apache2.</p>

<p>I currently know of some possibilities that install the exact packages, but do not scale that good:</p>

<ol>
<li>Copy all required <code>*.deb</code> to every virtual machine manually and enter: <code>dpkg -i</code> ... -> Could work, but it is very error prone. (Manual scripts etc.)</li>
<li>Create and use a new Ubuntu repository for each setup. -> Does not work because I would need n repositories.</li>
<li>Setup the machine once and copy the VM / create a snapshot. -> Does not work because I would need to store n VMs.</li>
</ol>

<p>My problem could be labeled as patch management, but I do not want to update my packages to the current version. My goal is to install old packages.</p>
","<p>You can use <code>apt-get</code> to install a specific version of the package a long as it is in an archive that apt knows about.  From the <code>apt-get</code> manpage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A specific version of a package can be selected for installation by following  the package name with an equals and the version of the package to select.  This will cause that version to be located and selected for install.  Alternatively a specific distribution can be selected by following the package name with a slash and the version of the  distribution or the Archive name (stable, frozen, unstable).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, you could do:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install apache2=2.2.20-1ubuntu1
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you may need to do some dependency resolution on your own in this case, but if there are any problems apt-get will tell you what is causing them.  On my 11.10 system I would need to do the following to get this to work:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install apache2=2.2.20-1ubuntu1 \
                     apache2.2-common=2.2.20-1ubuntu1 \
                     apache2.2-bin=2.2.20-1ubuntu1 \

"How do I run specific sudo commands without a password?","215475","","<p>On one particular machine I often need to run <code>sudo</code> commands every now and then.
I am fine with entering password on <code>sudo</code> in most of the cases.</p>

<p>However there are <strong>three <code>sudo</code> commands</strong> I want to run <strong>without entering password</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>sudo reboot</code></li>
<li><code>sudo shutdown -r now</code></li>
<li><code>sudo shutdown -P now</code></li>
</ul>

<p>How can I exclude these commands from password protection to <code>sudo</code>?</p>
","<h2>Use the <code>NOPASSWD</code> directive</h2>

<p>You can use the <code>NOPASSWD</code> directive in your <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man5/sudoers.5.html""><code>/etc/sudoers</code> file</a>.</p>

<p>If your user is called <code>user</code> and your host is called <code>host</code> you could add these lines to <code>/etc/sudoers</code>:</p>

<pre><code>user host = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown
user host = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot
</code></pre>

<p>This will allow the user <code>user</code> to run the desired commands on <code>host</code> without entering a password. All other <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man8/sudo.8.html""><code>sudo</code></a>ed commands will still require a password.</p>

<p>The commands specified in the <code>sudoers</code> file <em>must</em> be fully qualified (i.e. using the absolute path to the command to run) as described in the <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man5/sudoers.5.html""><code>sudoers</code> man page</a>. Providing a relative path is considered a syntax error.</p>

<p>If the command ends with a trailing <code>/</code> character and points to a directory, the user will be able to run any command in that directory (but not in any sub-directories therein). In the following example, the user <code>user</code> can run any command in the directory <code>/home/someuser/bin/</code>:</p>

<pre><code>user host = (root) NOPASSWD: /home/someuser/bin/
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Always use the command <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man8/visudo.8.html""><code>visudo</code></a> to edit the <code>sudoers</code> file to make sure you do not lock yourself out of the system – just in case you accidentally write something incorrect to the <code>sudoers</code> file. <code>visudo</code> will save your modified file to a temporary location and will <em>only</em> overwrite the real <code>sudoers</code> file if the modified file can be parsed without errors.</p>

<h2>Using <code>/etc/sudoers.d</code> instead of modifying <code>/etc/sudoers</code></h2>

<p>As an alternative to editing the <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file, you could add the two lines to a new file in <code>/etc/sudoers.d</code> e.g. <code>/etc/sudoers.d/shutdown</code>. This is an elegant way of separating different changes to the <code>sudo</code> rights and also leaves the original <code>sudoers</code> file untouched for easier upgrades.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Again, you should use the command <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man8/visudo.8.html""><code>visudo</code></a> to edit the file to make sure you do not lock yourself out of the system:</p>

<pre><code>sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/shutdown 
</code></pre>

<p>This also automatically ensures that the owner and permissions of the new file is set correctly.</p>

<h2>If <code>sudoers</code> is messed up</h2>

<p>If you did not use <code>visudo</code> to edit your files and then accidentally messed up <code>/etc/sudoers</code> or messed up a file in <code>/etc/sudoers.d</code> then you will be locked out of <code>sudo</code>.</p>

<p>The solution could be to fix the files using <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man1/pkexec.1.html""><code>pkexec</code></a> which is an alternative to <code>sudo</code>.</p>

<p>To fix <code>/etc/sudoers</code>:</p>

<pre><code>pkexec visudo
</code></pre>

<p>To fix <code>/etc/sudoers.d/shutdown</code>:</p>

<pre><code>pkexec visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/shutdown
</code></pre>

<p>If the ownership and/or permissions are incorrect for any <code>sudoers</code> file, the file will be ignored by <code>sudo</code> so you might also find yourself locked out in this situation. Again, you can use <code>pkexec</code> to fix this.</p>

<p>The correct permissions should be like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -l /etc/sudoers.d/shutdown 
-r--r----- 1 root root 86 Jul 16 15:37 /etc/sudoers.d/shutdown
</code></pre>

<p>Use <code>pkexec</code> like this to fix <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions"">ownership and permissions</a>:</p>

<pre><code>pkexec chown root:root /etc/sudoers.d/shutdown
pkexec chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/shutdown

","<p>The routes look fine. I'll assume that those IP addresses are private ones (LAN) and not public accessible.</p>

<p>Since you're connected in different ways to the network (wifi / wired), it's very likely that your router has separated wired / wireless networks. Try connecting both of them on a wired (or wireless) connection. Another possibility is that a firewall on the Ubuntu machines is blocking connections.</p>

<p>Otherwise, configure your router to use the same network (subnet) for wireless and wired connections. Also make sure that the router does not block client-to-client communication.</p>

<p>Your router is possibly dropping all unsolicited packets, that's why your friend gets a ""connection timed out"" message on your public IP address. Configure NAT port forwarding so that the public IP address + port combination forwards to your LAN address.</p>

<p>Example network:</p>

<pre><code>YOUR NETWORK (A)
    Router A (public address: 198.51.100.1)
    Desktop A - 10.0.0.2
    Laptop  A - 10.0.0.3

YOUR FRIENDS NETWORK (B)
    Router B (public address: 203.0.113.1)
    Machine B - 192.168.0.2
</code></pre>

<p>On <em>Router A</em>, setup NAT forwarding:</p>

<pre><code>To make your desktop accessible:
  forward the public port 22 to 10.0.0.2
To make your laptop accessible:
  forward the public port 2222 to 10.0.0.3
</code></pre>

<p>If you've a firewall (<code>ufw</code>, <code>iptables</code>, ...) on the machines set, allow incoming traffic to port 22 (Desktop A) and port 2222 (Laptop A).</p>

<p>The desktop can now be accessed using SSH with:</p>

<pre><code>ssh user@198.51.100.1 -p 22
</code></pre>

<p>The laptop can now be accessed using SSH with:</p>

<pre><code>ssh user@198.51.100.1 -p 2222

<p>I'd like to change <kbd>PgUp</kbd> to <kbd>Home</kbd> or <kbd>PgDown</kbd> to <kbd>End</kbd>.</p>

<p>Does a built-in command or a tool exist reassign keys in Ubuntu/GNOME?</p>
","<p><strong>Notice:</strong> As of 2013, Ubuntu and derivatives no longer use <code>xmodmap</code>, but instead use <code>xkb</code>. For more information see <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/325272/permanent-xmodmap-in-ubuntu-13-04/347382#347382?newreg=4eb097870a15490ebbe39d78412f9797"">this answer</a>. The answer below is no longer relevant for current releases.</p>

<hr>

<p>For remapping certain keys you need two tools. First <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/en/man1/xev.1.html""><strong>xev</strong></a> (command-line tool) and second <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/en/man1/xmodmap.1.html""><strong>xmodmap</strong></a> (also command-line tool). Both should be available in Ubuntu without extra installing them.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start terminal window and run <code>xev</code>. Now it's active and waits for you to press a key. Then press the key whose behaviour you want to change. i.e. <kbd>PgUp</kbd>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>xev</code> will output some information about the pressed key. The third line is important. It should look similar to:</p>

<pre><code>state 0x10, keycode 110 (keysym 0xff55, Prior), same_screen YES,
</code></pre>

<p>in this example <code>Prior</code> is the name of the behaviour the key is assigned to at the moment, the number keycode is the internal id to recognize the key.
Now do this with another key i.e. <kbd>PgDown</kbd> give this output</p>

<pre><code>state 0x10, keycode 115 (keysym 0xff56, Next), same_screen YES,
</code></pre>

<p>Here again the interesting part for us is <code>keycode 115</code> and <code>Next</code> - the name of the behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p>now when you want to swap the two keys use <code>xmodmap</code>. </p>

<pre><code> xmodmap -e ""keycode 110 = Next""
</code></pre>

<p>This changes the key with keycode 110 on your keyboard to the action <code>Next</code>. It's pretty simple.</p>

<p>Note that if the key you are mapping should have a different meaning when used with the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key (for example for British keyboard layouts, <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd> gives quotation marks) then you can simply list the secondary command after the first. For example if you want the key with code 53 to map to backslash normally, but to the bar symbol when used with shift, you might do:</p>

<pre><code> xmodmap -e ""keycode 53 = backslash bar""
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Additional information:</strong> The sequence of these mappings is <kbd>Key</kbd>, <kbd>Shift+Key</kbd>, <kbd>mode_switch+Key</kbd>, <kbd>mode_switch+Shift+Key</kbd>, <kbd>AltGr+Key</kbd>, <kbd>AltGr+Shift+Key</kbd>. To skip a column use <code>NoSymbol</code>. Moreover, <a href=""http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/List_of_keysyms"">here</a> is a comprehensive list of all keysyms.</p>

<p><strong>Note: These change are for the active X session only and will be lost after reboot.
When you want to save the changes permanently you have to run the following commands after the ones above:</strong></p>

<pre><code>xmodmap -pke &gt;~/.Xmodmap
</code></pre>

<p>(it creates a file named <code>.Xmodmap</code> in your home directory (<code>~</code>))</p>

<p>Then you have to create a file named <strong><code>.xinitrc</code></strong> in your home directory where you put command <code>xmodmap .Xmodmap</code> in.</p>

<p>You can now modify <code>.Xmodmap</code> and run <code>xmodmap .Xmodmap</code> from console to see the changes immediately. The changes in <code>.Xmodmap</code> will persist.</p>

<p>source: <a href=""http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=7675138&amp;postcount=2"">Ubuntu Foruns</a></p>

<h2>Bonus stuff:</h2>

<p>If the key you are remapping has different behavior depending on a state (
like how the keys in the numeric keyboard depend on NumLock) you simply have to do <strong><code>xmodmap -pm</code></strong> to get a list of modifiers and then do: </p>

<p><code>xmodmap -e ""KEYCODE MODIFIER = behaviour behaviour_with_modifier""</code></p>

<p>Suppose, for example, that you want to get a period instead of a comma on the numeric keyboard (useful for most programmers), but you want to keep the ""delete"" behavior when NumLock is off. </p>

<pre><code>xmodmap -e ""keycode 91 mod2 = KP_Delete period""
</code></pre>

<p><code>mod2</code>, because <code>xmodmap -pm</code> tells us that <code>mod2</code> is <code>Num_Lock</code>, the other names are obtained by pressing the keys in <code>xev</code>.</p>

"How to install an init.d script?","214767","","<p>I am trying to install an init.d script, to run celery for scheduling tasks.
Here is the steps I followed:</p>

<ul>
<li>copied the file <a href=""https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/3.0/extra/generic-init.d/celeryd"" rel=""noreferrer"">celeryd</a> and pasted it in folder <strong>/etc/init.d/</strong></li>
<li>created a configuration file <strong>celeryd</strong> in folder <strong>/etc/default/</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>now when I tried to start it by <code>sudo /etc/init.d/celeryd start</code>, it throws error <code>sudo: /etc/init.d/celeryd: command not found</code></p>

<p>I googled about how to install init.d, I got this <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5817879/how-do-i-set-up-a-init-d-script-for-a-program"">SO-question</a>.</p>

<p>it says to issue a <code>uname -a</code> and when I does I get this:</p>

<pre><code>Linux capsonesystem8-desktop 3.2.0-43-generic-pae

</code></pre>

<p>and also it says use utils like <code>insserv</code> to enable init.d script
so tried:</p>

<p><code>insserv /etc/init.d/celeryd</code> but it throws error <code>insserv: command not found</code></p>

<p>so I tried to install <strong>insserv</strong> <code>sudo apt-get install insserv</code>. but it say aleady installed:</p>

<pre><code>insserv is already the newest version.
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 222 not upgraded.

<p>So how to install init.d script?? Any help will be appreciated.</p>

<p>when I tried:</p>

<pre><code>$ sh -x /etc/init.d/celeryd start

<p>it reveal some <code>errors</code>. may be that is why the service won’t start.</p>

<h3>update2:</h3>

<p>I cleared all the errors when I run <code>$ sh -x /etc/init.d/celeryd start</code> but still <code>sudo /etc/init.d/celeryd start</code> throws <code>command not found</code> error</p>
","<p>Your <code>celeryd</code> script is probably not executable, that's why <code>sudo /etc/init.d/celeryd</code> is returning <code>command not found</code>. So, you need to first make it executable.</p>

<p>To do so, run the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/celeryd
sudo chown root:root /etc/init.d/celeryd
</code></pre>

<p>The first line changes the permissions to <code>-rwxr-xr-x</code>, and the second line ensures that the owner and group owner of the file is <code>root</code>.</p>

<p>Once this is done, I assume you will need to use <code>sudo /etc/init.d/celeryd start</code> to start the daemon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question is trying to address some common mistakes by users not used to the APT system and <code>apt-get</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>APT tool <code>apt-get</code> has simple commands that you need to know before hand what they do, and in what circumstances use it.</p>

<p>If what you want is <strong>update your packages list</strong>, the correct command is:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>

<p>just that! You don't need to write anything else before nor after. Is just <strong>sudo</strong> + <strong>apt-get</strong> + <strong>update</strong>. Done.</p>

<p><strong>To install packages or programs</strong> in your system, you <strong>first need to know the package name</strong>. If you don't know the package name is recommended you use a GUI (like Ubuntu Software Center or packagekit), search and install your program using it. If you know the package name then you only have to:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install <em>package_name</em></code></pre>

<p>Replace <code>package_name</code> your package name. You can install several packages at once, just write them with an space between them. If you are still getting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>E: Unable to locate package <em>package_name</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then try updating your list or reviewing the instructions you are following, maybe is just a typographic mistake. If name of that package is unknown for apt-get that is the error you will get.</p>

<p><strong>For upgrading</strong> the packages that you already have installed, aka update all your system, you need to do:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing else. It will upgrade all the packages that you have installed in your system.</p>

Every time that I install pip it installs for python 2.7, any help?</p>
","<p>While on more modern versions of Ubuntu you could just <code>sudo apt-get install python3-pip</code> (and then use <code>pip3</code>), a Python 3 copy of <code>pip</code> was never packaged for 12.04.</p>

<p>Therefore you need to follow the more old fashioned install route with <code>easy_install</code>:    </p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
sudo easy_install3 pip
</code></pre>

<p>Now, there is every chance that this will clash with Python 2's <code>pip</code> and <strong>override</strong> <code>/usr/bin/pip</code>, because it will install a python3 based <code>/usr/local/bin/pip</code> which is also in Ubuntu 12.04's $PATH.</p>

<p>It shouldn't <strong>overwrite</strong> it so as long as you know that, it might be acceptable. However it might be best to start investigating the happy world of <code>virtualenv</code> as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/10763461/12870"">this answer suggests</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively you could rename the easy-installed python3 version of pip:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mv /usr/local/bin/pip /usr/local/bin/pip-3

"Installing and testing CUDA in Ubuntu 14.04","213831","","<p>I am uncertain about how to install CUDA in my system. 
looking around there are many tutorials about cuda on 12.04 LTS and a few on 13.04 and 13.10, but they all talk about acquiring a <code>deb</code> package from the <a href=""https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads"">NVidia CUDA developer zone</a>. </p>

<p>Well NVidia does not offer a Debian package for 14.04 as of yet.</p>

<p>However, there is a promising package in <code>apt</code> repository: <code>nvidia-cuda-toolkit</code>.</p>

<p>The problem is that I didn't find any example with it. At least not the examples that are referred to in <a href=""http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/index.html"">cuda6 online documentation</a> section 4.11.</p>

<p>I should mention that the toolkit installed is v5.5, not v6 but I haven't found documentation for cuda v5.5 on the NVidia website.</p>

<p>So I can verify that <code>nvcc</code> is there, but nothing further than that. How can I get some examples to run to verify the CUDA is installed properly?</p>

cd ~/Downloads
./cuda_6.0.37_linux_64.run -extract=~/Downloads/nvidia_installers;

<pre><code>sudo apt-get --purge remove ""nvidia-*""

<p>Have these instructions handy as we need to kill X install the driver.

"Can't install php5 on Ubuntu 16.04","211860","","<p>so I've recently installed my first Ubuntu, to be precise, a daily build of 16.04, on my new laptop since the hardware was to new for 15.10. Now I'm in the process of setting it up and I want to install php5 and some extensions.</p>

<p>When I execute <code>sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5</code> I get the error message that there is no installation package available for php5 and libapache2.</p>

<p>The error message is in german, so I doubt that this would help, but anyways here it is. :-)
<code>E: For package »libapache2-mod-php5« existiert kein Installationskandidat.</code></p>

<p>Do I need to add a apt-get repository? Or what am I doing wrong?</p>
","<p><em>TL;DR: If you want to stay with php5, you will need to stay at Ubuntu 14.04 LTS</em></p>

<p><strong>Using PHP 7.0 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS</strong></p>

<p>Ubuntu 16.04 has switched to PHP 7.0 with a new infrastructure for PHP package.  So, no, you can't install php5 on Ubuntu 16.04, but you can install PHP 7.0 packages with:</p>

<p><code>apt-get install libapache2-mod-php</code></p>

<p>That will install a virtual package that depends on the latest PHP version and pull <code>libapache2-mod-php7.0</code> as a dependency.</p>

<p>If you are looking for extensions, always use a version-less variant as well (e.g. <code>php-apcu</code> instead of <code>php7.0-apcu</code>) as the PECL extensions are packaged without the version to allow smooth upgrades.</p>

<p><strong>Using PHP PPA to coinstall PHP 5.6 with PHP 7.0</strong></p>

<p>There's an option to co-install PHP 5.6 packages using <code>ppa:ondrej/php</code>.</p>

<p>For more information, please see that answer: <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/762161/309221"">https://askubuntu.com/a/762161/309221</a></p>

"update-java-alternatives vs update-alternatives --config java","211630","","<p>On Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I have installed Sun's JDK7, Eclipse, and the Arduino IDE. I want the Arduino to use OpenJDK 6 and want Eclipse to use Sun's JDK 7. </p>

<p>From my understanding I need to manually choose which Java to use before running each application. This led me to the <code>update-java-alternatives -l</code> command. When I run this I only see the following: </p>

<pre><code>java-1.6.0-openjdk-amd64 1061 /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk-amd64
</code></pre>

<p>but when I run <code>update-alternatives --config java</code> I see the following: </p>

<pre><code>*0  /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java   auto mode
1  /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java   manual mode
2  /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/bin/java                   manual mode
3  /usr/lib/jvm/jre1.7.0/bin/java                   manual mode
</code></pre>

<p>I don't understand why the <code>update-java-alternatives</code> doesn't display the same 3 options. I also don't understand how to switch between OpenJDK6 and JDK7. How I can go about using the OpenJDK6 for Arduino development and Sun JDK7 for Eclipse/Android development?</p>
","<p><code>sudo update-alternatives --config java</code></p>

<p>Configures the default for the program ""java"". That's the Java VM.</p>

<p><code>sudo update-alternatives --config javac</code></p>

<p>Configures the default Java compiler.</p>

<p>You can also see that, because the first command lists a lot of ""JRE"" (Java Runtime Environment) folders and the Program is just called ""java"".</p>

<p>If I check which version is being used by issuing the command
<code>java -version</code>
or
<code>javac -version</code>,
I can see, that each command changes the program being used.</p>

<p>However, using <code>update-java-alternatives</code> with a JDK Version changes <strong>both</strong> programs for me. Using the first commands, you can use a Java VM and Java Compiler from different JDKs.</p>

<p>So it seems you need to install the <code>openjdk-7-jdk</code> package as well. It looks like you only installed <code>openjdk-7-jre</code>.</p>

<p>As for switching for different development environments:</p>

<p>Are you talking about starting the IDE itself with different Java versions or using different versions <strong>in</strong> the IDE for compilation and running your app?</p>

<p>For 1.: You can specify which JVM to use in the eclipse.ini, as described <a href=""https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse.ini#Specifying_the_JVM"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>. I don't know how to do that for the Arduino IDE.</p>

<p>For 2.: In Eclipse you can select the JRE/JDK to be used in Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Installed JREs. And under Java -> Compiler you could choose an older Java compliance if you wish.</p>

<pre><code>grep sshd.\*Failed /var/log/auth.log | less
</code></pre>

<ul>

"Why ~/.bash_profile is not getting sourced when opening a terminal?","207366","","<h1>Problem</h1>

<p>I have an Ubuntu 11.04 Virtual Machine and I wanted to set up my Java development environment. I did as follows</p>

<ol>
<li><code>sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk</code></li>
<li><p>Added the following entries to <strong>~/.bash_profile</strong></p>

<pre><code>export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk

export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

<li><p>Save the changes and exit</p></li>
<li><p>Open up a terminal again and typed the following</p>

<pre><code>echo $JAVA_HOME   (blank)
echo $PATH        (displayed, but not the JAVA_HOME value)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Nothing happened, like if the export of JAVA_HOME and it's addition to the PATH were never done.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Solution</h1>

<p>I had to go to <strong>~/.bashrc</strong> and add the following entry towards the end of file</p>

<pre><code>#Source bash_profile to set JAVA_HOME and add it to the PATH because for some reason is not being picked up
. ~/.bash_profile
</code></pre>

<h1>Questions</h1>

<ol>
<li>Why did I have to do that? I thought bash_profile, bash_login or profile in absence of those two get executed first before bashrc. </li>
<li>Was in this case my terminal a <strong>non-login</strong> shell?</li>
<li>If so, why when doing su after the terminal and putting the password it did not execute profile where I had also set the exports mentioned above?</li>
</ol>
","<p><code>~/.bash_profile</code> is only sourced by bash when started in interactive login mode. That is typically only when you login at the console (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>..<kbd>F6</kbd>), or connecting via ssh.</p>

<p>When you log in graphically, <code>~/.profile</code> will be specifically sourced by the script that launches gnome-session (or whichever desktop environment you're using). So <code>~/.bash_profile</code> is not sourced at all when you log in graphically.</p>

<p>When you open a terminal, the terminal starts bash in (non-login) interactive mode, which means it will source <code>~/.bashrc</code>. </p>

<p>The right place for you to put these environment variables is in <code>~/.profile</code>, and the effect should be apparent next time you log in.</p>

<p>Sourcing <code>~/.bash_profile</code> from <code>~/.bashrc</code> is the wrong solution. It's supposed to be the other way around; <code>~/.bash_profile</code> should source <code>~/.bashrc</code>.</p>

<p>See <a href=""http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles"">DotFiles</a> for a more thorough explanation, including some history of why it is like it is.</p>

"How do I fix DNS resolving which doesn't work after upgrading to Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy)","207264","","<p>After upgrade to 13.10 my DNS resolving fails. It seems the DNS servers which I get by DHCP (LAN) are not used.</p>

<p>I could temporary solve the problem by adding <code>nameserver 8.8.8.8</code> to <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>. But then the intranet hosts still can not be resolved.</p>

<p>When clicking on the <em>Connection Information</em> menu item on the network indicator, the Primary DNS and the Secondary DNS are set correctly. But my computer seams not to use them.</p>

<p>So my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What should I put into <code>resolv.conf</code>, if anything?</li>
<li>How to find out, which name servers my computer is querying?</li>
<li>Where to look next, to find out, why name servers received by DHCP are not used?</li>
</ul>
","<p>First you need to know a bit about how name resolving works in Ubuntu since Ubuntu 12.04.</p>

<p>Stéphane Graber blogged some information about it last year <a href=""https://www.stgraber.org/2012/02/24/dns-in-ubuntu-12-04/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>. The most important thing to know is that both Ubuntu Server and Ubuntu Desktop use resolvconf to manage the <code>resolv.conf</code> file. That means that you should no longer edit <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> directly; instead you should configure your network interface configuration utility to provide the right information to resolvconf. For Ubuntu Server the network interface configuration utility is <strong>ifup</strong> and it is configured by the file <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>. For Ubuntu Desktop the network interface configuration utility is <strong>NetworkManager</strong>. This is what you are using.</p>

<p>NetworkManager is configured by means of <strong>Network indicator > Edit Connections</strong>. However, for network interfaces configured by DHCP it normally isn't necessary to change any settings manually. Normally what happens is that the (remote) DHCP server provides to NetworkManager both an IP address for the local interface and the address of a (remote) DNS nameserver to use. NetworkManager starts an instance of a forwarding nameserver that listens locally at 127.0.1.1. This address, 127.0.1.1, is sent to resolvconf which puts <code>nameserver 127.0.1.1</code> in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>. NetworkManager also gives the (remote) IP address of the DHCP-provided DNS nameserver to the forwarding nameserver. Thus a program running on the local system asks the resolver to translate a host name into an IP address; the resolver queries the local forwarding nameserver at 127.0.1.1; the forwarding nameserver queries the remote nameserver(s) it has been told about, receives an answer and sends it back up the chain.</p>

<p>NetworkManager communicates with the forwarding nameserver process over D-Bus. You can see what NetworkManager told the forwarding nameserver by running the command </p>

<pre><code>nmcli dev list iface eth0 | grep IP4.DNS
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update arising from the comments:</strong><br>
Note that resolvconf actually writes the file <code>/run/resolvconf/resolv.conf</code> to which <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> is supposed to be a symbolic link. If <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> is not a symbolic link then you need to recreate it. To do so you can run </p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>sudo ln -sf /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

"How do I change the color for directories with ls in the console?","207231","","<p>On my console the color for directories is such a blue, that it is hard to read on a dark background.</p>

<p>How can I change the color definitions for <code>ls</code>?</p>
","<p>To change your directory colors, open up your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file with your editor </p>

<pre><code>nano ~/.bashrc
</code></pre>

<p>and make the following entry at the end of the file:</p>

<pre><code>LS_COLORS=$LS_COLORS:'di=0;35:' ; export LS_COLORS
</code></pre>

<p>Some nice color choices (in this case <code>0;35</code> it is purple) are:</p>

<pre><code>Blue = 34
Green = 32
Light Green = 1;32
Cyan = 36
Red = 31
Purple = 35
Brown = 33
Yellow = 1;33
Bold White = 1;37
Light Grey = 0;37
Black = 30
Dark Grey= 1;30
</code></pre>

<p>The first number is the style (1=bold), followed by a semicolon, and then the actual number of the color, possible styles (effects) are:</p>

<pre><code>0   = default colour
1   = bold
4   = underlined
5   = flashing text (disabled on some terminals)
7   = reverse field (exchange foreground and background color)
8   = concealed (invisible)
</code></pre>

<p>The possible backgrounds:</p>

<pre><code>40  = black background
41  = red background
42  = green background
43  = orange background
44  = blue background
45  = purple background
46  = cyan background
47  = grey background
100 = dark grey background
101 = light red background
102 = light green background
103 = yellow background
104 = light blue background
105 = light purple background
106 = turquoise background
107 = white background

<p>All possible colors:</p>

<pre><code>31  = red
32  = green
33  = orange
34  = blue
35  = purple
36  = cyan
37  = grey
90  = dark grey
91  = light red
92  = light green
93  = yellow
94  = light blue
95  = light purple
96  = turquoise
97  = white
</code></pre>

<p>These can even be combined, so that a parameter like:</p>

<pre><code>di=1;4;31;42
</code></pre>

<p>in your LS_COLORS variable would make directories appear in bold underlined red text with a green background!</p>

<p>To test all these colors and styles in your terminal, you can use one of:</p>

<pre><code>for i in 00{2..8} {0{3,4,9},10}{0..7}
do echo -e ""$i \e[0;${i}mSubdermatoglyphic text\e[00m  \e[1;${i}mSubdermatoglyphic text\e[00m""
done

for i in 00{2..8} {0{3,4,9},10}{0..7}
do for j in 0 1
   do echo -e ""$j;$i \e[$j;${i}mSubdermatoglyphic text\e[00m""
   done
done
</code></pre>

<p>You can also change other kinds of files when using the ls command by defining each kind with:</p>

<pre><code>bd = (BLOCK, BLK)   Block device (buffered) special file
cd = (CHAR, CHR)    Character device (unbuffered) special file
di = (DIR)  Directory
do = (DOOR) [Door][1]
ex = (EXEC) Executable file (ie. has 'x' set in permissions)
fi = (FILE) Normal file
ln = (SYMLINK, LINK, LNK)   Symbolic link. If you set this to ‘target’ instead of a numerical value, the color is as for the file pointed to.
mi = (MISSING)  Non-existent file pointed to by a symbolic link (visible when you type ls -l)
no = (NORMAL, NORM) Normal (non-filename) text. Global default, although everything should be something
or = (ORPHAN)   Symbolic link pointing to an orphaned non-existent file
ow = (OTHER_WRITABLE)   Directory that is other-writable (o+w) and not sticky
pi = (FIFO, PIPE)   Named pipe (fifo file)
sg = (SETGID)   File that is setgid (g+s)
so = (SOCK) Socket file
st = (STICKY)   Directory with the sticky bit set (+t) and not other-writable
su = (SETUID)   File that is setuid (u+s)
tw = (STICKY_OTHER_WRITABLE)    Directory that is sticky and other-writable (+t,o+w)
*.extension =   Every file using this extension e.g. *.rpm = files with the ending .rpm

<p>Especially, you might want to change the background color for <code>ow</code> (<code>OTHER_WRITABLE</code>) whose default is non-readable non-bold blue text on green background for files writable to all users.</p>

<p>You could use for instance <code>LS_COLORS=""$LS_COLORS:ow=1;33""</code> at the end of your <code>.bashrc</code> file, to get readable bold orange text on black background.</p>

<p>After you alter your .bashrc file, to put the changes in effect you will have to restart your shell or run <code>source ~/.bashrc</code>.</p>

"How do I set system-wide proxy servers in Xubuntu, Lubuntu or Ubuntu Studio?","206461","","<p>I cannot find the proxy settings anywhere. Do I have to set it through terminal, through <code>gconftools</code> or is there some GUI present for it?</p>
","<h2>System-wide proxies in Ubuntu Studio, Xubuntu and XFCE must be set via environment variables</h2>

<p>Ubuntu Studio, like Xubuntu, uses the XFCE desktop environment which does not contain a graphical settings tool to set systemwide proxies (<a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/134902/58612"">unlike the default Ubuntu desktop environment, Unity</a>).</p>

<h3>1. Set up the proxy/proxies for most programs</h3>

<ul>
<li>Open the <code>/etc/environment</code> file with <code>gksudo leafpad</code> (or your favorite editor). This file stores the system-wide variables initialized upon boot.</li>
<li><p>Add the following lines, modifying appropriately. You must duplicate in both upper-case and lower-case because (unfortunately) some programs only look for one or the other:</p>

<pre>
http_proxy=http://myproxy.server.com:8080/
https_proxy=http://myproxy.server.com:8080/
ftp_proxy=http://myproxy.server.com:8080/
no_proxy=""localhost,127.0.0.1,localaddress,.localdomain.com""
HTTP_PROXY=http://myproxy.server.com:8080/
HTTPS_PROXY=http://myproxy.server.com:8080/
FTP_PROXY=http://myproxy.server.com:8080/
NO_PROXY=""localhost,127.0.0.1,localaddress,.localdomain.com""
</pre></li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Then set up proxies for GTK3 programs such as Rhythmbox:</h3>

<p>Some newer GTK3 programs such as Rhythmbox ignore the environment variables set above, and rely on Gnome settings instead. To make sure they are covered, open a terminal and paste the below line-by-line, modifying as appropriate:</p>

<pre><code>gsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy mode 'manual' 
gsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy.http host 'myproxy.server.com'
gsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy.http port 8080
</code></pre>

<h3>3. Finally, set up the proxies for <code>apt-get</code> and Update Manager</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>These programs will not obey the environment variables either. Create a file called <code>95proxies</code> in <code>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/</code>, and include the following:</p>

<pre>
Acquire::http::proxy ""http://myproxy.server.com:8080/"";
Acquire::ftp::proxy ""ftp://myproxy.server.com:8080/"";
Acquire::https::proxy ""https://myproxy.server.com:8080/"";
</pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, logout and reboot to make sure the changes take effect.</p>

<h2><strong>Scripts for turning Proxy server on/off</strong>:</h2>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>: Before proceeding, note that I have tried this on Lubuntu 14.04 and it is IMPORTANT that before you run the mentioned scripts, the file <code>/etc/environment</code> should have only one line in it i.e. '$PATH...' and there should be nothing else in the file, else you might need to modify the script's code. These scripts set and unset the proxy as described above, but they rely upon file truncation and file appending to change <code>/etc/environment</code> and <code>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/95proxies</code> files. So make sure that:</p>

<p>1) <code>/etc/environment</code> contains only one line i.e. '$PATH:...'. And nothing else. </p>

<p>2) The file <code>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/95proxies</code> does not exist or does not have anything 
important in it.</p>

<p>So! If you want to automate the process of turning proxy on and off without having to type allot. you can make two executable shell scripts <code>proxyon.sh</code> and <code>proxyoff.sh</code> as:</p>

<h2><code>proxyon.sh:</code></h2>

<pre><code>if [ $(id -u) -ne 0 ]; then
  echo ""This script must be run as root"";
  exit 1;
fi

if [ $# -eq 2 ]
  then

  gsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy mode 'manual' ;
  gsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy.http host '$1';

  NO_PROXY=\""localhost,127.0.0.1,localaddress,.localdomain.com\""\n"" &gt;&gt; lol.t;

  cat lol.t &gt; /etc/environment;


  printf \
  ""Acquire::http::proxy \""http://$1:$2/\"";\n\
  Acquire::ftp::proxy \""ftp://$1:$2/\"";\n\
  Acquire::https::proxy \""https://$1:$2/\"";\n"" &gt; /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/95proxies;

  rm -rf lol.t;

  else

  printf ""Usage $0 &lt;proxy_ip&gt; &lt;proxy_port&gt;\n"";

fi
</code></pre>

<h2><code>proxyoff.sh</code>:</h2>

<pre><code>if [ $(id -u) -ne 0 ]; then
  echo ""This script must be run as root"";
  exit 1;
fi

gsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy mode 'none' ;

grep PATH /etc/environment &gt; lol.t;
cat lol.t &gt; /etc/environment;

printf """" &gt; /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/95proxies;

rm -rf lol.t;
</code></pre>

<p><em>How to use</em>: Once you have made these scripts, make them executable, you may keep them anywhere you like. To turn on proxy all you have to do is go to the directory containing the 'proxyon.sh' script and then you need to type <code>sudo ./proxyon.sh {host} {port}</code>. As an example consider this:</p>

<pre><code> $ sudo ./proxyon.sh 10.2.20.17 8080
 OR
 $ sudo ./proxyon.sh myproxy.server.com 8080
</code></pre>

<p>Where '10.2.20.17' is the proxy server's IP - you can also type something like myproxy.server.com - and '8080' is the port. After that just log out and login to your account, to make sure that everything is set. You can start using the internet or whatever then. And when you want to turn the proxy off, go to the directory containing 'proxyoff.sh' and type:</p>

<pre><code> $ sudo ./proxyoff.sh
</code></pre>

<p>This will unset all of your proxies. Now logout and login again to switch to normal mode.</p>

<h2>Method 2:</h2>

<p><code>x11vnc</code> is a simple VNC server and you won't have to mess around with Gnome settings or 500 firewalls, just install <code>x11vnc</code> on all your computers (with puppet or whatever you're using for mass-control).</p>

<p>Then from your local computer run:</p>

<p>Obviously swapping <code>user@host</code> for the username and hostname/IP of the remote computer.</p>

<p>And then use a VNC client of your choice to connect to <code>localhost:5900</code>. The SSH command starts a vnc server on the remote computer and then tunnels back that port over SSH. You don't have to open up any ports (as long as you can already SSH).</p>

<p>If your computers have funny display settings, you might do better to leave off the <code>-display :0</code> segment in the SSH command. <code>x11vnc</code> will then automatically try to find the right display.</p>

","<h1>How to get back a ""GNOME 2 look and feel"" in Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot</h1>

<h2>1. Install ""GNOME Classic"" session</h2>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback
</code></pre>

<p>You now get the possibility to choose the ""GNOME Classic"" session when you log in, but there are some problems with this session:</p>

<ul>
<li>The top panel's height and its icons are too large</li>
<li>The panel background is inconsistent</li>
</ul>

<p>GNOME Classic:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/s7sRi.png"" alt=""orig""></p>

<p>With the fixes below:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/04tg7.png"" alt=""fixed""></p>

<p>After turning sound and bluetooth off and on again:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NlNjR.png"" alt=""fixed-compacticons""></p>

<p>The fixes also work for the Radiance theme:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EVZwU.png"" alt=""fixed-compacticons-radiancetheme""></p>

<h2>2. Reduce the size of the icons to 16 pixels</h2>

<p>This will also reduce the height of the top panel from 30 to 24 pixels.</p>

<p><strong>2a. Create folder for config files:</strong></p>

<pre><code>mkdir ~/.config/gtk-3.0
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2b. Create or edit ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini and add this:</strong></p>

<pre><code>[Settings]
gtk-icon-sizes = panel-menu=16,16:gtk-large-toolbar=16,16
</code></pre>

<h2>3. Fix the panel background</h2>

<p>Note: Instead of the following solution, the background can also be fixed by using:<br>
(<kbd>Win</kbd>-)<kbd>Alt</kbd>-rightclick on panel -> Properties -> Background -> Solid color</p>

<p><strong>3a. Create or edit ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css and add this:</strong></p>

<pre><code>/* Fallback Mode Panel */
/* Fix background color (needed in Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot). */
/* Based on /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/gnome-panel.css. */

PanelWidget,
PanelApplet,
PanelToplevel {
    background-color: @dark_bg_color;
    background-image: none;
}

.gnome-panel-menu-bar,
PanelApplet &gt; GtkMenuBar.menubar,
PanelApplet &gt; GtkMenuBar.menubar.menuitem,
PanelMenuBar.menubar,
PanelMenuBar.menubar.menuitem {
    background-color: @dark_bg_color;
    background-image: none;
}

PanelAppletFrame {
    background-color: @dark_bg_color;
    background-image: none;
}
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, you should log out and in again using the ""GNOME Classic"" session in order to see the changes.</p>

<h2>4. Further panel configuration</h2>

<p>Use (<kbd>Win</kbd>-)<kbd>Alt</kbd>-middleclick-drag and (<kbd>Win</kbd>-)<kbd>Alt</kbd>-rightclick to configure the panel further.</p>

<p>Note that the panel items snap to the left/center/right of the panel, so they might need to be dragged some distance before they move at all.</p>

<p>Launchers can easily be added by dragging items directly from the Applications menu to the panel.</p>

<h2>5. Fix icon spacing</h2>

<p>There seems to be a bug which causes excessive spacing between the icons in the notification area tray:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/04tg7.png"" alt=""fixed""></p>

<p>An easy fix is to change the icons back and forth, e.g. muting/unmuting the sound and disabling/enabling bluetooth. This solution is unfortunately only temporary and must be performed again after each login.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NlNjR.png"" alt=""fixed-compacticons""></p>

<h2>Final remarks</h2>

<p>Make a note for future reference that you just added two config files in:</p>

<pre><code>~/.config/gtk-3.0/
</code></pre>

<p>This is nice to know in case the config files mess things up with later Ubuntu releases and need to be removed again.</p>

"How do I patch/workaround SSLv3 POODLE vulnerability (CVE­-2014­-3566)?","200784","","<p>After the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#BEAST_attack"">BEAST attack</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Heartbleed_Bug"">Heartbleed bug</a>, now I've heard about a new vulnerability in SSL/TLS called <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf"">POODLE</a>. How do I protect myself against being exploited?</p>

<ul>
<li>Are only servers or also clients affected?</li>
<li>Is this OpenSSL/GnuTLS specific?</li>
<li>What kind of services are affected? Only HTTPS or also IMAPS, SMTPS, OpenVPN, etc.?</li>
</ul>

<p>Please show me examples on how to avoid this vulnerability.</p>
","<h2>Background info</h2>

<p>SSL is designed to secure the transport level on the internet. For 'the web' aka HTTP you'll know this as HTTPS, but it's also used for other application protocols. SSLv2 was the first widely used transport security protocol but was found insecure not long after. Successors SSLv3 and TLSv1 are widely supported now. TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 are newer and gaining a lot of support too. Most if not all web browsers released from 2014 have support for it.</p>

<p>The recent discovery by Google engineers points out that SSLv3 should not be used any longer (like SSLv2 is deprecated a long time ago). The clients that won't be able to connect to your site/service are probably very very limited. CloudFlare <a href=""https://blog.cloudflare.com/sslv3-support-disabled-by-default-due-to-vulnerability/"">announced</a> that less than 0.09% of their visitors still rely on SSLv3.</p>

<p>Simple solution: disable SSLv3.</p>

<h2>Does Ubuntu provide any update?</h2>

<p>Yes, via <a href=""http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2385-1/"">usn-2385-1</a> with the addition of the SCSV feature, <strong>but it does not mitigate the issue completely</strong> as it does not disable SSLv3 and the patch will only work if both sides of the connection have been patched. You'll receive it through your regular security updates in your package manager.</p>

<p>So, still <strong>YOU</strong> have to take action yourself to disable SSLv3 (it's configurable). Future versions of clients/browsers will disable SSLv3 most likely. E.g. Firefox 34 will do so.</p>

<p>Disabling SSLv3 completely by default in Ubuntu on implementation level will probably break some stuff out there also for non-HTTPS SSL usage which is not so much vulnerable, so I assume maintainers won't do that and only this SCSV patch will be applied.</p>

<h2>Why does the SCSV update in OpenSSL via usn-2385-1 does not mitigate the issue?</h2>

<p>Really, stop asking such questions and just skip a few paragraphs and disable SSLv3. But hey, if you're not convinced, here you go:</p>

<p>POODLE shows that SSLv3 with CBC ciphers is broken, implementing SCSV does not change that. SCSV only makes sure you don't downgrade from some TLS protocol to any lower TLS/SSL protocol as needed with the Man-in-the-Middle attack required for the usual cases.</p>

<p>If you have to access some server which does not offer TLS at all, but only SSLv3, then your browser doesn't really have a choice and has to talk to the server using SSLv3, which is then vulnerable without any downgrade attack.</p>

<p>If you have to access some server which offers TLSv1+ and SSLv3 too (which is discouraged) and you want to be sure your connection will not be downgraded to SSLv3 by an attacker, then <em>both</em> the server and the client need this SCSV patch.</p>

<p>For completely mitigating the issue the disablement of SSLv3 your end is enough and you can be sure you won't be downgraded. And you won't be able to talk to to SSLv3-only servers.</p>

<h2>Okay, so how do I disable SSLv3?</h2>

<p>See below in the application specific sections: Firefox, Chrome, Apache, Nginx and Postfix are covered for now.</p>

<h2>Are only servers or also clients affected?</h2>

<p>The vulnerability exists if both the server and client accepts SSLv3 (even if both are capable of TLSv1/TLSv1.1/TLS1.2 due to a downgrade attack).</p>

<p>As a server admin you should disable SSLv3 <strong>now</strong> for the security of your users.</p>

<p>As a user, you should disable SSLv3 in your browser <strong>now</strong> to secure yourself when visiting websites which still support SSLv3.</p>

<h2>Is this OpenSSL/GnuTLS/browser specific?</h2>

<p>No. It's a protocol (design) bug, not an implementation bug. This means you can't really patch it (unless you're changing the design of the old SSLv3).</p>

<p>And yes, there's a new <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20141015.txt"">OpenSSL security release</a>, but read below (<em>But I really really need SSLv3 support... for reason X,Y,Z!</em>) on why you'd better focus on disabling SSLv3 altogether.</p>

<h2>Can I kill SSLv3 on the network (firewall) level?</h2>

<p>Well, yes, probably. I put this in a separate blog post for further thoughts and work. We may have some magic <code>iptables</code> rule you can use!</p>

<p>My blog post: <a href=""https://blog.g3rt.nl/take-down-sslv3-using-iptables.html"">How to take down SSLv3 in your network using iptables for POODLE?</a></p>

<h2>Is it relevant for HTTPS only or also for IMAP/SMTP/OpenVPN and other protocols with SSL support?</h2>

<p>The current attack vector, as shown by the researchers, works with controlling the plaintext sent to the server using Javascript being run on the victim's machine. This vector does not apply to non-HTTPS scenarios without using a browser.</p>

<p>Also, normally an SSL client doesn't allow the session to be downgraded to SSLv3 (having TLSv1+ seen in the handshake capabilities), but browsers want to be very backward compatible and they do. The combination with controlling plaintext and the specific way a HTTP header is built up makes it exploitable.</p>

<p>Conclusion: disable SSLv3 for HTTPS <strong>now</strong>, disable SSLv3 for other services in your next service window.</p>

<h2>What's the impact? Do I need to revoke and regenerate my server certificate? (As with Heartbleed)</h2>

<p>No, you don't need to rotate your certificates for this. The vulnerability exposes plaintext recovery from the session data, it does not provide access to any secrets (neither the session key or certificate key).</p>

<p>An attacker is most likely only capable of stealing the plaintext headers like session cookies in order to perform <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking"">session hijacking</a>. An additional constraint is the need for a full (active) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack"">MitM attack</a>.</p>

<h2>Is there anything else I can do to improve my SSL configuration in general?</h2>

<p>As a user, besides disabling SSLv3 in your browser, not really. Well, just always install the latest security updates.</p>

<p>For servers, follow <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS"">Mozilla's TLS server guide</a>. And test with <a href=""https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html"">Qualys' SSL Labs test</a>. It's really not that hard to get an A+ rating on your site. Just update your packages and implement the recommendations from the guide of Mozilla.</p>

<h2>But I really really need SSLv3 support... for reason X,Y,Z! Now what?</h2>

<p>Well, there's a patch that circumvents the downgrade attack of TLSv1 capable clients, called the SSLv3 Fallback Protection. It will improve the security of TLSv1+ too, by the way (downgrade attack is harder/impossible). It's offered as a backport from a more recent OpenSSL version in the Ubuntu Security advisory <a href=""http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2385-1/"">usn-2385-1</a>.</p>

<p>Big catch: Both clients and servers need this patch in order to work. So, in my opinion while you're updating both clients and servers you should just upgrade to TLSv1+ anyway.</p>

<p>However, please, please, just retire SSLv3 in your network for now. Put effort in upgrading security standards and just ditch SSLv3.</p>

<h2>I heard about SCSV support to eliminate the protocol downgrade attack. Do I need it?</h2>

<p>Only if you really need SSLv3 for some odd reason, but it improves security in TLSv1+ too, so yes, I'd recommend you to install it. Ubuntu provides an update for this feature in <a href=""http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2385-1/"">usn-2385-1</a>. You'll receive it through your regular security updates in your package manager.</p>

<h2>Testing vulnerability for privately hosted sites (e.g. intranet/offline).</h2>

<p>Your servers are vulnerable simply if they support SSLv3. Several options here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>With OpenSSL s_client:</p>

<pre><code>openssl s_client -connect &lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt; -ssl3
</code></pre>

<p>If the connection succeeds, sslv3 is enabled. If it fails, it is disabled. When it fails you should see something like:</p>

<pre><code>error:14094410:SSL routines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:sslv3 alert handshake failure
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Using <code>nmap</code>:</p>

<pre><code>nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 myhostname.tld
</code></pre>

<p>It should output '<code>SSLv3: No supported ciphers found</code>'. Adjust for your hostname/port.</p></li>
<li><p>Using <a href=""https://github.com/jvehent/cipherscan"">cipherscan</a>. Clone/download the binary and execute it:</p>

<pre><code>./cipherscan myhostname.tld
</code></pre>

<p>It should <em>not</em> list anything with SSLv3 under the 'protocols' column.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Firefox browser</h2>

<p>Open <code>about:config</code>, find <code>security.tls.version.min</code> and set the value to <code>1</code>. Then restart your browser to drop any open SSL connections.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NVHH2.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>Firefox from version 34 onwards will disable SSLv3 by default and thus require no action (<a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2014/10/14/the-poodle-attack-and-the-end-of-ssl-3-0/"">source</a>). However, at the moment of writing, 33 is just released and 34 is set for November 25.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Google Chrome (Linux)</h2>

<p>Edit the <code>/usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop</code> file, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop
</code></pre>

<p>Edit <strong>all lines</strong> starting with <code>Exec=</code> to include <code>--ssl-version-min=tls1</code>.</p>

<p>E.g. a line like</p>

<pre><code>Exec=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable %U
</code></pre>

<p>becomes</p>

<pre><code>Exec=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable --ssl-version-min=tls1 %U
</code></pre>

<p>Then make sure to fully close the browser (Chrome apps may be keeping your browser active in the background!).</p>

<p>Note: You may need to repeat this every google-chrome package update, overwriting this <code>.desktop</code> launcher file. A Google Chrome or Chromium browser with SSLv3 disabled by default is not yet announced at the time of writing.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Apache HTTPD Server</h2>

<p>If you are running an Apache web server that currently allows SSLv3, you will need to edit the Apache configuration. On Debian and Ubuntu systems the file is <em>/etc/apache2/mods-available/ssl.conf</em>. On CentOS and Fedora the file is <em>/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf</em>. You will need to add the following line to your Apache configuration with other SSL directives.</p>

<pre><code>SSLProtocol All -SSLv2 -SSLv3
</code></pre>

<p>This will allow all protocols except SSLv2 and SSLv3.</p>

<p>While you're at it, you may want to consider improving the ciphersuite configuration for your webserver as explained on <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Apache"">Mozilla's TLS server guide</a>. Add for example:</p>

<pre><code>SSLCipherSuite          ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-DSS-AES128-GCM-SHA256:kEDH+AESGCM:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES:CAMELLIA:DES-CBC3-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!RC4:!MD5:!PSK:!aECDH:!EDH-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA:!EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:!KRB5-DES-CBC3-SHA
SSLHonorCipherOrder     on
SSLCompression          off
# Read up on HSTS before you enable it (recommended)
# Header add Strict-Transport-Security ""max-age=15768000""
</code></pre>

<p>Then check if the new configuration is correct (no typos etc.):</p>

<pre><code>sudo apache2ctl configtest
</code></pre>

<p>And restart the server, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>sudo service apache2 restart
</code></pre>

<p>On CentOS and Fedora:</p>

<pre><code>systemctl restart httpd
</code></pre>

<p>More info: <a href=""https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslprotocol"">Apache documentation</a></p>

<p>Now test it: If your site is publicly available, test it using <a href=""https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/"">Qualys’ SSL Labs tool</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Nginx server</h2>

<p>If you're running Nginx, just include the following line in your configuration among the other SSL directives:</p>

<pre><code>ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
</code></pre>

<p>While you're at it, you may want to consider improving the ciphersuite configuration for your webserver as explained on <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Nginx"">Mozilla's TLS server guide</a>. Add for example:</p>

<pre><code>ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-DSS-AES128-GCM-SHA256:kEDH+AESGCM:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES:CAMELLIA:DES-CBC3-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!RC4:!MD5:!PSK:!aECDH:!EDH-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA:!EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:!KRB5-DES-CBC3-SHA';
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
# Read up on HSTS before you enable it (recommended)
# add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=15768000;
</code></pre>

<p>And restart the server, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>sudo service nginx restart
</code></pre>

<p>Reference: <a href=""http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_protocols"">Nginx documentation</a></p>

<p>Now test it: If your site is publicly, available, test it using <a href=""https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/"">Qualys' SSL Labs tool</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Lighttpd webserver</h2>

<p>Lighttpd versions >1.4.28 support a configuration option to disable SSLv2 and v3.  Lighttpd releases before 1.4.28 allow you to disable SSLv2 ONLY.  <em>Please note that Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and earlier install at best lighttpd v1.4.28 and therefore a simple fix is not available for those distributions.</em>  Therefore this fix should only be used for Ubuntu versions greater than 12.04.  </p>

<p>For Ubuntu version 12.04 or Debian 6, an updated lighttpd package is available from the openSUSE repository:
<a href=""http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/http/Debian_6.0"">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/http/Debian_6.0</a></p>

<p>The package is intended for Debian 6 (squeeze) but works also on 12.04 (precise)</p>

<p>Edit your <code>/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf</code> to add the following lines after the <code>ssl.engine = ""enable""</code> directive</p>

<pre><code>ssl.use-sslv2          = ""disable""
ssl.use-sslv3          = ""disable""
</code></pre>

<p>Then you should restart the lighttpd service with a <code>sudo service lighttpd restart</code> and perform an ssl3 handshake test as described in earlier sections to make sure that the change was implemented successfully.</p>

<p>Taken from <a href=""http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Docs_SSL"">http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Docs_SSL</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Postfix SMTP</h2>

<p>For 'opportunistic SSL' (encryption policy not enforced and plain is acceptable too), you don't need to change anything. Even SSLv2 is better than plain, so if you need to secure your server you should be using 'mandatory SSL' mode anyway.</p>

<p>For 'mandatory SSL' mode being configured already, just add/change the <a href=""http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols"">smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols</a> setting for inbound connections and <a href=""http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols"">smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols</a> for outbound connections:</p>

<pre><code>smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols=!SSLv2,!SSLv3
smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols=!SSLv2,!SSLv3
</code></pre>

<p>Optionally, if you want to disable SSLv3 for opportunistic encryption as well (even though it's unnecessary as explained above), do so thusly:</p>

<pre><code>smtpd_tls_protocols=!SSLv2,!SSLv3
smtp_tls_protocols=!SSLv2,!SSLv3
</code></pre>

<p>and restart Postfix:</p>

<pre><code>sudo service postfix restart
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Sendmail</h2>

<p><em>(Unverified edit by anonymous user, I'm not comfortable with Sendmail, please verify.)</em></p>

<p>These options are configured in the <code>LOCAL_CONFIG</code> section of your <code>sendmail.mc</code></p>

<pre><code>LOCAL_CONFIG
O CipherList=HIGH
O ServerSSLOptions=+SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 +SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3 +SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE
O ClientSSLOptions=+SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 +SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Dovecot</h2>

<p>In Dovecot v2.1+, add the following to your <code>/etc/dovecot/local.conf</code> (or a new file in <code>/etc/dovecot/conf.d</code>):</p>

<pre><code>ssl_protocols = !SSLv2 !SSLv3
</code></pre>

<p>and restart Dovecot:</p>

<pre><code>sudo service dovecot restart
</code></pre>

<p>For older versions you will have to <a href=""http://www.mail-archive.com/dovecot@dovecot.org/msg59945.html"">patch the source code</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Courier-imap (imapd-ssl)</h2>

<p>Courier-imap allows SSLv3 by default on Ubuntu 12.04 and others.  You should disable it and use STARTTLS instead to force TLS.  Edit your <code>/etc/courier/imapd-ssl</code> configuration file to reflect the following changes</p>

<pre><code>IMAPDSSLSTART=NO
IMAPDSTARTTLS=YES
IMAP_TLS_REQUIRED=1
TLS_PROTOCOL=TLS1
TLS_STARTTLS_PROTOCOL=TLS1
TLS_CIPHER_LIST=""&lt;take those from the Mozilla TLS Server guide!&gt;""
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>HAProxy Server</h2>

<p>SSL is supported in HAProxy >= 1.5.</p>

<p>Edit the <code>/etc/haproxy.cfg</code> file and find your <code>bind</code> line. Append <code>no-sslv3</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>bind :443 ssl crt &lt;crt&gt; ciphers &lt;ciphers&gt; no-sslv3
</code></pre>

<p>Reference: <a href=""https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/configuration-1.5.html#5.1-no-sslv3"">HAProxy Documentation</a></p>

<hr>

<h2>OpenVPN</h2>

<p>Appears to be unaffected (<a href=""https://forums.openvpn.net/topic17268.html"">source</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OpenVPN uses TLSv1.0, or (with >=2.3.3) optionally TLSv1.2 and is thus not impacted by POODLE.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>Puppet</h2>

<p>Puppet uses SSL over HTTPS but it isn't used by 'browser' clients, just Puppet agents which aren't vulnerable to the attack vector shown. However, it's best practice to just disable SSLv3.</p>

<p>My recommendation is to use the <a href=""https://forge.puppetlabs.com/stephenrjohnson/puppet"">stephenrjohnson/puppetmodule</a> Puppet module to set up your Puppet master in which <a href=""https://github.com/stephenrjohnson/puppetmodule/commit/1adb73f9a400cb5e91c4ece1c6166fd63004f448"">I killed SSLv3</a> some time ago.</p>

<p>In Windows we can get using NBTSTAT but this doesn't work in Linux.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to do that?</p>
","<h1>NetBIOS</h1>

<p>Windows (and Linux devices with Samba) use NetBIOS to 'publish' their addresses. This is what <code>NBTSTAT</code> uses to look up the IP address.</p>

<p>To find a hostname in your local network by IP address you can use:</p>

<pre><code>nmblookup -A &lt;ip&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can install <code>nbtscan</code> by running:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install nbtscan
</code></pre>

<p>And use:</p>

<pre><code>nbtscan &lt;ip&gt;
</code></pre>

<h1>Multicast DNS</h1>

<p>If systems publish their address via Multicast DNS (OS X, Windows 10 and Linux devices with a running <code>avahi-daemon</code> do this), do a lookup using <code>avahi-resolve</code> (requires installing <code>avahi-utils</code>):</p>

<pre><code>avahi-resolve -a &lt;ip&gt;
</code></pre>

<h1>Reverse DNS</h1>

<p>If the host has a public IP-address and a working reverse DNS entry, use the <code>dig</code> (requires installing <code>dnsutils</code>) or <code>host</code> (requires installing <code>bind9-host</code>) programs:</p>

<pre><code>dig -x &lt;ip&gt;

Why is that ? and what can I do to update the kernel from terminal.</p>
","<p>You need to perform <code>dist-upgrade</code> inorder to install/remove all dependencies related to the packages upgraded using <code>upgrade</code>. From the <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get/"">manual page of apt-get</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>  dist-upgrade
       dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of
       upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies
       with new versions of packages; apt-get has a ""smart""
       conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade
       the most important packages at the expense of less
       important ones if necessary. The dist-upgrade command may
       therefore remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list
       file contains a list of locations from which to retrieve
       desired package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a
       mechanism for overriding the general settings for
       individual packages.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the better way of upgrading would be:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>However, be careful while using <code>dist-upgrade</code> as it might also remove packages to satisfy dependencies.</p>

<p>This is a familiar message to everyone that uses Virtual Box. This ""bug"" has been popping up every few months at least since 11.10.

While the error message is similar, on Ubuntu 14.04 this issue seems to have a different nature, unrelated to the <code>virtualbox-dkms</code> package.

"How to have my PHP Send mail?","198199","","<p>I installed Ubuntu 11.04, LAMP using tasksel.</p>

<p>I find that PHP <code>mail()</code> does not work.</p>

<p>I suppose I need to enable it or something? How do I do that?</p>
","<p>From the mail manual of php:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
  
  <p>For the mail functions to be
  available, PHP requires an installed
  and working email system. The program
  to be used is defined by the
  configuration settings in the php.ini
  file.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means you have to install some sort of mailserver and configure php to use it. Usually this mailserver is postfix in Ubuntu. However - if the php side you are coding will eventually be stored on a hosting service's side (e.g. xmission), a mail server will most likely already be installed there. In that case just test your site online instead of locally.</p>

<p>If you need to test it on your own system or mean to host it on your own home-server than proceed with:</p>

<h1>Postfix Installation</h1>

<p>Installation: <a href=""http://packages.ubuntu.com/postfix"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">postfix</a> <a href=""http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/postfix"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9SOjZ.png"" alt=""Install postfix""></a> / <code>sudo apt-get install postfix</code>
During the process you will be asked in which mode you want postfix installed. There are four possible modes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Internet</strong>: Your own mail-server.</li>
<li><strong>Satellite</strong>: An extern mail provider (e.g. Google) will be used for sending and receiving mail. The server will not receive any mail.</li>
<li><strong>Smarthost</strong>: Mixture between the two. Mail is stored locally but sent through an external mail provider.</li>
<li><strong>Local only</strong>: Will not concern you. That's a system intern mailserver. You can only send mail from user to user on the system.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest of the install options depend on your choice of this general configuration.</p>

<p>Most likely you will choose a satellite install. That means mail will be sent using an extern provider. As smtp-server (outgoing mail server) you will then have to specify your providers smtp. The rest of the options is self explanatory.</p>

<h3>Post Installation Configuration</h3>

<p>Most smtp-servers require a password authentication to send mail. So postfix will need to know that password. Also there are things like encryption to consider (which you'll have to google). This is how you configure postfix using password authentication (sasl):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Install

by clicking the Software Center icons or from terminal using:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libsasl2-2 libsasl2-modules sasl2-bin
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Enable sasl-auth by adding these lines to <code>/etc/postfix/main.cf</code></p>

<pre><code> # add to /etc/postfix/main.cf
 smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
 smtp_sasl_security_options = noplaintext noanonymous
 smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_password
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Create a file <code>/etc/postfix/sasl_password</code> with a line like:</p>

<pre><code> smtp.gmail.com USERNAME@gmail.com:USERPASSWORD
</code></pre>

<p>Substitute the actual password, username and smtp-address.</p></li>
<li><p>Update postfix:</p>

<pre><code> sudo chmod 600 /etc/postfix/sasl_password # for safety of your smtp password
 sudo postmap hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_password 
 sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sender_canonical
 sudo /etc/init.d/postfix restart   
</code></pre>

<p>You might have to circumvent the <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/46723/why-do-i-get-an-error-when-i-try-to-postmap-sasl-password-file-with-postfix"">'permission denied' bug</a> by <code>chown postfix:postfix /etc/postfix</code> beforehand.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This should do it in most of the cases. Yet some smtp providers require a specific address as the sender or encryption.</p>

<p>Gmail (and perhaps other services) may not like it that you are attempting to send mail this way as it could be deemed insecure by their standards, and would block your attempt i.e. nothing will happen on the screen or someplace of the whole process would block your authentication. Also your POP3 must be enabled.</p>

<p>If another network card is working, this should be easy. If your only card is failing at this point, find alternatives to this and be creative, e.g. using an USB wired network adapter or an alternative working WiFi adapter borrowed from a friend or neighbour.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you have installed the following packages: <code>lshw</code>, <code>rfkill</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Update your system. By installing all latest (regular) system updates, bug fixes already released by developers after the release should be on your PC by doing so. Don't forget to reboot your system afterwards. See also <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/56348/how-do-i-update-ubuntu"">How do I update Ubuntu?</a></p>

<p>After applying all updates, reboot. It may already work in this stage. If not, just continue.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Is it really a driver issue?</h2>

<p>First of all, one should determine whether the card isn't recognized and/or if it's a radio kill switch preventing it from working. Follow <em>all steps</em> below, as your problem may be two- or three-fold:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Run <code>sudo lshw -C network</code> in a terminal.</p>

<p>You might need to install <code>lshw</code> first.</p>

<ul>
<li>In case multiple devices are listed, locate the device concerned.</li>
<li>In case it's listed as <code>*-network UNCLAIMED</code>, you should follow the steps in <strong>Installing (newer) drivers</strong>.</li>
<li>In case it's listed as <code>*-network</code> (without 'Unclaimed'), the output below about the driver could be relevant in further steps, e.g. <code>configuration: broadcast=yes driver=iwlwifi</code></li>
<li>In case your device isn't listed at all, try the additional steps in <strong>Identifying the <em>exact</em> hardware</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Run <code>rfkill list</code> in a terminal. This lists the state of radio killswitches. Sample output:</p>

<pre><code>1: phy0: Wireless LAN
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>In case you see <code>yes</code> on <code>Hard blocked</code>: refer to your notebook manual for a hardware switch for Wireless LAN.</li>
<li>In case you see <code>yes</code> on <code>Soft blocked</code>: hotkeys on your notebook may help activating it, as well as hitting ""Enable Wireless"" in the Network Manager applet. If that fails to remove the soft block, run <code>sudo rfkill unblock all</code>.</li>
<li>In case you don't see any kill switches listed: this might not apply for your device. Usually only mobile PCs are equipped with killswitches.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Only for USB devices: exclude USB-level issues.</p>

<ul>
<li>Preferably, try one directly attached to your mainbord, avoiding hubs or your computer case's connectors.</li>
<li>Try using another type of USB port (e.g. USB2.0 instead of USB3.0 port).</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Identifying the <em>exact</em> hardware</strong> and see if you can see some error messages when you plug in your device.</li>
<li>Try another cable (if any) you've verified is working.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Installing (newer) drivers</h2>

<p>These are some obvious, sane and harmless steps to take, avoiding the ones listed in <strong>Things to avoid if possible</strong>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Try to see if Ubuntu suggests to install additional drivers. Refer to <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/47506/88802"">How do I install additional drivers?</a> for more information on how to do do this.</p></li>
<li><p>Install additional firmware as this may be required for your hardware.</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure you have enabled <code>multiverse</code> as posted in <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/89096/88802"">How do I enable the &quot;multiverse&quot; repository?</a></li>
<li>Install both <code>linux-firmware</code> and <code>linux-firmware-nonfree</code> packages, e.g. <code>sudo apt-get install linux-firmware linux-firmware-nonfree</code> and reboot.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Try backported kernel modules (drivers) from the compat-wireless package. Ubuntu provides packages of compat-wireless of more recent Linux kernel releases for the kernel with the stable distribution (available since 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot).</p>

<ul>
<li>Find the latest ones available by searching with your favourite package management tool. At the time of writing, this was <code>linux-backports-modules-cw-3.6-quantal-generic</code> for Quantal. In the near future, a <code>3.7</code> package may be out.</li>
<li>Install it, e.g. <code>sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-3.6-quantal-generic</code> for Quantal, or <code>sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-3.6-precise-generic</code> for Precise. Then reboot.</li>
</ul>

<p>In case you're running an LTS release (e.g. Precise or Lucid), backported kernels of all next releases are provided as a package. At the time of writing Quantal is the latest release after Precise and the package is <code>linux-image-generic-lts-quantal</code> and boot into your new kernel.</p></li>
<li><p>From here on, you should consider trying out a more recent release of Ubuntu to see if it has gained support for your hardware, just by booting from a Live CD/USB. Also consider trying the latest Beta/RC of Ubuntu+1. If it does work, the easiest approach is to simply wait for the new release.</p></li>
<li><p>Some hardware is just utterly broken on default installs, usually because the vendor isn't releasing (all) source code or does not allow redistribution of all required modules via Ubuntu. See the <strong>Hardware requiring special care</strong> section at the bottom to see if your device (chipset) is listed.</p></li>
<li><p>Try the latest stable Linux kernel. <em>This is a less harmless approach and may break other stuff.</em> This should not be necessary as the more recent wireless drivers are provided by the compat-wireless package in the earlier option. However, it may just a bit newer and therefore include a bugfix helping you out.</p>

<ul>
<li>Go to <a href=""http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/?C=M;O=D"" rel=""noreferrer"">the <code>kernel.ubuntu.com</code> downloads section</a> and identify the latest stable release (e.g. <code>v3.7.1-raring</code> at the time of writing).</li>
<li>Download all the <code>.deb</code> files for your architecture (e.g. <code>amd64</code> or <code>i386</code>), <em>plus</em> the ones with <code>all</code> in the name.</li>
<li><p>Install them all at once by issuing e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>cd Downloads
sudo dpkg -i linux-headers-3.7.1-030701-generic_3.7.1-12345678_amd64.deb linux-image... # include all
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>and finally, reboot into your new kernel.</p></li>
<li>if the new kernel doesn't work for you or introduces other issues, boot your system using the older kernel (e.g. hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> during the early boot stage to select it in the Grub menu) and then remove the packages using your package management e.g. <code>sudo apt-get remove linux-\*3.7.1\*</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Identifying the <em>exact</em> hardware</h2>

<p>The product you have was probably sold using a retail name completely irrelevant to you issue. Most vendors just use chipsets from manufacturers like Broadcom, Atheros, Ralink or Intel while the product itself may not carry this name. One example of this: a <a href=""http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkPad_11a/b/g/n_Wireless_LAN_Mini_Express_Adapter"" rel=""noreferrer"">ThinkPad 11a/b/g/n Wireless LAN Mini Express Adapter</a> may in fact just be a <code>Atheros AR5418</code>. The Thinkpad rebrand does usually not affect the hardware support in Linux, but the used chipset <em>does</em>. Therefore, it's of great importance to identify the chipset.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>PCI and integrated devices (e.g. mobile PCs):</p>

<pre><code>lspci -nn | grep -i network
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>USB devices:</p>

<pre><code>lsusb
</code></pre>

<p>In case you have trouble identifying it from this list:</p>

<ol>
<li>Unplug the device.</li>
<li>Open a terminal and run <code>sudo tail -n 0 -f /var/log/syslog</code></li>
<li>Re-plug the device in and give the kernel/device a few seconds to initialize.</li>
<li>Stop the command by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>. The output should help identifying it from the list.</li>
<li>Check for output mentioning <code>unable to enumerate USB device</code>. If such output is present, your device is already failing on communication on USB-level. You're hitting a hardware issue probably: check for broken cables/connectors, power issues, broken hubs, other broken hardware. Don't bother dealing with drivers at this point - fix USB communication first.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>In case your hardware isn't listed, this may be unrelated to your adapter, but a general PCI/USB bus error. This is considered outside the scope of a WiFi issue. Note that some notebooks have integrated WiFi adapters connected to an internal USB port, so it may be listed as USB in such a case.</p>

<p>Example output:</p>

<pre><code>$ lsusb
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. ...
                            ^^^^-- product ID
                       ^^^^------- vendor ID

$ lspci -nn | grep -i network
04:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Intel Corporation [...] [8086:4238] (rev 3e)
                                                vendor ID --^^^^
                                               product ID -------^^^^
</code></pre>

<h2>Tips in using Google</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use the numeric product/vendor IDs as identified by the commands issued.</li>
<li>Use <code>linux</code> as a keyword with it, rather than <code>Ubuntu</code>.</li>
<li>Try using the device's chipset name as listed in the output in the steps of <strong>Identifying the <em>exact</em> hardware</strong>. Examples: <code>AR9285</code>, <code>BCM4311</code>, <code>Intel</code>+<code>6300</code>.</li>
<li>Avoid using keywords unrelated to hardware support. E.g. your desktop environment is unrelated, so use <code>Ubuntu</code> instead of <code>Lubuntu</code>.</li>
<li>Try to be sensitive for 'general' information about your device, rather than focusing on specific solutions, e.g. ""Firmware is needed for this device"", or reports of users that it worked out-of-the-box in a previous release.</li>
</ul>

<h2>I had no luck with all options. What should I provide in a new question?</h2>

<p>Before posting a new question, <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/search"">search this site</a> using keywords from <strong>Identifying the <em>exact</em> hardware</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>All relevant (unexpected or errors) output from the options in this answer.</li>
<li>Relevant output of the steps done in the <strong>Identifying the <em>exact</em> hardware</strong> section.</li>
<li>The kernel you're running and the versions you've tried. Use the <code>uname -r</code> command to identify your kernel version.</li>
<li>Other Ubuntu versions you've tried.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Things to avoid if possible</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Compiling from source (e.g. running <code>make</code>, <code>sudo make install</code>).</p>

<ul>
<li>This may overwrite system files and confuse your package management. Installing this way may work, but can break anytime later if the package management updates overwrite the files again.</li>
<li>It may lead to unexpected errors which may be hard to solve for a novice user.</li>
<li>It's hard to <em>undo</em> all the changes done by <code>sudo make install</code> in case you want to revert your actions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Ndiswrapper approaches.</p>

<ul>
<li>This 'wrapper' around Windows drivers should be tried as a last resort only, as it's very inefficient to emulate a Windows environment on Linux for hardware drivers.</li>
<li>Stability and performance are usually reported as low.</li>
</ul></li>

"How do I install the Cinnamon Desktop?","197299","","<p>I have read that there is a new Gnome-2 like interface called Cinnamon produced by the Linux Mint developers.</p>

<p>Is this available for Ubuntu users - and if so how do I install it?</p>
","<p>Cinnamon is a Gnome-Shell desktop fork.  It is not strictly a Gnome-2 interface, although the developers aims are laudable - to produce a simpler more traditional desktop interface.</p>

<p>Development seems to be rapid.  It is usable and certainly fun to play with with a growing number of extensions to install to extend the base installation.</p>

<h2>How to install</h2>

<h3>for 13.04 &amp; 13.10, 14.10 &amp; later</h3>

<p>Cinnamon is now available in the Universe repository</p>

<p><a href=""https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/cinnamon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cinnamon <img src=""https://hostmar.co/software-small"" alt=""Install cinnamon""></a></p>

<p>Alternatively - from the command-line:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install cinnamon-desktop-environment
</code></pre>

<p>Since it is in this repository, it is community maintained and thus it is up to the community to update  the packages as and when new releases and bug-fixes are released.</p>

<p>For Ubuntu 14.04, there is currently no cinnamon packages in the Universe repository.</p>

<h3>Via PPA for 11.10 and later</h3>

<p><strong>EDIT: 22/05/2014 - the PPA <code>ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable</code> has been removed or hidden from public view.</strong>  I contacted the maintainer and the following is their reply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The stable PPA is indeed no longer being maintained.</p>
  
  <p>The nightly PPA is being kept for development purposes and should not
  be used on any sort of production machine (it can and will break at
  any time).</p>
  
  <p>To be honest, I don't have an alternative to offer Ubuntu users at the
  moment, apart from switching to a distribution that does support
  Cinnamon. There are many such distributions out there, and I'm only
  hoping for someone to (finally) step up on Ubuntu's side to provide
  proper packages to its users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EDIT: 25/04/14 - Two alternative PPA's have now been created - both claiming to enable the <em>stable</em> version of Cinnamon for Ubuntu users.  I cannot vouch for the <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/35629/are-ppas-safe-to-add-to-my-system-and-what-are-some-red-flags-to-watch-out-fo"">veracity of these PPAs</a></p>

<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> In addition, you can also install cinnamon 2.2 in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and derivatives by adding Linux Mint 17 Qiana  repository in your system.</p>

<p>Open file <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> with nano command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

"How to enable TRIM?","196462","","<p>I know that the Linux kernel supports TRIM as of version 2.6.33, so there should be TRIM support in ubuntu.</p>

<p>Is TRIM enabled by default or do I need to change some settings or install additional software for it to work? If so, how?</p>
","<h1>Ubuntu 14.10 onwards</h1>

<p>In Ubuntu 14.10 and 15.04, TRIMming happens automatically every week on all SSDs supported by <code>fstrim</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ tail -n1 /etc/cron.weekly/fstrim 
/sbin/fstrim --all || true
</code></pre>

<h1>Ubuntu 14.04</h1>

<p>As of Ubuntu 14.04, scheduled TRIM is <strong>enabled by default for Intel, SAMSUNG, OCZ, Patriot and Sandisk SSDs.</strong> If you have another brand, you could disable the vendor check by running the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sed -i 's/exec fstrim-all/exec fstrim-all --no-model-check/g' /etc/cron.weekly/fstrim
</code></pre>

<p>(or just edit the file <code>/etc/cron.weekly/fstrim</code> and add <code>--no-model-check</code>)</p>

<h1>Ubuntu 13.10 and Earlier</h1>

<p>There are three ways to perform TRIM, manual, scheduled, and automatic:</p>

<h2>Manual TRIM</h2>

<p>In Ubuntu this can be performed with <a href=""http://manpg.es/fstrim""><code>fstrim</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo fstrim /
</code></pre>

<p>however it is not needed when scheduled or automatic TRIM are enabled, as detailed in the sections below. </p>

<p><em>Note:</em> For <strong>Ubuntu 11.04</strong> and earlier systems, fstrim is not available so you have to use <code>wiper.sh</code> supplied with <code>hdparm</code> in <code>/usr/share/doc/hdparm/contrib/wiper.sh.gz</code></p>

<h2>Scheduled TRIM (Recommended)</h2>

<p>This is the currently recomended method, and is <a href=""https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/core-1311-ssd-trimming"">planed to be activated per default for Ubuntu 14.04</a>. Here's how to activate it manually in older versions of ubuntu (11.10 to 13.10):</p>

<p>Create a weekly CRON job script file:  </p>

<pre><code>gksudo gedit /etc/cron.weekly/fstrim
</code></pre>

<p>Paste the following code in the file, then save and close the file:</p>

<pre><code>#! /bin/sh  

# By default we assume only / is on an SSD. 
# You can add more SSD mount points, separated by spaces.
# Make sure all mount points are within the quotes. For example:
# SSD_MOUNT_POINTS='/ /boot /home /media/my_other_ssd'  

SSD_MOUNT_POINTS='/'  

for mount_point in $SSD_MOUNT_POINTS
do  
    fstrim $mount_point  
done
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the above assumes that only your root filesystem <code>/</code> is located on an SSD. If you have more mount points that reside on one or more SSDs, add them to <code>SSD_MOUNT_POINTS</code> as explained in the code.</p>

<p>Make the script executable:</p>

<pre><code>sudo chmod +x /etc/cron.weekly/fstrim
</code></pre>

<p>And finally test it:</p>

<pre><code>sudo /etc/cron.weekly/fstrim
</code></pre>

<p>If you see no errors, your cron job should be working fine.</p>

<h2>Automatic TRIM (Deprecated, Slow)</h2>

<p>Automatic TRIM has been supported since Ubuntu 10.10 (kernel 2.6.33) with the EXT4 file system. However, sending TRIM commands to the SSD in real-time - after every delete - has been recognized to make deletion much slower than usual on some drives. Therefore a weekly scheduled TRIM via a cron job (described above) is recomended. </p>

<p>To enable automatic TRIM on a drive or partition, they need to be mounted with the <code>discard</code> option in <code>fstab</code>. Firstly backup your fstab then open it for editing: </p>

<pre><code>sudo cp /etc/fstab ~/fstab-backup
gksudo gedit /etc/fstab
</code></pre>

<p>Add <code>discard</code> to the fstab options entry (comma separated) for the SSD drive or each partition. </p>

<pre><code>UUID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000  /  ext4  discard,errors=remount-ro  0  1
</code></pre>

<p>Close and save fstab, then reboot and automatic TRIM should now be working.</p>

<h3>Testing automatic TRIM</h3>

<p>To test if TRIM is working issue the following commands (<a href=""http://www.ocztechnologyforum.com/forum/showthread.php?63843-The-truth-about-firmware-1.4-and-Linux&amp;p=479503&amp;viewfull=1#post479503"">source</a>):</p>

<pre><code>cd  / # Replace with SSD file system
sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=tempfile count=100 bs=512k oflag=direct
sudo hdparm --fibmap tempfile
</code></pre>

<p>From the output copy the number under <code>begin_LBA</code> and verify the device name of your SSD: <code>System-&gt;Administration-&gt;Disk Utility</code> e.g. <em>sda, sdb, sdc</em> ...</p>

<p>Run the following but replace <code>[ADDRESS]</code> (begin_LBA) and <code>sdX</code> (SSD device name) with the details obtained above.</p>

<pre><code>sudo hdparm --read-sector [ADDRESS] /dev/sdX 
</code></pre>

<p>the output should be a long string of characters for those sectors</p>

<pre><code>sudo rm tempfile
sync
</code></pre>

<p>Repeat the <code>hdparm</code> command from above: </p>

<pre><code>sudo hdparm --read-sector [ADDRESS] /dev/sdX 
</code></pre>

<p>If you get only zeros then automatic TRIM is working. However if after removing the file the sectors are still not empty then wait a while and run the command again.</p>

"What's the difference between Google Chrome and/or Chromium? What are the advantages/disadvantages to each?","194897","","<p>I used Google Chrome in Windows, and am now using Chromium in Ubuntu.  Is there any difference to the two programs?  What are the advantages and disadvantages to each program?  Which one seems better?</p>
","<p>There are some key differences between Google Chrome and Chromium. First off, Google Chrome is a commercial closed source product made by Google which is based on the open source <a href=""http://www.chromium.org/Home"" rel=""noreferrer"">Chromium project</a>.</p>

<p>Chrome is not available in the default Ubuntu repositories as it's not open source, however Google makes <a href=""http://www.google.com/chrome"" rel=""noreferrer"">Chrome available</a> through their own 3rd party repository. Chrome is updated by Google directly, as they run the entire repository and update Chrome on their schedule. Since it doesn't need to be redistributable and open source, Chrome includes things that we can't ship in Ubuntu out of the box, like Flash and H264 support (See the <a href=""http://www.ubuntu.com/project"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ubuntu promise</a>). However you can install this support with a few packages (see below).</p>

<p><a href=""http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/chromium-browser"" rel=""noreferrer"">Chromium</a>, being open source, is available in the Ubuntu repositories. This is maintained by Ubuntu developers and goes through our <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates"" rel=""noreferrer"">Stable Release Update</a> process. Chromium has a <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates/MicroReleaseExceptions"" rel=""noreferrer"">release process exception</a>, which allows the team to upload a Chromium build as soon as a new upstream release is made.</p>

<p>There really aren't any proper ""releases"" made of Chromium, so Ubuntu developers base their build on what stable version of Chromium the stable Chrome build is based off of. Fabien Tassin has a <a href=""http://ftagada.wordpress.com/2011/01/19/chromium-release-management-explained/"" rel=""noreferrer"">blog post</a> about this process that goes into much more detail.</p>

<p>The following packages in Ubuntu install the codecs and features in Chromium that you can find in Chrome:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://packages.ubuntu.com/chromium-codecs-ffmpeg"" rel=""noreferrer"">chromium-codecs-ffmpeg</a> <a href=""http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/chromium-codecs-ffmpeg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://hostmar.co/software-small"" alt=""Install chromium-codecs-ffmpeg""></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://packages.ubuntu.com/chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra"" rel=""noreferrer"">chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra</a> <a href=""http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://hostmar.co/software-small"" alt=""Install chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra""></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://packages.ubuntu.com/flashplugin-installer"" rel=""noreferrer"">flashplugin-installer</a> <a href=""http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/flashplugin-installer"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://hostmar.co/software-small"" alt=""Install flashplugin-installer""></a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Really it depends on what you want. If you trust Google to not break your computer and like the convenience of Chrome then you can use that; if you want an open source browser that is the basis of Chrome that is peer reviewed by Ubuntu developers and doesn't require 3rd party sources then you want Chromium.</p>

<p>This <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome#User_tracking"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia page</a> outlines some of the security/usage tracking differences between the two browsers.</p>

<p>I have Ubuntu 12.04 as host and Win7 as guest. I installed VirtualBox 4.1 and Extension Pack 4.1 from Oracle website. I also enabled USB 2.0 from Settings of my VM. My Win7 VM doesn't regconize USB (Flash Drive and Kindle Fire).
How to fix it?</p>

<p>Update: I added my current user to vbusers group but it doesn't work as well.</p>
","<p>(assuming you've already installed guest additions)</p>

<p>You also need to set USB filters so that the USB devices get sent to the guest OS.</p>

<p>From the main Virtualbox window open the Settings dialog, then the USB section, then click the little ""add filter"" button on the right side of the screen.  You should be able to create a filter from any currently connected USB devices.</p>

<p>After you've done this (maybe restart to be sure the host OS isn't capturing any of the USB devices for itself--Ubuntu will try to automount the flash drive so you might also want to check and make sure that it is unmounted too) then boot into the guest OS and you should see your USB devices.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

<p><strong>Edit: note on USB filters</strong></p>

<p>It's my understanding that a device being used by a guest OS with a USB filter will not be accessible by the host OS while the guest OS is running.  Therefore, one should choose carefully what usb devices to create filters for.</p>

<p>You <em>should</em> create USB filters for things that you plan on only using with the guest OS (often peripherals that don't work with the host OS and will only work with the guest OS) and when you won't require being able to access the device from the host OS while the guest OS is running.  For example I have a USB banking dongle from my bank, ICBC, that is not compatible with Linux so I use a virtualized installation of Windows XP for banking and use a USB filter to grab the USB dongle.</p>

<p>Examples of good devices to create filters for:</p>

<ul>
<li>USB banking dongles that only work with guest OS</li>
<li>e-readers (Kindle,Nook,etc.) that you plan on using only (or primarily) with the guest OS.</li>
<li>external soundcards that only work with the guest OS or require the guest OS for full functionality</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of bad devices to create filters for:</p>

<ul>
<li>USB input devices (mouses or keyboards) that you would like to use with the host and guest OSes.  Virtualbox will allow the guest OS access to these devices by default so there is no need for the guest OS to directly control them (well, I could think of some specialized reasons but I will digress...).</li>
<li>USB storage devices that you want the guest and the host OSes to both be able to access at the same time.  Instead, mount the drive on the host OS and use shared folders to share the drive to the guest OS.</li>

","<p>Though its man page doesn't document it, <code>mv</code> will refuse to rename a directory to another directory if the target directory contains files. This is a good thing in your case because you turn out to want to <em>merge</em> the content of the source into the target, which <code>mv</code> will not do.</p>

<p>Use <code>rsync -a backup/ backupArchives/</code> instead. After that <code>rm -rf backup/*</code>.</p>

<p>I downloaded puttygen.exe and had it generate a key pair. In <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> I have this line:</p>

<pre><code>AuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys

<p>and on my client's public key file it says this:</p>

<p>I copied the part from ""ssh-rsa AAA"" to ""my@email.address.com"" and put that in the file <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> on my server (in my own homefolder). In PuTTY under Connection > SSH > Auth I entered the path to the private key it generated on my client and saved the session settings.</p>

<p>I restarted the ssh server with</p>

<p>Now if I load the profile in PuTTY (I verified the private key is still in Connection > SSH > Auth and that the path is correct) and run the profile, it says</p>

<pre><code>Server refused our key
</code></pre>

<p>I tried putting the public key in a file under the <b>directory</b> <code>./ssh/authorized_keys/</code> but that didn't help so I used <code>./ssh/authorized_keys</code> as a <b>file</b>, pasting the key in it. I also tried generating a private/public key pair on the server, putting the public key in <code>./ssh/authorized_files</code> and loading the private one in PuTTY on my client. Rebooting the server didn't help either.</p>

<p>I found that the error may be solved by putting the key in a place outside the user's home folder but that's only useful if the home folder is encrypted, which this one is not.</p>

<p>Also tried generating a 4096 bit key, thinking perhaps 1024 was too short.</p>

<p>How can I get this to work? Thanks!</p>

<p>Ok, <code>/var/log/auth.log</code> said:</p>

<pre><code>sshd: Authentication refused: bad ownership or modes for directory /home/vorkbaard/.ssh

<p>Google tells me <code>~/.ssh/</code> should be 700 and and <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> should be 600, so I did that. Now <code>/var/log/auth.log</code> says:</p>

","<p>Ok, it is fixed however I don't see how this is different from what I tried already.</p>

<p>What I did:</p>

<ul>
<li>generate a key pair with puttygen.exe (length: 1024 bits)</li>
<li>load the private key in the PuTTY profile</li>
<li>enter the public key in <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> <strong>in one line</strong> (needs to start with <code>ssh-rsa</code>)</li>
<li><code>chmod 700 ~/.ssh</code></li>
<li><code>chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code></li>
<li><code>chown $USER:$USER ~/.ssh -R</code></li>
<li>change <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> so it contains <code>AuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys</code></li>
<li><code>sudo service ssh restart</code></li>

"How to detect and configure an output with xrandr?","193860","","<p>I have a DELL U2410 monitor connected to a Compaq 100B desktop equipped with an integrated AMD/ATI graphics card (AMD E-350). The installed O/S is Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.</p>

<p>The computer is connected to the monitor via the DVI connection.</p>

<p>The problem is that I cannot set the desktop resolution to the native 1920x1200. The maximum allowed resolution is 1600x1200.</p>

<p>Doing some research I found about the <code>xrandr</code> utility. Unfortunately, when trying to use it I cannot configure it to the required resolution. First, it does not report the output name (which supposed to be <code>DVI-0</code>), saying <code>default</code> instead. Without it I cannot use the <code>--fb</code> option.</p>

<p>The EDID utility seems to identify the monitor well. Here's the output from <code>get-edid</code>:</p>

<p>How can I set the screen resolution to 1920x1200?
Why doesn't <code>xrandr</code> identify the <code>DVI-0</code> output?</p>

<p>Note that the same computer running Ubuntu version higher than 10.04 detects the correct resolution with no problems. On this machine I cannot upgrade due to some legacy hardware compatibility problems.</p>

 </pre>

<p>Then, I think, you will be able to get xrandr to use the custom mode you've learned how to define (if you still need it after fixing the basic problem).</p>

<p><strong>Increase Virtual Screen Size</strong></p>

<p>[This][1] article suggests adding a Virtual line to the Screen section of a xorg.conf configuration file to set the maximum screen size. It's from a couple of years ago. When testing this I wasn't able to set the Virtual line past the maximum screen size given by <code>xrandr -q</code>, however. With my driver and hardware that value was an already quite large 8192x8192, however.</p>

<p>You could experiment by adding this as /etc/X11/xorg.conf, for example:</p>

<pre>
Section ""Screen""
    Identifier ""My Screen""
    Subsection ""Display""
        Virtual 2048 2048
    EndSubSection
EndSection</pre>

<p>You will probably not see a /etc/X11/xorg.conf as today's video drivers will attempt to determine reasonable defaults for everything and modern distributions leave that file out. It will be used if present, however. </p>

<p>If you do already have an /etc/X11/xorg.conf file you can try adding the above Virtual line to the Display subsection of its Screen section</p>

<p>I suggest you test this with a command line editor since there's some chance it will mess up your ability to sign on with the Ubuntu GUI and you may need to do Alt-Ctrl-F1, sign on, and edit (or remove) the file using command line tools. Any errors should in /var/log/Xorg.0.log or /var/log/Xorg.1.log. </p>

<p>In fact, you could and should test this by logging into an additional userid on your system (without logging out of your usual userid) and checking from the new session, that way you can use Alt-Ctrl-F7 to go back to your working GUI if there's trouble. In the case that you are using an additional user id to log in without logging out of the first the appropriate log will be /var/log/Xorg.1.log. Don't log out of the working session or boot until you have a working xorg.conf or have again removed it.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Use a Different Graphics Driver</strong></p>

<p>Another article I read resolved this problem by switching drivers, but I see from your question that the Additional Drivers program doesn't give you any alternatives. (I assume that's what you mean above when you mention the ""Hardware Drivers dialog"". Unless you change drivers with the Additional Drivers program you will use a driver the kernel deems appropriate for your video card or the video logic on your motherboard.</p>

<p>For the OP, from what you described in your comments above it appears that your system should be using the radeon driver, but isn't. I use the radeon driver and commonly set my horizontal resolution to 1920 (max for the driver/card seems to be 8192). The vesa and fb drivers are very basic drivers for old hardware--old enough that monitors of that era didn't have very large displays.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Upgrade Ubuntu</strong></p>

<p>If you are running a computer newer than the Ubuntu version you have installed and, in particular, its Linux kernel it's completely possible that the kernel won't recognize your graphics adapter. If that's the case you need to upgrade your Ubuntu software which contains support for your equipment.</p>

<p>Since he can't get fglrx to run, this unfortunately  is the case for ysap. Because of the newness of this equipment relative to the release ysap is running, there is no support for [1002.9802] in the Lucid (or Maverick either) Linux kernel. First support for this equipment appeared in the Natty 2.6.38 kernel. To check for support for a particular device in kernel modules you can go to /lib/modules/<em>kernel-version</em>/module.alias file and search for the adapter's value. For that equipment:</p>

<pre><code>grep v00001002d00009802 /lib/modules/2.6.38-10-generic/modules.alias
</code></pre>

<p>To check Natty's kernel support. It replies:</p>

<pre><code>alias pci:v00001002d00009802sv*sd*bc*sc*i* radeon
</code></pre>

<p>As a test, you can try to boot a live CD on the system and try to set the resolution you desire in that environment (click on Try Ubuntu, rather than Install).</p>

<p>Getting appropriate driver support can also enable modern graphics facilities like direct rendering and OpenGL support, greatly improving performance and aesthetics.</p>

<p>For a personal computer you may also be able to use an upgraded kernel if a compatible one is available for your version of Ubuntu. For a production computer it may be necessary to upgrade Ubuntu to a newer version, when available, for the sake of reliability and robustness.</p>

<pre><code> */2 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path_to_my_php_script/info.php &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre>
","<p>The syntax for the crontab entry looks correct. Indeed, if you edit your crontab using ""<code>crontab -e</code>"" (as you should), you'll get an error if you specify a syntactically invalid crontab entry anyway.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Firstly, does <code>/path_to_my_php_script/info.php</code> run correctly from the command-line?</p></li>
<li><p>If so, does it also run correctly like this?:</p>

<pre><code>/bin/sh -c ""(export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin; /path_to_my_php_script/info.php &lt;/dev/null)""
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If that works, does it work like this?</p>

</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Step (3) is similar to how cron will run your program (as documented in ""man 5 cron"".</p>

<p>The most likely problem you're having is that the PATH cron is using to run your program is too restrictive. Therefore, you may wish to add something like the following to the top of your crontab entry (you'll need to add in whatever directories your script will need):</p>

<pre><code>PATH=~/bin:/usr/bin/:/bin
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that cron will by default use <code>/bin/sh</code>, not bash. If you need bash, also add this to the start of your crontab file:</p>

<pre><code>SHELL=/bin/bash
</code></pre>

<p>Note that both those changes will affect <strong>all</strong> the crontab entries. If you just want to modify these values for your <code>info.php</code> program, you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>*/2 * * * * /bin/bash -c "". ~/.bashrc; /path_to_my_php_script/info.php""
</code></pre>

<p>It's also worth mentioning that on a system configured for ""mail"" (in other words a system which has an MTA configured [sendmail/postfix/etc]), all output from crontab programs is sent to you via email automatically. A default Ubuntu desktop system won't have local mail configured, but if you're working on a server you can just type ""mail"" in a terminal to see all those cron mails. This also applies to the ""<code>at</code>"" command.</p>

<p>Do you know how i could deal with this ?</p>

<p>If I was working on my local machine, I would call <code>gksudo nautilus</code> but in this case I only have terminal access to the machine.</p>
","<p>You're right, there is no <code>sudo</code> when working with <code>scp</code>. A workaround is to use <code>scp</code> to upload files to a directory where your user has permissions to create files, then log in via ssh and use <code>sudo</code> to move/copy files to their final destination.</p>

<p>Another solution would be to change permissions/ownership of the directories you uploading the files to, so your non-privileged user is able to write to those directories.</p>

<p>Generally, working in the <code>root</code> account should be an exception, not a rule - the way you phrasing your question makes me think maybe you're abusing it a bit, which in turn leads to problems with permissions - under normal circumstances you don't need super-admin privileges to access your own files.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/a8teY.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Any idea?</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot of the guest showing some networking information:</p>

<p><sup>(Please note that this question is about how to give a VM Internet access in VirtualBox, so the presence of a picture of Windows doesn't <em>automatically</em> make this off-topic!)</sup></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MBJWb.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.imgur.com/YFms5.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Larger image here.</strong></a></p>
","<h2>Setting Up NAT</h2>

<p><strong>NAT</strong> is not an option for <em>Adapter Type</em>. Rather, it's an option for <em>Attached to</em>.</p>

<p>Click where it currently says <strong>Bridged Adapter</strong> and you should be able to select <strong>NAT</strong>.</p>

<p>By the way, the reason changing it to <strong>NAT</strong> sometimes helps is not specific to Windows guests. Rather, if your physical (host) PC is on a LAN, <strong>Bridged Adapter</strong> (as well as <strong>NAT</strong>) usually works fine. If your physical PC has a network connection for just one computer--as is often the case if it's plugged directly into a cable/DSL/ISDN modem that only has one Ethernet port on it--then there is no local network to bridge to, so then you must use <strong>NAT</strong>.</p>

<p>If you use <strong>Bridged Adapter</strong> and your host machine is on a physical LAN, your guest machine will automatically be able to see and be seen by computers on the LAN. If you use <strong>NAT</strong> on a LAN, the guest machine will be able to see the other computers on the LAN but the other computers on the LAN (besides the virtualization host) will not be able to see it.</p>

<p>If you're interested in more details, see these articles on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_bridge"" rel=""noreferrer"">network bridging</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation"" rel=""noreferrer"">network address translation</a>.</p>

<p>If that works, great. Otherwise...</p>

<h2>Check the Guest's Network Configuration</h2>

<p>In the virtual machine, open the Network Connections configuration (from the Control Panel or in Start Menu > Settings). Unless you've manually configured multiple interfaces for the guest machines in VirtualBox (or have actual network adapters attached to it with USB forwarding), you'll see just one, and unless you've changed its name, it will be called <em>Local Area Connection</em> (perhaps with a number after it).</p>

<p>Right-click on that and click <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ys1XU.png"" alt=""guest machine, Windows XP Network Connections: this is the first place to click &quot;Properties&quot;""></p>

<p>Under <em>The connection uses the following items</em>, click <em>Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</em> and click <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/y4qHB.png"" alt=""guest machine, Windows XP &quot;Local Area Connection&quot; showing protocols and services list""></p>

<p>Make sure the configuration is correct.</p>

<h3>For Bridged Connections</h3>

<p>If you kept the VM's network adapter <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_bridge"" rel=""noreferrer"">bridged</a> in VirtualBox, rather than switching it to NAT, then it is as if there is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch"" rel=""noreferrer"">layer 2 network switch</a> connecting three devices:</p>

<ul>
<li>The virtual machine.</li>
<li>The physical host machine.</li>
<li>Whatever the physical host machine is connected to (on the particular host network adapter that was bridged). For example, if your computer is plugged into a router, it's like the switch is plugged into the router. If it's connected wirelessly to an access point, it's like the switch is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_bridge"" rel=""noreferrer"">wireless bridge</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, <strong>your VM is ""networkologically"" equivalent to your host machine</strong>. Whatever settings it has (except its IP address of course), your virtual machine should have.</p>

<h3>For NAT Connections</h3>

<p>If you selected <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation"" rel=""noreferrer"">NAT</a> for <em>Attached to</em> in VirtualBox, then it's like <em>your real computer is acting like a small home/office router</em>. Your host machine runs a DHCP server that is accessible only to VirtualBox virtual machines, and the guest gets all its network configuration information from it.</p>

<p>The VirtualBox DHCP server will provide both an IP address and DNS information to the guest, so <em>both</em> of these two options should be selected:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Obtain an IP address automatically</em></li>
<li><em>Obtain DNS server address automatically</em></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kq9tC.png"" alt=""guest machine, Windows XP TCP/IP settings, General tab""></p>

<h3>This is the key.</h3>

<p><em>This is the particular problem, for the system in this question. <strong>If</strong> this is the only problem with the configuration, then fixing this should solve the matter entirely.</em></p>

<p>You have manual settings, rather than DHCP.</p>

<p>That can work, but the manual settings would need to be correct, and you'd also want to make sure the IP was not in the range of IP addresses that your router assigns from (or there could be a collision with another device on the network).</p>

<p>In this case, the manual settings are not correct at all, because:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The host machine's IP address on the network interface through which it provides an Internet connection to the guest is not the same as its IP address on the physical network. Even if your computer's IP address is 192.168.1.1 ""in real life,"" the guest cannot access it that way.</p>

<ul>
<li>More likely, if you set it up this way yourself, you may have been thinking that you should put your real-life home/office router's IP address (which is often 192.168.1.1) in as the default gateway and the primary DNS server.</li>
</ul>

<p>But the guest cannot directly access the physical NAT router on your desk (or wherever), because any data transmitted between the VM and the real router must go through the VM's router, and the VM's router is your computer (accessed through that special virtual network interface).</p></li>
<li><p>Since the default gateway is wrong, no routing occurs and the VM cannot access any physical network devices outside your computer.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the VM's IP address is outside the correct range (which is usually 10.2.2.*) and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, it cannot access the correct range. (The subnet mask is correct, but together with the IP it identifies the wrong subnet.)</p></li>
<li><p>The DNS server must also be fixed or no hosts can be accessed through their domain names (like askubuntu.com).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If for some reason you <em>need</em> to use a ""static IP,"" i.e., not use DHCP, then you'll have to get the correct information from VirtualBox and input it. Please let me know if you need help with that (I can expand this to include instructions).</p>

<p>Assuming DHCP is okay with you, you can solve the problem by making your <em>Internet Protocol (TCP/IP Properties)</em>, <em>General</em> tab settings look like the screenshot above.</p>

<h2>Still No Internet Connection? Time to Troubleshoot</h2>

<p>It may help to gather some more information from the guest side. In the virtualized Windows XP system that is mysteriously not connecting to the Internet, install the VirtualBox guest additions (by clicking <em>Devices</em> > <em>Install Guest Additions</em>; see <a href=""https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sharedfolders"" rel=""noreferrer"">the manual</a> for more information). Reboot, and see if you can connect to the Internet. If you cannot, you've still accomplished something useful, because now you can copy and paste between the guest and host clipboards.</p>

<p>So open the Command Prompt in Windows. One way to do that is to run:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Start > Run... > <code>cmd.exe</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now run this command to get information about the Windows guest system's network interfaces and connections.</p>

<pre><code>ipconfig /all
</code></pre>

<p>Then copy all the text in the command prompt to the clipboard. This functionality is accessible in the contextual menu raised by right-clicking anywhere inside the command prompt window. You can then edit your question on your Ubuntu host system where you have a working Internet connection, and paste it in.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>More generally, for people other than the asker of this question:</p>

<p>You can then paste it into applications in your Ubuntu host system, permitting you to refer to it when your Windows VM is suspended/off. You can provide it to whoever is trying to help you. You can include it in your own question here on Ask Ubuntu</p>

<p>(However, if your network problem is in the virtual installation, rather than the virtual hardware or the VirtualBox software--for example, if your VM accessed the Internet fine until you installed some Windows software <em>other than the guest additions</em>--then your problem would likely be considered off- topic for Ask Ubuntu. It would likely be on-topic for <a href=""http://superuser.com"">Super User</a> though.)</p></li>

"How to add a GPG key to the apt sources keyring?","188579","","<p><a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser"">Ubuntu Doc</a> page says this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is advisable that you add the Opera GPG key.</p>
  
  <p><code>wget -qO - http://deb.opera.com/archive.key | sudo apt-key add -</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where do I add that?</p>

<p>I want to take the advice but I don't know what part of software center to add gpg keys to.</p>
","<p>This a a one line command to enter in terminal. See
<a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/38162/what-is-a-terminal-and-how-do-i-open-and-use-it"">What is a terminal and how do I open and use it?</a> </p>

<p>To use it, you would paste the entire command in the terminal (remember to use https):</p>

<pre><code>wget -qO - https://deb.opera.com/archive.key | sudo apt-key add -
</code></pre>

<p>But of course, it is daunting just copying and pasting commands without knowing what they are doing, and having no instructions on how to undo their actions, so here is a basic breakdown of the commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>wget</code> downloads something from a server. See <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/wget.1.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">wget manual for Ubuntu 16.04</a>.</li>
<li><code>|</code> is a pipline, which takes the output of one command and runs it into the input of another</li>
<li><code>apt-key add</code> adds a package key</li>
</ul>

<p>So it basically downloads the key and then adds it in one command.</p>

<p>I tested the command and it should work.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now to verify that it worked, run this command (from <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/107189/47291"">this answer</a>):</p>

<pre><code>apt-key list
</code></pre>

<p>This will list the keys added and the key from Opera should be listed on the bottom like this:</p>

<pre><code>pub   1024D/30C18A2B 2012-10-29 [expires: 2014-10-29]

sub   4096g/C528FCA9 2012-10-29 [expires: 2014-10-29]
</code></pre>

<p>The linked answer also shows that you can remove the key if needed, using:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-key del 30C18A2B
</code></pre>

<p>with <code>30C18A2B</code> being the key-id from the list.</p>

<hr>

<p>After performing that command, and setting up the sources exactly like in <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/291034/adding-repository"">your screen-shot</a>, do:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update

"tor browser install ubuntu 14.04","187660","","<p>I have read the answers to other questions regarding the install/running of the tor browser. I have tried the answers given but still cannot get the tor browser to run on mine. I have ubuntu 14.04 and where it shows to start tor browser when I double click all I get is an open tab full of code. Anyone with suggestions I should try? I also tried downloading from tor project did not work and tried the install using command in the terminal and it also did not work. When I had windows I had no problem with the install or the tor browser running. I really like ubuntu better this is the only thing that I am having trouble with. PLEASE HELP!!!</p>
","<p><br/>Install from Terminal:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you installed older version of Tor-Browser, in first you must clear the old <code>.tor-browser-en</code> folder from home folder. Just clear that by using: <code>cd ~ &amp;&amp; rm -r .tor-browser-en</code></p>

<p>Then type following line one by one in Terminal ( <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> ) to install Tor-Browser.</p>

<p>Transcoding is not an option. </p>
","<p>Perhaps the easiest tool for that is <code>ffmpeg</code>, or <code>avconv</code> from the <code>libav-tools</code> package.

<p>Changing container without re-enconding content could not be simpler:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mkv -codec copy output.mp4

<ul>
<li><p>It auto-detects a Matroska to MP4 container conversion based on input/output filenames.</p></li>
<li><p><code>-codec copy</code> stream copies, or ""re-muxes"", the streams from the input to the output without re-encoding. Think of it like a copy and paste.</p></li>
<li><p>Default stream selection behavior is to select only one stream per stream type. For example, if your input has two video streams and one audio stream then only the video stream with the largest frame size will be selected. Add <code>-map 0</code> if you want to select all streams from the input.</p></li>
<li><p>Some containers may not support some formats. So check if your chosen <em>container</em> format, be it <code>mkv</code>, <code>mp4</code> or even <code>avi</code> has support for all the <em>content</em> in your files (video, audio, subtitles, data, etc). For example, <code>mp4</code> does not support SubRip subtitles (<code>.srt</code> files).</p></li>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get --purge remove postgresql
</code></pre>

<p>This will also prompt you to remove that software that depends on Postgres, which in this case it appears you would like to do.<br>
I do not personally run 9.10 or Postgres, so it is possible that Postgres installs itself in several parts. In that case, a simple:</p>

<pre><code>dpkg -l | grep postgres
</code></pre>

<p>Will get you the list of those packages that Postgres installed.
Then, just use the same ""apt-get --purge remove ...."" command but instead of just postgresql, type each package name, separated by spaces, like:</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get --purge remove postgresql postgresql-doc postgresql-common</code> (depending on the list of packages installed, of course)</p>

","<p>Copied as-is from <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ServerFaq#What.27s_the_difference_between_desktop_and_server.3F"">Ubuntu docs</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first difference is in the CD contents. The ""Server"" CD avoids including what Ubuntu considers desktop packages (packages like X, Gnome or KDE), but does include server related packages (Apache2, Bind9 and so on). Using a Desktop CD with a minimal installation and installing, for example, apache2 from the network, one can obtain the exact same result that can be obtained by inserting the Server CD and installing apache2 from the CD-ROM.</li>
<li>The Ubuntu Server Edition installation process is slightly different from the Desktop Edition. Since by default Ubuntu Server doesn't have a GUI, the process is menu driven, very similar to the Alternate CD installation process.</li>
<li>Before 12.04, Ubuntu server installs a server-optimized kernel by default. Since 12.04, there is no difference in kernel between Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server since linux-image-server is merged into linux-image-generic. </li>
<li>For Ubuntu LTS releases before 12.04, the Ubuntu Desktop Edition only receives 3 years of support. This was increased to 5 years in Ubuntu LTS 12.04 In contrast, all Ubuntu LTS Server Edition releases are supported for 5 years. </li>

"How to find and change the screen DPI?","183698","","<p>I am trying to find and then change the <em>screen</em> DPI (dots per inch) setting in 12.04 and 12.10. However, I can't seem to find any app or config file that can do this. Is there any app or conf file for this?</p>

<p>Note that this is for 12.04+ so the following will not work:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/60044/how-do-i-change-the-font-dpi-settings"">How do I change the font DPI settings?</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Moreover, they are basically changing the font size, not the actual screen DPI.</p>
","<p>This is an updated version of my previous answer which was related to Ubuntu 12.04. In 16.04 (Xenial) 3 steps are needed to set DPI correctly instead of 2.</p>

<p>I'll explain on the example of the system with Ubuntu 12.04 with Gnome Classic and a monitor with resolution 1680x1050. My starting settings: <code>xdpyinfo | grep dots</code> reported <code>96x96 dots</code> , <code>xrdb -query | grep dpi</code> reported <code>Xft.dpi: 96</code> , <code>grep DPI /var/log/Xorg.0.log</code> reported some weird settings <code>NOUVEAU(0): DPI set to (90, 88)</code>.</p>

<p>In 16.04 the outputs of all these 3 commands were consistent and were equal to 96. Though such consensus is better than the disorder of 12.04, the reported value is hardcoded and far from the real DPI value.</p>

<p>Let's calculate optimal DPI for my monitor. Actual size of the screen can be found with the command <code>xrandr | grep -w connected</code> (convert output to centimetres) or with a long ruler by hand. In my case: <code>X = 47.4cm</code> ; <code>Y = 29.6cm</code>. Divide them by 2.54 to get the size in inches: <code>X ~ 18.66in</code> ; <code>Y ~ 11.65in</code>. Lastly divide the actual dots amount (based on your resolution) by the size in inches: <code>X = 1680/18.66 ~ 90dpi</code> ; <code>Y = 1050/11.65 ~ 90dpi</code>. So my real dpi is 90.</p>

<p><strong>Be warned</strong>, the manual method of measuring may be more accurate, than the output of the command <code>xrandr | grep -w connected</code> because the newer versions of X server ignore the size reported by EDID and calculate the size using the screen resolution and a hardcoded value of DPI (more info <a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/589485"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>).<br>
Another method how to find the size of the monitor is to read its EDID directly. Install <code>read-edid</code> package and run the command <code>sudo get-edid | parse-edid | grep DisplaySize</code> in the terminal. Its output will give you the actual size of your monitor in millimetres. If not - use the ruler.</p>

<p>Let's start fixing DPI:</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> In 12.04 run <code>gksudo gedit</code>, open <code>/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf</code> and add a parameter under <code>[SeatDefaults]</code> section:</p>

<pre><code>xserver-command=X -dpi 90
</code></pre>

<p>There's no such file in 16.04 by default, so you must create <code>lightdm.conf</code> manually and put it into <code>/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/</code>. The contents of this file are the same:</p>

<pre><code>[SeatDefaults]
xserver-command=X -dpi 90
</code></pre>

<p>Restart your computer or restart X. Now <code>grep DPI /var/log/Xorg.0.log</code> will  show the desired setting.</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> In my former answer I proposed to create a file in <code>/etc/X11/Xsession.d/</code> containing string <code>xrandr --dpi 90</code>. This worked in 12.04, but in 16.04 this setting isn't persistent. In newer systems we can add the desired value on session start. Run ""Startup Applications"", press ""Add"" button, name it ""Fix DPI"" and set the command <code>xrandr --dpi 90</code> in the field. Save the changes and re-login. Now <code>xdpyinfo | grep dots</code> will report <code>90x90 dots</code>.</p>

<p>If <code>xdpyinfo</code> still shows 96 then add a timeout before running <code>xrandr</code>. Edit the command in ""Startup Applications"" and change it to:</p>

<pre><code>bash -c ""sleep 15; xrandr --dpi 90""
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/637921/123714"">Reference</a>  </p>

<p><em>Step 2 is optional for 12.04 because in older systems Step 1 fixes both <code>Xorg.0.log</code> and <code>xdpyinfo</code> values.</em></p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> In GNOME3 DPI setting is hardcoded to 96 and cannot be changed directly, but the text can be scaled instead. Calculate the desired multiplier: <code>desired_DPI / 96</code> (in my case <code>90/96 = 0.9375</code>). Now run the command (or use <code>dconf</code> if you prefer):</p>

<pre><code>gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface text-scaling-factor 0.9375
</code></pre>

<p>Changes will be applied at once. <code>xrdb -query | grep dpi</code> will report the desired <code>Xft.dpi: 90</code>.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> There is another method to fix DPI setting which is much more difficult and it is described in <a href=""http://blog.drtebi.com/2012/12/changing-dpi-setting-on-gnome-34.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> guide. I tried it also and the result was the same (at least in 12.04).</p>

<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> Only Ubuntu developers can say for certain whether values modified by Steps 1 &amp; 2 really matter in modern Ubuntu or they are silently ignored. Only Step 3 produces the changes which are instantly noticeable. Those users who consider that certain apps may still rely on X server settings are encouraged to perform all 3 steps described above. For the rest Step 3 is sufficient - that's the sole way of customization adopted in modern Ubuntu distros.</p>

"Removing Firefox in Ubuntu with all add-ons like it never existed","183663","","<p>I have been using Firefox for a long time in Ubuntu, I downloaded some add-ons but it made firefox extremely slow, even if I remove them nothing will change.</p>

<p>I tried to remove Firefox also, but re-installing it will somehow recover the same Firefox I had- it seems it write some info somewhere that even if you remove Firefox, it will keep them.</p>

<p>Moreover, I am not able to use see any flash videos or website with Firefox(chrome works fine).. Honestly I tampered with plug-in settings in Firefox that this happened. But right now I can't do anything to overwrite the setting...</p>

<p>My question is how I can remove Firefox in a way to remove any previous traces and re-install a new version like for the first time?</p>
","<h2>Delete Firefox and all it's data:</h2>

<p>I think this can be done in five easy steps, <strong>please edit my answer - or tell me to - if it's not complete</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>run <code>sudo apt-get purge firefox</code></p></li>
<li><p>Delete <code>.mozilla/firefox/</code> in your home directory, should it still be there</p></li>
<li><p>Delete <code>.macromedia/</code> and <code>.adobe</code> in your home directory, these can contain ""Flash Cookies"" stored by the browser. The same is true, if applicable, for Silverlight (Moonlight) and other plugins, they can allow websites to store data on your computer.</p></li>
<li><p>Delete <code>/etc/firefox/</code>, this is where your preferences and user-profiles are stored</p></li>
<li><p>Delete <code>/usr/lib/firefox/</code> should it still be there</p></li>
<li><p>Delete <code>/usr/lib/firefox-addons/</code> should it still be there</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Mind the periods in front of file- and directory names: They indicate a hidden directory. You can tell your File Browser to show them by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd>.</p>

<p>The 4th and 5th step must be done with superuser privileges. To start a the File Browser as a superuser, press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd> and enter <code>gksu nautilus</code>. </p>

<p>Finally, restart your computer to get rid of all temporary files. This should remove all traces of firefox ever being there.</p>

<p>Important:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't rely on this method if you've got sensitive information to protect! Deleting a file, in most cases, only means deleting a reference to it. The raw data will still be on your hard drive, and the proverbial bond-villain will be able to recover them. I'm only mentioning this <em>in case</em> it's applicable to anybody who reads this. The only way to <em>really</em> get rid of data, is to shred the hard drive to bits.</li>

<p>NB: I accept that this is a duplicate (I was looking for it, and couldn't find it, so asked + answered it, hoping that I would find it) however, I don't think the question about .desktop files is a duplicate.</p>
","<p>There are two ways of making a file executable:</p>

<p><strong>GUI Method:</strong></p>

<p>Go to the permissions tab, then tick the box <code>Execute: [✓]</code> Allow executing file as program.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5ea5F.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5ea5F.png"" alt=""""></a></p>

<p><strong>Command line method:</strong></p>

<p>Just run:</p>

<pre><code>chmod +x /path/to/your/file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>chmod</code> does also have some more advanced options. It accepts three groups of options, represented as <code>--- --- ---</code>. The first set of <code>---</code> is User. The second is Group and the last is Other (everyone else).</p>

<p><code>r</code> stands for Read, <code>w</code> for Write and <code>x</code> for eXecute.</p>

<p>To allow everyone to read it, but only Group to execute and User to read and write it would be <code>-rw- rx- r--</code>. This would be added to the command as:</p>

<pre><code>chmod +rw-rx-r-- /path/to/file.extension
</code></pre>

<p><code>chmod</code> also can do this in numbers. It is based on binary.</p>

<p>So there are these numbers:</p>

<p>Execute by user is <code>100</code>.
Execute by group is <code>010</code>.
Execute by other is <code>001</code></p>

<p>Write by user is <code>200</code>.
Write by group is <code>020</code>.
Write by other is <code>002</code>.</p>

<p>Read by user is <code>400</code>.
Read by group is <code>040</code>.
Read by other is <code>004</code>.</p>

<p>Then you add these together to get the desired combination.</p>

<p>So to allow everyone to read it, but only Group to execute and User to write it would be <code>400 + 040 + 004</code> and <code>010</code> and <code>200</code></p>

<p>That adds up to <code>600 + 050 + 004 = 654</code>.</p>

<p>You could then run the command.</p>

<pre><code>chmod +654 /path/to/file.extension
</code></pre>

<p>to set it. So to set all permissions you can run:</p>

<pre><code>chmod +rwxrwxrwx /path/to/file.extension
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>chmod +777 /path/to/file.extension
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, you can do:</p>

<pre><code>chmod -777 /path/to/file.extension
</code></pre>

<p>To take all permissions away from everyone.</p>

<p>And:</p>

<pre><code>chmod +300 /path/to/file.extension
</code></pre>

<p>To add read and write for the user, without affecting any other permissions (e.g. Execute permissions).</p>

<p><a href=""http://ss64.com/bash/chmod.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">This website</a> has a very useful little tool, whereby you can tick the options you want and it gives you the command:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Vgwt.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Vgwt.png"" alt=""""></a></p>

<p>However, not all the possible combinations are sensible to use; the main ones that are used are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>755 - <code>Owner</code> has all, and <code>Group</code> and <code>Other</code> can read and execute</p></li>
<li><p>700 - <code>Owner</code> has all</p></li>
<li><p>644 - <code>Owner</code> can read and write, and <code>Group</code> and <code>Other</code> can read</p></li>
<li><p>600 - <code>Owner</code> can read and write</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And, if you're using non-trivial user groups:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>775 - <code>Owner</code> can read and write, and <code>Group</code> and <code>Other</code> can read</p></li>
<li><p>770 - <code>Owner</code> and <code>Group</code> have all, and <code>Other</code> can read and execute</p></li>
<li><p>750 - <code>Owner</code> has all, and <code>Group</code> can read and execute</p></li>
<li><p>664 - <code>Owner</code> and <code>Group</code> can read and write, and <code>Other</code> can just read</p></li>
<li><p>660 - <code>Owner</code> and <code>Group</code> can read and write</p></li>
<li><p>640 - <code>Owner</code> can read and write, and <code>Group</code> can read</p></li>

"What is the loopback device and how do I use it?","182603","","<p>What are <em>loopback</em> and <em>localhost</em>?</p>

<p>Why do they exist, what are they used for, and how would I use them?</p>
","<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopback#Virtual_network_interface"" rel=""noreferrer"">loopback device</a> is a special, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Interface"" rel=""noreferrer"">virtual</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_port_%28hardware%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">network interface</a> that your computer uses to communicate with itself. It is used mainly for diagnostics and troubleshooting, and to connect to servers running on the local machine.</p>

<h2>The Purpose of Loopback</h2>

<p>When a network interface is disconnected--for example, when an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ethernet</a> port is unplugged or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wifi"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wi-Fi</a> is turned off or not associated with an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point"" rel=""noreferrer"">access point</a>--no communication on that interface is possible, not even communication between your computer and itself. The loopback interface does not represent any actual hardware, but exists so applications running on your computer can always connect to servers on the same machine.</p>

<p>This is important for troubleshooting (it can be compared to looking in a mirror). The loopback device is sometimes explained as purely a diagnostic tool. But it is also helpful when a server offering a resource you need <em>is running on your own machine</em>.</p>

<p>For example, if you run a web server, you have all your web documents and could examine them file by file. You may be able to load the files in your browser too, though with server-side active content, it won't work the way it does when someone accesses it normally.</p>

<p>So if you want to experience the same site others do, the best course is usually to connect to your own server. The loopback interface facilitates that.</p>

<h2>Addresses on Loopback</h2>

<p>For <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4"" rel=""noreferrer"">IPv4</a>, the loopback interface is assigned all the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address"" rel=""noreferrer"">IPs</a> in the <code>127.0.0.0/8</code> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork"" rel=""noreferrer"">address block</a>. That is, <code>127.0.0.1</code> through <code>127.255.255.254</code> <em>all</em> represent your computer. For most purposes, though, it is only necessary to use one IP address, and that is <code>127.0.0.1</code>. This IP has the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname"" rel=""noreferrer"">hostname</a> of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>localhost</code></a> mapped to it.</p>

<p>Thus, to log in as <code>bob</code> via <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH"" rel=""noreferrer"">SSH</a> to the SSH server running on your own machine, you would use:</p>

<pre><code>ssh bob@localhost
</code></pre>

<p>Like other network adapters, the loopback device shows up in the output of <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man8/ifconfig.8.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ifconfig</code></a>. Its name is <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man4/lo.4freebsd.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>lo</code></a>.</p>

<h2>An Example: CUPS</h2>

<p>One common, production (i.e., not just diagnostic) use of <code>localhost</code> on Ubuntu is to perform advanced printer configuration. In a web browser, go to:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:631
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUPS"" rel=""noreferrer"">CUPS</a> runs a web server on port 631, and this can be used to configure printing, regardless of what GUI you are running (or even if you are not running a GUI at all).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3BDda.png"" alt=""Screenshot showing CUPS in a web browser""></p>

<p>If you try connecting to <code>http://127.0.0.1:631</code>, this will work too. However, if you try to connect to <code>http://127.0.0.2</code>, it will not. All the <code>127.*.*.*</code> addresses identify your computer on the loopback interface, but a server program can decide to bind just to a specific IP address.</p>

<h2>A Notable Difference from Windows</h2>

<p>If you come from a Windows background, you might expect <code>loopback</code> to itself be a synonym of <code>localhost</code> (and thus to be able to ping <code>loopback</code>, connect to servers on <code>loopback</code>, and so forth). That behavior is peculiar to Windows.</p>

<ul>
<li>But you <em>can</em> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_file"" rel=""noreferrer"">add any name</a> including <code>loopback</code> to your <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man5/hosts.5.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>/etc/hosts</code> file</a>, with <code>127.0.0.1</code> as its address, and it will act like <code>localhost</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Meanings of ""Loopback""</h2>

<p>The general concept of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopback"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>loopback</em></a> is a mechanism through which a message or signal ends up (or loops) back to where it started.</p>

<p>So there are a few other ways <em>loopback</em> is use in Ubuntu that should not be confused with the loopback device in networking.</p>

<h3>Loop Mounts</h3>

<p>To mount a disk image in Ubuntu, you could run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount -o loop <strong><em>image</em></strong>.iso /media/<strong><em>label</em></strong></code></pre>

<p>This is usually called a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_device"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>loop device</em></a> (and not a <em>loopback device</em>), but the term <em>loopback file interface</em> is occasionally used.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with the loopback device in networking.</p>

<h3>Sound</h3>

<p>Pulseaudio and other sound systems provide a mechanism to ""connect"" line-in to line-out, so that audio input is echoed back to your speakers/headphones. Pulseaudio's <a href=""http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/FAQ#How_do_I_connect_an_input_source_to_an_output_sink.3F"" rel=""noreferrer"">loopback module</a> facilitates this.</p>

<p>Here, it <em>is</em> correct to use the term <em>loopback</em>, but like loop mounts, this also has nothing to do with the loopback device in networking. (And nothing to do with loop mounts, either.)</p>

"""Mounting cifs URL not implemented yet"" when I try to mount a samba share","181178","","<p>I have a server for development (Ubuntu 12.04). On that machine, I have a shared folder named ""projects"". I tried</p>

<p><code>sudo mount -t smbfs smb://192.168.2.28/projects/myProject /mnt/myProject</code></p>

<p>on my Ubuntu 11.10 and got the error:</p>

<pre>
Mounting cifs URL not implemented yet. Attempt to mount smb://192.168.2.28/projects/myProject.
</pre>

<p>How can I do to solve it? I need to mount the folder to use it with NetBeans.</p>
","<p>Since as the error message says CIFS URLs (starting with <code>smb://</code>) are not supported, you have to use the ""classic"" syntax to identify the server and share. Furthermore, you cannot mount a folder <em>within</em> a share as though it is a share--you should mount the share and then access the folder within it. You can make a symbolic link to the folder inside the share,  if necessary. Finally, when you run <code>smbmount</code>, <code>mount -t smbfs</code>, or similar remote mount commands as <code>root</code> (for example, with <code>sudo</code>), you need to specify the username on the server (unless it's actually <code>root</code>, which is unlikely and, if the server runs a Unix-like system, not recommended).</p>

<p>So first, you'll create a folder (mount point) for the share:</p>

<p><code>sudo mkdir /mnt/projects</code></p>

<p>(This is assuming you want to create it in <code>/mnt</code>. It's become more common to create all globally accessible mount points that aren't part of your Ubuntu system itself in <code>/media</code> instead of <code>/mnt</code> but it's fine to use <code>/mnt</code> if you like.)</p>

<p>Then use a command like this to mount the share:</p>

<p><code>sudo smbmount //192.168.2.28/projects /mnt/projects -o user=<strong>USERNAME</strong></code></p>

<p>Replace <strong><code>USERNAME</code></strong> with the username on the Samba server that you need to log in as. You'll be prompted for your password. You can specify your password on the command-line too (with <code>-o password=<strong>PASSWORD</strong></code>) but it will appear in cleartext in the Terminal and will go into your command history, so you probably don't want to do that.</p>

<p>You'll notice that I've used <code>smbmount</code> but <code>mount -t smbfs</code> or <code>mount -t cifs</code> (or <code>mount.cifs</code>) should work just as well, if you prefer.</p>

<p>Now <code>smb://192.168.2.28/projects</code>'s contents are accessible in <code>/mnt/projects</code>. If you need to be able to access the contents of <code>smb://192.168.2.28/projects/myProject</code> in <code>/mnt/projects/myProject</code>, you can create a symbolic link:</p>

<p><code>sudo ln -s /mnt/projects/myProject /mnt/myProject</code></p>

<p><strong>For readers of Ubuntu 12.10 and later:</strong> You must use <code>mount.cifs</code> or <code>mount -t cifs</code> (<code>smbmount</code> and <code>mount -t smbfs</code> are no longer provided). The <a href=""https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/cifs-utils"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cifs-utils</a> <a href=""https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/cifs-utils"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://hostmar.co/software-small"" alt=""Install cifs-utils""></a> package is required.

"Proper fstab entry to mount a samba share on boot?","180756","","<p>I am a little confused on the proper fstab entry for a samba share in Ubuntu 12.04  </p>

<p>although it turns out this was due to network connectivity issues, and not related to improper fstab entry.</p>

<p>Edit <code>/etc/fstab</code> and add your entry:</p>

<pre><code>//server/share /pathto/mountpoint cifs credentials=/home/username/.smbcredentials,uid=shareuser,gid=sharegroup 0 0
</code></pre>

<p>Create the .smbcredentials file in your home directory:</p>

<pre><code>username=shareuser
password=sharepassword
domain=domain_or_workgroupname
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you secure your <code>~/.smbcredentials</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>chmod 0600 ~/.smbcredentials
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, test the mount with:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount -a

"How to Edit PDFs?","180483","","<p>I typically have two needs:</p>

<p>Scenario A. <strong>Change a single PDF page.</strong></p>

<p>In this case I have a PDF but not the original source file used to create the PDF. I don't want to try to recreate the document from scratch. I'd like to open the PDF and change a few things. A good example of this scenario: I was responsible for planning a big event at a campground site, I had a PDF of the site. I wanted to start with that document, highlight some parts, add some labels, remove some parts that weren't relevant. </p>

<p>or </p>

<p>Scenario B. <strong>Combine PDFs or extract page(s) from a PDF</strong></p>

<p>This scenario usually arises because I want a single PDF deliverable that is made up of parts that are best created in different programs. In this case I have the source files for all the documents but they don't play well enough together to easily create a single PDF deliverable. For part of it, I may want to use Libre Office Writer. For another page I may want to use Gimp. Still another page I may use Libre Office Calc. I could use Writer as the master document and embed images or the Calc object into that, but for ultimate control, you can't beat separate PDF documents that are then combined.</p>

<p><strong>What are the best tools / processes for editing PDFs in Ubuntu?</strong></p>
","<p>LibreOffice Draw does not work for me as the fonts get completely messed up which then throws the formatting of the document off.</p>

<p>Here are three solutions that for me have worked consistently over the years. </p>

<h2><a href=""https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/pdfshuffler"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PDF-shuffler</a></h2>

<p>I do a lot of combining of PDF documents (as in the Scenario B) and I find PDF-shuffler simple and convenient. I have also used it to extract pages out of a larger pdf document and it works well there too. The <strong>PDF-shuffler</strong> GUI is simple and it works consistently.</p>

<h2><a href=""https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/gimp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gimp</a></h2>

<p>Sometimes for Scenario A you just want to convert the PDF into an image and then manipulate the image. If you don't know the difference between a vector graphic and an image, you probably want to convert to an image and GIMP does a good job of that. When you open a PDF with GIMP it will give you some choices about how you want to convert it. Pay attention to the resolution option. Choose a higher number for a larger file size and a more detailed image. </p>

<h2><a href=""https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/inkscape"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Inkscape</a></h2>

<p>The truth is, there isn't a super easy way to edit PDF files following scenario A above. That is because PDF is a universal format and some of the structure of the document is lost when it is converted to PDF. A simple example: if you take a 3 page report and convert it to a PDF you have broken the links between the text on each page. If you edit the PDF version of it and delete a paragraph on the first page the text from pages 2 and 3 won't automatically flow onto the first page. It would be much easier to edit that document in the original program used to create it. </p>

<p>But for whatever reason, you don't have the original document so you are stuck working off of a PDF. So set your expectations appropriately  when editing a PDF document following scenario A. </p>

<p>Once you set your expectations accordingly, you'll see that inkscape is the best tool for most jobs here. It will allow you to import a single page of the PDF document as an inkscape vector graphic. There will be a few things grouped together that don't really make sense, and you may have to change some fonts (assuming you don't have the original fonts installed), but really it is slick. </p>

<p>There is a learning curve to Inkscape but the truth is that you can't manipulate PDF without using some program with a learning curve. For my time, I'd prefer to invest that in learning Inkscape--a great application for creating vector graphics that can come in handy for lots of different scenarios--than I would in trying to figure out how to use a special tool just for editing PDFs.</p>

<p>Good luck</p>

"How do I get resolvconf to regenerate resolv.conf after I change /etc/network/interfaces?","180244","","<p>After updating <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> with something very similar to below, how do I get <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> to update?  I tried (as root) <code>resolver -u</code>, <code>service networking restart</code> but they didn't work. I also fixed the symlink for <code>resolv.conf</code> and tried <code>resolver -u</code> again. Finally in frustration I rebooted, which did fix the problem by rebuilding <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>.</p>

<p>Ubuntu 12.04, 64bit server, all the latest patches installed.</p>

<p>Example <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>:</p>

<pre><code>iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.3.3
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.3.1
    dns-search example.com
    dns-nameservers 192.168.3.45 192.168.8.10
</code></pre>
","<p><code>service networking restart</code> is not always a reliable way of down-upping all interfaces.</p>

<p>The <code>resolvconf -u</code> command only updates <code>resolv.conf</code> from resolvconf's own database. You need to update the database.</p>

<p>To update the database you have to call resolvconf with the <code>-a</code> or <code>-d</code> option. That happens behind the scenes when you run ifup or ifdown. So, normally, as with any other change to <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>, to activate changes to the dns-* options you have to ifdown the interface in question and ifup it again. Or you can reboot.</p>

<p>If you want to make changes to an interface without ifdownupping it (perhaps because you are administering the machine remotely and happen to be connected via that interface, natch) then you can achieve the same result by running resolvconf directly from the command line. This requires a bit more knowledge of resolvconf's semantics. Assume the relevant /e/n/i stanza is</p>

<pre><code>iface IIII FFFF static
    address ...
    ...
    dns-nameservers X.X.X.X Y.Y.Y.Y
    dns-search SSSS
</code></pre>

<p>where FFFF is an address family (""inet"" or ""inet6"").</p>

<p>To activate these dns-* options you run resolvconf as follows (yes, with newlines in the string piped to resolvconf).</p>

<pre><code>echo ""nameserver X.X.X.X
nameserver Y.Y.Y.Y
search SSSS"" | sudo resolvconf -a IIII.FFFF
</code></pre>

<p>For the stanza given in the question this would be the following.</p>

<pre><code>echo ""nameserver 192.168.3.45
nameserver 192.168.8.10
search example.com"" | sudo resolvconf -a eth0.inet

","<p>There is a command created specifically for that case: <code>yes</code></p>

<pre><code>$ yes | ./script
</code></pre>

<p>What <code>yes</code> does is it repeatedly prints <code>y</code> followed by a newline to stdout. If you connect the output of <code>yes</code> to another command using a pipe (the vertical bar) then the <code>y</code> followed by newline will go to the input of the other command.</p>

<p>If you want to say no (<code>n</code>) instead of yes (<code>y</code>) you can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ yes n | ./script
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Other methods to enter input:</p>

<p>If you know exactly how many <code>y</code> your script is expecting you can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ printf 'y\ny\ny\n' | ./script
</code></pre>

<p>The newlines (<code>\n</code>) are the enter keys.</p>

<p>Using <code>printf</code> instead of <code>yes</code> you have more fine grained control of input:</p>

<pre><code>$ printf 'yes\nno\nmaybe\n' | ./script
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in some rare cases the command does not require the user to press enter after the character. in that case leave the newlines out:</p>

<pre><code>$ printf 'yyy' | ./script
</code></pre>

<p>For sake of completeness you can also use a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document#Unix_shells"" rel=""noreferrer"">here document</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./script &lt;&lt; EOF
y
y
y
EOF
</code></pre>

<p>Or if your shell supports it a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document#Here_strings"" rel=""noreferrer"">here string</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./script &lt;&lt;&lt; ""y
y
y
""
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can create a file with one input per line:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./script &lt; inputfile
</code></pre>

<p>If the command is sufficiently complex and the methods above no longer suffice then you can use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expect"" rel=""noreferrer"">expect</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Technical nitpick:</p>

<p>The hypothetical command invocation you gave in your question does not work:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./script &lt; echo 'yyyyyyyyyyyyyy'
bash: echo: No such file or directory
</code></pre>

<p>This is because the shell grammar allows a redirect operator anywhere in the command line. As far as the shell is concerned your hypothetical command line is the same as this line:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./script 'yyyyyyyyyyyyyy' &lt; echo
bash: echo: No such file or directory
</code></pre>

<p>That means <code>./script</code> will be called with the argument <code>'yyyyyyyyyyyyyy'</code> and the stdin will get input from a file named <code>echo</code>. And bash complains since the file does not exists.</p>

<p>To do this, I need to install the nVidia drivers first (sigh).</p>

<p>To do this, I need changes to persist a reboot.</p>

<p>To do this, <strong>I need to <em>really</em> install Ubuntu on a USB key.</strong></p>

<p>How do you do that?</p>

<hr>

<h2>What I tried</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>I tried to make a USB key from <a href=""https://launchpad.net/testdrive"">Testdrive</a>, then boot from it, then choose ""Install Ubuntu."" The installer refused to install to the installation media itself.</p></li>
<li><p>I tried, from my installed copy of Ubuntu:</p>

<pre><code>sudo kvm /dev/sdb --cdrom .cache/testdrive/iso/ubuntu_natty-desktop-i386.iso
</code></pre>

<p>...but the installer didn't detect the disk properly.</p></li>
</ol>
","<h1>Ubuntu/Linux solution</h1>

<h2>1. Obtain latest image</h2>

<p>You should do this with <a href=""https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/testdrive"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">testdrive</a> <a href=""http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/testdrive"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://hostmar.co/software-small"" alt=""Install testdrive""></a>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rj1n8.png"" alt=""TestDrive""></p>

<p><strong>Note.</strong> If your key is smaller than 4.4 GB (for Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal)), you <strong>must</strong> get the alternate installer. The Desktop installer refuses to continue if there is less than 4.4&nbsp;GB of free disk space.</p>

<h2>2. Format the USB disk.</h2>

<p>This is important if you already have anything looking like a Linux install on your disk, or the installer will not want to touch that disk, for some reason. I failed earlier because I didn't perform this step, so skip at your own risk! You need a key that is at least 3&nbsp;GB in size.</p>

<p>You can do so from <em>System</em> → <em>Administration</em> → <em>Disk Utility</em>. Choose the destination USB key, unmount all partitions, and select <em>Format Drive.</em></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wNNA7.png"" alt=""Disk Utility""></p>

<p>You need to make sure you select ""Don't Partition"" before it lets you format the disk.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gkwf2.png"" alt=""Format drive window.""></p>

<h2>3. Start a virtual machine on the USB key</h2>

<p>I made sure (with <code>file</code>) that my USB key was in <code>/dev/sdb</code>, then ran:</p>

<pre><code>sudo qemu-system-x86_64 /dev/sdb -cdrom ~/.cache/testdrive/iso/ubuntu_natty-desktop-i386.iso
</code></pre>

<p>...to install the i386 ISO of the Natty Narwhal desktop -- the file name will vary if you download a different ISO image.</p>

<p>Details for your virtualization solution of choice will vary, but you want to use the <em>device file</em> of your USB key as the VM's hard drive.</p>

<p>Append <code>-boot order=d</code> to the kvm command to make it boot from the image in case it tries to boot from the 'hard disk' and fails because it cannot find an operating system there.</p>

<h2>4. Install normally.</h2>

<p>At this point you are working on a virtual machine that sees your USB key as the only connected hard drive. From inside the ""QEMU"" window, install as you would normally do.</p>

<p>A few notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Partitioning.</strong> Avoid using the automatic partitioning system, as it will create a swap partition on your USB key. That's no good, as swapping becomes <em>super</em> slow (seconds-long system freezes slow) and quickly kills your drive's life. Simply allocate a single partition for <code>/</code>. If you're using the alternate installer, make sure you set the <code>noatime</code> flag to further reduce the amount of writes to the disk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Updates.</strong> Skip the option to automatically download and install updates. It is not guaranteed that the repositories will be in a consistent state by the time you run the installer. Personally, I'd rather manage the upgrades manually with a tool such as <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/aptitude.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">aptitude</a> (which does no longer ship with Ubuntu by default).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Alpha-quality software.</strong> Things are a little wonky -- it is alpha quality software, after all. I had <code>dpkg</code> exiting with error code 1 without being able to review the error - no packages were broken as a result, however. I tried to shutdown the virtual machine cleanly after the setup, but it hung. On a reboot, however, the system booted fine.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Reboot and boot into your copy of Ubuntu</h2>

<p>You may need to fiddle with your BIOS settings to make this work.</p>

<hr>

<p>A nice (or annoying, based on your use case) thing about Ubuntu on a USB is that next time it'll refresh GRUB, it'll also detect and add to the list the kernels and operative systems on the HDD. This should let you boot straight into your HDD from your USB key's GRUB.</p>

","<p>Two possibilities, first is that being a hardware thing, as micro SDHC have a little notch you can easily notice which matches another notch in the reader and that basically just enables it in read-only mode. That you can't change, just try to use another reader or you could put a piece of silicon or tape on notch, easiest thing is to use another reader.</p>

<p>Second possibility is that being a file permission issue, in which case you can do the following :
In terminal, use these commands:</p>

<pre><code>gksudo nautilus
</code></pre>

<p>This will launch nautilus in root shell and bypass all permissions.
OR:</p>

<pre><code>sudo fdisk -l
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you a list of the drives on your system, figure out which drive it is in the list, easiest way is to look for the <code>blocks</code> as this is the space. It will probably be <code>/dev/sdb</code> or <code>/dev/sdc</code>, then </p>

<pre><code>sudo chown -hR &lt;your username&gt; &lt;the SDHC drive, /dev/sdb for example&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>this will change ownership of the drive to you. OR:</p>

<pre><code>sudo chmod -R 777 &lt;the SDHC drive, /dev/sdb for example&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Though if you just execute the first command <code>sudo nautilus</code> it will save you all this trouble, but you'll have to do it every time you use the SDHC. </p>

<p>If all of this doesn't work, use this command :</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount --options remount,rw &lt;the SDHC drive, /dev/sdb for example, find it using fdisk -l&gt;
</code></pre>

"Install Ubuntu from ISO image directly from hard disk of a system running Linux?","177866","","<p>I don't want to burn a CD, DVD or USB memory stick. And I don't care about saving the existing operating system (Linux Mint). I want to install Ubuntu (actually Kubuntu 12.04 LTS) to the computer directly from the ISO image. The image is for the Kubuntu Live DVD (3.5 GB).</p>

<p>The computer is now booted into Linux Mint. A set of command line steps would be satisfactory. In my mind, I simply need to trick the existing system into thinking I inserted a CD/DVD, right?</p>

<p>I know there is a similar question already but it does not have a good answer. The answer basically says, ""see this link."" I reviewed the link and I decided that StackExchange needs a good answer to this question. Furthermore, most answers at other places on the Internet assume the user is coming to Ubuntu from Windows. So I think this question is one that needs a good answer here. Thanks</p>
","<p>I found this looking around on the net.</p>

<p>Grub2 is capable of directly booting ISO images for many Linux distros if the entries have been properly defined in the Grub2 configuration files.</p>

<p>The ISO image <strong>must be placed on a separate partition</strong> that does not have an operating system installed on it. For the sake of simplicity, we would place it inside a new directory under /boot (assuming it is on a separate partition).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create the new directory and copy your ISO image:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mkdir /boot/iso
sudo cp ~/Desktop/name.iso /boot/iso
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>~/Desktop/name.iso</code> is the location and name of your ISO image assuming that the image is located at your desktop.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the Grub2 entry:</p>

<p>The entry for the ISO image needs to be added to <code>/etc/grub.d/40_custom</code> file. Edit the file by:</p>

<pre><code>gksudo gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom
</code></pre>

<p>And replace the text in that file with this one:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
echo ""Adding 40_custom."" &gt;&amp;2
exec tail -n +4 $0
# This file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries.  Simply type the
# menu entries you want to add after this comment.  Be careful not to change
# the 'exec tail' line above.

menuentry ""Kubuntu ISO"" {
        set isofile=""/boot/iso/kubuntu-12.04.iso""
        loopback loop (hd0,8)$isofile
        linux (loop)/casper/vmlinuz boot=casper iso-scan/filename=$isofile noprompt noeject
        initrd (loop)/casper/initrd.lz
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where is:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Kubuntu ISO</code> = The name you want to display in the Grub menu.</li>
<li><code>boot/iso/kubuntu-12.04.iso</code> = The location and name of your ISO image.</li>
<li><code>(hd0,8)</code> = The partition which contains the ISO image.</li>
<li>note: the <code>tail -n +4</code> means simply ""which line grub starts to read the configuration from as is"". the 4th line in this example is the first comment line, which is fine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Grub reads the partitions in a different way than Ubuntu does. 'hd0' means first HDD which is read as <code>sda</code> by Ubuntu, and <code>8</code> is the partition which is the same as for Ubuntu. So in other words, (hd0,8) means 'sda8'.</p>

<p>To find out your partition, run this command in a Terminal:</p>

<pre><code>sudo fdisk -l
</code></pre>

<p>Suppose your image is contained in the <code>sda1</code> partition, you'd change <code>(hd0,8)</code> in the above line to <code>(hd0,1)</code> and if the image is in the <code>sdb1</code> partition, you'd change <code>(hd0,8)</code> to <code>(hd1,1)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Save and close this file and now run this command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo update-grub
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Reboot and choose the new ISO entry from Grub menu this time. Hopefully, it will boot successfully to the desktop.</p>

<p>Now, if you want to perform an installation from the same ISO, you'd need to unmount the ISO image first as it is mounted from a partition on your HDD (probably you've got a single HDD and want to install Ubuntu to the same HDD) and the installer needs to unmount any mounted partitions before it can make any changes.</p>

<p>So, from the Live CD environment, go to a Terminal and run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo umount -l /isodevice
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>That's all. Now you can double-click the 'Install' icon at the desktop and proceed with the installation.</p>

"How to install Ubuntu on portable external Hard Drive?","177692","","<p>OS: Windows 7. I want install Linux Ubuntu on portable external Hard Drive USB 2.0.
I read a variety of methods, but I'm confused by contradictory advices and methods. Actually, installing Ubuntu on anything other than clean PC looks much more complicated than installing Windows.
I need to have <code>Ubuntu package + Python 2.7 + C compiler</code> installed. My external hard drive is partially filled, I need to keep all files. </p>

<p>Will Ubuntu run entirely on external hardrive, without writing anythinhg to Windows system folders and to registry?</p>

<p>Can anyone post detailed guide how install Ubuntu on external hard drive? </p>
","<p>A very detailed answer would be beyond the scope of a single question, but here's the general outline. It's very easy, but success will partly depend on the ability of your computer to boot from an external hard drive. This depends on the bios.</p>

<p>Before starting, make sure your bios has an option to boot from a USB HD.</p>

<p>If all you need is the basic install, Python 2.7, and the C compiler, you can get away with installing Ubuntu to a fairly small partition. I forget the literal minimum Ubuntu needs to install, but it's roughly 8 GB. I would recommend 10 GB as a minimum, plus another 2-4 GB if you want a swap drive.</p>

<p><strong>Create space for a partition</strong></p>

<p>It's best in your case to create the new partition before doing the install. You will need to shrink the existing partition on your external hard drive first.</p>

<p>I would recommend backing up the USB HD; but if you had a second one, you could just install to that one. Depending on how full the drive is, you may not be able to back it completely; but try at least back up any important files. This is just a general warning and precaution since your data should be safe.</p>

<p>You have two options to shrink the existing partition:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use the Windows partition manager in administrative tools. I believe these are available in Home Premium. If the partition won't shrink by enough, you may need to delete files to make room. If you have more than enough available but it still doesn't shrink enough, use a free defrag tool like MyDefrag to defrag and move the files to the start of the partition.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>gparted</code> from the Ubuntu live install media. This is probably the easier way to do it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Create a new partition</strong></p>

<p>Create the Ubuntu live installation media and use it to boot your computer. Choose Try Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Plug in the external hard drive. Start the program <code>gparted</code>. If you have not already shrunk the partition on the external HD, do it now.</p>

<p>In <strong>most</strong> cases, the internal HD will show up as <code>sda</code> and the external as <code>sdb</code>, but this is not guaranteed. <em>Be sure you are looking at the correct HD in gparted.</em></p>

<p>Shrinking the partition will leave unallocated space. Use this to create a new partition. Format it to <code>ext4</code>. Jot down the partition number. This will be used for <code>/</code>.</p>

<p>You don't need a swap partition, but if want one, shrink the new partition by the size you want (or just make it a little smaller in the first place). Format that space to <code>linux-swap</code>.</p>

<p>Note down the numbers of the new partitions.</p>

<p><strong>Run the Installer</strong></p>

<p>Start the installer from the icon on the desktop or on the launcher. When asked how you want to install, choose: <em>Somethine Else</em>.</p>

<p>This will start the partitioner within the installer. This is different than <code>gparted</code> and may look a little intimidating to a beginner.</p>

<p>Carefully highlight the new partition (check the number and drive carefully) and click <em>Change</em>. </p>

<p>Follow the dialogs to a. Use the partition as <code>ext4</code>, b. mount to <code>/</code>, and c. format. </p>

<p>Highlight the swap partition and click <em>Change</em>. Choose use a <code>linux-swap</code> and that's all for that one.</p>

<p>Very important: change the installation of the bootloader to the USB HD. This will most likely be <code>/dev/sdb</code>. This will prevent you from overwriting the master boot record on your hard drive. (If you do this by accident, it's easily fixed).</p>

<p>Double-check your partition choices, then click <em>Install Now</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p>That's it. To run Ubuntu, boot the computer with the USB plugged in. Set your bios order or otherwise move USB HD to the first boot position. The boot menu on the usb will show you both Ubuntu (on the external drive) and Windows (on the internal drive). Choose the one you want. If you boot without the usb, you will boot into Windows normally.</p>

<p>Ubuntu has Python 2.7 installed by default. To install the C comiler, open the terminal, any run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install gcc
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential
</code></pre>

<p>(if you want some additional programs helpful for C programming).</p>

<hr>

<p>To run Ubuntu in a virtual machine instead, install VirtualBox or VMWarePlayer in Windows. Both are free. Create a new VM and use the installer media to install to the VM. But this time, don't worry about partitions. Choose <em>Install Ubuntu</em> to the entire <em>virtual</em> drive. This doesn't affect the rest of the hard drive.</p>

<p>If you want to put the VM on the external hd, be sure to override the default location when creating the VM and put it on a folder on the external drive.</p>

<p>Creating your installation media with persistence through a Windows program like LiveUSBCreator will also work, but this option will be very slow.</p>

Aaarggh...</li>
</ul>

<h1>Things I have tried</h1>

<h2>I installed the ntp package</h2>

<p>...and tried using the <code>ntpd</code> daemon instead of the <code>ntpdate</code> utility. It won't sync my time either; the daemon starts fine, but my clock remains off. I even tried using the exact <code>/etc/ntp.conf</code> from the accepted answer in the latter post, and restarting the daemon. No go. Anyway, I don't want to use the daemon. I am perfectly aware that <code>ntpdate</code> is considered ""deprecated"", and it is advised to use <code>ntpd -q</code> instead. Also see here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/297560/ntpd-vs-ntpdate-pros-and-cons"">ntpd vs ntpdate: pros and cons</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But since <code>ntpd</code> doesn't work for me either, <em>the problem lies elsewhere</em>. And I find that I would prefer not having to install any extra packages just for synchronizing the clock. <code>ntpdate</code> comes pre-installed with Ubuntu, and <em>it should work just fine</em>. So I uninstalled the <code>ntp</code> package again.</p>

<h2>Maybe port 123 is blocked?</h2>

<p>From this post:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/180876/no-server-suitable-for-synchronization-found-error-when-trying-to-run-ntpdate"">&quot;no server suitable for synchronization found&quot; error when trying to run `ntpdate`</a></li>
</ul>

<p>...I got the idea that port 123 may be blocked from my computer / network at my work place. Indeed,</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo nmap -p123 -sU -P0 localhost
...
PORT    STATE  SERVICE
123/udp closed ntp

<p>But still:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com
4 Mar 13:06:16 ntpdate[4361]: no server suitable for synchronization found
</code></pre>

<p>Even with the <code>-u</code> option, which tells <code>ntpdate</code> to use an unprivileged port for syncing (instead of port <code>123</code>) which is certainly not blocked from my work place:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo ntpdate -u ntp.ubuntu.com
4 Mar 13:06:28 ntpdate[4427]: no server suitable for synchronization found

"How do I boot into recovery mode?","177604","","<p>I recently tried booting into the Grub2's menu entry ""Ubuntu GNU/Linux, with Linux 3.2.0-24-generic-pae (Recovery Mode) just to see what was there.  It booted successfully, but I had no idea what to do after I was there.  My question is where can I find some documentation on the recovery mode and what to do if I truly needed to be there.  I'm running Ubuntu 12.04.</p>
","<p>The recovery mode is normally used when you need an exclusive admin access to your system. You normally go into the root shell and recover/repair the system through the command line.</p>

<ol>
<li>Switch on your computer.</li>
<li>Wait until the BIOS has finished loading, or has almost finished. (During this time you will probably see a logo of your computer manufacturer.)</li>
<li>Quickly press and hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key (or <kbd>Escape</kbd> key on some computers), which will bring up the GNU GRUB menu. (If you see the Ubuntu logo, you've missed the point where you can enter the GRUB menu.) <b>**</b></li>
<li><p>Select the line which starts with ""Advanced options"". <b>*</b></p></li>
<li><p>Select the line ending with <em>""(recovery mode)""</em>, probably the second line, something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ubuntu GNU/Linux, with Linux 3.8.0-26-generic (recovery mode)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Press Return and your machine will begin the boot process.</p></li>
<li><p>After a few moments, your workstation should display a menu with a number of options. One of the options (you may need to scroll down to the bottom of the list) will be ""Drop to root shell prompt"". Press Return with this option highlighted.</p></li>
<li><p>The root partition is mounted read-only. To mount it read/write, enter the command</p>

<pre><code>mount -o remount,rw /
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you have /home, /boot, /tmp, or any other mount point on a separate partition, you can mount them with the command</p>

<pre><code>mount --all
</code></pre>

<p>(This must be done following step 8 so that <code>/etc/mtab</code> is writable.) Alternatively, you could try to select ""Enable networking"" in step 7, though this has been found to cause the system to hang.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>*</b> If you have Ubuntu Quantal (12.10) or earlier, omit step 4 (the recovery mode menu items are displayed on the top-level menu).</p>

<p><b>**</b> If you reboot, there is no need to hold the Shift key in step 3. The GNU GRUB menu will continue to be displayed automatically on each boot until a normal startup of Ubuntu completes.

<p>""After googling around for few days i found this useful script from www.multicd.tuxfamily.org. Multicd.sh is a shell script written by maybeway36 which enables two or more Live Linux distros / utilities to be able to boot from single CD/DVD. It is really very simple to create multi Live Linux distro in a single disc. Create a folder in your home folder and name it as <code>multicd</code>. Put all the live Linux iso images along with multicd.sh script inside multicd folder. Close the window. Open terminal and give the following commands</p>

<pre>
cd multicd
chmod +x multicd*.sh
sudo ./multicd*.sh
</pre>

<p>Above commands will execute multicd.sh. While executing, this script will download few packages from Internet and make a new iso image called multicd.iso for you inside multicd folder. Check the size of multicd.iso image file. If it exceeds more than 700 mb then you must insert DVD to write it. Choose burn image option from your favorite image burning software to write multicd.iso file. Upon reboot, with the CD/DVD present inside CD/DVD drive, new GRUB will display list of live distros available in the disc. Choose your favorite one to login...</p>

<p>Note: When you download any Linux iso image from internet it will look like this ""ubuntu-9.04-desktop-i386"" but this has to be renamed as ubuntu.iso (inside multicd folder). Presently this script supports 20 live distros. List of Live Linux distros supported in this script are given below (and the names accepted by this script are on the right side of each distro).""</p>

"Main difference between Ubuntu and Redhat?","174838","","<p>Except for package management systems and environments, I would like to know what the main differences are between them .</p>

<p>Which provides the best support for their builds?</p>
","<p>There are a few different ways to interpret ""Redhat"" here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Red-hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) - A specific, commercial distribution by Red Hat.</p>

<p>By far the biggest difference between Ubuntu and RHEL is the license terms - Red Hat Enterprise Linux is commercial.</p>

<p>You can, however, get basically the same distribution, but without the commercial contract, for free in the form of the CentOS distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>Distributions which are based on or inherit from Red Hat, which would also include CentOS and Fedora, and their derivatives.</p>

<p>It's actually very hard to compare Ubuntu against all those (RHEL, CentOS and Fedora) as if they are one thing, because they are all very different in themselves.  They do all share the same package manager as I talk about below, but the differences between them are greater than the difference between their package manager and Ubuntu's.</p></li>
<li><p>RPM-based distributions in general - that is, distributions that use the Redhat Package Management system.  This would expand your scope to include distributions like SUSE, Mandriva, PCLinuxOS, and their derivatives.</p>

<p>Ubuntu is based on Debian's package manager APT and DPKG.  Red Hat, CentOS and Fedora are based on the Red Hat Linux package management system, RPM.  Both package managers are now quite mature and have roughly equivalent features.  You could debate individual design decisions though but it's hard to say that one overall is better than the other.</p></li>

<h3>I think over-writing the Windows partition's VBR caused this problem.</h3>

<p>My understanding is that there are several steps to starting an operating system. In your case I think something like the steps below happen.</p>

<ol>
<li>The BIOS on your computer attempts to run the code in the first sector of the hard drive. This first sector is usually referred to as the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record""><em>MBR (Master Boot Record)</em></a>.</li>
<li>In addition to the MBR, every partition can also have a boot record. It is often referred to as the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_boot_record"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_boot_record"">Volume Boot Record or VBR</a>. The MBR on your hard drive transfers control to the VBR of partition 1, your Windows partition.</li>
<li>Windows expects a partition's VBR to take the next step towards booting an operating system such as Windows 7. So Windows would have originally installed a VBR which would transfer control to the Windows <code>bootmgr</code> program in your Windows partition.<br>
<br/>However, when you instructed the Ubuntu install program to install GRUB into the Windows partition, GRUB appears to have replaced the Windows VBR with its own. This GRUB VBR displays the GRUB boot menu.</li>
<li>The instructions GRUB currently uses to boot Windows are essentially to locate the VBR in the Windows partition and transfer control to it. The VBR in the Windows partition is GRUB's VBR. Transferring control to it just (re)displays the GRUB boot menu.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, I am not sure yet what would be the best way to fix this. We want to be careful that we do not break GRUB and make it impossible to boot anything on your computer when we attempt to fix the problem booting Windows.</p>

<p>Below is a copy of some of the information from your Bootinfo Summary for reference. My comments above are based on this information.</p>

<h3>A possible work-around to boot Windows 7</h3>

<p>Below is a suggestion for editing your GRUB boot commands which may allow you to boot Windows 7. I am not sure this will work, but it seems worth trying. </p>

<p>Currently your <code>grub.cfg</code> uses the GRUB boot commands below to boot Windows 7.</p>

<pre><code>menuentry ""Windows 7 (loader) (on /dev/sda1)"" --class windows --class os {
    insmod part_msdos
    insmod ntfs
    set root='(hd0,msdos1)'
    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 1EA0019AA0017A13
    chainloader +1
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am suggesting you try changing this and use these commands instead.</p>

<pre><code>menuentry ""Windows 7 (loader) (on /dev/sda1)"" --class windows --class os {
    insmod part_msdos
    insmod ntfs
    insmod ntldr
    set root='(hd0,msdos1)'
    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 1EA0019AA0017A13
    ntldr ($root)/bootmgr
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the steps to do this. </p>

<ol>
<li>Boot your system to the GRUB menu.</li>
<li>Select (highlight) the GRUB boot menu entry <code>Windows 7 (loader) (on
/dev/sda1)</code>.</li>
<li>Press <kbd>e</kbd> to edit the GRUB boot commands for Windows 7.  </li>
<li>Make two changes to this list of commands as illustrated in the <code>menuentry</code> above.

<ul>
<li>Add the command <code>insmod ntldr</code></li>
<li>Change the command
<br/><code>chainloader +1</code><br>
to 
<br/><code>ntldr ($root)/bootmgr</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Press either <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> or <kbd>F10</kbd> to boot using
these edited commands.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note 1:</strong>  </p>

<p>If the above work-around succeeds in loading the Windows 7 boot menu, then you could make it semi-persistent by </p>

<ol>
<li>Using <code>sudo</code> to edit the file <code>/etc/grub.d/40_custom</code> and add the second, modified <code>menuentry</code> shown above. (If you do this, I'd also suggest you change the title of this ""custom"" entry.)</li>
<li>Run the command <code>sudo update-grub</code> to update <code>/boot/grub/grub.cfg</code> to include your customized entry. (It will be on the bottom of the GRUB menu when you boot.)</li>
</ol>

<p>I would view the suggestion above as only a partly-baked solution. A better solutions is to restore the Windows VBR to the Windows partition <strong>without</strong> also  destroying the ability of GRUB to boot. </p>

<p>I think ... but am not 100% sure ... that the Windows recovery command <code>bootsect</code> can be used to do this. If you want to risk it, one possible way to do this is outlined below.</p>

<ul>
<li>When booting Windows, press <kbd>F8</kbd> to bring up the <code>Advanced Boot Options</code> menu.</li>
<li>Select the <code>Repair Your Computer</code> entry.</li>
<li>Walk through the next windows until you reach <code>System Recovery Options</code>.</li>
<li>Select <code>Command Prompt</code></li>
<li>Run the command <code>bootsect /nt60 C:</code></li>
</ul>

<p>But you might also want to wait a bit and see what other answers you get to your 
question before you take the risk of trying the above.</p>

<p><strong>Note 2:</strong></p>

<p>While searching for other things, I ran across two other questions on AskUbuntu which are related to your problem.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/99584/52923"">Windows 7 won&#39;t boot after installing Ubuntu 11</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/10410/52923"">Windows 7 doesn&#39;t boot after Ubuntu install</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not sure how much help these questions provide. The answer to the second question was to use the command <code>bootrec /fixboot</code> to restore the VBR for the Windows partition. My understanding from that question was that using the <code>bootrec /fixboot</code> command solved the problem.</p>

<p>But the second question insists that <code>bootrec /fixboot</code> did <strong>not</strong> solve the problem.</p>

<p>(Beats the heck out of me as to what might be going on there.)</p>

"Configure screensaver in Ubuntu","172574","","<p>How do I configure the screensaver in Ubuntu? I can see that gnome-screensaver is running.</p>
","<p>Starting with 12.04, Ubuntu doesn't ship with any screensavers, just a black screen that appears when your system is idle. If you’d rather have screensavers, you can swap gnome-screensaver for XScreenSaver.</p>

<p>Screensavers were actually removed back in Ubuntu 11.10. Ubuntu uses gnome-screensaver and inherited the change from upstream GNOME. The GNOME developers think a black screen that puts your monitor into lower-power mode is optimal.</p>

<h2>Installing XScreenSaver</h2>

<p>Open a <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal#Starting_a_Terminal"" rel=""noreferrer"">terminal</a> and run the following command to uninstall gnome-screensaver:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get remove gnome-screensaver
</code></pre>

<p>Install XScreenSaver and some additional screensaver packages with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install xscreensaver xscreensaver-data-extra xscreensaver-gl-extra
</code></pre>

<h2>Configuring your screensaver</h2>

<p>After installation, perform a search in the Dash for Screensaver. Launch the Screensaver utility and use it to configure XScreenSaver and select your screensaver settings.</p>

<p>The Screensaver utility will prompt you to stop the gnome-screensaver process and launch the xscreensaver background process when you start it.</p>

<p>By default, XScreenSaver will choose a random screensaver each time it starts. You can specify the screensavers it chooses from or enable ""Only One Screensaver"" mode to always use your favorite screensaver.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/atdiG.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h2>Adding to Startup</h2>

<p>To actually use the screensavers, you'll want XScreenSaver to start in the background each time you log in. If it doesn’t start, it can’t notice your system is idle and launch screensavers.</p>

<p>Get started by launching the Startup Applications utility from the Dash. Add a startup program with the following command. The name and comment here can be anything you like:</p>

<pre><code>xscreensaver -nosplash
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QNN9s.png"" alt=""xscreenserver""></p>

<h2>Reverting Your Changes</h2>

<p>Reverting these changes is simple. Just run these commands to uninstall XScreenSaver and reinstall gnome-screensaver:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get remove xscreensaver xscreensaver-data-extra xscreensaver-gl-extra
sudo apt-get install gnome-screensaver
</code></pre>

<p>Both systems are updated, I installed the additions on the guest and I evenly split memory and video memory (64MB) between guest and host.

Idling with the system monitor open the (single) guest cpu never gets below 55% and could rise to 80 - 90% just by moving the mouse around. Opening Firefox will cause the system monitor to show cpu usage 100% in the guest, while the host shows that both cpus are evenly working around 60%.</p>

<li>Allocate only the storage you need. Keep large files elsewhere, outside the vStorage.</li>
<li>Never allocate more CPUs or RAM than you should. 1 vCPU is probably enough.</li>
<li>Leave 1GB of RAM for the HostOS. Do not over commit RAM.</li>
<li>Use the VirtIO drivers for Storage and Networking. Modern Linux guests support this. For Windows guests, use the SATA (storage) and Intel PRO/1000 (network) drivers. It is possible to use virtio drivers under Windows, it is just a little harder.</li>
<li>Enable ACPI and AHCI for all guests from 2003, WinXP and later.</li>
<li>Desktop VMs should get all 128MB of display vRAM</li>
<li>Server VMs should stay with 9MB of vRAM; don't waste it.</li>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the command:</p>

"How can I check Internet connectivity in a console?","171355","","<p>Is there an easy way to check Internet connectivity from console? I am trying to play around in a shell script.
One idea I seem is to <code>wget --spider <a href=""http://www.google.co.in/"">http://www.google.co.in/</a></code> and check the HTTP response code to interpret if the Internet connection is working fine. But I think there must be easy way without the need of checking a site that never crash ;)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Seems like there can be a lot of factors which can be individually examined, good thing. My intention at the moment is to check if my blog is down. I have setup cron to check it every minute.
For this, I am checking the HTTP response code of wget --spider to my blog. If its not 200, it notifies me (I believe this will be better than just pinging it, as the site may under be heavy load and may be timing out or respond very late). Now yesterday, there was some problem with my Internet. LAN was connected fine but just I couldn't access any site. So I keep on getting notifications as the script couldn't find 200 in the wget response. Now I want to make sure that it displays me notification when I do have internet connectivity.</p>

<p>So, checking for DNS and LAN connectivity is a bit overkill for me as I don't have that much specific need to figure out what problem it is. So what do you suggest how I do it?</p>

<p>Here is my script to keep checking downtime for my blog:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# Sending the output of the wget in a variable and not what wget fetches
RESULT=`wget --spider http://blog.ashfame.com 2&gt;&amp;1`
FLAG=0

# Traverse the string considering it as an array of words
for x in $RESULT; do
    if [ ""$x"" = '200' ]; then
        FLAG=1 # This means all good
    fi
done

if [ $FLAG -eq '0' ]; then
    # A good point is to check if the internet is working or not
        # Check if we have internet connectivity by some other site
        RESULT=`wget --spider http://www.facebook.com 2&gt;&amp;1`
        for x in $RESULT; do
            if [ ""$x"" = '200' ]; then
                FLAG=1 # This means we do have internet connectivity and the blog is actually down
            fi
        done

    if [ $FLAG -eq '1' ]; then
        DISPLAY=:0 notify-send -t 2000 -i /home/ashfame/Dropbox/Ubuntu/icons/network-idle.png ""Downtime Alert!"" ""http://blog.ashfame.com/ is down.""         
    fi  
fi

exit
</code></pre>

<p>This way I need to check for internet connectivity only where there is an issue with my blog response code. Its a bit heavy (as I am not using ping) but should not give any false positives. Right? Also how can I randomize pinging to a different site everytime, like facebook, google, yahoo etc. Also (I was trying to avoid any I/O) I can write to a log file by which I can check the count of downtime checks and then skip further checks till the site is down or cause longer checks (10mins instead of every min). What do you think?</p>
","<h2>Checking whether specific website is up</h2>

<p>First, there is multiple good online monitoring services. To pick one, Pingdom includes free account for monitoring one target. (Disclaimer: I am <em>not</em> affiliated with Pingdom in any way).</p>

<p>Second, using <code>wget --spider</code> for your own script is good idea. You'll get some false positives when your computer is down, or when your DNS server is not working. Checking return code is straightforward way to do it.</p>

<pre><code>wget --spider http://example.com
if [ ""$?"" != 0 ]; then
  echo ""Website failed!"" | mail -s ""Website down"" your_email@provider.tld
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Yet again, there is holes in this approach. If your provider has cached your DNS record, but DNS server is down, others can't access your site, even though monitoring says everything is fine. You can write short workaround with <code>host</code>, for example <code>host example.com &lt;your dns server IP&gt;</code>. That will return error, if DNS server is not responding, even if OpenDNS or your own provider's DNS server works fine.</p>

<h2>Checking whether internet is working</h2>

<p>There isn't really easy way in general way.</p>

<p>You can for example run <code>ping -c1</code> multiple well known sites (for example www.google.com, facebook.com and ping.funet.fi) and check return codes to determine whether any of these is reachable. You can automatically check return code by using variable <code>$?</code>. Parameter <code>-c1</code> is limiting number of ping packets to one.</p>

<p>You may encounter problems with some public wifi networks when there is login gateway that redirects all ping requests and HTTP requests. If so, you may get ping responses and correct HTTP status codes, even when you can't access any other sites.</p>

<p>If you want to check cable state, you can use</p>

<pre><code>sudo ethtool eth0
</code></pre>

<p>From output (excerpt):</p>

<pre><code>Speed: 1000Mb/s
Duplex: Full
Port: Twisted Pair
Link detected: yes

","<h2>tl;dr</h2>

<p>Yes it's the correct way.<br>
But to be more <em>semantic</em>: Yes, it's the correct way to allow <code>.htaccess</code> to override all directives in the <code>/var/www</code> directory.</p>

<hr>

<p>As you found out, <a href=""http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#AllowOverride""><code>AllowOverride</code></a> is allowed only under the <code>Directory</code> section.</p>

<p>Using your example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Directory ""/var/www""&gt;
    AllowOverride All
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is telling apache, that all configurations can be overridden in the <code>/var/www</code> and all its sub-directories (recursively).</p>

<hr>

<p>For a better example, consider you have the following configuration in your virtual host:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Directory ""/var/www""&gt;
    AllowOverride All
&lt;/Directory&gt;

&lt;Directory ""/var/www/uploads""&gt;
    AllowOverride Limit
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the following directory structure:</p>

<pre><code>var/
    www/
        .htaccess
        uploads/
            .htaccess
            a/

                .htaccess
            d/
                .htaccess
</code></pre>

<p>What I did here, is create an <code>.htaccess</code> in every sub-directory of the <code>/var/www</code> directory.<br>
<sup><em>It usually shouldn't be like so, but this is just for the sake of the example</em></sup></p>

<p>Comparing the directory structure with the configuration, it means that all <code>.htaccess</code> files inside in the <code>/var/www</code> folder and its sub-directories, excluding the <code>/var/www/uploads</code> directory and its sub-directories, can override all kinds of directives.</p>

<p>But <code>/var/www/uploads</code> and its sub-directories can only use the <code>.htaccess</code> file to override the <code>Allow</code>, <code>Deny</code> and <code>Order</code> directives.</p>

<p><sup>Note: As of apache 2.4 (Which is available by default in 13.10+) the <code>Allow</code>, <code>Deny</code> and <code>Order</code> directives were replaced by a single directive named <code>Require</code>.</sup></p>

"What are the meta, super, and hyper keys?","168640","","<p>In System -> Preferences -> Keyboard -> Layout -> Options ->Alt/Win key behavior</p>

<p>What do meta, super, hyper mean?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ovfp3.png"" alt=""Keyboard Layout Options Dialog Box""></p>
","<p>Meta, Super and Hyper are modifier keys that modify the key's function. They are specific to the Symbolics <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5mQf8.png"" alt="""">&nbsp;Space Cadet Keyboard</a></strong> used on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lisp</a> machines <em>back in the day</em>. Their function is <em>sometimes</em> emulated using other keys.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Space-cadet.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Space-cadet.jpg/400px-Space-cadet.jpg"" alt=""Space Cadet Keyboard""></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Meta</strong></p>

<p>The Meta key is not found on modern keyboards. Its use is sometimes emulated with <kbd>AltGr</kbd> (on some international layouts) or the right <kbd>Alt</kbd> key on the others. In addition:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sun keyboards have a meta key (<kbd>◆</kbd>) as well</li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs"" rel=""noreferrer"">Emacs</a> calls <kbd>Esc</kbd> the Meta key</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Super</strong></p>

<p>The Super key is equivalent to <kbd><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/AAjIi.png"" alt=""the Windows logo key""></kbd> or the <kbd>⌘</kbd> (command) key. In Ubuntu, it's just another name for <kbd><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/AAjIi.png"" alt=""the Windows logo key""></kbd>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hyper</strong></p>

<p>Hyper is the fourth (counting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>) and last modifier on the Space cadet keyboard. In Ubuntu, its function is undefined (I <em>think</em>), but it can be mapped, as in the screen shot above, to <kbd><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/AAjIi.png"" alt=""the windows logo key""></kbd>, should it be needed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Compose_key_on_Sun_Type_5c_keyboard.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Compose_key_on_Sun_Type_5c_keyboard.jpg/400px-Compose_key_on_Sun_Type_5c_keyboard.jpg"" alt=""Sun Microsystems Keyboard""></a><br><em>Sun's keyboard had different modifiers.</em></p>

<p>Note that GNOME and X.org implement many modifiers. Meta, Super and Hyper are not Linux's way of dealing with any modifier keys, but merely three of them specific to the Space Cadet keyboard. There is also <strong>Menu</strong>, <strong>Compose</strong>, <strong>AltGr</strong>, <strong>Greek</strong>, <strong>Front</strong>, <strong>X</strong> and others.</p>

<p>However, by convention the Windows logo key is called Super, and it is not implemented as yet another modifier by X.org.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the definition of modifier keys depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The keyboard itself</p></li>
<li><p>The keyboard layout</p></li>
<li><p>The driver</p></li>
<li><p>The operating system's implementation</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It's therefore almost impossible to generalise this information. I've tried to be somewhat specific to Gnome/X.org using a Windows-style keyboard with one of the more popular layouts. To test your keyboard, you can run <code>xev</code> - its terminal output will tell you what modifiers have been detected for your keyboard.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pVUt7.jpg"" alt=""Macintosh keyboard keys""><br><em>The Macintosh keyboard has a completely different set of modifiers</em></p>

<p>Some additional information:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wikipedia claims the Windows key is sometimes called Meta, but I didn't find any other reference for this.</p></li>
<li><p>The <kbd>Alt</kbd> key is sometimes called <strong>Option</strong>, as this is its equivalent on Macintosh keyboards</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Compose</strong> key (not a modifier, but a <em>dead key</em>), also called <strong>Multi</strong>, is often mapped to the <strong>Menu</strong> key or the right Windows key.</p></li>
<li><p>The AltGr key I've mentioned is also called a third-level modifier. Each key on the keyboard has, potentially, four characters on it. The first level is the lowercase, then it goes uppercase, <kbd>Alt</kbd> + something, and <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + something. For example, the four glyphs on my <kbd>A</kbd> key are a, A, æ and Æ.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It's all a mess :-)</p>

<hr>

<p>As they've been addressed in the comments:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <kbd>Fn</kbd> is not <em>really</em> comparable. It's a hardware key that's not directly interfaceable by the operating systems. Pressing <kbd>Fn</kbd> and another key causes an entirely different code to be sent to the operating system. Examples for this include XF86AudioMute, XF86Eject and so on. The Operating system can't detect whether <em>fn</em> is pressed or not.</p></li>
<li><p>The <kbd>SysRq</kbd> key is traditionally a label on the <kbd>Print Screen</kbd> key indicating its function if used with the modifier <kbd>Alt</kbd>. It is sometimes, especially on newer notebooks, mapped to <kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Print</kbd>. In Linux, it provides a few <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Magic</em> shortcuts</a>.</p></li>

"Grant a user permissions on www-data owned /var/www","168220","","<p>I have a simple web server setup for some websites, with a layout something like:</p>

<p>site1: <code>/var/www/site1/public_html/</code></p>

<p>site2: <code>/var/www/site2/public_html/</code></p>

<p>I have previously used the root user to manage files, and then given them back to <code>www-data</code> when I was done (WordPress sites, needed for WP Uploads to work). This probably isn't the best way.</p>

<p>I'm trying to find a way to create another user (lets call it user1) that has permission to edit files in site1, but not site2, and doesn't stop the files being 'owned' by <code>www-data</code>. Is there any way for me to do this?</p>
","<p>If we check ownership of site1, we will find something like this,</p>

<pre><code>ls -ld /var/www/site1/
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 24 21:06 site1/
</code></pre>

<p>This means that the directory is owned by user root, group root. While user root has write permission (plus read and execute permissions) to the directory, group root has only read and execute permissions.  </p>

<p>We will want to change the group ownership to another <em>(new)</em> group and add user1 to that particular group. We will give write permission to that particular group as well.</p>

<p>Create  a new group,</p>

<pre><code>sudo addgroup site1
</code></pre>

<p>Add user1 to the newly created group,</p>

<pre><code>sudo adduser user1 site1
</code></pre>

<p>Check that user1 is really in that group,</p>

<pre><code>groups user1
</code></pre>

<p>The output should be a list something like,</p>

<pre><code>user1 : &lt;other-groups&gt; site1
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can change the group ownership of your intended directory.</p>

<pre><code>sudo chown -vR :site1 /var/www/site1/
changed ownership of `/var/www/site1/' from root:root to :site1
</code></pre>

<p>Grant write permission to this new group owner,</p>

<pre><code>sudo chmod -vR g+w /var/www/site1/
mode of `/var/www/site1/' changed from 0755 (rwxr-xr-x) to 0775 (rwxrwxr-x)
</code></pre>

<p>Check that all the changes are indeed there,</p>

<pre><code>ls -ld /var/www/site1/
drwxrwxr-x 2 root site1 4096 Oct 24 21:06 /var/www/site1/
</code></pre>

<p>So, the directory now is owned by user root, group site1. Both user root and group site1 have write permission (plus read and execute permissions) to the directory. Any user belonging to group site1 will enjoy all the privileges granted to that group.</p>

<p>Now login as user1, move to site1 directory and try to create a file in that directory,</p>

<pre><code>echo ""My User1 Site"" &gt; index.html 
bash: index.html: Permission denied
</code></pre>

<p>This failed since most likely the primary group of user1 is not site1. So, change to that group.</p>

<pre><code>newgrp - site1
</code></pre>

<p>Try to recreate the file (beware that you have been moved to the home directory of user1 after changing group), this should work now.
Since the created files will have world read permission, apache (or your web server) should not face any problem accessing them.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Also, as pointed out by <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/users/158892/dan08"">dan08</a> in  comment, you  need to add www-data to site1 group.</p>

<pre><code>sudo adduser www-data site1
</code></pre>

<p>On many (not all) distributions, www-data is the user under which the Apache web server runs. This also means that everything done by Apache (especially including PHP scripts) will be done with the permissions of user www-data (and also group www-data) by default. WordPress uses the user www-data to write files.</p>

<p>If you want to see how apache web server is running, issue the command,</p>

","<p>Please read the following first: <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/34702/40581"">How do I set up Android ADB?</a></p>

<hr>

<h1>Configuring USB access</h1>

<p>First, you don't need root permissions to run ADB if you have set the permissions accordingly. The AOSP site provides examples for <a href=""http://source.android.com/source/initializing.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Configuring USB Access</a> for Nexus devices. You can use the following scheme for non-Nexus devices:</p>

<pre><code>SUBSYSTEM==""usb"", ATTR{idVendor}==""xxxx"", ATTR{idProduct}==""xxxx"", MODE=""0600"", OWNER=""&lt;username&gt;""
</code></pre>

<p>Vendor and product ID can be obtained by using <code>lsusb</code> and searching for your device. (Note: The device actually is a Galaxy Nexus.)</p>

<pre><code>$ lsusb | grep -i samsung
Bus 002 Device 103: ID 04e8:6860 Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd GT-I9100 Phone [Galaxy S II]
</code></pre>

<p>So my <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules</code> udev rule looks like this:</p>

<pre><code># adb protocol on maguro/toro (Galaxy Nexus)
SUBSYSTEM==""usb"", ATTR{idVendor}==""04e8"", ATTR{idProduct}==""6860"", MODE=""0600"", OWNER=""username""
</code></pre>

<p>You may want to repeat this for the other phone states like fastboot if needed. To let the changes take effect either reload udev (<code>sudo udevadm control --reload</code>) or reboot (recommended).</p>

<h1>Making programs available</h1>

<p>Instead of <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/60218/40581"">modifying the path variable</a> I would suggest adding a symbolic link to the executable either in <code>~/bin/</code> (user only) or in <code>/usr/local/bin/</code> (system wide).</p>

However, I'm having a lot of trouble trying to install the numerous packages that aren't included natively on Ubuntu. Can someone help me install the PNG library, libpng and zlib. This is just one of many things I need to get on here but I think I need to first start off with this. I did download both packages, did the tar xf thingy on the download, and looked at the README files for insight on installing the software. I get weird errors though. I first tried installing libpng and the terminal was like zlib isn't installed so I was like ok, I'll just get zlib but permission is denied. Do I need to get root or something? I remember seeing people say root before, but I don't know if it is relevant. I'm really new so I don't understand a lot of these things and it's kinda scary. Please help. </p>

<p>For libpng, run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libpng-dev

"How to install driver for TP-Link TL-WN722N on Ubuntu 14.04?","166855","","<p>Hi I am new to Ubuntu and Linux. As I am developing a WiFi product, I want to capture the WiFi traffic wirelessly with Wireshark. Having some searching in the web, I know that I can do that with a USB WiFi adapter and Ubuntu. Then I can run the Wireshark in real monitor/promiscuous mode.</p>

<p>Ok so I bought a TP-Link TP-WN722NC (I want to buy the TP-WN722N at first, but the store only has this model). Also I found a laptop and installed the Ubuntu 14.04.1. Then I noticed that I need a driver for this adaptor. So I try to follow the blog post <a href=""http://blog.y3xz.com/blog/2011/10/23/installing-tl-wn722n-on-ubuntu-1110/"">Installing TL-WN722N on Ubuntu 11.10</a> to install the driver <em>ath9k_htc</em> but seems it was not successful.</p>

<p>Then I downloaded the backports 3.16-1 by running these two commands:</p>

<pre><code>wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/stable/v3.16/backports-3.16-1.tar.gz
tar xvf compat-wireless-2.6.38.2-2.tar.bz2
</code></pre>

<p>However, after that point do not know what should I do. Could you help guide me to install the correct driver?</p>
","<p><strong>Part One</strong></p>

<p>Open a terminal and run the following commands:</p>

<p>First, you will need to install a few applications to build and compile from source:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
apt-get install gcc build-essential linux-headers-generic linux-headers-`uname -r`
</code></pre>

<p>Save any unsaved work and reboot. When you sign back in, open a terminal.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part Two</strong></p>

<p>Download the needed file:</p>

<pre><code>wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/stable/v4.4.2/backports-4.4.2-1.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>Now, unzip the tar.gz file:</p>

<pre><code>tar xvfz backports-4.4.2-1.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>Then, <strong>c</strong> hange your <strong>d</strong> irectory to the uncompressed file:</p>

<pre><code>cd backports-4.4.2-1
</code></pre>

<p>Because there is a Makefile, we will be using the <code>make</code> command. First, clean the build area by typing this command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo make clean
</code></pre>

<p>Then, use this command to build and compile:</p>

<pre><code>sudo make
</code></pre>

<p>You should receive an error and some instructions. Following these instructions to specify the driver you want to build and install by running the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo make defconfig-ath9k
</code></pre>

<p>Now, run make again:</p>

<pre><code>sudo make
</code></pre>

<p>This time you should receive no errors. This may take some time to finish. When it is done, install the driver with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>You will see some messages saying something about a key. These errors can safely be ignored and should not impact the overall outcome.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part Three</strong></p>

<p>Now, run these two commands in an open terminal to load the driver modules at boot time.</p>

<pre><code>echo ""ath9k"" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules

echo ""ath9k_htc"" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
</code></pre>

<p>For the next command, I will use <code>gedit</code> as the text editor but you can use nano, leafpad, kate, mousepad or any text editor.</p>

<pre><code>sudo gedit /etc/rc.local
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we need to insert the following two lines before <strong>""exit 0""</strong> so the last four lines of the file should look exactly like this:</p>

<pre><code># Declare TP-WN727N USB ID to ath9k_htc module
echo ""148F 7601"" | tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/ath9k_htc/new_id

exit 0
</code></pre>

<p>Click on save before exiting out of gedit.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part Four</strong></p>

<p>Finally, the script mentions something about updating your initramfs. It might not be needed but these are kernel modules so that's what we will do by running the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo update-initramfs -k all -u
</code></pre>

<p>and don't forget to update grub when you are done:</p>

<pre><code>sudo update-grub
</code></pre>

<p>Save any unsaved work, leave the device plugged in and reboot for these changes to take effect.</p>

","<p>Please read the update at the end of this answer regarding changes in Firefox 52.</p>

<h2>Update for Firefox >=52</h2>

<p>As of Firefox 52 support for NPAPI plugins as been dropped. All plugins living in one of the above directories are ignored, with the exception of Adobe Flash.</p>

"How to remove a user from a group?","165953","","<p>I added a user account to the <code>admin</code> group and discovered I added wrong user. So I now have to remove the account from the <code>admin</code> group. </p>

<p>How can I remove an account from a group without deleting the user?</p>
","<p>Portablejim's answer is accurate but dangerous -- if you typo something, your system may be unusable, <em>especially</em> if you alter the admin group improperly.  If you must edit the groups file, use the <code>vipw -g</code> or <code>vigr</code> commands, which verify the syntax before saving.  Even then, there are better ways.</p>

<p>From a commandline, the one you probably want to use is the following (as root):</p>

<pre><code>deluser &lt;username&gt; &lt;groupname&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This will remove the specified user from the specified group. You must relogin to see the effect. It will not delete the user, or the group, just the membership.  There are also ways of doing it with the <code>usermod</code> command, but it's harder to use as you need to replace the entire list of groups for a user in order to remove a single group.  The <code>gpasswd</code> command is also capable of doing this (as sagarchalise points out), but is mostly deprecated. As always, see the man pages for more details.</p>

"How to kill a script running in terminal, without closing terminal (Ctrl + C doesn't work)?","165541","","<p>I have written a bash script that calls several other programs and executes a bunch of commands. I run this script from the terminal. Now I want to kill the script.</p>

<p>Pressing <code>Ctrl + C</code> sometimes doesn't cut it, I think because sometimes the script is executing another program, and for some reason the kill signal doesn't work.</p>

<p>However, if I close the terminal window, it kills the script.</p>

<p>Is there something I can do (a keyboard combination), that is analogous to closing the terminal window, without actually closing the terminal window (I don't want to lose command history, current directory, output history, etc.)?</p>
","<p>You have few options. One is to stop the script (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Z</kbd>), get the PID of the script and send <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Termination-Signals.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>SIGKILL</code></a> to the process group.</p>

<p>When a command is executed in a shell, the process it starts and all its children are part of the same <a href=""http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/index.php"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>process group</em></a> (in this case, the foreground process group). To send a signal to all processes in this group, you send it to the process leader. For the <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/en/man1/kill.1.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>kill</code></a> command, process leader is denoted thus:</p>

<pre><code>kill -PID
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>PID</code> is the process ID of the script. </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Consider a script <code>test.sh</code> which launches some processes. Say you ran it in a shell:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./test.sh
</code></pre>

<p>In another terminal,</p>

<pre><code>$ pgrep test.sh
17802
$ pstree -ps `!!`
pstree -ps `pgrep test.sh`
init(1)───sshd(1211)───sshd(17312)───sshd(17372)───zsh(17788)───test.sh(17802)─┬─dd(17804)
                                                                               ├─sleep(17805)
                                                                               └─yes(17803)
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, to send a signal to process group created by <code>test.sh</code>, you'd do:</p>

<pre><code>kill -INT -17802
</code></pre>

<p><code>-INT</code> is used to send <code>SIGINT</code>, and so this command is the equivalent of pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>C</kbd> on the terminal. To send <code>SIGKILL</code>:</p>

<pre><code>kill -KILL -17802
</code></pre>

<p>You only need to stop the script if you can't open another terminal. If you can, use <code>pgrep</code> to find the PID.</p>

<p>One of the commands that the script launches may be trapping <code>SIGINT</code>, which is probably why <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>C</kbd> is ineffective. However, <code>SIGKILL</code> can't be trapped, and it is usually a <em>last-resort</em> option. You might want to try <code>SIGTERM</code> (<code>-TERM</code>) before going for the kill. Neither <code>SIGKILL</code> or <code>SIGTERM</code> can be set up as a <a href=""https://superuser.com/a/417991/334516"">keyboard shortcut</a> the way <code>SIGINT</code> is.</p>

<p>All this is moot if your script doesn't contain a shebang line. From <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/12296783/2072269"">this SO answer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Usually the parent shell guesses that the script is written for the the same shell (minimal Bourne-like shells run the script with /bin/sh, bash runs it as a bash subprocess) ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of this, when the script is executed, you won't find a process named after script (or a process with the script's name in the command line) and <code>pgrep</code> will fail.</p>

<p>Always use a shebang line.</p>

"How to exclude multiple directories with rsync?","165419","","<p>I am trying to backup my home directory using rsync, and I want to exclude some of the directories that contain junk.

"How to create a local APT repository?","164914","","<p>I would like to build my own local repository on my LAN, so that machines on the LAN can update and upgrade from it. I want to download the packages and store them on my local server so that I can update, upgrade, install, etc, from it without using the internet.</p>
","<p>*<strong><em>To make an offline Repository Over LAN *</em></strong> <br><br>
<strong><em>Install a Local Apache Webserver</em></strong></p>

<pre><code># apt-get install apache2
</code></pre>

<p>By default, Debian's Apache package will set up a website under <code>/var/www</code> on your system. For our purposes, that's fine, so there's no reason to do anything more. You can easily test it by pointing your favorite browser at <code>http://localhost</code> You should see the default post-installation web page which is actually stored in <code>/var/www/index.html</code>
<br><br><br>
<strong><em>Create a Debian Package Repository Directory</em></strong>
<br><br>
chose to create a directory <code>/var/www/debs</code> for this. Under it, you should create ""architecture"" directories, one for each architecture you need to support. If you're using just one computer (or type of computer), then you'll only need one -- typically ""i386"" for 32-bit systems or ""amd64"" for 64 bit. If you are using some other architecture, I'll assume you probably already know about this.
Now just copy the "".deb"" package files for a given architecture into the appropriate directories. If you now point your favorite web browser at <code>http://localhost/debs/amd64</code> (for example) you'll see a listing of the packages for 64 bit systems.
<br><br><br>
<strong>Create a Packages.gz file</strong>
<br><br>
Now we need to create a catalog file for APT to use. This is done with a utility called ""dpkg-scanpackages"". Here's the commands I use to update the AMD64 packages on my LAN:</p>

<pre><code># cd /var/www/debs/

# dpkg-scanpackages amd64 | gzip -9c &gt; amd64/Packages.gz
</code></pre>

<p><br><br><br>
<strong>Make the repository known to APT</strong>
<br><br>
Now the only thing left to do is to let APT know about your repository. You do this by updating your /etc/apt/sources.list file. You'll need an entry like this one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>deb http://localhost/debs/ amd64/</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used the actual hostname of my system instead of localhost -- this way the code is the same for all of the computers on my LAN, but localhost will do just fine if you are running just one computer.<br>
Now, update APT:</p>

<pre><code># apt-get update
</code></pre>

"What is the equivalent for switching drives in terminal on Linux?","164875","","<p>In DOS, I switch between different drives by typing <code>c:</code>, <code>d:</code>, <code>e:</code> and so forth. But it doesn't work that way in Linux.</p>

<p>Could anyone please tell me how to switch between different drives?</p>
","<p>Linux doesn't really have a way to work with ""drives"", per se, except with system utilities that access partitions; they often need to specify the drive that contains the partition.  But if your drives each only have one partition, it doesn't really matter.</p>

<p>Anyway, to access a drive, you actually need to specify the partition in some way, usually by a definition like /dev/sda1 (1st partition on 1st drive) or /dev/sda2 (2nd partition on first drive).  Using the Disk Utility or gparted, you can see all the partitions graphically.  If you're only using the terminal, I've found that the command ""blkid"" is handy to list the drives with their UUIDs.  I use the form:</p>

<pre><code>sudo blkid -c /dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>Using the terminal, you need to mount a partition to actually use it.  This is actually pretty easy to do.  In most cases, you would want to use an empty directory as the ""mount point""; if the directory is not empty, its contents will be masked and unavailable during the mount.  This may be useful in certain circumstances, such as testing or temporarily changing a configuration for some other reason, as it will alleviate the need to rename or delete the current contents.</p>

<p>If you have a directory named /mnt/drive2 (/mnt is commonly used, but it can be in your home directory if you want), and your drive is /dev/sdb, with a single partition, then the simplest command is:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount -t type /dev/sdb1 /mnt/drive2
</code></pre>

<p>where ""type"" is the type shown in the blkid command, such as ntfs, ext4, etc.</p>

<p>EDIT:  to experiment, don't be afraid to try the mount command.  It is only temporary until you reboot (or unmount using the ""umount"" command).  To make it permanent, you need to enter it into <code>/etc/fstab</code>.  If you want to do that, you can experiment by creating an entry, then using the command ""mount -a"" to mount everything in <code>/etc/fstab</code>.  If there are errors, it will tell you, and you can correct and repeat until it works.</p>

"What does apt-get --fix-missing do and when is it useful?","162969","","<p>From the man page:</p>

<pre><code>-m, --ignore-missing, --fix-missing
  Ignore missing packages; if packages cannot be retrieved or fail the integrity 
  check after retrieval (corrupted package files), hold back those packages and 
  handle the result. 

  Use of this option together with -f may produce an error in some situations. If a 
  package is selected for installation (particularly if it is mentioned on the 
  command line) and it could not be downloaded then it will be silently held back. 

 Configuration Item: APT::Get::Fix-Missing.
</code></pre>

<p>This is confusing:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can 'ignore missing' and 'fix missing' be synonyms for the same option?</li>
<li>What does 'hold back' mean in this context?</li>
<li>What does 'handle the result' mean?</li>
</ol>

<p>And in what situation is it useful anyway? When you try to install a package not in the apt index, you get this message:</p>

<pre><code>E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?
</code></pre>

<p>Are the two suggestions (<code>apt-get update</code>, <code>apt-get install --fix-missing...</code>) at all equivalent?</p>
","<p>Ok with order:</p>

<ul>
<li>(1) <strong>-m</strong> ignore <em>missing</em> or fix <em>missing</em> packages in opposition to <strong>-f</strong> <em>broken</em> packages. These options are <strong>synonyms</strong> for the same option. (Since to fix it ignores from here it takes its own <em>weirdness</em>  :-) )</li>
<li>(2-3) When you install/upgrade with <code>apt-get upgrade</code> or with <code>apt-get install somepackage</code> usually it tries to update dependencies. This means that maybe it finds that some packages need new or updated versions of existing packages, and so on in a cascade of dependencies. If some packages miss or fail the integrity check, it seems it <strong>suspends</strong> this package and wants you to go to <strong>handle</strong> the result following the <em>handle method</em> of the requiring package, if possible. Often it stops the installation of the package.</li>
<li>(4)  With <code>apt-get update</code> you download what is needed to rebuilt an updated list of dependencies.<br>
After that you can try to run again <code>apt-get install --fix-missing</code> in the hope that the rebuilt list fixes the problem by itself.<br>
This can be very useful at times like when you add a source for packages in your <code>/etc/atp/sources.list</code>
or when the package index files are updated meanwhile.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all the programs you can use under Ubuntu came from the official Ubuntu repositories and are updated with the same versions -- this is rare.</p>

<p>Moreover there are many reasons why an installation can be abruptly interrupted (A kill signal, a power shortage, a failure of graphic driver...)  In all those cases can be impossible to execute normally an <code>apt-get update</code> and it is needed in advance to fix the problem with <code>apt-get install --fix-missing</code> or with some <code>dpkg</code>  commands.  </p>

<p>You can see <code>apt-get install --fix-missing</code> as a light and friendly version of command like <code>dpkg-reconfigure --all</code> or <code>dpkg</code>. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Added rule for device in <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules</code>. The rule is the following and works for <code>adb</code>:</p>

<li><p>Restarted <code>udev</code> (and computer just to make sure).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Adb works, and all methods for reading from the device via MTP seems to work (I have tried mounting with mtpfs, gmtp and using the mtp-tools package directly). When I try to write to the device however, nothing I have tried works.</p>

<p>As an example, running <code>mtp-newfolder test_dir 0 0</code> gives the following output:</p>

<pre><code>libmtp version: 1.1.0
Device 0 (VID=04e8 and PID=6860) is a Samsung GT-P7510/Galaxy Tab 10.1.
Folder creation failed.

</code></pre>

<p>If I run <code>mtp-folders</code> after a failed mtp-newfolder without re-plugging the device, I get the following output:</p>

<pre><code>The headers for the current running kernel were not found. If the module compilation fails then this could be the reason.

Building the main Guest Additions module ...done.
Building the shared folder support module ...fail!

","<p>To get a VirtualBox ubuntu server guest to correctly accept a guest-additions install you will need to have a minimal xorg package install:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg xserver-xorg-core
</code></pre>

<p>By doing this, you will have the shared-folder support.</p>

<p>As you have found, the guest additions is one very large script - ""VBoxLinuxAdditions.run""</p>

<p>You may be able to unpick this file - I wouldnt recommend it, because as newer versions of virtualbox is released, the version of guest-additions is usually bumped as well.</p>

<p>In addition, I would recommend (if you haven't already), install <code>dkms</code>.  When newer ubuntu kernels are updated, the guest-additions kernel modules will be automatically compiled.  Without <code>dkms</code> you will lose your shared-folder support when a kernel update is made.</p>

"How do you test the network speed between two boxes?","161573","","<p>I have a gigabit network set up in my house and a few Ubuntu based boxes. Out of complete curiosity I would like to check the speed between the two boxes. I am not having any problems with speed or anything, it really is just the geek in me that is curious. Plus maybe the results will let me know if there is room for improvement, or that I have something configured wrongly.</p>

<p><strong>So how do you properly test the network speed between Ubuntu boxes?</strong></p>
","<p>I use <code>iperf</code>. It's a client server arrangement in that you run it in server mode at one end and connect to its from another computer on the other side of the network.</p>

<p>One both machines run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install iperf
</code></pre>

<p>We'll start an <code>iperf</code> server on one of the machines:</p>

<pre><code>iperf -s
</code></pre>

<p>And then on the other computer, tell <code>iperf</code> to connect as a client:</p>

<pre><code>iperf -c &lt;address of other computer&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>On the client machine, you'll see something like this:</p>

<pre><code>oli@bert:~$ iperf -c tim
------------------------------------------------------------
Client connecting to tim, TCP port 5001
TCP window size: 16.0 KByte (default)
------------------------------------------------------------
[  3] local 192.168.0.4 port 37248 connected with 192.168.0.5 port 5001
[ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth
[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec  1.04 GBytes    893 Mbits/sec
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, if you're running a firewall on the server machine, you'll need to allow connections on port 5001 or change the port with the <code>-p</code> flag.</p>

<hr>

<p>You can do pretty much the same thing with plain old <code>nc</code> (netcat) if you're that way inclined. On the server machine:</p>

<pre><code>nc -vvlnp 12345 &gt;/dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>And the client can pipe a gigabyte of zeros through <code>dd</code> over the <code>nc</code> tunnel.</p>

<pre><code>dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1K | nc -vvn 10.10.0.2 12345
</code></pre>

<p>As demod:</p>

<pre><code>$ dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1K | nc -vvn 10.10.0.2 12345
Connection to 10.10.0.2 12345 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
1024+0 records in
1024+0 records out
1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB) copied, 9.11995 s, 118 MB/s
</code></pre>

<p>The timing there is given by <code>dd</code> but it should be accurate enough as it can only output as fast the pipe will take it. If you're unhappy with that you could wrap the whole thing up in a <code>time</code> call.</p>

<p>Remember that the result is in mega<em>bytes</em> so multiply it by 8 to get a mega<em>bits</em>-per-second speed. The demo above is running at 944mbps.</p>

I'm on a corprate network with an HTTP proxy at x.y.z.251:9090.  I've configured the guest OS with the autoconfiguration script, so Firefox works fine, but I can't get ""apt-get"" or ""Ubuntu Software Center"" to connect using the proxy.</p>

<p>I'm not at all certain what I'm doing wrong.</p>

<p>--- Update ----
I have also tried:</p>

<pre><code>Acquire::http:proxy ""http://user:pass@x.y.z.251:9090/""
</code></pre>

<p>""x.y.z"" are, of course, place-holders; I doubt my employer's security people would look kindly on me posting the actual numbers.  I see no difference in the packet trace -- ""apt-get"" is still using the real IP addresses and port 80.  I made a deliberate mistake in the apt.conf file and ""apt-get"" exited with an error, so I'm certain that it sees this configuration line for the proxy, it just doesn't seem to honor it.</p>

<p>I am using the ""NAT"" networking connection, as it is against the IT policy here to bridge between networks, and the DHCP server only provides addresses to known MAC addresses.  I don't want IT security banging on my cube (again).</p>
","<p>Based on my past experience, overall Ubuntu (GNOME) doesn't work very well with PAC (Automatic Config). Pac (Proxy Auto-config) is basically JavaScript logic to determine the closest or most appropriate proxy for you, I <strong>strongly recommend</strong> using the proxy servers directly (in your case Network - Network Proxy).</p>

<p>A few things to check</p>

<h3>Check your /etc/apt/apt.conf</h3>

<p>Network -Network Proxy GUI will update <code>/etc/apt/apt.conf</code> and set the proxy info there.</p>

<h3>Find out the proxy server info from pac</h3>

<p>You can find the details by reading the <code>proxy.pac</code> file anyway.</p>

<p>So the <code>/etc/apt/apt.conf</code> should look like below (suppose the proxy server is => proxy.company.com port 80), do NOT use pac URL.</p>

<pre><code>Acquire::http::proxy ""http://proxy.company.com:80/"";
Acquire::https::proxy ""https://proxy.company.com:80/"";
Acquire::ftp::proxy ""ftp://proxy.company.com:80/"";
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: If no proxy is specified in the apt config files, <code>apt-get</code> will fall back to <code>http_proxy</code> environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From apt.conf man page, respond to the comment from @Braiam</p>

<pre><code>   http
       HTTP URIs; http::Proxy is the default http proxy to use. It is in
       the standard form of http://[[user][:pass]@]host[:port]/. Per host
       proxies can also be specified by using the form http::Proxy::&lt;host&gt;
       with the special keyword DIRECT meaning to use no proxies. If no
       one of the above settings is specified, http_proxy environment
       variable will be used.
</code></pre>

<h3>Check proxy environment variables</h3>

<p>You can check proxy settings by running the following in terminal</p>

<pre><code>echo $http_proxy
echo $https_proxy
echo $ftp_proxy
</code></pre>

<p>If you set env variables correctly, you should be should be able to update in CLI.</p>

<h3>Prefer IPv4</h3>

<p>I noticed <code>apt-get</code> was trying to connect to the update servers using their ipv6 address. This could cause problems (sometimes the IPV6 addresses expire or change).</p>

<p>You can edit <code>/etc/gai.conf</code> and add <code>precedence ::ffff:0:0/96  100</code> to prefer ipv4 over ipv6.</p>

  <p>Note: this answer is meant to be more of an 'explanation' than providing the best/easiest way to remove old kernels. For the best/easiest way to remove old kernels, please review the other answers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, so from the output of <strong><code>/etc/fstab</code></strong> you posted, it seems that your <strong><code>/boot</code></strong> is mounted on a separate partition, and from the output of <strong><code>df -h</code></strong>, that partition is full. This is because there are old kernels installed that are not needed; you can tell that by looking at the output of <strong><code>dpkg -l | grep linux-image</code></strong> that you posted, where you can see more than one ""<strong>linux-image</strong>"" with different versions. We need to remove the old versions.</p>

<p>First, I want you to run the command <strong><code>uname -r</code></strong> in a terminal, this will show you the kernel version you are currently using. We never want to remove that kernel version. The command will say something like this <code>3.5.0-<b>26</b>-generic</code>. Take a note of that number, <code>26</code>! The following commands will assume that that's the kernel you're running.</p>

<p>The command to remove an old kernel version is:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get purge linux-image-x.x.x-xx-generic
</code></pre>

<p>...where the x characters are numbers. So, in your case, because you have a lot of old versions (17, 18, 19, etc...), we would have to run this command for each of the versions, like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>sudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.5.0-17-generic</code></li>
<li><code>sudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.5.0-18-generic</code></li>
<li><code>sudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.5.0-19-generic</code></li>
</ul>

<p>...and so on. But, there's a way to do all of this through one command. The command is this (<strong>DO NOT RUN THE COMMAND YET! Read the following.</strong> ):</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.5.0-{17,18,19,21,22,23,24}-generic
</code></pre>

<p>This command will remove the versions mentioned in the brackets. I didn't include versions 25, 26 and 28 because of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Didn't include 26 obviously because that is the kernel version you are currently running! That's the version we got from the command <code>uname -r</code>, remember? We never want to remove that!</li>
<li>Didn't include 28 because that's the one that your upgrade was trying to upgrade to (you can tell that from the <code>iF</code> status next it, meaning that it's ""half configured"").</li>
<li>Didn't include 25 because it is usually good practice to leave at least one old version. So since you're running 26, we'll keep 25, so we won't include it in the command above.</li>
</ul>

<p>So if the last number in <code>uname -r</code> is 26 (or 28, or even 25), then it's safe to run the above command. Enter your password when prompted, and type <code>y</code> when asked. This will show a bunch of lines, and will eventually go back to the command prompt (in your case, <code>matty@matty-G41M-ES2L:~$</code>), hopefully without errors. When it's done, do <strong><code>df -h</code></strong> and look at the last line, the one that starts with <strong><code>/dev/sda1</code></strong>. You should find that it now has more space, and that the percentage used is less than 100% like it was before. You can now proceed with your update again.</p>

"Which to use NFS or Samba?","160350","","<p>I am setting up a box to be a file server at the house. It will mainly be used to share music, pictures, movies with other linux boxes on the network, and one OS X machine. From what I have read NFS and samba would work in my situation, and as such I am not sure which to choose. What is important to me is the speed transfers between boxes and how difficult it is to setup.</p>

<p>Which would you recommend and why?</p>
","<p>In a closed network (where you know every device), NFS is a fine choice.  With a good network, throughput it disgustingly fast and at the same time less CPU intensive on the server. It's very simple to set up and you can toggle <code>readonly</code> on shares you don't need to be writeable.</p>

<p>I disagree with Anders. v4 can be just as simple as v3. It only gets complicated if you want to start layering on security through LDAP/gssd. It's capable of very complex and complete security mechanisms... But you don't need them. They're actually turned off by default.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
</code></pre>

<p>Then edit <code>/etc/exports</code> to configure your shares. Here's a line from my live version that shares my music:</p>

<pre><code>/media/ned/music        192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
</code></pre>

<p>This shares that path with anybody on 192.168.0.* in a <code>readonly</code> (notice the <code>ro</code>) way.</p>

<p>When you've finished editing, restart NFS:</p>

<pre><code>sudo /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server restart
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>To connect a client, you need the NFS gubbins (not installed by default):</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install nfs-common
</code></pre>

<p>And then add a line to <code>/etc/fstab</code></p>

<pre><code>192.168.0.4:/media/ned/music  /media/music  nfs ro,hard,intr 0 0
</code></pre>

<p>This is actually the NVSv3 client still because I'm lazy but it's compatible in this scenario. <code>192.168.0.4</code> is the NFS server (my desktop in this case). And you'll need to make sure the mount path (<code>/media/music</code> here) exists.</p>

<hr>

<p>For a Mac, follow this: <a href=""http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/apple-in-the-enterprise/mounting-nfs-volumes-in-os-x/"">http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/apple-in-the-enterprise/mounting-nfs-volumes-in-os-x/</a></p>

<p>It's much more simple than some older tutorials would have you believe.</p>

<hr>

<p>It might look more complicated than it really is but it's solid, predictable and fast. Something you can't level against Samba... At least, in my experience.</p>

"How to run a cron job using the sudo command","160256","","<p>Is it possible to run a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron"">cron</a> job which needs the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo"">sudo</a> command?</p>

<p>Like:</p>

<pre><code> sudo rm somefile
</code></pre>
","<p>I won't get into how much this is a bad idea; simply put, running <code>sudo</code>in crontab requires your password to be stored somewhere in plaintext. </p>

<p><strong>It's a bad idea.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>The following is the preferred method of running administrative tasks through cron. <strong>Since you don't really need to write <code>sudo</code> in the crontab, if you are modifying root's crontab.</strong></p>

<h3>Use root's crontab</h3>

<p>Run the following command: </p>

<pre><code>sudo crontab -e
</code></pre>

<p>This opens up <code>root</code>'s crontab. <code>sudo</code> is not necessary to run your command in this context, since it'll be invoked as <code>root</code> anyway.</p>

<p>Therefore, you would simply append the following to root's crontab.</p>

<pre><code>@hourly rm somefile
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Now, if you <em>absolutely</em> want to be unsafe and take risks with your password, the following will run your command from your own crontab, and enter your password automatically when prompted by <code>sudo</code>.</p>

<p>Again, <strong>this is not recommended</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p></p>

<p>In your own crontab, write your command like so:</p>

<pre><code>@hourly echo ""password"" | sudo -S rm somefile
</code></pre>

<p>The obvious disadvantage here is that, should anyone ever access your crontab, your password will be readable in plaintext.</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>BIOS = Basic Input/Output System</p>

<p>(U)EFI = (Unified) Extensible Firmware Interface</p>

<p>MBR = Master Boot Record</p>

<p>GPT = GUID Partition Table</p>

<p>UEFI / EFI / BIOS = Firmware interface</p>

<p>MBR / GPT = How the computer knows (per hard disk) what partitions are on the
drive and how to boot from them.</p>

<h3>UEFI / BIOS</h3>

<p>A <strong>firmware interface</strong> is the way that the firmware (the software inside 
devices) and operating system interact. It initialises the hardware then runs
the operating system and ensures that the operating system drivers can operate
 the hardware.</p>

<p>The BIOS has been the usual firmware interface that has been used. The UEFI is
a newer interface that has several features, such as being faster, having a GUI
and being able to start the network card and get an ip address. UEFI replaces
EFI. (Those developing EFI saw that there were others doing something similar
and so joined them, bringing the ideas of EFI with them. This then became UEFI).</p>

<p>A BIOS requires the bootloader to be at the start of the disk, however a UEFI
uses a partition for this and can choose among multiple boot loaders to use.</p>

<h3>MBR / GPT + GRUB</h3>

<p>The <strong>MBR</strong> is a section of code at the start of the disk that contains a boot
loader (for the BIOS), as well as the partition map and a unique disk identifier. </p>

<p>To install GRUB onto a disk with a MBR, GRUB places a small program in the MBR to
load the rest of GRUB from another part of the disk. (This is done because the
MBR is too small to contain all of GRUB). The space that is chosen is space
between the MBR and the first partition, which usually exists.</p>

<p>GPT is a standard for how the partitons are specified. It does have a 'protective'
MBR, however this is only for allowing BIOS based computers to boot and stop
tools that only know about MBR from trying to trash GPT. It can have </p>

<p>(How GPT is handled depends on whether it is booting using a BIOS (or UEFI system
in BIOS emulation mode) or UEFI. I will focus on UEFI as it relates to the question).</p>

<p>Boot loaders for operating systems are stored in a partion called EFI System
Partiton, that is formatted (usually) with FAT32. This is where GRUB is installed.</p>

<h2>Converting</h2>

<p>First...</p>

<p><strong>We are playing around with the partition table, so guaranteed safety is not
possible. It is a risky operation.</strong> However, the method should not lose data.</p>

<p>Others coming across this: <strong>Do not use on Apple Macs.</strong></p>

<p>Now...</p>

<p>You will need to do this on a live CD (or another linux installation installed
to a different disk.)</p>

<p>When dealing with GPT disks, we need to use a GPT aware program. 'GPT fdisk' is
a good tool to use and what I will be using. It can be called <code>gptfdisk</code> or
<code>gdisk</code> depending on distribution (Ubuntu calles it <code>gdisk</code>). Parted (and Gparted)
is also GPT aware, so can 'safely' be used with GPT disks.</p>

<p>To convert you need to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Resize partitions to fit GPT data and EFI system partition.</li>
<li>Convert the disk and add partitions</li>
<li>Install GRUB to EFI system partition.</li>
</ol>

<h3>1) Resize partition</h3>

<p>Use <code>parted</code> (command line) or <code>gparted</code> (GUI) to resize the first and last
partition. The first partion should have about 200MiB before it, and the last
partition should have 1MiB to 2MiB (either will do) taken off the end.</p>

<h3>2) Convert the disk</h3>

<p>Run</p>

<pre><code>gdisk /dev/sdx
</code></pre>

<p>changing the device you want to convert is <code>/dev/sdx</code>.</p>

<p>It should tell you that it will convert the partiton table.</p>

<pre><code>GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 0.6.14

<h3>3) Install GRUB</h3>

<p><strong>This comes with less assurances that the previous part as I have not tried it myself.</strong></p>

<p>I am not sure about this step, so I'll guess using <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/84513/33286"">RAOF's instructions</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To switch to grub-efi you'd want to</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Find your EFI partition; mount it in /boot/efi. Add this to /etc/fstab¹</li>
  <li>Install the grub-efi package</li>
  <li>Switch your BIOS boot priority from UEFI and Legacy to UEFI only (or a similar option)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>You should work out which version of grub-efi to install with</p>

<pre><code>ioreg -l -p IODeviceTree | grep firmware-abi
</code></pre>

<p>If it says <code>EFI32</code> install the <code>grub-efi-ia32</code> package, if it says <code>EFI64</code> 
install the <code>grub-efi-amd64</code> package. You can install the packages with</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install &lt;package name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This will probably only work if you have booted in EFI mode.</p>

<p>If it does not work, you could try <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFIBooting#Install_GRUB2_in_.28U.29EFI_systems"" rel=""noreferrer"">these</a> step by step instructions
(under ""Install GRUB2 in (U)EFI systems"") once <code>grub-efi</code> is installed.</p>

<h2>Configuring (+ Dual Boot)</h2>

<p>If RAOK's instructions work, you should be able to add the following line to
<code>/etc/grub.d/40_custom</code></p>

<pre><code>menuentry ""Windows 7"" {
        set root='(hd0,gpt1)'
        chainloader /EFI/microsoft/bootmgfw.efi
}
</code></pre>

<p>It assumes that Windows is recognised as <code>hd0</code> by GRUB. It may need to be changed
to <code>hd1</code> in order to work.</p>

<p>Now run</p>

<pre><code>update-grub
</code></pre>

<p>to update the config file.</p>

"Install on Second Hard Drive with startup boot option?","159914","","<p>In theory, what I want to do is very simple, but I've done some google research and read some posts on this site and I'm still confused. </p>

<p>I want to keep win7 on my primary C:\ drive, and install Ubuntu (12.10) on a secondary drive (that I have yet to buy or install. I just want to be certain that I'm successful when I do this). If at all possible I'd also like it if when I start the computer I have the option to boot either Win7 or Ubuntu, like an account log in type thing where I just pick which drive I'm running with that day. And just to reiterate, I do <strong><em>not</em></strong> want to partition my C:\ drive or alter, change, or affect my Win7 system in any way.</p>

<p>The reason I'm still fairly uncertain about all of this, is that a lot of the guides I've read have been for earlier versions of Ubuntu. Also the vast majority of guides are about partitioning one drive to fit both OS'. I want two separate OS running from two separate drives that I can pick at boot. The guides I did find mentioned that there is some issue with the grub being installed on C:\ but the rest of the OS being installed on the other drive. Is this still the case? How do I avoid that?</p>

<p>Also, if it helps, I've been running 12.04lts on my laptop for a few months now in and out of class and I love it.</p>

<p>Finally, if you could please point me to a guide or write your answer in the form of a guide for a two year old that'd be awesome. I'm still an Ubuntu novice and I don't want to mess up my win7.</p>
","<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>

<p>Each partitioned disk contain one small block called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record"" rel=""noreferrer"">MBR</a>. It resides at the beginning of the disk. </p>

<p>Now, the OS inserts their code to MBR to load their own bootloader.
Windows does same, Linux does same. </p>

<p>They insert a small code pointing to actual location of bootloader. Like in Linux, This MBR contains <code>Stage1</code> of <code>GRUB</code> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_GRUB"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>GRUB</code></a> is a bootloader used in Linux) which loads a larger executable <code>Stage2</code> that may located in other partition. </p>

<p>If you install Windows, and then Linux, GRUB <code>Stage1</code> sits in MBR. Now other part of GRUB (the actual bootloader) contains the Windows bootloader location. Now when you select Windows from GRUB menu, Windows starts to load. This is called <code>chain loading</code> (GRUB loads first, then GRUB loads the Windows bootloader based on selection).</p>

<p><strong>Coming back to your question</strong></p>

<p>In your case, you have two MBR (because you have 2 hard disks).</p>

<p>Therefore, you have two options:</p>

<p><strong>Easiest Option</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Create a partition on 2nd disk. </li>
<li><p>Install Ubuntu on that partition &amp; install GRUB on 2nd disk's MBR not on first disk's MBR. Be careful here. See below image (just for demo purpose), you need to do everything in <strong>(probably) <code>sdb</code></strong>. </p></li>
<li><p>You select your <strong>already created <code>sdb</code> partition</strong>, edit, assign mount point <code>/</code>, and file system type <code>ext4</code></p></li>
<li><p>Select boot loader location as <code>sdb</code> , not <code>sda</code> (see red colored section)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/we9t2.png"" alt=""bootloaderLocation""> </p>

<ul>
<li>Once done, reboot and you will be booted to Windows 7. </li>
</ul>

<p>It happens because, your <strong>boot disk priority says to boot from first hard disk</strong> (Where we didn't change anything).</p>

<p>So open BIOS, <strong>change boot disk priority so that the disk containing Ubuntu comes first.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>This time, GRUB will be loaded. And you can boot either OS.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the disk, Windows 7 will boot directly. </p></li>
<li><p>Again plugin the 2nd disk, verify boot order from BIOS so that 2nd disk comes first. You can now boot any OS again.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Another Option</strong></p>

<p>You can modify Windows bootloader also to load Ubuntu from 2nd disk. It is a bit harder, and since you don't want to touch Windows 7 at all, I am not recommending it.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> All tutorials available here talks about adding Ubuntu from same disk but different partition. I have not done it for across devices, you may need to adopt accordingly. </p>

<p>Here is a <a href=""http://nerdy-notes.blogspot.in/2010/09/adding-ubuntu-to-windows-7-bootloader.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">tough guide</a> to do so.</p>

<p>There is a great GUI tool to edit boot loader called <a href=""http://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/"" rel=""noreferrer"">EasyBCD</a> (It is free for personal use). <a href=""http://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Their guide</a> about setting up Ubuntu using Windows bootloader. </p>

<p><strong>I strongly recommend using GRUB as bootloader, as it is more flexible. May be you can <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/52963/35775"">set Windows as default boot</a> option AND/OR <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/135113/how-to-change-the-time-for-os-selection-menu-in-grub/135116#135116"">reduce timeout value</a>.</strong></p>

"How large should I make root, home, and swap partitions?","159735","","<p>I have a laptop with win7 installed. I have now made a 60gb partition which I want to install ubuntu into. The question I have, before I do the installation, is how large each of the root, swap, and home partition should be? I have read some place that root could be as small as 8GB, but isn't that too small? Since I guess beside ubuntu all the softwares installed will reside there as well? And I think I'm going to set my swap to be 2GB large.</p>

<p>My main concern is how large should the root partition should be. I'm mainly going to use ubuntu for programming and browse the web.</p>
","<p>You actually should just install ubuntu on two partitions, <code>/</code> and <code>swap</code>. You can have ubuntu do this automatically by choosing to use the available free space (in other words, do not format your 60GB partition in vista before installing ubuntu).</p>

<p>Some will argue that you should use separate partitions for <code>/home</code>, <code>/boot</code>, <code>/</code> and all kinds of things. This is  useful in <strong>some</strong> situations, but for most common situations you are better off <strong>not</strong> doing this.  This is because it will fragment your disk in a way that might not be wanted later. Just let ubuntu choose for you and you'll be safe :)</p>

<p>You would often use a separate home in situations where you want to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple drives</li>
<li>Multiple mutually exclusive ubuntu installs sharing the same data (could work with varying distros but not advisable to do this with different distros)</li>
<li>Situations where your data needs to be safe in the case of a drive failure/upgrade (most normal installs are safe)</li>
<li>You want it to be easier to reinstall or upgrade the system (just choose not to format the <code>/home</code> partition - please note a backup of important data is highly recommended during any system upgrade)</li>
<li>The same drive is used by different systems.</li>
<li>Your disk does not have enough capacity for both home and system data (e.g. a small SSD)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> <em>""Ubuntu's installer offers to preserve the contents of /home, so you don't need to be afraid to lose anything when doing re-installs or upgrades. – htorque""</em></p>

<p>On another note about swap - if you want to be sure that when doing large tasks you can have a lot of swap space, you can set your swap space to be twice the size of your ram, but either way, ubuntu will handle the requirements rather well if you choose to install on the blank 60GB partition.</p>

<p>You might also want to read up on Swap files instead of Swap partitions.  Again this can help reduce fixed fragmentation of your disk and dynamically allocate space as you need it.  Supposedly, there is no performance loss.

It is always preferable to install through the native Package Management as the Package Manager will handle the location, updates, paths and the launchers (shortcuts) for you.

","<p>GIMP v2.8 does not natively export bitmaps to SVG files. There used to be a plugin to do so but this project apparently is discontinued. We could import an image as a bitmap object to <a href=""https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/inkscape"" rel=""noreferrer"">Inkscape</a> <a href=""https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/inkscape"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://hostmar.co/software-small"" alt=""Install inkscape""></a> and save it as an SVG file. The image will then remain a bitmap file, i.e. it will get aliasing artifacts on scaling (see below).</p>

<p>But <strong>Inkscape</strong> can do even more. We can import the bitmaps we had already put so much work in to Inkscape and convert them with a few mouse clicks to nice vector graphics.</p>

<p>Here is how to do that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open Inkscape.</li>
<li>Choose <em>""File - Import""</em> to import a bitmap file.</li>
<li>Choose to <em>""embed""</em> the image.</li>
<li>Select the image with the select tool (<strong>↖</strong>).</li>
<li><p>Select <em>Path - Trace Bitmap...</em> for settings (below shown for 2 colors = <em>""Scans""</em> ):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SU8c8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p>Select <em>""Update""</em> for a preview until settings are fine.</p></li>
<li>Start tracing with <em>""OK""</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now a vectorized image of your original bitmap will be seen on top of the bitmap. We can resize or move this newly created object, delete the original image, or choose to <em>""Object - Ungroup""</em> in case we need to adapt shapes or colour of sub-object created.</p>

<p>The advantage of a vector graphic can most rapidly be seen when we increase it's size. Shown below was zooming to 2500%. Top is the original bitmap, bottom is the vectorized object:</p>

"How do I install adobe flashplayer in ubuntu 16.04?","158147","","<p>I was wondering how I can install the adobe flashplayer from this site: <a href=""https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/"">https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/</a></p>

","<p>You won't be able to install it from that site. I believe Opera has pepper-flash built in which is a more up to date version then the one officially supported from Adobe.</p>

<p>If you still need to install it then add Canonical Partners to your software sources. To do this, go to System Settings, then open Software &amp; Updates and on the tab ""Other Software"" make sure Canonical Partners is ticked. Then proceed normally with:</p>

"Migrate from a virtual machine (VM) to a physical system","157898","","<h3>Aka: How can I convert a .vdi or .vmdk to a real installation on a physical disk?</h3>

<p>Is it possible/feasible to migrate a Virtual Machine installation of Ubuntu onto a physical machine? If possible, how difficult would this be to accomplish and what steps would i need to take to prepare for the migration.</p>

<p>I'd like to do some testing on a VM and if it works out migrate that system to physical hardware instead of reinstalling everything. Is this possible?</p>
","<p>Yes, it's possible. It's not even <em>that</em> hard, it just takes some time, a Ubuntu LiveCD, sticky-back-plastic, and an external USB disk (if you don't have more than one internal disks).</p>

<h2>Preliminary step: Convert the disk to something useful</h2>

<p>Both VMWare and VirtualBox (amongst others) use disk formats that don't lend themselves well to being written directly to disk. You <em>can</em> but I personally feel it's more convenient to write it to an intermediary, standard image first. You can do this from your current system without having to boot to a LiveCD.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Load a terminal and fire in:</p>

<pre><code>cd /media/wherever-the-image-is/

# for VMWare
sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm
qemu-img convert your-vmware-disk.vmdk -O raw disk.img

# For VirtualBox
VBoxManage internalcommands converttoraw your-virtualbox-disk.vdi /dev/sdX
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Move <code>/media/wherever-the-image-is/disk.img</code> somewhere that you're not about to write to. If you're planning to write it to the disk that it's currently sitting on, you'll want to stick it on a separate internal disk, or, worst-comes-to-worst an external disk.</p></li>
<li><p>The following instructions assume you've moved it to <code>/media/dave/disk.img</code> (<code>dave</code> is an external USB disk)</p></li>
<li><p>Before you do any serious writing, <strong>make sure you have backups</strong>. It's a cliche thing to say but one typo and there's a very real possibility you'll nuke your system. Assume that things will go wrong and be prepared. CloneZilla can help you take whole disk backups if you have somewhere for that data to be stored.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Write the image to a disk of its very own</h2>

<p>You'll want to do something like this. <strong>This assumes you're going to overwrite a whole disk.</strong> If you want to do an alongside-Windows install, don't follow these instructions! Skip to after the bullets.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Boot into an Ubuntu Live CD and click Try Ubuntu.</p></li>
<li><p>Mount your the place where your vmdk image is being stored (eg the external USB disk as <code>/media/dave</code>). Do <strong>not</strong> mount the place where you want to write to.</p></li>
<li><p>Then we go to work:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dd if=/media/dave/disk.img of=/dev/sdX
</code></pre>

<p>You want to replace <code>sdX</code> with the correct path to your destination disk. The <code>sudo</code> password is blank, just hit return.</p></li>
<li><p>You can then open <code>gparted</code> or something else and you should see your Ubuntu partition sitting on the disk. You should be able to expand it out.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Write the image to a disk alongside another operating system</h2>

<p>This is perhaps an altogether safer way of doing things. The idea is very similar apart from you do a proper install of Ubuntu and then just sync over the files from <code>disk.img</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your LiveCD this time will need to be the same version of Ubuntu as your virtual install. Boot into the Live CD and, again, click Install.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow the installer through, repartition things as you see fit. About 10 minutes later, you'll be installed and it'll ask you to reboot. Don't reboot. Doesn't matter if you accidentally do, just make sure you're back in the LiveCD for the next instructions.</p></li>
<li><p>Mount your new install's partition and your external disk where you've stored the <code>disk.img</code> from earlier (just double click them in nautilus).</p></li>
<li><p>Mount your disk.img ISO in a terminal:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mkdir /media/oldinstall
sudo mount -o loop /media/dave/disk.img /media/oldinstall
</code></pre>

<p>-Note - After creating the desired .img file, sometimes when you try to mount it as a loop device  you might get the following error </p>

<p><strong>""NTFS signature is missing.
 Failed to mount '/dev/loop0': Invalid argument
 The device '/dev/loop0' doesn't seem to have a valid NTFS. ""</strong> </p>

<p>A .img file sometimes contains a master boot record and a partition table before the actual partition that you might want to mount. Hence you need to find out the offset of the required partition. To this, one can use the <strong>parted</strong> tool. For an example, look at the answer by sisco311 in this link  <a href=""http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1576011.html"">http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1576011.html</a> </p>

<p>So, if you have determined your offset to be 'xxx' then you can mount your partition using</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount -o loop,offset=xxx /media/dave/disk.img /media/oldinstall
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>From there you can either cherry-pick files or just copy over everything on top of your new Ubuntu install using something like:</p>

<pre><code>sudo rsync /media/oldinstall/ /media/my-new-install/
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Reboot and you <em>should</em> be greeted with your old VMWare install, but on bare metal. If you get nasty grub issues, you can fix it by <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling%20GRUB%202"">going back to Live CD, chrooting and fixing things</a>.</p></li>

"How to determine if a string is a substring of another in bash?","157866","","<p>I want to see if a string is inside <em>a portion</em> of another string.<br>
e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>'ab' in 'abc' -&gt; true
'ab' in 'bcd' -&gt; false
</code></pre>

<p>How can I do this in a conditional of a bash script?</p>
","<p>You can use the form <code>${VAR/subs}</code> where <code>VAR</code> contains the bigger string and
<code>subs</code> is the substring your are trying to find:</p>

<pre><code>my_string=abc
substring=ab
if [ ""${my_string/$substring}"" = ""$my_string"" ] ; then
  echo ""${substring} is not in ${my_string}""
else
  echo ""${substring} was found in ${my_string}""
fi
</code></pre>

<p>This works because <code>${VAR/subs}</code> is equal to <code>$VAR</code> but with the first occurrence of the string <code>subs</code> removed, in particular if <code>$VAR</code> does not contains the word <code>subs</code> it won't be modified.</p>

","<h2>Soft-blocking</h2>

<p>The output to <code>sudo rfkill list</code> shows that your network card is ""soft-blocked"".</p>

<p>This could happen when the wireless card has been signalled to switch-off via the kernel.</p>

<p>Try the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>run in a terminal:</p>

<p><code>sudo rfkill unblock wifi; sudo rfkill unblock all</code></p></li>
<li><p>rerun <code>sudo rfkill list</code> to confirm that the card has been unblocked.</p></li>
<li><p>reboot</p></li>
<li><p>rerun <code>sudo rfkill list</code> again to confirm unblocking as been retained. </p></li>
<li><p>rerun <code>sudo lshw -class network</code> - you should now see that the kernel has recognised (or not) the wireless card.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If the wireless kernel module has been recognised (it should not say ""unclaimed""), Network Manager should now be able to see wireless networks that are available in your vacinity.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Diagnose the kernel issue</h2>

<p>If the network card is not recognised - and you have confirmed <code>sudo rfkill list</code> shows no blocking (i.e. both soft blocked and hard blocked are ""no"") then add the following to your question:</p>

<pre><code>sudo modprobe -r iwl3945
sudo modprobe iwl3945
dmesg | tail -n 50
</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully this will point out the error - for example a firmware issue not loading.</p>

<h2>Loading new firmware</h2>

<p>If it is a firmware issue then you can try maybe one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>install the backports wireless drivers:</li>
</ul>

<p>i.e.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-2.6.39-generic
</code></pre>

<p>Then reboot - test for software blocking etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>get the latest firmware as follows:</li>
</ul>

<p>i.e.</p>

<pre><code>wget http://intellinuxwireless.org/iwlwifi/downloads/iwlwifi-3945-ucode-15.32.2.9.tgz

tar xzf iwlwifi-3945-ucode-15.32.2.9.tgz

cd iwlwifi-3945-ucode-15.32.2.9

sudo cp iwlwifi-3945-2.ucode /lib/firmware
</code></pre>

<p>Then reboot - test for software blocking etc.</p>

<p>N.B. your dmesg trace should indicate what the name of the firmware it is having an issue with.  Possibly you need to rename ""iwlwifi-3945-2.ucode"" to whatever the name of the firmware it was expecting.</p>

"How to turn on Network Discovery and Share between computers with Samba","156935","","<p>I have an Ubuntu server. 
Accessing the server from Windows clients works fine.</p>

<p>But the server is not listed among the available PCs on Windows client's Network overview.<br>
For windows machines it would be the <strong>Network Discovery</strong> feature.</p>

<p>How can I make my Samba server visible on the network?</p>

<p>Windows version is Windows 7.<br>
The Workgroup in <code>smb.conf</code> is the same as in Windows.</p>
","<p>To share resources (File Sharing) between 2 or more computers on the same LAN you need Samba which by default comes with Network discovery (After having Samba installed) activated. It will work for your local network but you need to remember to set the <strong>workgroup</strong> to the one the network is using. </p>

<p>To install Samba, first you either have to ""Share a folder"", I recommend sharing anything inside your home folder so it is less trouble because of permissions, this can be a folder in your desktop for example. You can share it by right clicking the folder and selecting Sharing, Ubuntu will guide you through a couple of Sharing questions that involve installing Samba and setting the correct permissions.</p>

<p>The other way to install samba is by literally installing samba ;). Either with <strong>Software Center</strong> or in the terminal typing the following: <code>sudo apt-get install samba</code> &lt;-- Didn't see that one coming did you!</p>

<p>Now to edit the Samba configuration and make sure you are on the <strong>same network workgroup</strong>. The workgroup should be the same for all machines in your LAN. This way, they can actually take advantage of the network discovery between Windows and Ubuntu or Ubuntu and Ubuntu machines.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Edit your <code>smb.conf</code> file: <code>sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf</code></p></li>
<li><p>Find the line in the <strong>[Global]</strong> secion that reads <strong>workgroup</strong></p>

<pre><code>[global]

## Browsing/Identification ###

# Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of  
 workgroup = WORKGROUP
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Change the value of workgroup to the one your network workgroup is using or set a new name for the workgroup you would like to be working on, for example:</p>

<pre><code>workgroup = myhomenet
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Save the file and restart the Samba service: <code>sudo service smbd restart</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Enjoy the power of weird network discovery ^^</p>

<p>This should be enough to have an Ubuntu to Ubuntu LAN working but in cases where Windows is involved and just in case Windows does not see your Ubuntu PC, add the following to you <code>smb.conf</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>local master = yes
preferred master = yes
</code></pre>

<p>And of course restart your Samba service.</p>

<p>If still it does not see it, in Windows look for the <strong>Advanced Sharing Settings</strong> found in the left panel in the <strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong>. While in there choose the option <strong>Enable file sharing for devices that use 40 or 56 bit encryption</strong>. This is only an issue in Windows Vista and Above, if you have Windows XP it should work correctly.</p>

<p>After this, to access any other computers on the Network you can open the File Browser and select <strong>Browse Network</strong> :</p>

"How to remove all files and subdirectories in a directory WITHOUT deleting the directory in bash?","156901","","<p>Is there a command to remove all files and subdirectories in a directory WITHOUT deleting the directory?</p>

<p>For example if I have directory ""dontDeleteMe"" with subdirectories ""1"", ""2"", ""3"" and each subdirectory has a few pictures in it, how can I remove the subdirectories ""1"", ""2"", and ""3"" and all the files in the them, without removing the parent directory ""dontDeleteMe""?</p>
","<p>To remove everything <em>in</em> a directory without removing the directory, type in:</p>

<p><code>rm -rfv dontDeleteMe/*</code></p>

<p>Please note, the <code>/*</code> part is very important. If you put a space before the <code>*</code>, it will delete all your files in your current directory.   </p>

<p>Also, be very careful playing with <code>rm</code>, <code>-r</code> and <code>*</code> all in the same command. They can be a disastrous combination.    </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  Okay, I realized if you do have hidden/dot files [filenames with dots at the beginning, e.x. <code>.hidden</code>] then this will leave those files intact.  </p>

<p>So really, the simplest solution to the <strong>original question</strong> is: 
<code>rm -rfv dontDeleteMe &amp;&amp; mkdir dontDeleteMe</code></p>

<p>Another one would be to use <code>find</code>'s <code>-exec</code> option or pipe to <code>xargs</code> (below):</p>

<p><code>find dontDeleteMe/* -print0  | xargs -0  rm -rv</code></p>

<p>You can customize the session names with the <code>-S</code> parameter, otherwise it uses your hostname (teamviggy), for example:</p>

<pre><code>$ screen

<p>(ctrl-A d to detach)</p>

<pre><code>$ screen -S myprogramrunningunderscreen

","<p><strong>Update 2017-04-13</strong>: This seems to have changed in recent Ubuntu versions and running <code>sudo apt-get install console-common</code> will try to remove other packages. So, for recent Ubuntu versions, use this instead <em>(Tested in 17.04)</em>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration

<p>The simplest way would indeed be as @steeldriver <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/434849/change-keyboard-layout-english-uk-on-command-line-to-english-us?noredirect=1#comment566503_434849"">suggested</a> to open a terminal and run this command:</p>

<p>Now save your changes and close the file editor. Apport will now no longer start at boot. If you want to turn it off immediately without rebooting, run <code>sudo service apport stop</code>.</p>

Suppose I need to learn the modules NumPy and SciPy.</p>

<li>How will I install it if it is not installed? </li>
<li>How will I know if it is already installed?</li>
</ul>
","<p><strong>How to know if a python module is installed or not in the system:</strong> You can do a very easy test in terminal,</p>

<pre><code>$ python -c ""import math""
$ echo $?
0                                # math module exists in system

$ python -c ""import numpy""

ImportError: No module named numpy
$ echo $?
1                                # numpy module does not exist in system
</code></pre>

<h3>How will I install it if it is not installed</h3>

<p>You can install specific module by downloading respective packages from repository, for example you can <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/588512/127327"">install <code>scipy</code></a> as,</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install python-scipy ## for Python2
sudo apt-get install python3-scipy ## for Python3
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Alternately</strong> You can also install a python module using <code>python-pip</code> as suggested by Zack Titan in the <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/588390/how-do-i-check-whether-a-module-is-installed-or-not-in-python#comment816847_588392"">comment below</a>, To install <code>numpy</code> you can use</p>

<pre><code>pip install numpy
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> It is highly recommended to install python-modules using official Ubuntu repository only and not to use the <code>pip</code> method as <strong>superuser</strong>(i.e., as <code>root</code> or using <code>sudo</code>). In some cases it may leave your system unusable by breaking system python. </p>

"How do I install GRUB on a RAID system installation?","154803","","<p>I'm trying to setup and install Ubuntu on a RAID 1 setup. I have two disks, sdb and sdc. I've been following this guide</p>

<p><a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SoftwareRAID"">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SoftwareRAID</a></p>

<p>which more or less works for getting everything set up and Ubuntu installed. The problem is at the end of the installation, it tries to install GRUB. By default it tries my ""first disk"", which gives a ""fatal error"". I've tried installing it on a specific partion, e.g. sdb1 as well as RAID devices, e.g. md0, md1, etc.. Nothing seems to work.</p>

<p>The actual error is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unable to install GRUB in /dev/sdb</p>
  
  <p>Executing 'grub-install '/dev/sdb' failed.</p>
  
  <p>This is a fatal error.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then I'm taken back to the main install menu. If I choose ""Install the GRUB boot loader on a hard disk"" option, I can pick the partition, but entering sdb2 or md1 gives the same error.</p>

<p>So I went ahead an just didn't install GRUB, which means now I presumably have a working Ubuntu installation, but I can't boot it. I've tried booting from the LiveCD to install GRUB, but I can't chroot into my system because it doesn't seem to recognize that my disk is a Linux disk. There's an error about it being a RAID partition.</p>

<p>So basically I would really like to know how you know to which device to install GRUB at installation, or at the very least, how to install it on to my system now.</p>

<p>I suppose I should also mention that sda is a Windows 7 installation that I would like to keep around and be able to access at boot.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help.</p>
","<p>My problem turned out to be that I had GUID partition table since my drives were 2TB each. The method I originally tried to follow didn't assume this, and so installing GRUB didn't work.</p>

<p>Instead, you should make a small (1MB) partition on each disk and RAID them together and set it as a GRUB boot partition (I'm not sure of the actual name). Set up your other RAID partitions (e.g. swap and /) and then the GRUB installer should find the boot area just fine.</p>

"How to remove lines from the text file containing specific words through terminal?","154252","","<p>How to remove all the lines from the text file containing the words ""cat"" and ""rat""?</p>
","<h3><code>grep</code> approach</h3>

<p>To create a copy of the file without lines matching ""cat"" or ""rat"", one can use <code>grep</code> in reverse (<code>-v</code>) and with the whole-word option (<code>-w</code>).</p>

<pre><code>grep -vwE ""(cat|rat)"" sourcefile &gt; destinationfile
</code></pre>

<p>The whole-word option makes sure it won't match <code>cats</code> or <code>grateful</code> for example. Output redirection of your shell is used (<code>&gt;</code>) to write it to a new file. We need the <code>-E</code> option to enable the extended regular expressions for the <code>(one|other)</code> syntax.</p>

<h3><code>sed</code> approach</h3>

<p>Alternatively, to remove the lines in-place one can use <code>sed -i</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sed -i ""/\b\(cat\|rat\)\b/d"" filename
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>\b</code> sets word boundaries and the <code>d</code> operation deletes the line matching the expression between the forward slashes. <code>cat</code> and <code>rat</code> are both being matched by the <code>(one|other)</code> syntax we apparently need to escape with backslashes.</p>

<p>Tip: use <code>sed</code> without the <code>-i</code> operator to test the output of the command before overwriting the file.</p>

"Why doesn't running ""sudo shutdown now"" shut down?","153452","","<p>When I issue the following:</p>

<pre><code>sudo shutdown now
</code></pre>

<p>..my newly commissioned Ubuntu 14.04 server doesn't shut down. It stops with the following message:</p>

<pre><code>* Stopping System V runlevel compatibility
Give root password for maintenance:
(or type Control-D to continue):
</code></pre>

<p>If I type in the root password, the machine simply sits there at the shell prompt.</p>
","<p>Traditionally, the command <code>sudo shutdown now</code> will take you to the runlevel 1 (recovery mode); this will happen for both Upstart and SysV init.
To get what you want, i.e., to shut down the computer properly, you need to give the <code>-h</code> switch to <code>shutdown</code>. </p>

<p>One thing to note here is that <code>halt</code> will close all the processes, turn off the CPUs and return the control to a ROM monitor of the mainboard needing the user to press the power button to get the power supply turned off, whereas <code>poweroff</code> after turning off the CPUs will simply turn off the power supply resulting in a proper shutdown.</p>

<p>The <code>-h</code> switch of <code>shutdown</code> will either <code>halt</code> or <code>poweroff</code> the computer, the decision will be taken by the system although in Ubuntu I have seen that it would normally <code>poweroff</code> the machine. To be sure of that, you can use the <code>-P</code> switch with <code>shutdown</code> to <code>poweroff</code> the computer. </p>

<p>To summarize, here are the commands available to <code>poweroff</code> (<strong>not</strong> <code>halt</code>) a computer:</p>

<pre><code>sudo shutdown -h now
sudo shutdown -P now
sudo poweroff
sudo halt -p
sudo init 0
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>poweroff</code> and <code>halt</code> commands basically invoke <code>shutdown</code> (except for the <code>poweroff -f</code>). <code>sudo poweroff</code> and <code>sudo halt -p</code> are exactly like <code>sudo shutdown -P now</code>. The command <code>sudo init 0</code> will take you to the runlevel 0 (<strong>shutdown</strong>).</p>

<p>Now what if you want to shut down forcefully, i.e., you don't want to wait for processes to close normally? In that case you can use:</p>

<pre><code>sudo poweroff -f
</code></pre>

<p>This will not use <code>shutdown</code>. Rather, it will invoke the <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/reboot.2""><code>reboot(2)</code></a> system call (used for reboot, poweroff &amp; halt) to power off the computer instantly.</p>

<p><strong>VBOXAUTOSTART_DB</strong> which contains an absolute path to the autostart database directory and<br>
<strong>VBOXAUTOSTART_CONFIG</strong> which contains the location of the autostart config settings. The file should look similar to this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code># virtualbox defaults file
VBOXAUTOSTART_DB=/etc/vbox
VBOXAUTOSTART_CONFIG=/etc/vbox/vbox.cfg

<li><p>Now we need to create the <code>/etc/vbox/vbox.cfg</code> file and add</p>

default_policy = deny
# Create an entry for each user allowed to run autostart
myuserid = {
allow = true

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the filename <code>vbox.cfg</code> doesn't work above, try naming it <code>autostart.cfg</code>.</p>

<p>If you are the only user you can just add the line <code>default_policy = allow</code> to the <code>vbox.cfg</code> file.</p></li>
<li><p>Set permissions on directory to the vboxuser group and make sure users can write to the directory as well as sticky bit.</p>

<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>sudo chgrp vboxusers /etc/vbox
sudo chmod 1775 /etc/vbox
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Add each of the users to the <code>vboxusers</code> group. </p>

<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers USERNAME
</code></pre>

<p>(replace <code>USERNAME</code> with the username)</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>If you have changed group permissions for the current user, log out and back in again to refresh the permissions.</em> (credit @kR105)</p>

<ol start=""5"">

<p>and enable autostart for an individual VM with</p>

<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>VBoxManage modifyvm &lt;uuid|vmname&gt; --autostart-enabled on

<p>This will create a <code>myuserid.start</code>  file in <code>/etc/vbox</code> directory</p></li>

"How to set up a root cron job properly","153045","","<p>I tried to set up a root cron job to run a Bash script as root, to run at minute 7,37, every hour, every day of month, every month. This script is located in <code>/usr/bin</code> and named <code>tunlrupdate.sh</code>. It updates the DNS of Tunlr.</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -l /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh 
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2133 Sep 24 15:42 /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh
</code></pre>

<p>This Bash script is available <a href=""https://github.com/JochenB/tunlrupdate/blob/master/tunlrupdate.sh"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>When invoked the script writes what's happening in a log located in <code>/var/log/tunlr.log</code></p>

<p>To add this root cron job I used the standard for root's crontab</p>

<pre><code>sudo crontab -e
</code></pre>

<p>And inserted these 2 lines at the end. I expect cron to run the script as root.</p>

<pre><code># check for updated Tunlr DNS every 30 minutes at the hour + 7 mn and hour + 37 mn
07,37 * * * * root /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh
</code></pre>

<p>A later command <code>sudo crontab -l</code> confirmed that the cron job has been inserted.</p>

<p>I did reboot Ubuntu and was checking in the log file if the cron job was launched properly. However there is nothing in the logfile <code>/var/log/tunlr.log</code> meaning the job was never successfully launched.</p>

<p>I did check that if I run the script from the command line</p>

<pre><code>sudo /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh
</code></pre>

<p>then the logfile is updated accordingly.</p>

<p>Why is this cron job not running as planned in my system?</p>

<p>UPDATE 1 : All the proposed solutions so far do not work. I thank Olli for a CLI to list the system log <code>sudo grep CRON /var/log/syslog</code>. However I did get a CRON error</p>

<pre><code>CRON[13092]: (root) CMD (  [ -x /usr/lib/php5/maxlifetime ] &amp;&amp; [ -d /var/lib/php5 ]
&amp;&amp; find /var/lib/php5/ -depth -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type f -cmin +$(/usr/lib/php
/maxlifetime) ! -execdir fuser -s {} 2&gt;/dev/null \; -delete)
</code></pre>

<p>with the suggested PATH= insertion &amp; use of absolute path from root for functions in the script or without this suggested solutions here. I still get this error.</p>

<p>After some searching I pinpointed the error in the file <code>/usr/lib/php5/maxlifetime</code> as is explained <a href=""https://forum.linode.com/viewtopic.php?t=9780&amp;p=55980"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>: <code>Change #!/bin/sh -e --&gt; #!/bin/sh -x</code></p>

<p>Then listing the CRON error log in my system</p>

<pre><code>sudo grep CRON /var/log/syslog
Feb 11 18:07:01 Marius-PC CRON[14067]: (root) CMD (root /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh)
Feb 11 18:07:01 Marius-PC CRON[14066]: (root) MAIL (mailed 1 byte of output; but got
status 0x00ff, #012)
</code></pre>

<p>I still don't get the bash script executing. This time no error is shown in the log. To get assurance this was not the content of the script I reduced the script to the following 3 lines:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
LOGFILE=/var/log/tunlr.log
echo $LOGFILE &gt;&gt; $LOGFILE
</code></pre>

<p>I still don't get the cron job through. Nothing is written in the log file. So even may be an empty script will not run in cron ? I don't get it. I am know trying a script reduced to these 2 lines:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
exit 0
</code></pre>

<p>And still the same error log. The cron script does not go through ...</p>
","<p>Well, at last the working solution. In the syslog I saw the repetitive and intriguing:</p>

<pre><code>CRON[18770]: (root) CMD (root /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh)
</code></pre>

<p>That sounds like root was not recognized as a cmd. As I already used the root's cron by using <code>$ sudo /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh</code>. Then I tried with the original script (corrected for a mistake in the date UNIX cmd : %m which is month was used for minutes which is %M) the following (which removes the root from the cron line):</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo crontab -e
# check for updated Tunlr DNS every 30 minutes at the hour + 7 mn and hour + 37 mn
07,37 * * * * /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh
</code></pre>

<p>This turned out to be the final solution. [Although I found scores of literature stating the erroneous line with root in the cron line. That was a mistake].</p>

<p><strong>TLP Developer</strong></p>

<p>( This is not a general prerequisite for TLP but is only needed <strong>if the user decides</strong> to change the default governor. If a user issues the command <strong>without changing the TLP setting</strong> too, he ends up with ""perfomance"", which is quite bad for battery life.), Apply to section <strong>3.)</strong> Processor and Frequency Scaling</p>

</ol>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>0.) <strong>General</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>TLP_ENABLE=1
</code></pre>

<p>Set to 0 to disable TLP (Reboot needed), It should be enabled so leave the default value</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1.) <strong>File System</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>     DISK_IDLE_SECS_ON_AC=0
     DISK_IDLE_SECS_ON_BAT=2 
</code></pre>

<p>DISK_IDLE_SECS_ON_BAT=2 = You can either leave the default value <strong>(2)</strong> or you can edit it as <strong>5</strong>, By default Ubuntu uses <strong>5</strong>, its up to you, read the gives below help</p>

<pre><code> cat /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/laptop-mode
</code></pre>

<p>This controls how agressive the system is at trying to avoid
writing to disk.  The longer the disk is idle, the more power you can save.</p>

<p>This is only active on battery power, and it restores these values
to kernel defaults when on AC power.</p>

<p><strong>Defaults 5</strong>, which enables laptop mode and forces the system to <strong>wait 
5 seconds</strong> whenever something asks to write to disk to flush out as much
data as we can. </p>

  <p>2.) <strong>Dirty page values</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code> MAX_LOST_WORK_SECS_ON_AC=15
 MAX_LOST_WORK_SECS_ON_BAT=60 
</code></pre>

<p>Leave the default value </p>

<p>Defaults 60, which means that the kernel will not start forcing process
to write out file information that has been changed but not saved until 60%
of usable system memory is filled with dirty information.</p>

  <p>3.) <strong>Processor and Frequency Scaling</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code> CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_AC=ondemand
 CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_BAT=powersave
</code></pre>

<p>Remove the hash and edit it as conservative.</p>

<p>Its up to you what you want, you can also use <strong>ON_BAT=powersave</strong></p>

<p>Select a cpu frequency scaling governor: ondemand/powersave/performance/conservative</p>

<p><strong>Governor ??</strong></p>

<p>The governor decides what frequency should be used.</p>

<p>Module Description:</p>

<pre><code>ondemand        Dynamically switch between CPU(s) available if at 95% cpu load

performance     Run the cpu at max frequency

conservative    Dynamically switch between CPU(s) available if at 75% load

powersave       Run the cpu at the minimum frequency
</code></pre>

<p><strong>TLP Developer</strong></p>

<p>To use ""conservative"" over ""powersave – especially on AC – should not be
a general recommendation but only an option for hardware that produces
excessive heat or fan noise.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4.) <strong>Min/Max frequency</strong></p>
</blockquote>

</code></pre>

<p>Set the min/max frequency available for the scaling governor.
Possible values strongly depend on your cpu. For available frequencies see 
tlp-stat output, Section ""+++ Processor"".</p>

<p><strong>Hint</strong>: Parameters are disabled by default, remove the leading # to enable them,
otherwise kernel default values are used.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5.) <strong>Turbo Boost</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code> CPU_BOOST_ON_AC=1

</code></pre>

<p>Important: this setting may lead to increased disk drive wear and tear because of excessive read-write head unloading (recognizable from the clicking noises)</p>

<pre><code>128 – compromise between power saving and wear (TLP standard setting on battery)

<h3>VA-API (Hardware Acceleration For Intel / AMD GPUs)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
</blockquote>

<p>The main motivation for VA-API (Video Acceleration API) is to enable hardware accelerated video decode/encode at various entry-points (VLD, IDCT, Motion Compensation etc.) for the prevailing coding standards today (MPEG-2, MPEG-4 ASP/H.263, MPEG-4 AVC/H.264, and VC-1/VMW3). Extending XvMC was considered, but due to its original design for MPEG-2 MotionComp only, it made more sense to design an interface from scratch that can fully expose the video decode capabilities in today's GPUs. </p>

"What does `nomodeset` do","152111","","<p>Since installing Ubuntu 12.10 I have been playing around trying to get my Radeon HD 5450 gpu to work with the proprietary driver, as from the start installing the driver meant losing unity.</p>

<p>I won't list the steps I took as it is not a requirement to answering this question.</p>

<p>After taking one measure and then installing fglrx-updates, upon reboot the system hung at the purple screen. So I decided to boot using <code>nomodeset</code></p>

<p>I edited</p>

<pre><code>quiet splash $vt_handoff
</code></pre>

<p>to look like this</p>

<pre><code>quiet splash nomodeset
</code></pre>

<p>Making this change I am then able to log in with Unity and the proprietary driver installed and performing well. I would go as far as to say it performs better than it did in 12.04</p>

<p><code>fglrxinfo</code> reads</p>

<pre><code>display: :0  screen: 0
OpenGL vendor string: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
OpenGL renderer string: ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5000 Series
OpenGL version string: 4.2.11903 Compatibility Profile Context
</code></pre>

<p>Please note the way I have added <code>nomodeset</code> It had been a while since I have had to do this so it was done from memory.

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>nomodeset $vt_handoff

<p>What has my <code>nomodeset</code> edit done? The only thing wrong that I have noticed is that I don't get the plymouth Ubuntu logo screen when booting.</p>

<p>If that is the only trade-off I am happy to make the edit permanant.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>nomodeset</strong> </p>
  
  <p>The newest kernels have moved the video mode setting into
  the kernel. So all the programming of the hardware specific clock
  rates and registers on the video card happen in the kernel rather than
  in the X driver when the X server starts.. This makes it possible to
  have high resolution nice looking splash (boot) screens and flicker
  free transitions from boot splash to login screen. Unfortunately, on
  some cards this doesnt work properly and you end up with a black
  screen. Adding the nomodeset parameter instructs the kernel to not
  load video drivers and use BIOS modes instead until X is loaded.</p>

"How to mount a VirtualBox shared folder at startup?","151616","","<p>I have Ubuntu installed in Virtualbox. I want to mount my VirtualBox shared folder in Ubuntu automatically when I log in Ubuntu. I put the following line in my ~./bashrc and ~/.bash_profile:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount -t vboxsf windows_share /media/windows_share
</code></pre>

<p>where windows_share is the name I created with Virtualbox. But everytime I start my Ubuntu, it asks me for passwd since it needs sudo. Is there anyway to automatically mount Windows share without entering password every time I log in?</p>
","<p>To always mount a Virtual Box ""shared folder"" on booting an Ubuntu guest we have two options. It is up to personal preference which option works best in our setting.</p>

<h3>1. Mount with fstab</h3>

<p>To mount a shared folder using the <code>vboxsf</code> filesystem provided with <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/22743/how-do-i-install-guest-additions-in-virtualbox"">Guest Additions</a> we first need to make sure <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/30396/error-mounting-virtualbox-shared-folders-in-an-ubuntu-guest"">prerequisites are met</a>. Then we may put the following line in our <code>etc/fstab</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;name_of_share&gt;   /path/to/mountpoint   vboxsf   &lt;options&gt;  0   0
</code></pre>

<p>Replace <code>name_of_share</code> and <code>/path/to/mountpoint</code> with your individual setup (the directory for the mountpoint has to be created first). See the manpage for mount <code>&lt;options&gt;</code>. One possibility is to mount with <code>defaults</code>, or to give specific mount options (e.g. <code>rw, suid, exec, auto, users</code>).  </p>

<p>On some systems the <code>vboxsf</code> kernel module is not yet loaded at the time <code>fstab</code> is read on boot. It may then help to append the <code>vboxsf</code> kernel module to <code>/etc/modules</code>.  </p>

<p>Some systems may need option <code>comment=systemd.automount</code> in their fstab entry (<a href=""https://superuser.com/a/869652"">source</a>).</p>

<h3>2. Mount with Virtual Box ""automatic mounting"":</h3>

<p>In recent releases of Virtual Box we can also automatically mount shared folders on creation:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hS83j.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>After a reboot of the guest this shared folder will be mounted to the guest directory <code>/media/&lt;username&gt;/sf_&lt;name_of_share&gt;</code> accessible to all users who had been made member of the group <code>vboxsf</code>.</p>

"How much memory (RAM) should I allocate to the Virtual Machine?","151391","","<p>I'm installing Ubuntu in a Virtual Box; my host OS is Windows 7, and I have 6GB of RAM on my system. One tutorial on setting up Ubuntu on a virtual machine (this one, on step 14: <a href=""http://www.aztcs.org/meeting_notes/linuxsig/ubuntuintovirtualbox/ubuntuintovirtualbox.htm"">http://www.aztcs.org/meeting_notes/linuxsig/ubuntuintovirtualbox/ubuntuintovirtualbox.htm</a>) says to set the RAM at 45% of the total RAM I have available, which would be about 2.7GB in my case. Is this correct? </p>

<p>Also, when I allocate RAM to the vm, is that RAM now reserved exclusively for the vm, and if yes, is it only reserved for the vm when the vm is running a guest OS or does it create a permanent division in the RAM, i.e., when I stop running and quit from the virtual machine, will my host OS (Windows 7) regain all 6GB of RAM as its available RAM?</p>
","<p>You should give virtual machine however much RAM you need <em>for the tasks you're using it to perform</em>.</p>

<p>If you're running a single virtual machine, the suggestion you read is OK (provided that your host machine has enough RAM, which it does). However, depending on what you plan to do with your Ubuntu system, it probably doesn't need 2.7 GB of RAM. I give most of my virtual machines, including Ubuntu virtual machines, 1 GB of RAM, even when I have enough physical RAM available that I could allocate more.</p>

<p>If you plan to run multiple virtual machines, then giving a virtual machine 2.7 GB of RAM out of a total of 6 GB is probably too much. It would not work out well to have two VM's with that amount of RAM!</p>

<p>Finally, your virtual machine will typically reserve all the RAM you give it, <em>whenever it is running</em>. When the virtual machine is turned off, suspended, hibernated, or otherwise not running, this RAM will <em>not be in use</em>. For example, I have about 10 virtual machines, most of which have 1 GB of RAM, on a host machine with 4 GB of RAM. This is not a problem; it just means I can only run up to a few of them at a time.</p>

"Grub not showing on startup for Windows 8.1 Ubuntu 13.10 Dual boot","150980","","<p>Ok, so I'm such a newbie to Ubuntu and I bought a Windows 8 pre-installed laptop last month.</p>

<p>I updated to Windows 8.1 and then I thought about installing Ubuntu as a dual boot so I could mess around and learn more about it. </p>

<p>So I followed a Youtube tutorial ( <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJfTvkgLqfQ"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJfTvkgLqfQ</a> ) and I got my stuff working fine. </p>

<p>The first few times I booted I got the GRUB menu instead of my default HP Boot OS Manager, and I was able to select my OS. </p>

<p>So I went to sleep and the next day I turned on my computer and the GRUB menu did not show up. I tried several times and it didn't automatically show up.</p>

<p>In order for me to see the GRUB menu I had to turn on my PC and on start had to press ESC to pause startup and press F9 to get boot options. Then from there I had to pick from OS Boot, Ubuntu, Ubuntu (Yes there were two Ubuntus available) and a default EFI file thingy. </p>

<p>When I click the first Ubuntu I get the GRUB Menu (I was too scared to try the second in case I screwed my laptop up) and I can safely load Ubuntu from there and use it (although I do have to increase my brightness every time I load Ubuntu because it somehow reduces my brightness to complete darkness on boot)</p>

<p>So my problem here is why isn't my GRUB showing on boot, after it worked on the first day? </p>

<p>My laptop is a HP TouchSmart j-078CA.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1</strong>: FYI I just switched to Ubuntu LiveCD to check my Installation and found out that one of my partition is flagged as <code>msftres</code>. Here is a screenshot of my GParted on a LiveCD: <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SSFNK.png"" alt=""Gparted on LiveCD""></p>
","<p>First, turn off the Windows 8 Fast Startup feature, <a href=""http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/6320-fast-startup-turn-off-windows-8-a.html"">as described here.</a> That feature causes filesystem corruption, which can in turn cause odd boot issues. There's a good chance that this issue caused your problem initially. Disabling Fast Startup might or might not cause GRUB to reappear the next time you reboot.</p>

<p>If that doesn't fix the problem, you should try re-registering GRUB with your firmware's NVRAM. The way to do this that's most reliable is to use <code>bcdedit</code> in Windows. Open an <em>Administrator</em> Command Prompt window and type:</p>

<pre><code>bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\ubuntu\grubx64.efi
</code></pre>

<p>If you're booting with Secure Boot active, change <code>grubx64.efi</code> to <code>shim.efi</code> (or maybe it's <code>shimx64.efi</code>; in Linux, check the contents of <code>/boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu</code> to see what's there). Doing this in Windows is more reliable than other methods because some users have reported that some versions of Windows repeatedly re-register themselves as the default boot loader if the default is set outside of Windows. Although this is rare, it's consistent with what you're seeing, so using Windows for this task may be necessary.</p>

<p>An easier way to do it, but potentially less reliable in your case, is to use <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair"">Boot Repair.</a> This tool automatically fixes certain types of boot problems, and it's likely to work for you. The biggest risk is that if an overzealous Windows caused GRUB to become inaccessible to begin with, the Boot Repair change won't work.</p>

<p>If you continue to have problems, post back with details. (If necessary, edit your original post and comment on this one to alert me to the change.)</p>

","<p>First of all make sure you click on ""Apply system-wide..."" whenever you change proxy settings in the gnome-network-properties (<code>System -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Network Proxy</code>).

<p>However, I have faced situations where all the above still doesn't work: Synaptic or <code>apt-get</code> (over commandline) can't connect to the internet through the proxy even after it is set in the above way. In such cases, one solution is to add a file in <code>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d</code> with specific proxy configuration for apt (this will be used by apt-get, aptitude, synaptic and Ubuntu software center).</p>

<p>None of the above. You should use <code>/usr/local/bin</code> or <code>/usr/local/sbin</code> for system-wide available scripts. The <code>local</code> path means it's not managed by the system packages (this is <a href=""http://lintian.debian.org/tags/file-in-usr-local.html"">an error</a> for Debian/Ubuntu packages). </p>

<p>For <em>user-scoped scripts</em>, use <code>~/bin</code> (a personal bin folder in your home directory).</p>

"How do I share a folder with another Linux machine on the same home network?","150310","","<p>I'm trying to share a folder on one Ubuntu machine with another Ubuntu machine on the same home network.

","<blockquote>
  <p>What does Windows have to do with
  this? I'm not trying to share with a

</blockquote>

<p>You're right, this can be confusing. So let me try to clarify the terms first of all:</p>

<p>The way Windows shares files and printers is called <strong>SMB</strong>. The people from the <strong>SAMBA</strong> project have implemented all of Microsoft's protocols and specifications for Linux. Ubuntu therefore supports the same sort of file sharing as Windows, which is called Samba.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>You can use SAMBA to share files between Linux machines.</strong> In fact, you might prefer it in case you have, for example, have a friend over with their Windows computer.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, you can use <em>The Linux Way</em> of sharing files, which is NFS (Network File System) - <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/8534/share-files-and-printer-between-2-ubuntu-boxes/8573#8573"">This answer to a previous question</a> explains how to do it. (but it's rather technical)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, when the Sharing Options dialogue asks you to install the packages, you're not actually installing any Microsoft software or anything like that. Go ahead and do it, it's perfectly safe.</p>

<p>Addendum:</p>

<p>You can try to just enable sharing before you follow Salih Emin's instructions; if it doesn't work, you will get a simple warning, you can then do the steps Salih describes if needed. I have tried it on a freshly installed and up-to-date system, and I indeed needed to do this.</p>

","<p>I'll start by saying that the answer you linked already summarizes all the optimizations you may need.</p>

<p>Next, to answer your questions:</p>

<p><strong>1. Which file system (ext2/3/4 or something else)? (consider SSD life)</strong></p>

<p>ext4 is a good filesystem even for SSD, so that would be my suggestion.
(If you want performance so bad you should try XFS )</p>

<p><strong>2. Can it be changed after installation?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, but it is not trivial, so choose well from the start :)</p>

<p><strong>3. Should I partition the disk? (as we do in traditional HDD) for now, no plan of dual booting. Only Ubuntu will live on scarce space of 80GB SSD.</strong></p>

<p>This is really not a matter of SSD, but your personal choice. If you were to ask me I'll say no; don't partition the disk you will end in loosing useful space.
(If you end with a partition with 2GB free and another with 1GB free, you theoretically have 3Gb free but cannot copy a 3GB file... that space is wasted )</p>

<p><strong>4. I have 2 GB RAM, should I still allocate swap space (if I dont allocate swap space, can i still hibernate the machine)? will swap space impact SSD life?</strong>
I wouldn't worry so much about the SSD life ( modern one can run for decades ), however 2GB of RAM are enough not to need the swap partition. 
Finally the swap partition is needed in order to hibernation, so if you want to hibernate the machine then you need the swap partition.</p>

<p><strong>5. Should I consider putting additional 1GB RAM to avoid swap space?</strong>
1GB more or ram is always useful :) do it if you can.</p>

<p><strong>6. What is partition aligning? is it needed to be done before installing the Ubuntu OS or can be done later?</strong></p>

<p>That is the procedure where you align clusters, blocks and chunks. IMHO it is only needed on servers with a lot of data throughput. A good tool to do partition alignment is GParted. Of course this should be done <strong>before</strong> installing Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Hope this helps :)</p>

<ul>
<li>apache module</li>
<li>CGI application</li>
<li>FastCGI application</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is simply, how do you change this via the command line?  I know there are many configuration files for apache.</p>

<p>I'm quite bewildered how there does not seem to be a clear guide that I can find that details this process for something that seems to be so common.  Forgive me if this exists... if so, please point me in the right direction.</p>
","<p>I finally found a nice tutorial geared at doing just this.  I will outline the steps I took as I already had my LAMP stack installed but the full tutorial can be found <a href=""http://www.howtoforge.com/using-php5-fpm-with-apache2-on-ubuntu-12.04-lts"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note for the new:</strong></p>

<p>In the tutorial, it begins by switching to the root user with:</p>

<pre><code>sudo su
</code></pre>

<p>In my case I simply prefixed those commands <code>sudo</code> instead of switching users, so I will be documenting my steps that way.</p>

<p><strong>Begin</strong></p>

<p>Step one:  Install the Apache Worker MPM (Multi-Procesing Modules)</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install apache2-mpm-worker
</code></pre>

<p>This replaces the prefork I had installed which is the default when installing Apache.</p>

<p>Step 2: Install PHP5 and necessary modules</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-fastcgi php5-fpm php5
</code></pre>

<p>At this point you may get an error installing 'libapache2-mod-fastcgi':</p>

<pre><code>Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Package libapache2-mod-fastcgi is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source

E: Package 'libapache2-mod-fastcgi' has no installation candidate
</code></pre>

<p><strong>This part is not in the above tutorial</strong></p>

<p>To reconcile this, the <code>multiverse</code> repository must be added to the apt sources.</p>

<p>To do this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
</code></pre>

<p>To which I appended the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise multiverse
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise-updates multiverse
deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise-security multiverse
</code></pre>

<p><code>precise</code> in this case refers to my version of Ubuntu ""<a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases"">Precise Pangolin</a>"".</p>

<p>So now, save those changes and back to terminal:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>

<p>and again:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-fastcgi php5-fpm php5
</code></pre>

<p>which will (should) now work.</p>

<p>Now enable these Apache modules:</p>

<pre><code>sudo a2enmod actions fastcgi alias
</code></pre>

<p>restart apache</p>

<pre><code>sudo service apache2 restart
</code></pre>

<p>Step 3: Apache configuration</p>

<p>To make Apache work with PHP-FPM, we need the following configuration:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_fastcgi.c&gt;
    AddHandler php5-fcgi .php
    Action php5-fcgi /php5-fcgi
    Alias /php5-fcgi /usr/lib/cgi-bin/php5-fcgi
    FastCgiExternalServer /usr/lib/cgi-bin/php5-fcgi -host 127.0.0.1:9000 -pass-header Authorization
    &lt;Directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin&gt;
        Require all granted 
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
    #directory statement mult be on multiple lines
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
  
  <p>If you're using an older version of Apache (2.3.x or older), leave out the line</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;Directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin&gt; Require all granted &lt;/Directory&gt;
</code></pre>
  
  <p>You can check your installed version with the command</p>

<pre><code>apache2 -version
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You can put it in the global Apache configuration (so it's enabled for all vhosts), for example in <code>/etc/apache2/conf.d/php5-fpm.conf</code> (this file does not exist, so you must create it), or you can place it in each vhost that should use PHP-FPM.</p>

<p>I choose to go the global route, so:</p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/apache2/conf.d/php5-fpm.conf
</code></pre>

<p>paste in the code block above, and save, exit.
This new file will be automatically loaded by Apache's default configuration which loads all files in the <code>/etc/apache2/conf.d/</code> directory.</p>

<p>restart Apache:</p>

<pre><code>sudo service apache2 restart
</code></pre>

<p>Now create the following PHP file in the document root <code>/var/www</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /var/www/info.php
</code></pre>

<p>Add:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php phpinfo();
</code></pre>

<p>save &amp; exit.</p>

<p>Now we call that file in a browser (e.g. <code>http://your-server-ip/info.php</code>)</p>

<p>Under <strong>Server API</strong> at the top you should see <code>FPM/FastCGI</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Success!</strong></p>

<p>How can I free up / extend boot without messing up my installation? </p>
","<h2>Freeing Up Space on the Root File System</h2>

<p>To free up space on the root file system you can try to execute <code>apt-get clean</code>.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work you can go to /var/cache/apt/archives and manually remove a few files from the cache to get some space back, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>sudo rm linux-headers-*
</code></pre>

<p>It won't hurt to remove all of the .deb files here if you need to--that is what <code>apt-get clean</code> does. They will be automatically be re-downloaded by apt if they are again needed.</p>

<h2>Freeing Up Space on the /boot File System</h2>

<p>The Original Poster has a separate /boot partition, and that is what is full and preventing the apt system from working. It will be necessary for him to free up space there.</p>

<p>If there almost enough space, go to /boot and remove a config file or two:</p>

<pre><code>sudo rm config-3.2.0-19-generic-pae
</code></pre>

<p>for example, but using the name of one of the kernel versions you intend to remove anyway. This will free up a little space (about 144K apiece).</p>

<p>If you need more space individually remove old vmlinuz initrd, abi and System.map files until you have enough space (about 22 megs for one of my i386 kernel versions). </p>

<p>Whatever you do, <em>don't remove them all</em>. You should at least keep the latest two matching versions of each kind of file, for each kind of kernel you use.</p>

<p>Then proceed with your apt-get install commands. As mentioned above they may have to re-download some of the debs you deleted, but if so that will happen automatically. When you have apt working again, clean up by using apt-get to remove the packages corresponding to the files you removed--so everything matches.</p>

<hr>

<p>The config file in /boot is the kernel config that <em>was used</em> by the kernel team to <em>build</em> the kernel of the same name. It should be harmless to remove unless you want it for reference or to aid you in building your own kernels.</p>

<p>Finally you are manually removing an old kernel package or two from the /boot partition to make even more room for the new one.</p>

","<p>Your <code>iptables</code> output shows that no port is blocked.</p>

<p>So the question is: Is anything listening on port 8000? If nothing is listening on a port but the port is not blocked by a firewall <code>nmap</code> will report it as <code>closed</code>. From <a href=""http://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-basics.html"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>closed</p>
  
  <p>A closed port is accessible (it receives and responds to Nmap probe packets), but there is no application listening on it. They can be helpful in showing that a host is up on an IP address (host discovery, or ping scanning), and as part of OS detection. Because closed ports are reachable, it may be worth scanning later in case some open up. Administrators may want to consider blocking such ports with a firewall. Then they would appear in the filtered state, discussed next.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the <code>nmap</code> report: <code>""996 closed ports""</code> actually say that those ports are not blocked by a firewall but no program is listening on them. <code>nmap</code> reports a blocked port as <code>filtered</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>filtered</p>
  
  <p>Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open because packet filtering prevents its probes from reaching the port. The filtering could be from a dedicated firewall device, router rules, or host-based firewall software. ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you put an application in listening state on port 8000 it will likely show up in the output of <code>nmap</code>. You can do this if you just run <code>python3 -m http.server</code> or <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code> on the machine on which you are trying to open the ports, this will put a HTTP server listening on port 8000. Then run <code>nmap</code> again to scan the machine.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Your <code>netstat</code> output has this line:</p>

<pre><code>tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:8000          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      4134/python  
</code></pre>

<p>That means your python program is only listening on localhost (127.0.0.1), so it is only accessible from localhost, not from outside. The program has to listen on the IP of your network adapter or on the universal 0.0.0.0 IP. The problem is what I wrote above, no program is listening on the 8000 port (from the outside world) so <code>nmap</code> says it is closed. </p>

"What are the differences between 32-bit and 64-bit, and which should I choose?","147958","","<p>What is the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit Ubuntu? I've heard the 64-bit platform performs better and can detect more than 4GB of RAM. Also, while some apps haven't ported to 64-bit yet, <code>ia32-libs</code> lets a 64-bit machine run them.</p>

<p>If so, why not promote 64-bit over 32-bit?</p>
","<p>I believe the main question when choosing between 32 and 64 bits is not ""Does my processor support 64 bits — if so then I should use 64 because that's twice as good"", but <strong>""How much memory do I have?""</strong>.</p>

<p>64-bit programs use about 50% more memory then their 32-bit counterparts. The results of this are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>less code/data can fit into processor caches -> more cache misses -> your super-fast processor waits more for memory controller to fetch data from RAM. Processor also needs to read <em>more</em> data because it's more bloated.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux uses non-allocated RAM to cache disks. Less free memory available -> less space for disk caches -> slower disk access</p></li>
<li><p>Once you're out of RAM and the system starts swapping - disk access is thousands times slower than RAM, so any potential benefits of 64-bit code (see below) are flying out of window.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, in 64-bit mode processor has more registers, so it doesn't need to access memory that often, also, some calculations (64-bit numbers etc.) are more efficient. So generally, code which is not memory-restricted runs slightly faster in 64-bit mode.</p>

<p>So, if your system has, say, 2GiB of RAM or less then I would definitely choose 32 bits. More than 4GiB - the benefits of 64 bits are becoming more prominent. Around 4GiB is a ""grey zone"" - you need to make a choice yourself. </p>

<p>Here are screenshots of a (rather old) vanilla Ubuntu running in a VirtualBox with 1GiB RAM:</p>

<p><strong>32 bit:</strong> uses 388 MiB of RAM right after booting, no additional applications running (from the screenshot, 397780KiB, which is 388MiB)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/W2YWu.jpg"" alt=""32 bit Ubuntu""></p>

<p><strong>64 bit:</strong> uses 491 MiB of RAM (from the screenshot, 503452KiB = 491MiB)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BMEbH.jpg"" alt=""64 bit Ubuntu""></p>

<p>Additionally, in my testing, a web-application written in Python used up to 60% more memory on a 64-bit machine which resulted in a test suite running in 380 secs on a 32-bit machine but taking 523 seconds on a 64-bit one (both with 1GiB of RAM). If the machines were not RAM-limited the results would likely be different (as phoronix tests show).</p>

<p>Here are some more thorough and recent tests: <a href=""http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~cking/x32/Quantal-x32-power-memory-comparisons.ods"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~cking/x32/Quantal-x32-power-memory-comparisons.ods</a></p>

","<p><code>libc.so</code> was moved as part of the <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MultiarchSpec"">multiarch</a> work in Ubuntu 11.04.  The reason that there can't be a symlink there is that the purpose of multiarch is to make it possible to install both the <code>i386</code> and <code>amd64</code> versions of <code>libc</code> at the same time so that you can run 32-bit binaries more easily on 64-bit systems and vice versa (and other similar situations).  If the <code>libc6</code> package contained a symlink to the new location, then the versions of that package for different architectures wouldn't both be installable at the same time (which version of the symlink would <code>dpkg</code> pick?), defeating the entire point of the exercise.</p>

"Changing permissions on serial port","146542","","<p>I'm using the Arduino IDE in Ubuntu, and am having issues with the serial port. It has worked in the past, but for reasons that may be unnecesary, I felt the need to change the ownership of some of the files from root ownership to my users ownership.</p>

<p>This made the IDE work correctly, but I lost the ability to use the correct serial port.  In the dev folder, the port I need is listed as permission 166. Someone (who is no longer in the area to help me) swapped the permissions to 666, which made it all work gloriously.</p>

<p>However, it reverted back as soon as I restarted my computer, and if I now try to use the command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo chmod 666 ttyACM0
</code></pre>

<p>nothing happens. No error messages, but no permission change either.  </p>

<p>How can I change it, and how can I get it to change permanently.</p>

<p>I apologize if this question is overly simplistic or unclear, I'm an ubuntu noob, and I wouldn't begrudge feedback!</p>
","<p>The issue with the permissions for <code>/dev/ttyACM0</code> can be permanantly solved by adding yourself to the <code>dialout</code> group. You will have to logout and then log back in before the group change is recognized.</p>

<h2>Ubuntu 15.04 and newer.</h2>

<pre><code>sudo service sddm restart
</code></pre>

<p>While restarting lightdm restarts the entire display manager, you may be able to resolve the issue by restarting unity or compiz (Unity is a compiz plugin).</p>

<p>Restarting Unity (<code>nohup setsid unity</code> OR <code>nohup unity --restart</code> on the CLI OR <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd> and type <code>unity</code>) restarts the Unity shell.  </p>

<p>If that doesn't work, restart compiz with <code>nohup compiz --replace</code>. You may need to restart unity again after restarting compiz.  </p>

<p>Restarting lightdm restarts the entire display manager which is most likely to work but it will also close your running applications.  Which you need to do depends on how broken your session is.  If you can just restart Unity or Compiz, do that.  If that doesn't work, restart lightdm.  </p>

Now <strong>connect</strong> the device and input <code>ls /dev/ | grep sd</code> again and <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Now you should have two outputs. <strong>Compare</strong> them to each other.</p>

"Why is swap being used even though I have plenty of free RAM?","144530","","<p>I thought the whole essence of swap was to act as a temporary storage safety net when RAM was full but my swap partition is constantly being used even though I sometimes have as much as 3GB free RAM. Is this normal?</p>
","<p>You could try changing your ""swappiness"" value:</p>

<p>From the <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq/#What_is_swappiness_and_how_do_I_change_it.3F"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ubuntu's Swap FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>What is swappiness and how do I change it?</h3>
  
  <p>The swappiness parameter controls the tendency of the kernel to move processes out of physical memory and onto the swap disk. Because disks are much slower than RAM, this can lead to slower response times for system and applications if processes are too aggressively moved out of memory.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>swappiness can have a value of between 0 and 100</p></li>
  <li><p>swappiness=0 tells the kernel to avoid swapping processes out of physical memory for as long as possible</p></li>
  <li><p>swappiness=100 tells the kernel to aggressively swap processes out of physical memory and move them to swap cache</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>The default setting in Ubuntu is swappiness=60. Reducing the default value of swappiness will probably improve overall performance for a typical Ubuntu desktop installation. A value of swappiness=10 is recommended, but feel free to experiment. <em>Note: Ubuntu server installations have different performance requirements to desktop systems, and the default value of 60 is likely more suitable.</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>To check the swappiness value</strong></p>
  
  <p><code>cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness</code></p>
  
  <p><strong>To change the swappiness value</strong> A temporary change (lost on reboot) with a swappiness value of 10 can be made with</p>
  
  <p><code>sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10</code></p>
  
  <p><strong>To make a change permanent</strong>, edit the configuration file with your favorite editor:</p>
  
  <p><code>gksudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf</code></p>
  
  <p>Search for vm.swappiness and change its value as desired. If vm.swappiness does not exist, add it to the end of the file like so:</p>
  
  <p><code>vm.swappiness=10</code></p>
  
  <p>Save the file and reboot.</p>

<p>I have a display with 3200x1600px on only 11'' and everything looks really tiny.</p>
","<p>There are some steps to take:</p>

<h2>1. System wide Menu and titlebar scaling</h2>

<p>Starting with 14.04 we have an option that helps a bit:</p>

<p>Scaling Support</p>

<p>open the System Settings (here in english:)</p>

<pre><code>LANG=c unity-control-center

<p>Go to ""Displays"" and set the ""Scale for menu and title bars"":</p>

<strong><em>Note</strong>: not all applications handle this correctly, some will not reserve the extra space, so some UI elements are not accessible with this option!</em></p>

<h2>3.increase unity dock size</h2>

<p>In <code>unity-control-center</code>-><code>Appearance</code>-><code>Look</code> at the botom, you can adjust the size</p>

<h2>4. adapt Firefox</h2>

<p>(or use Chrome, which works fine since Version 41.0.2272.76 Ubuntu 14.10, though Chrome will need to be restarted to take effect)</p>

<h2>5. increase font in Pidgin</h2>

<p>There is a plugin you can install</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install pidgin-extprefs
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can increase the font in Plugins->Extended Prefs</p>

<p>This line explains the warning:</p>

<pre>Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / <b>4096 bytes</b></pre>

<ul>
<li>Your hard disk is one of the newer models which uses the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Format"">Advanced Format</a> of 4096 bytes per physical sector instead of the older 512 bytes/sector. </li>
<li>These HDDs can still provide a ""legacy"" emulation of 512 bytes/sector, which is why you see the logical sector size as 512.</li>
<li>In fact, <code>lshw</code> shows it's a Western Digital drive, the first company to switch to AF. <a href=""http://www.wdc.com/global/products/features/?id=7&amp;language=1"">They have an extensive page with lots of information on it</a>, which you may wish to look at.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, the warning occurs because partition 1 starts at logical sector 63 = byte 32256, a number not divisible by 4096; in fact it's near the end of the 7th physical sector (position 7.875 to be exact :)</p>

<h3>Should you fix it? If so, how? <em>[always backup!]</em></h3>

<p>In theory this sort of partitioning <em>may</em> affect read/write IO rates somewhat, depending on your drive's firmware. If you are happy with the performance now, ignore the warning, and no need to do anything. If not, <strong>backup all important data first</strong>, and then use Gparted to move the partition so that it starts at 4096-byte sector; setting the start boundary at <strong>1 MiB</strong> is an easy way to do it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Technically, you can set the start to any logical sector <em>which is a multiple of 8</em>, e.g. 64 is good, 256 is good, etc., but 63, 255... are not.</li>

<p>When I access the default site on <code>http://localhost/</code> I get this message on the page <code>403 Forbidden</code>.</p>

<p>How should I set the file permissions on the www root so I can secure access the web pages? Or is there something else that I have to change?</p>
","<p>I usually stick to a <code>755</code> (or <code>rwxr-xr-x</code>) on my web root, but I do not think this is the issue you're running into since your directory is already set to that.  <code>nginx</code> should have access to your directory.  The question then becomes the permissions (or existence of) the file you're trying to access.  The files within your directory will need to be readable by the user <code>nginx</code> is running as.  I usually leave these files set to a <code>755</code> (the same as the directory).  You can change the entire directory by doing <code>sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/nginx-default/</code>.</p>

<p>If there is not an index file in the directory, however, you will still get the same error.  The index file is used when you request a directory that doesn't have directory listings enabled.  The most common index file is <code>index.html</code>.  This default can be edited in your config, however, using something like:</p>

<pre><code>location / {
    index index.php;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want <code>nginx</code> to generate a list of files in that directory for you, simply turn on <a href=""http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxHttpAutoindexModule"">directory indexing</a>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>location  /  {
  autoindex  on;

<li><strong>search</strong>: works just like <code>apt-cache search</code> but sorted alphabetically.</li>
<li><strong>show</strong>: works like <code>apt-cache show</code> but hide some details that people are less likely to care about (like the hashes). The full record is still available via <code>apt-cache show</code> of course.</li>
<li><strong>update</strong>: just like the regular <code>apt-get update</code> with color output enabled.</li>
<li><strong>install,remove</strong>: adds progress output during the dpkg run.</li>

"Wifi card on an virtualbox's ubuntu","140801","","<p>I am using a virtualbox to run ubuntu on an osx machine. The problem is that I can't get any wireless extensions when running <code>iwconfig</code>. How can I manage that to connect directly my ubuntu to an wifi card ?</p>
","<p>VirtualBox does not natively offer Wireless support (Like a virtualized Wireless device). Instead, it connects directly to the Wireless device the Host uses. In this guide I will point to the steps needed to have a working Wireless card for you Guest. Before we begin you need to make sure you have done the following points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Installed the Extension Pack for that particular VirtualBox Version. You can find the extension pack in the <a href=""https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads"" rel=""noreferrer"">Download section of VirtualBox</a>. To install it, open VirtualBox, go to the menu and select <strong>File</strong> --> <strong>Preferences</strong>. Now select <strong>Extensions</strong> and select the <strong>Add Pack</strong> button at the far right. Look for the downloaded Extension pack and add it to VirtualBox.  </p></li>
<li><p>You have added your user to the <strong>vboxusers</strong> group. The quickest way is to go to the terminal and type: </p>

<p><code>sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers cyrex</code></p>

<p>where <strong>cyrex</strong> is my username. In this case, you would change <strong>cyrex</strong> for yours. Note that if the <code>vboxusers</code> group is not found it is because VirtualBox is not yet installed on your system.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now to proceed with the steps. This is what is called a <strong>passthrough</strong> method:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Right click on the Virtual Environment you wish to edit and select **Settings*:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/k1QR6.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p>Go to the Network section and select an Adapter. In this case I selected Adapter 1 although it is recommended to select a second Adapter, this way, you can use the wireless connection to your Host and still be able to connect to your internal Virtualized network (Connect to other virtualbox guests internally). For the example mentioned here I connected directly using the first adapter.</p>

<p>Click on the <strong>Attached To</strong> option and select <strong>Bridged Adapter</strong>. This will open an option that will show your Host network interfaces. If your host iw Linux it will show something like <code>wlan0</code>, <code>wlan</code>, <code>eth2</code>... If your Host is a Mac, it will show <code>AirPort</code>. In the image you can see <code>wlan0</code> for this case:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TKOSP.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now simply accept and run your virtualized environment. You should connect and see it similar to this:</p>

<p>On Mac and Linux hosts, functionality is limited when using AirPort (the Mac's wireless networking) or any Wireless Linux device to bridged networking. Currently, VirtualBox supports only IPv4 over Mac's AirPort or Linux Wireless devices. For protocols such as IPv6 and IPX, you must choose a wired interface.</p>

<p>Some adapters strip VLAN tags in hardware. This does not allow to use VLAN trunking between VM and the external network with pre-2.6.27 Linux kernels nor with host operating systems other than Linux.</p>

<p>I should also mention that in the following extended options:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vcrie.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You can select how you wish to interpret the Host's wireless device. If you wish to see it as a Intel network device, a PcNet device or a Paravirtualized Network device. Note that Promiscuous mode is used more often for sniffing and can create a bit of network lag on both, the Guest and Host when using it.</p>

<p>Note that if you disconnect in the Guest OS, you are only disconnecting the Guest to Host virtualized connection. You are <strong>not</strong> disconnecting or turning off your Host's Wireless device. For more information regarding VirtualBox and networking see <a href=""http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this guide</a>.</p>

<p>Using the method above, with a PCI Wireless device on the host or a USB Wireless device is the same. The VirtualBox Network settings will detect the device the same way. I am testing this right now with the <strong>Edimax EW-7811Un</strong>. It was detected as <code>wlan1</code> and Virtualbox (On the Network settings) detected the device as such. Remember that one thing is how the ""outside"" of the virtual environment works and then another how it works inside. Inside it was shown as a ""Wired"" device and I have internet through it.</p>

<p>Now, if you want to access a USB device do the following (Note that you need the Extension Pack for this):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Once the virtual OS has started select the device from the USB option on the bottom:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UndFv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p>It will appear on the Desktop after a couple of seconds:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VyWRZ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p>If you want the USB device to be present from the beginning, then go to the USB Settings option and select the <strong>Enable USB 2.0 Controller</strong> then add the device you wish to have activated with the <strong>Add Filter From Device</strong> option at the right (The one with the Green Plus sign).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/731Lw.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now I want to add that the difference between the <strong>VirtualBox Extension Pack</strong> and the <strong>Guest Addition</strong> is that, apart from the USB support and Remote Display options that the Extension Pack brings the Guest Addition provides the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Better Mouse Integration</li>
<li>Better 3D Support</li>
<li>Copy/Paste Support between Host and Guest</li>
<li>Folder Sharing between Host and Guest</li>
</ul>

<p>So if you need any of this features, you need to also install the Guest Addition. If you only need access to a USB Device or network options, with the Extension alone you will have that.</p>

<p>Note that VirtualBox does <strong>NOT</strong> provide a virtualized Wireless device inside the guest. They will all look like a wired one, even if the host is providing the connection via a Wired or Wireless card. Something like this:</p>

"Should I edit my resolv.conf file to fix wrong DNS problem?","140763","","<p>I have the problem that my Ubuntu machine uses the wrong DNS server. For some reason the machine queries <code>localhost</code> for DNS information.</p>

<p>I have added the DNS server in the network settings GUI, but <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> still contains <code>127.0.0.1</code> as the DNS server address. Now, I thought I could just edit the file by myself, but it explicitly says I should not edit the file by hand.</p>

<p>Now, since the network settings GUI didn't generate the file with the right settings, how do I generate a new <code>resolv.conf</code> file by myself?</p>
","<p>What none of the answers posted so far addresses is the appearance that the questioner fails to understand that having <code>nameserver 127.0.0.1</code> in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> is correct, assuming that a local nameserver is running. And in Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop there is, by default, a local nameserver running, namely, a <code>dnsmasq</code> process controlled by NetworkManager which listens on <code>127.0.0.1</code>. In Ubuntu 12.10 the listen address has been changed to <code>127.0.1.1</code>.</p>

<p>So the solution is not to make any changes to <code>resolv.conf</code>. It is correct, assuming that the questioner wants to use the local nameserver.</p>

<p>If name service is not working then the local nameserver is not being given correct forwarding addresses, or there is some other networking problem.</p>

<p>The questioner tried using the ""network settings GUI"" to ""generate the file with the right settings"" and this failed to work. I don't know exactly what this means, but here is the right way to enter nameserver addresses so that they end up in <code>resolv.conf</code> at the right time. I assume that the questioner is using <code>NetworkManager</code> and not <code>ifup</code> to configure interfaces. </p>

<p>Most often interfaces are configured using the DHCP protocol. In that case nothing needs to be configured on the local system. The DHCP server knows what nameserver address its clients should use and sends this information to the DHCP client, which sends it to NetworkManager, which sends it to resolvconf, which puts the information into <code>resolv.conf</code>. So in this case it is the DHCP server that may need to be configured.</p>

<p>If the network interface on the local machine is statically configured then the correct nameserver addresses have to be entered into NetworkManager at, for example, network indicator | Edit Connections... | Wireless | myconnection | Edit... | IPv4 Settings | Additional DNS servers.</p>

<p>It is possible that the local nameserver is not working properly. In that case the questioner should edit <code>/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo gedit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
</code></pre>

<p>and comment out the line</p>

<pre><code>dns=dnsmasq
</code></pre>

<p>in the ""[main]"" section. To comment out the line, put a <code>#</code> at the beginning of the line, then save the file. Then restart network-manager.</p>

<pre><code>sudo restart network-manager
</code></pre>

<p>After this, non-local nameserver addresses will be entered into <code>resolv.conf</code> instead of the 127.* address.</p>

<p>If the questioner is using <code>ifup</code> rather than NetworkManager to configure network interfaces then <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/201614/127327"">jmartin2279's answer</a> is correct: you have to add the nameserver addresses to /etc/network/interfaces in the way jmartin2279 described.</p>

<p>Contrary to what some other answers advise, in general you should <em>not</em> add <code>nameserver</code>, <code>domain</code> or <code>search</code> options to files in <code>/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/</code>. See my comments on those answers.</p>

"How do I safely change grub2 screen resolution?","140616","","<p>I did a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.04 on a HP 550 Notebook. But grub2 isn't really fit in the best screen resolution that this Notebook can support (1280x800). </p>

<p>How can I do this without using a third party application ? </p>
","<p>To do this safely requires two steps.</p>

<h2>Step 1: find the preferred mode</h2>

<p>Reboot and press and hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to display your grub.  Press <code>C</code> to enter console mode. Then type: </p>

<pre><code>$ vbeinfo
</code></pre>

<p>This will display various stuff how grub recognizes your display.  At the bottom is ""preferred mode"" - in your case it should say 1280x800.  Note down the value. </p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</strong> sometimes, some buggy video cards incorrectly give Grub the wrong preferred resolution - if the preferred mode is much higher than you were expecting, then select the nearest mode in the list displayed that you were expecting.</em></p>

<p>Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to return to grub and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to boot.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Setting the resolution in grub</h2>

<p>Reach for your terminal and type</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo nano /etc/default/grub
</code></pre>

<p>find the line</p>

<pre><code>#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480
</code></pre>

<p>remove the <code>#</code> and change <code>640x480</code> with the preferred mode you wrote down. E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>GRUB_GFXMODE=1280x800
</code></pre>

<p>save, then type</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo update-grub
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>Note:</strong> the preferred mode has to be among those listed by vbeinfo.  For example, if your preferred mode is 1920x1080 (a common 16x9 aspect ratio setting), your preferred mode is NOT supported by vbeinfo and may not work correctly.  In fact, there do not seem to be any 16x9 modes supported by vbeinfo, as of Ubuntu 13.04. In that case you could try falling back to something common like 640x480, which, it seems most monitors support and vbeinfo supports.  Also, not all the modes supported by vbeinfo are necessarily supported by your monitor and you may have to experiment.</em></p>

then reboot into Windows twice. The usage of the /f parameter is very
important! If the device is a SoftRAID/FakeRAID then first activate
it and mount a different device under the /dev/mapper/ directory, (e.g.
/dev/mapper/nvidia_eahaabcc1). Please see the 'dmraid' documentation

</ul>
","<h2>Firefox Developer Edition</h2>

<hr>

<p>The Firefox Developer Edition is a modified version of Firefox, specifically designed for web developers. It uses a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Developer_Edition#A_separate_profile"" rel=""noreferrer"">separate profile</a> than the regular version of Firefox. Meaning you can have both Firefox or F-beta, installed next to the developer edition. Note that your F.D.E. will be a completely UN-customized browser. To unify settings, you can use <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-set-up-firefox-sync"" rel=""noreferrer"">Firefox sync</a>.</p>

<p>Here's one of many perks when using F.D.E:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""By using the Developer Edition, you gain access to tools and platform features at least 12 weeks before they reach the main Firefox release channel."" - <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Developer_Edition#The_latest_Firefox_features"" rel=""noreferrer"">Developer Edition - Mozilla | MDN#The_latest_Firefox_features</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<hr>

<p>There are currently three ways to do this, manually, PPA or via <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-make"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ubuntu Make</a>.</p>

<h2>Manually</h2>

<hr>

<p>Download from <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mozilla Firefox Developer Edition webpage</a>. Extract it with <code>file-roller</code> and move the folder to its final location. A good practice is to install it in <code>/opt/</code> or <code>/usr/local/</code>.</p>

<p>Once you moved the files to their final location (say <code>/opt/firefox_dev/</code>), you can create the following file <code>~/.local/share/applications/firefox_dev.desktop</code> to get a launcher with an icon distinct from normal Firefox. </p>

<pre><code>[Desktop Entry]
Name=Firefox Developer 
GenericName=Firefox Developer Edition
Exec=/opt/firefox_dev/firefox
Terminal=false
Icon=/opt/firefox_dev/browser/icons/mozicon128.png
Type=Application
Categories=Application;Network;X-Developer;
Comment=Firefox Developer Edition Web Browser.
</code></pre>

<p>To launch it, search for <code>Firefox Developer</code>, and simply run the <code>firefox</code> binary, and voilà.</p>

<p>Note that, when you install manually, the F.D.E. does not have the unity global menu by default.  </p>

<h2>PPA</h2>

<hr>

<p>Firefox for developers currently resides in <a href=""https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mozilla-daily/+archive/ubuntu/firefox-aurora"" rel=""noreferrer"">Firefox Aurora builds : “Ubuntu Mozilla Daily Build Team” team</a>. It should be noted that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Firefox Developer Edition replaces the Aurora channel in the <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Release_Process"" rel=""noreferrer"">Firefox Release Process</a>. Like Aurora, features will land in the Developer Edition every six weeks, after they have stabilized in Nightly builds."" - <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Developer_Edition#The_latest_Firefox_features"" rel=""noreferrer"">Developer Edition - Mozilla | MDN #The_latest_Firefox_features</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Version 35.0a2, first offered to Firefox Developer Edition users on November 10, 2014"" - <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/35.0a2/auroranotes/#main-content"" rel=""noreferrer"">Firefox — Aurora Notes (35.0a2) — Mozilla#main-content</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Install the Firefox Developer Edition, formerly know as Aurora, like so:</p>

<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-mozilla-daily/firefox-aurora
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install firefox
</code></pre>

<p>The Mozilla PPA only holds packages for the supported Ubuntu releases, not EOL(End Of Life) releases.</p>

<p>Note that installing with the aforementioned ppa, will result in your current Firefox installation being replaced!</p>

<h2>Ubuntu Make</h2>

<p>This method has been provided by <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/584704/36315"">Jorge Castro</a>. I am adding this here, because it's also an excellent way to install the Firefox Developer Edition(and many others dev tools).</p>

<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-desktop/ubuntu-make
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-make
</code></pre>

<p>After you have installed ubuntu-make, tell it to install the <code>web</code> tool <code>firefox-dev</code>.</p>

<pre><code>umake web firefox-dev
</code></pre>

<h2>Uninstall</h2>

<hr>

<p>If you wish to keep the Current default Firefox, because The FDE has no new features you like, or for whatever reason, here are a few ways to uninstall it.</p>

<h3>PPA</h3>

<hr>

<p>You can remove the ppa, and its packages, using ppa-purge.</p>

<p>Install it like so:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ppa-purge
</code></pre>

<p>The following will remove the PPA, and its packages:</p>

<pre><code>sudo ppa-purge ppa:ubuntu-mozilla-daily/firefox-aurora
</code></pre>

<h3>Manually</h3>

<hr>

<p>remove the binaries with the <code>rm</code> command(rename the path to the location you actually extracted FDE). Or with your file-manager:</p>

<pre><code>sudo rm -r /opt/firefox_dev/
</code></pre>

<p>Also remove the <code>firefox_dev.desktop</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo rm ~/.local/share/applications/firefox_dev.desktop
</code></pre>

<p>After that you have successfully removed the Firefox Developer Edition.</p>

<h2>Ubuntu Make</h2>

<p>the following command will remove Firefox Developer Edition:</p>

<pre><code>umake web firefox-dev -r
</code></pre>

<p>You can also remove umake and its PPA (<code>ppa-purge</code> needed, see installation instructions above):</p>

<pre><code>sudo ppa-purge ppa:ubuntu-desktop/ubuntu-make
</code></pre>

","<p>Apt doesn't support it directly, but there are ways to do it.</p>

<p>One is to use <code>schroot</code> to create a non-root chroot.

<pre><code>apt-get download package

<p>Replace <code>package</code> with the name of the package</p>

<p>The disadvantage to using dpkg like this is that error messages are likely to be cryptic; dpkg doesn't automatically resolve dependencies or create the directory structure it expects.</p>

<p>Finally, you could use the <code>apt-get source</code> command to fetch the source of the package and configure it to install locally. Usually this looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>apt-get source package
cd package
./configure --prefix=$HOME
make
make install

<p>The disadvantage to this approach is that you need the development environment available for this approach to work at all, and you might find yourself compiling dozens of packages in order to resolve all the dependencies.</p>

"Permissions issue: how can Apache access files in my Home directory?","139524","","<p>I know file permissions have been covered on here before, but im struggling to get my head around the concept for my scenario. </p>

<p>When i attempt to run the files again, same problem: 500 error due to permissions problems. Can anyone tell me what other steps i should take?</p>

<p>The webroot for my apache installation is inside my home folder. If i create new files in my webroot, they also work as expected, its only the old files that are causing the problem.</p>
","<p>The directories above your webroot should have the execute bit set to allow Apache descend into the directories.</p>

<p>If you have your webroot located at <code>/home/user/htdocs</code>, the <code>/</code>, <code>/home</code>, <code>/home/user</code> and <code>/home/user/htdocs</code> should have the execute bit set.</p>

<p>The above solution ""works"", but it's not ideal. If you've created a folder, Apache cannot write to it. The reverse happens too.</p>

<p>This can be ""fixed"" by setting umask 0007 and adding yourself to the Apache group (www-data if I'm not mistaken), so that newly created files and folders are writeable by the group.</p>

"How do I setup an Icecast server for broadcasting audio in my network?","139485","","<p>Broadcasting the output of the soundcard as an internet radio stream is a reliable way to stream audio in a network. This can nicely be used to e.g. transmit audio in a wireless LAN to another computer or any other device capable of playing internet radio streams.</p>

<p>However I did not find an easy step by step guide on how to set this up.</p>
","<h1>Broadcast audio with Icecast2</h1>

<hr>

<h2>1. Install <a href=""http://packages.ubuntu.com/icecast2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Icecast2</a> <a href=""http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/icecast2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/ceZqJ.png"" alt=""Install icecast2""></a></h2>

<hr>

<h2>2. Edit Icecast2 configuration</h2>

<p>Open the file <code>/etc/icecast2/icecast.xml</code> as root in an editor. For security reasons you should setup passwords in the <code>&lt;authentication&gt;</code> section:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;admin-user&gt;admin&lt;/admin-user&gt;
&lt;admin-password&gt;hackme&lt;/admin-password&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>If you changed the <code>&lt;source-password&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;relay-password&gt;</code> you need to do so on the source or relay side as well. That means leave it default or change it in the ices2.xml file (see below) as well. The same will need to be done in the Ices or Darkice configuration files.</p>

<p>You also need to define the hostname where your stream can be reached:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;hostname&gt;localhost&lt;/hostname&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Leave it as <em>localhost</em> (no need to give a resolved IP there) when you only want to stream in your local network. The default port to listen to is 8000. Change it only when needed.</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Edit defaults</h2>

<p>Open the <code>/etc/default/icecast2</code> file as root in an editor. The last line needs to be changed to </p>

<pre><code>ENABLE=true
</code></pre>

<p>That's all for Icecast2. Of course there are many more settings you can play with. In the configurations files there are explanatory notes on parameters.</p>

<h2>4. Start/Stop Icecast</h2>

<p>The server is started and stopped by the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>/etc/init.d/icecast2 start
/etc/init.d/icecast2 stop
</code></pre>

<p>While running the Icecast server can be administrated from any browser at <code>http://localhost:8000/admin/</code> after entering your administrator credentials  defined in step 1. Further documentation is available from <a href=""http://icecast.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Icecast.org</a>. </p>

<p><a href=""https://launchpad.net/stream2ip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stream2ip</a> is a graphical frontend to quickly start and stop streams where a basic setup for Ices2, Ices or Darkice has already been done.</p>

<h2><a href=""http://packages.ubuntu.com/ices2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ices2</a> <a href=""http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/ices2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/ceZqJ.png"" alt=""Install ices2""></a> for streaming OGG Vorbis audio from a local soundcard</h2>

<p>To set up of pulseaudio to enable recording from the soundcard see note for Darkice below.</p>

<h3>Make directories for Ices2</h3>

<pre><code>mkdir /var/log/ices   # in case you need logfiles.  
mkdir /etc/ices2      # for putting ices stuff in.  
</code></pre>

<h3>Edit the Ices2 configuration .xml</h3>

<p>Ices2 will run using an .xml file for settings. Verbous examples of configurations can be found in <code>/usr/share/doc/ices2/examples/</code>. These files need to be edited to meet your needs and can be copied anywhere, best in your home directory. Depending on the configuration file Ices2 uses a playlist in <strong>Ogg Vorbis</strong> format (<code>ices-playlist.xml</code>) or the output from your soundcard (<code>ices-alsa.xml</code>) as streaming source for Icecast2.</p>

<p>In the section <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> you may need to replace the device if you have setup your sound system to PulseAudio. To do this edit the corresponding line to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;param name=""device""&gt;pulse&lt;/param&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The name of the stream for the receiving client is defined in the following section.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;mount&gt;/example1.ogg&lt;/mount&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Start Streaming</h3>

<p>Streams from your soundcard will be started by first running the Icecast2 server, and then running Ices2 using the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>/etc/init.d/icecast2 start
ices2 /home/user/somewhere/ices-pulse.xml # or any other name from .xml file
</code></pre>

<h3>Setup Receiver</h3>

<p>On the receiver side your radio ""station"" tunes on: <code>&lt;serverIP&gt;:8000/example1.ogg</code> where <code>&lt;serverIP&gt;</code> is the IP of your streaming server followed by the port you defined in the icecast.xml file (default 8000).</p>

<h3>Terminate Streaming</h3>

<p>Streams are terminated by killing Ices2 and/or stop running the Icecast2 server:</p>

<pre><code>killall ices2
/etc/init.d/icecast2 stop
</code></pre>

<h2><a href=""http://www.icecast.org/ices.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ices</a> for broadcasting mp3 playlists</h2>

<p>Broadcasting a playlist containing <strong>mp3 files</strong> can not be done with Ices2. We need to install <strong>IceS</strong>, which we have to <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/123077/installing-applications-from-source"">install from source</a>.</p>

<p>After having set up the configuration file with server address, password and streaming properties (well documented example will be found in <code>/usr/share/doc/ices/examples</code>) we can stream mp3 audio files from playlists (e.g. in .m3u format) over an Icecast2 server by:</p>

<pre><code>/etc/init.d/icecast2 start
ices -c &lt;path_to_config_file&gt; -F &lt;path_to_playlist&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For further options read the documentation in the quite elaborate man page from <code>man ices</code>.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a href=""http://packages.ubuntu.com/darkice"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Darkice</a> <a href=""http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/darkice"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/ceZqJ.png"" alt=""Install darkice""></a> for live streaming</h2>

<p>We can stream the output of the local sound card as OGG Vorbis or as mp3 stream using <strong>Darkice</strong>. To enable streaming of the local soundcard we may need to define the recording device for Darkice in pulseaudio first. This can be done with <a href=""http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/pavucontrol"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pavucontrol</a> <a href=""http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/pavucontrol"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://hostmar.co/software-small"" alt=""Install pavucontrol""></a>. In the <em>Recording</em> tab choose <code>Monitor of &lt;your soundcard&gt;</code> for the <em>""ALSA plug-in [darkice]""</em>.</p>

<p>The configuration file (well documented example given in <code>/usr/share/doc/darkice/examples</code>) needs to be adapted to the Icecast server and the local sound environment:</p>

<pre><code>[general]
duration        = 0      # duration in s, 0 forever
bufferSecs      = 1      # buffer, in seconds
reconnect       = yes    # reconnect if disconnected

[input]
device          = default # or `pulse' for Pulseaudio
sampleRate      = 44100   # sample rate 11025, 22050 or 44100
bitsPerSample   = 16      # bits
channel         = 2       # 2 = stereo

[icecast2-0]
bitrateMode     = vbr       # variable bit rate (`cbr' constant, `abr' average)
quality         = 1.0       # 1.0 is best quality
format          = mp3       # format. Choose `vorbis' for OGG Vorbis
bitrate         = 256       # bitrate
server          = localhost # or IP
port            = 8000      # port for IceCast2 access
password        = hackme    # source password to the IceCast2 server
mountPoint      = mystream.mp3  # mount point on the IceCast2 server .mp3 or .ogg
name            = mystream
</code></pre>

<p>After saving this configuration (e.g. in <code>~/music/darkice.cfg</code>) we first run the Icecast server and are then able to stream pulseaudio output from the local sound card by invoking:</p>

<pre><code>/etc/init.d/icecast2 start
darkice -c ~/music/darkice.cfg
</code></pre>

<p>On the receiver we tune to <code>http://&lt;localhost&gt;:8000/mystream.mp3</code> for listening. <code>&lt;localhost&gt;</code> is the IP of the Icecast server.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Augment the default search path for module files. [...]</p>
  
  <p>The default search path is installation dependent, but generally begins with <code>prefix/lib/pythonversion</code> (see <code>PYTHONHOME</code> above). It is <em>always</em> appended to <code>PYTHONPATH</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>meaning that some values exist in <code>PYTHONPATH</code> and the default search path is also only appended.</p>

<p>Additionally, <a href=""http://www.stereoplex.com/blog/understanding-imports-and-pythonpath"">this blog post</a> (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20141113112849/http://www.stereoplex.com/blog/understanding-imports-and-pythonpath"">Archive.org link</a>) also explains clearly why you need to append to <code>PYTHONPATH</code> and not overwrite it.

<p>This command line tool is already installed from the core utilities in Ubuntu to securely erase and overwrite single files using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutmann_method"" rel=""noreferrer"">Gutman method</a>.</p>

<h3>Fast shredding</h3>

<pre><code>shred -vzn 0 /dev/sdc1
</code></pre>

<p>erases whole partitions by overwriting everything with <code>0</code>s in a single iteration. If no legal aspects require another procedure, doing so is most probably safe to securely delete your private data <sup><a href=""http://www.springerlink.com/content/408263ql11460147/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Craig Wright Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2008, <strong>5352</strong>, 243-257</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Secure shredding</h3>

<pre><code>shred -vzn 3 /dev/sdc1
</code></pre>

<p>erases the whole partition using 3 iterations with random numbers. In addition (option <code>-z</code>) this writes zeros to hide the shredding process at the end. This will take 4 times longer than the fast method.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> By shredding a partition we will overwrite this partition with <code>0</code> or random numbers. It therefore efficiently deletes everything including file system caches on that partition forever. This can also be used to remove unwanted remnants of deleted files. <strong>Files we want to keep will have to be backed up before shredding.</strong></p>

<li><p>Erasing data on a solid state disk (SSD) can if at all only be done by overwriting <strong>the whole drive</strong> (not only single partitions) with several iterations. Some SSDs may have an inbuilt feature to erase data but this may not always be efficient (see <a href=""http://www.usenix.org/events/fast11/tech/full_papers/Wei.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">this link</a> from comment).

"How do I quickly encrypt a file with AES?","139072","","<p>I want to encrypt a file using AES-256. How can I do that quickly and easily, and how can I - or someone else -decrypt it again?</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, there is no easy solution to securing your stuff. Think about your use-case, maybe something other than plain AES is better suited.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a password manager like <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/32164/what-does-a-keyring-do"">Keyring for passwords</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedHome"" rel=""noreferrer"">Encrypt your home directory</a> (very easy to do with the Ubuntu installer)</li>

<li><a href=""https://crypto.cat/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Use Cryptocat</a> for secure chat</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>If you want very simple platform independent encryption, you can use <strong>openssl</strong>.</p>

<h3>Please note: You can use this to hide birthday-gift-ideas.txt from your roommate, but don't expect it to be secure against a determined attacker!</h3>

<ol>
<li>As was pointed out in the comments, this method uses a naive key derivation function, so your password needs to be superlatively good in order for you to have a chance of being secure.</li>
<li>Additionally, this method doesn't authenticate the ciphertext, which means an attacker can modify or corrupt the contents without you noticing.</li>
<li>For many types of security, encryption is simply not enough (e.g. you can't just use encryption to communicate securely)</li>
</ol>

<p>If you still want to use openssl:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Encryption:</p>

<p><code>openssl aes-256-cbc -in attack-plan.txt -out message.enc</code></p></li>
<li><p>Decryption:</p>

<p><code>openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in message.enc -out plain-text.txt</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can get openssl to <code>base64</code>-encode the message by using the <code>-a</code> switch on both encryption and decryption. This way, you can paste the ciphertext in an email message, for example. It'll look like this:</p>

<pre><code>stefano:~$ openssl aes-256-cbc -in attack-plan.txt -a
enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:
Verifying - enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:
U2FsdGVkX192dXI7yHGs/4Ed+xEC3ejXFINKO6Hufnc=
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you have a choice of ciphers and modes of operation. For normal use, I recommend aes 256 in CBC mode. These are the ciphers modes you have available (only counting AES):</p>

<pre><code>aes-128-cbc ← this is okay
aes-128-ecb
aes-192-cbc
aes-192-ecb
aes-256-cbc ← this is recommended
aes-256-ecb
</code></pre>

</ul>

<p>Please note:</p>

<p>OpenSSL will ask you for a password. This is not an encryption key, it is not limited to 32 bytes! If you're going to transfer files with someone else, your shared secret should be very strong. You can use this site to get a sense of how good your password is:</p>

<p>It's obviously a fuzzier search but handy if you're not sure which package you're looking for.</p>

<h2>For manually installed things...</h2>

<p>A bit harder but if they're on the current path, you could just run them. That's a bit of mission so I'd rather just run:</p>

<p>That depends on the sanity of user. There's nothing to stop somebody installing something called <code>chromium-browser</code> that isn't Chromium. They could even package it up incorrectly and install that. Neither method can be 100% certain.</p>

"How to check the process is already running or not","138902","","<p>I want to check the particular process in already running or not.</p>

<p>But I didn't get any specific solution. Following is the example that I tried:
I have created <code>abc.sh</code> file and run this script on background, like <code>sh abc.sh &amp;</code>.</p>

<p>Now this file is running on background and I fire the <code>ps aux | grep ""abc""</code> command. </p>

<p>Following is the output of this command:</p>

<pre><code>prakash     3594  0.0  0.0   4388   820 pts/0    S+   16:44   0:00 grep --color=auto abc
</code></pre>

<p>After that I stop the <code>abc.sh</code> running script and fire the same command <code>ps aux | grep ""abc""</code> command.</p>

<p>But I am getting same output like: </p>

<pre><code>prakash     3594  0.0  0.0   4388   820 pts/0    S+   16:44   0:00 grep --color=auto abc
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any other way to find the process is running or not?</p>
","<p>Every process will be listed in the output of <code>ps aux</code>; whether running, sleeping, zombie or stopped.</p>

<p>However, in your case, since you ran the process using <code>sh abc.sh</code>, <code>sh</code> is the application(shell) that is running and not <code>abc.sh</code>. Hence, <code>ps aux</code> will not contain the process <code>abc.sh</code> because of which <code>grep</code> could not yield any result.</p>

<p>So, the correct way you should have used it is as:</p>

<pre><code>ps aux | grep sh
</code></pre>

<p>This may also return you other process that are running having the string <code>sh</code> anywhere in their output of <code>ps aux</code>.</p>

<p>You should note that the process will be ""running"" when the output of <code>ps aux</code> has its <code>STAT</code> as <code>R</code>. If it is something other than that, it is not running at the instance you fired the command to check the running processes. The different process states can be found in the man page for ps:</p>

<pre><code>D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
R    running or runnable (on run queue)
S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
T    stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced
W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
X    dead (should never be seen)
Z    defunct (""zombie"") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent
</code></pre>

<p>You could as well run the <code>top</code> command to check if the process is running or sleeping and the amount of CPU, RAM it is consuming. (This will again list your process as <code>sh</code>).</p>

<p>However, if you do want your process to be listed as <code>abc.sh</code>, then you should have the first line of the script you are running as:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
</code></pre>

<p>so that the shell will know what application to use to run the script(sh in this case, change it to <code>#!/bin/bash</code> for bash) and then provide executable permissions to the process using:</p>

<pre><code>chmod +x /path/to/abc.sh
</code></pre>

<p>replacing <code>/path/to/</code> with the location of the <code>abc.sh</code> file and then run <code>abc.sh</code> using</p>

<pre><code>/path/to/abc.sh
</code></pre>

"32-Bit UEFI Boot Support","138900","","<p>I recently purchased a Dell Venue 8 Pro.  I have read online about what it needs in order to boot into Ubuntu or any other Linux distro.  From what I have gathered, what really needs to happen is <strong>32-bit UEFI support.</strong>  I got information from several sites, but where it was really summed up was in this previous post:</p>

<p><a href=""http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2187204"">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2187204</a></p>

<p><em>""Ubuntu has no 32-Bit Uefi installer, ask them to add support, they may listen.""</em></p>

<p>That thread was specifically about getting the Dell Venue 8/11 Pro to boot Linux.  However, there are a slew of new tablets coming out running 32-bit UEFI, and I think this is a trend that is going to continue to grow:</p>

<p>mjg59.dreamwidth.org/26734.html</p>

<p><em>""UEFI on IA32 isn't going away. It will show up on more embedded systems as time goes on.""</em></p>

<p>Others have tried this before with mixed success, but haven't gotten things to work quite right:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.happyassassin.net/2013/11/24/the-fedlet-revived-or-fedora-linux-on-a-dell-venue-8-pro-bay-trail/"">https://www.happyassassin.net/2013/11/24/the-fedlet-revived-or-fedora-linux-on-a-dell-venue-8-pro-bay-trail/</a></p>

<p><em>""It doesn’t really work. But it’s interestingly close.""</em></p>

<p>I'm trying to start a thread dedicated thread on 32-Bit UEFI support, because that is the piece that is missing (from what I understand).  I don't really know how to work with this stuff, but I'm hoping that some people who do will read this and either contact canonical or somehow patch Ubuntu (or any other distro, really) to work this way.  Again, I don't really know how to do any of this...I'm just hoping someone can help!</p>

<p>Dell Venue 8, 11 Pro, Toshiba Encore, Acer w3, w4, Lenovo miix, and the asus transformer a100 are all tablets that will be affected by this...I think these are going to be incredibly popular tablets once their prices go down, and I think people are really going to get interested in putting linux on these.  Any help is appreciated, and thank you all so much!</p>

<p>EDIT 4/1/14:  Just booted into Ubuntu on my DV8Pro!  All you have to do is follow the instructions here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.jfwhome.com/2014/03/07/perfect-ubuntu-or-other-linux-on-the-asus-transformer-book-t100/"">http://www.jfwhome.com/2014/03/07/perfect-ubuntu-or-other-linux-on-the-asus-transformer-book-t100/</a></p>

<p>To summarize, what you need to do is download the latest Ubuntu 14 daily build (AMD 64 is what worked for me) and put that on a USB drive via Rufus.  'For “Partition scheme and target system type”, choose “GPT partition scheme for UEFI computer.”' You can get the latest daily build here:
<a href=""http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/"">http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/</a></p>

<p>You will need to put the file found below into your EFI/Boot directory:
<a href=""https://github.com/jfwells/linux-asus-t100ta/raw/master/boot/bootia32.efi"">https://github.com/jfwells/linux-asus-t100ta/raw/master/boot/bootia32.efi</a></p>

<p>Disable Secureboot and such--follow the original instructions link if you don't know how.  Then set the USB to boot first in BIOS.  This should get you to GRUB.</p>

<p>The rest I'll quote the original author, it's real straightforward:</p>

<p>In the GRUB menu, highlight “Try Ubuntu”, and press “e” to edit it. In the editing screen, scroll down to the command line options, where it says “quiet splash”. Delete “splash” and replace it with:
video=VGA-1:1368x768e reboot=pci,force
[EDIT: For those of us using the Dell Venue 8 Pro, you need to use this line instead:
video=VGA-1:800x1280e reboot=pci,force
That accounts for the different resolution of screen.]</p>

<p>Then press F10 to boot. You should get all the way to the Desktop.</p>

<p>There you have it!  This got me to the Unity Desktop.  Problems:  Wifi is not working, but I used an Ethernet adapter and that seems to work.</p>

<p>I tried rotating the screen, but it throws your touch input off to one side, so I left it.  </p>

<p>Make sure to read the tutorial mentioned earlier, it is more comprehensive, even though it is made for the ASUS T100.  If nothing else, the instructions I have provided should be enough just to get you to the Unity Desktop, which for me was amazing!  Hope you too can have the same success and keep building on it!</p>

<p>For what it's worth, someone else did this and posted a youtube video here:
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WrRngZ4giE#t=94"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WrRngZ4giE#t=94</a></p>
","<p>Ubuntu 15.10 supports 32-bit EFI. The 32-bit version will, in fact, automatically install a 32-bit EFI bootloader. Unfortunately, Canonical doesn't offer a bootable 32-bit ISO that has an EFI bootloader in the DVD image. So, we must create the install disk ourselves.</p>

<p>Other instructions try getting 64-bit Ubuntu to run and install. This probably comes from a misconception that EFI requires a 64-bit OS. This is false. In fact, the bitness of the EFI is meant to be tied to the bitness of the OS. Most PCs are designed for 64-bit OSes and therefore have 64-bit EFIs. However, cheap PCs designed for a 32-bit OS have 32-bit EFI.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, however, that Ubuntu (or rather, its Linux kernel) doesn't fully support the hardware in the systems which typically ship with 32-bit EFI BIOSes (cheap Intel Atom SoCs). WiFi, sound, and power management often do not work. Patched third-party kernels that fix some of the issues do exist, such as those <a href=""https://plus.google.com/communities/117853703024346186936"">made available here</a>.</p>

<li><p>Format your USB disk as FAT and mount it</p>

<ul>
<li>In Gnome Disks, select the USB drive in the left list, go to the ""Hamburger Menu"" in the upper-right corner, choose Format Disk, select MSR/DOS partitioning, and Format. Then click '+' and accept defaults which should create a FAT partition. Finally, click the ""play"" triangle to mount it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Extract installation files from the Ubuntu 32-bit ISO while copying the contents of the symlinks

<ul>
<li>In Gnome Disks, open the Disks menu (up where File and Edit normally are), choose Attach Disk Image, select ubuntu-15.10-desktop-i386.iso, and mount the biggest partition.</li>
<li>In Terminal, <code>rsync -rL --exclude=/ubuntu &lt;path to Ubuntu 32-bit install disk&gt;/ &lt;path to usb disk&gt;/</code>

<ul>
<li>Replace <code>&lt;placeholders&gt;</code> with the correct paths</li>
<li>Don't forget the slash at the end of the source path</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Copy /boot and /EFI directories from an Ubuntu 64-bit ISO

<ul>
<li>Mount the iso</li>
<li><code>rsync -r &lt;path to Ubuntu 64-bit install disk&gt;/boot/ &lt;path to usb disk&gt;/boot/</code></li>

<li><code>rsync -r &lt;path to Debian multi-arch install disk&gt;/boot/grub/i386-efi &lt;path to usb disk&gt;/boot/grub/</code>

<ul>
<li>Watch those slashes (this time the source doesn't end in a slash)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rename vmlinuz to vmlinuz.efi

<ul>
<li><code>mv &lt;path to usb disk&gt;/casper/vmlinuz &lt;path to usb disk&gt;/casper/vmlinuz.efi</code></li>

"How to change mouse speed/sensitivity?","138274","","<p>I am on an Asus Zenbook UX32VD in Ubuntu 12.10. Both in 12.04 and 12.10 I haven't been able to change the mouse speed (i.e. the ""sensitivity"" in the mouse/touchpad dialog). I can change the slider, but nothing changes.</p>

<p>This is a big problem for me, since the mouse speed is somewhat slow. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>The problem is both for the touchpad and mouse.</p>
","<p>Open a terminal and run this command: </p>

<pre><code>xinput --list --short
</code></pre>

<p>output:</p>

<pre><code>abcd@abcd-abcde:~$ xinput --list --short

Virtual core pointer

↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]

↳ Logitech USB RECEIVER                     id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]
</code></pre>

<p>My pointing devices are a <code>Logitech USB RECEIVER</code> and a <code>Synaptics TouchPad</code>.
To list out device properties: </p>

<pre><code>xinput --list-props ""SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad""
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> </p>

<p>Another option:
<code>xinput --list-props 11</code> as <code>11</code> is the number that is shown above in its parent property (SynPS/2 Synaptic TouchPad).</p>

<p>Now reduce it's property values to suit your need:</p>

<pre><code>Device Accel Constant Deceleration (267):   2.500000
</code></pre>

<p>using this command:</p>

<pre><code>xinput --set-prop ""SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad"" ""Device Accel Constant Deceleration"" 1.5
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> </p>

<p>Another option:
    <code>xinput --set-prop 11 267 1.5</code>  <code>11</code> is the device, just like from above, <code>267</code> is the id of the device property (Device Accel Constant Decleration) as you can see when device <code>11</code> is being listed all of properties being attached, and finally <code>1.5</code> is your desired speed.</p>

<p>You may have to play around with this number a bit to set it exactly as you need.</p>

<p>If you need to set this value automatically every time Ubuntu starts then:</p>

<p>create a .sh file</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

xinput --set-prop ""SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad"" ""Device Accel Constant Deceleration"" 1.5
</code></pre>

<p>change the file to executable :</p>

<pre><code>chmod +x
</code></pre>

<p>and Put this in the start-up applications list. </p>

"What are zombie processes?","138106","","<p>With commands like <code>top</code> and the gui based <code>System Monitor</code> I can see that at the moment I have several zombie processes.</p>

<p>What are zombie processes?</p>

<p>Do they affect the performance of the system or the application they are zombie to. Do they use too much memory or any memory at all?</p>
","<p>Zombies are DEAD processes. They can not be 'kill' (You cannot kill the DEAD).  All processes eventually die, and when they do they become zombies.  They consume almost no resources, which is to be expected because they are dead!  The reason for zombies is so the zombie's parent (process) can retrieve the zombie's exit status and resource usage statistics.  The parent signals the operating system that it no longer needs the zombie by using one of the wait() system calls.</p>

<p>When a process dies, its child processes all become children of process number 1, which is the init process.  Init is ``always'' waiting for children to die, so that they don't remain as zombies.</p>

<p>If you have zombie processes it means those zombies have not been waited for by their parent (look at PPID displayed by <code>ps -l</code>).  You have three choices: Fix the parent process (make it wait); kill the parent; or live with it.  Remember that living with it is not so hard because zombies take up little more than one extra line in the output of ps.</p>

<p>Zombies can be identified in the output from the Unix ps command by the presence of a ""Z"" in the STAT column. Zombies that exist for more than a short period of time typically indicate a bug in the parent program. As with other leaks, the presence of a few zombies isn't worrisome in itself, but may indicate a problem that would grow serious under heavier loads.</p>

<p>To remove zombies from a system, the SIGCHLD signal can be sent to the parent manually, using the kill command. If the parent process still refuses to reap the zombie, the next step would be to remove the parent process. When a process loses its parent, init becomes its new parent. Init periodically executes the wait system call to reap any zombies with init as parent.</p>

<p>There are also <strong>orphan processes</strong> which are a computer process whose parent process has finished or terminated.</p>

<p>A process can become orphaned during remote invocation when the client process crashes after making a request of the server.</p>

<p>Orphans waste server resources and can potentially leave a server in trouble (This is the biggest resource difference between zombies and orphans (Except if you see some orphan zombie movie). However there are several solutions to the orphan process problem:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Extermination is the most commonly used technique; in this case the orphan process is killed.</p></li>
<li><p>Reincarnation is a technique in which machines periodically try to locate the parents of any remote computations; at which point orphaned processes are killed.</p></li>
<li><p>Expiration is a technique where each process is allotted a certain amount of time to finish before being killed. If need be a process may ""ask"" for more time to finish before the allotted time expires.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A process can also be orphaned running on the same machine as its parent process. In a UNIX-like operating system any orphaned process will be immediately adopted by the special ""init"" system process. This operation is called re-parenting and occurs automatically. Even though technically the process has the ""init"" process as its parent, it is still called an orphan process since the process which originally created it no longer exists.</p>

I also have a <strong>WiFi router connected to internet</strong> which both my computers can access.</p>

<p>I want to share files between my desktop and my laptop using WiFi <em>(similar to Homegroup on Windows 7 but without using Ethernet cables)</em>.  How do I set-up that?</p>

<p>I want to share files using both OSs, if anyone have have information about sharing files with any of the OS please answer!</p>
","<h1>Network Setup</h1>

<p>Connect both the desktop and laptop to the WiFi router using standard setup. To check that both computers are connected, test that you can get on the Internet from both computers.</p>

<p><em>Optional:</em> In the router setup, see the local IP addresses assigned to the desktop and the laptop. These may look like 192.168.0.100 or 192.168.1.199. If an option to assign these specific IP addresses permanently in the router exist, you can do that. </p>

<hr>

<h1>Windows → Ubuntu</h1>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> On the laptop create a folder you want to share. There may be a folder called ""Public"" choose that one if you want. Right click the folder icon and choose ""Sharing Options."" A new window will open up:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iVbYh.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Check the box ""Share this folder.""</p>

<p>You may also want to check the other two boxes ""Allow others to create and delete files in this folder."" This will allow you the desktop Windows user to create and delete files on this folder.</p>

<p>The ""Guest Access"" check box is self explanatory. This may be useful if your Windows userID is not exactly the same as your Ubuntu user ID.</p>

<p>It may tell you Sharing service is not installed:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/a6tqx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Click ""Install Service"" and let it install the software by providing the password for the laptop user account when it prompts. You may be prompted to install more software like <code>libpam-smbpass</code>. Install all the software. It will ask you to restart services and click Yes.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Open the property window of the ""Public"" folder, by right clicking on it. Go to the permissions tab and make sure it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0wZXq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Click on ""Change permissions of enclosed files"" button and make sure it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1gKPx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now you should be able to edit files created in ubuntu in the ""Public"" folder of the laptop in the Windows Explorer. </p>

<p>However, if you create a file in Windows and put it in the Public folder of the laptop you may not be able to open that file when you get to the laptop. This is because Windows and Ubuntu do not understand each other's file ownership and permissions. So in the Ubuntu laptop, the file created by Windows is owned by ""Nobody"". You will have to <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/156998/how-do-i-start-nautilus-as-root/868882#868882"">open Nautilus as an Administrator</a> and change the ownership and read-write permissions while in the laptop.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Go to the Windows on the desktop computer and open <strong>Windows Explorer</strong>, Click on the triangle next to <strong>Network</strong> on the left panel. From the drop-down list you should be able to <strong>select the name of the laptop computer running Ubuntu</strong>. </p>

<p>Now you should be able to see your shared folder (say ""Public"") from the laptop in the Windows Explorer. Click on ""Public"" folder and see the files in the folder. You should be able to copy files from the Public folder in Ubuntu to your Windows local folder. </p>

<p>Under Server Address Enter:</p>

<pre><code>sftp://laptop_user_id@laptop_name.local/home/laptop_user_id
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>laptop_user_id</code> is the user ID you created for on your laptop. You can find your user ID by typing <code>whoami</code> in a terminal. And <code>laptop_name</code> is the name you gave to the laptop when you installed Ubuntu.</p>

<p>If you want to share a partition in your second hard drive of the desktop, under Server Address Enter:</p>

<pre><code>sftp://desktop_user_id@desktop_name.local/path/to/the/mount/point/of/the/partition/in/second/hard/drive
</code></pre>

<p>Replace <code>path/to/.../drive</code> with the actual path. </p>

<p>Alternately, if you know the local IP address of your laptop you can replace <code>laptop_name.local</code> with the local IP address of the laptop. </p>

<p>Press <code>Connect</code>. You will see a password dialog box:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4kKb8.png"" alt=""Password for SSH""></p>

<p>Enter the password associated with laptop_user_id and select if you want the password is to be remembered or not. Again click <code>Connect</code>.</p>

<p>Now you should see your home folder of the laptop.</p>

<p>Notice there is a new entry under <strong>Network</strong> on the left panel of Nautilus that begins with <code>laptop_user_id</code>. Right click on it and choose ""Add Bookmark"" to create a permanent bookmark for your laptop's home folder in the Nautilus of the Desktop.</p>

","<p>All log files are located in <code>/var/log</code> directory. In that directory, there are specific files for each type of logs. For example, system logs, such as kernel activities are logged in <code>syslog</code> file.</p>

<p>Some of the most common log files in that directory is :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In directory <code>apt</code> there is a file <code>history.log</code> which saves all the package installation and removal information even the initial system build as Live CD. You can open this file to see this very interesting file.</p></li>
<li><p>In directory <code>dist-upgrade</code> there is a file <code>apt.log</code> which logs the information during distribution upgrades</p></li>
<li><p>In directory <code>installer</code> the log files which are created during installation can be found. </p></li>

<li><p>The file <code>auth.log</code> includes information about the authentication activities such as when you authenticate as root user via sudo.</p></li>
<li><p>The file <code>dpkg.log</code> saves the low level details of package installation and removal related with <code>dpkg</code>. You might be aware that the <code>apt</code> system depends on <code>dpkg</code> for package installation and removal.</p></li>
<li><p><code>boot.log</code> includes information of each booting. </p></li>
<li><p><code>kern.log</code> saves kernel information such as warnings, errors etc.</p></li>
<li><p><code>alternatives.log</code> includes the history of all the alternatives set by various packages and their removal via <code>update-alternatives</code> command.</p></li>
<li><p>Another important log file is <code>Xorg.log</code> which include information about the graphics driver, its failures, warnings etc.</p></li>

<p>Also, what is meant by the same?</p>

<p>I went through the following <em>Ask Ubuntu</em> questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/175104"">How do I install BCM43142 wireless drivers for Dell Vostro 3460/3560?</a></em></p></li>
<li><p><em><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/55868"">Installing Broadcom Wireless Drivers</a></em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The second one seems to be a very comprehensive summary of all possible ways... Still I am stuck up with this <code>Exec Format error</code>.</p>
","<p>OK, so I finally fixed this :D</p>

<p>First here's what I learnt in the process:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>NEVER ram your OS with different drivers or modules haphazardly until your problem gets fixed, <strong>at least not</strong> without a) Knowing what / why you are doing, and b) MOST IMPORTANTLY <em>How to undo the same.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Whenever you try a different driver, module, or package, <em>first uninstall the package that you previously installed for the same purpose</em>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And lots of thanks to @<a href=""https://askubuntu.com/users/19421/chili555"">chili555</a> who pointed out that the leftover from a previous package was the reason.</p>

<p>So what I did was:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I tried installing <code>bcmwl-kernel-source</code> on a live run of Ubuntu 14.04 (with my LAN cable) and checked if WLan works now. (And yeah, it did <strong>confirm that Ubuntu 14.04 / BCM43142 / <code>bcmwl-kernel-source</code> were not the problem</strong>.)</p></li>
<li><p>I went to <code>/etc/modprobe.d</code> and cross checked the files there with my hard disk installation's version of the same folder. </p></li>
<li><p>This <code>/etc/modprobe.d</code> directory contains configuration files which contain blacklisting information for different modules. I made a note of the available files and later removed what was not available here from my hard disk installation's version of the same folder too.</p></li>
<li><p>I went to <code>/lib/modules/3.*/updates/</code>. <strong>This</strong> is the directory that stores all your modules (wl, b43, etc. ... ) and the one that I messed up with various custom patched versions of wl modules listed in various forums.</p></li>
<li><p>After cross checking with my hard disk installation's version of <code>lib/modules/3.*/updates/</code>, I manually removed all Bluetooth / wireless / dkms / wl / (and in particular one mac80211) and cleaned up any other modules that are related to wlan.</p></li>
<li><p>I finally replaced (did a recursive copy <em>onto</em>) the <code>/etc/modprobe.d</code> and <code>/lib/modules/3.*/updates/</code> directories (of my hard disk installation) with the same directories from the live OS.</p></li>
<li><p>Reboot</p></li>
<li><p>Do <code>sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source</code>. This is the official working driver for BCM43142 for Ubuntu 14.04.</p></li>
<li><p>Reboot and <code>sudo modprobe wl</code> and viola, wireless was working!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And finally sincere apologies to all my cross-posting, reposting, spamming IRCs with this question repeatedly. :P</p>

<p>NOTE: Replacing /removing your hard disk installation files is recommended only for those who installed your OS recently. Otherwise there is a risk that you could replace / remove files / modules that may have been installed for other devices which may be irrelevant to this issue.</p>

<p>Thanks again to chili555 :)</p>

"What is the difference between /etc/init/ and /etc/init.d/?","137544","","<p>What is the difference between <code>/etc/init/</code> and <code>/etc/init.d/</code>? </p>

<p>More generally, what meaning does the <code>.d</code> suffix convey to a directory?</p>
","<p><code>/etc/init.d</code> contains scripts used by the System V init tools (SysVinit). This is the traditional service management package for Linux, containing the <code>init</code> program (the first process that is run when the kernel has finished initializing¹) as well as some infrastructure to start and stop services and configure them. Specifically, files in <code>/etc/init.d</code> are shell scripts that respond to <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, <code>restart</code>, and (when supported) <code>reload</code> commands to manage a particular service. These scripts can be invoked directly or (most commonly) via some other trigger (typically the presence of a symbolic link in <code>/etc/rc?.d/</code>).</p>

<p><code>/etc/init</code> contains configuration files used by Upstart. Upstart is a young service management package championed by Ubuntu. Files in <code>/etc/init</code> are configuration files telling Upstart how and when to <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, <code>reload</code> the configuration, or query the <code>status</code> of a service. As of lucid, Ubuntu is transitioning from SysVinit to Upstart, which explains why many services come with SysVinit scripts even though Upstart configuration files are preferred. In fact, the SysVinit scripts are processed by a compatibility layer in Upstart.</p>

<p><code>.d</code> in directory names typically indicates a directory containing many configuration files or scripts for a particular situation (e.g. <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d</code> contains files that are concatenated to make a virtual <code>sources.list</code>; <code>/etc/network/if-up.d</code> contains scripts that are executed when a network <strong>i</strong>nter<strong>f</strong>ace is activated). This structure is usually used when each entry in the directory is provided by a different source, so that each package can deposit its own plug-in without having to parse a single configuration file to reference itself. In this case, it just happens that “init” is a logical name for the directory, SysVinit came first and used <code>init.d</code>, and Upstart used plain <code>init</code> for a directory with a similar purpose (it would have been more “mainstream”, and perhaps less arrogant, if they'd used <code>/etc/upstart.d</code> instead).</p>

"What is the $DISPLAY environment variable?","137505","","<p>I am new to shell scripting. I don't understand what the <code>$DISPLAY</code> environmental variable is.</p>

<p>I have Ubuntu 13.10 and I use <code>/bin/bash</code> shell. I have two monitors.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Command <code>echo $DISPLAY</code> will print <code>:0.0</code> on my machine (on both monitors). What does this mean?</p></li>
<li><p>In which cases will the <code>$DISPLAY</code> variable be blank or NULL?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any articles or tutorials on this?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>The magic word in the X window system is DISPLAY. A display consists (simplified) of:</p>

<ul>
<li>a keyboard,</li>
<li>a mouse</li>
<li>and a screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>A display is managed by a server program, known as an X server. The server serves displaying capabilities to other programs that connect to it.</p>

<p>The remote server knows where it have to redirect the X network traffic via the definition of the DISPLAY environment variable which generally points to an X Display server located on your local computer.</p>

<p>The value of the display environment variable is:</p>

<pre><code>hostname:D.S
</code></pre>

<p>where:</p>

<p>hostname is the name of the computer where the X server runs. An omitted hostname means the localhost.</p>

<p>D is a sequence number (usually 0). It can be varied if there are multiple displays connected to one computer.</p>

<p>S is the screen number. A display can actually have multiple screens. Usually there's only one screen though where 0 is the default.</p>

<p>Example of values</p>

<pre><code>localhost:4
google.com:0
:0.0
</code></pre>

<p><code>hostname:D.S</code> means screen S on display D of host hostname; the X server for this display is listening at TCP port 6000+D.</p>

<p><code>host/unix:D.S</code> means screen S on display D of host host; the X server for this display is listening at UNIX domain socket /tmp/.X11-unix/XD (so it's only reachable from host).</p>

<p><code>:D.S</code> is equivalent to host/unix:D.S, where host is the local hostname.</p>

<p><strong>:0.0 means that we are talking about the first screen attached to your first display in your local host</strong></p>

<p>From a X(7) man page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From the user's perspective, every X server has a display name
  of the form:</p>
  
  <p>hostname:displaynumber.screennumber</p>
  
  <p>This information is used by the application to determine how it should
  connect to the server and which screen it should use by default (on
  displays with multiple monitors):</p>
  
  <p>hostname The hostname specifies the name of the machine to which the
  display is physically connected. If the hostname is not given, the
  most efficient way of communicating to a server on the same machine
  will be used.  displaynumber The phrase ""display"" is usually used to
  refer to collection of monitors that share a common keyboard and
  pointer (mouse, tablet, etc.). Most workstations tend to only have one
  keyboard, and therefore, only one display. Larger, multi-user systems,
  however, frequently have several displays so that more than one person
  can be doing graphics work at once. To avoid confusion, each display
  on a machine is assigned a display number (beginning at 0) when the X
  server for that display is started. The display number must always be
  given in a display name.  screennumber Some displays share a single
  keyboard and pointer among two or more monitors. Since each monitor
  has its own set of windows, each screen is assigned a screen number
  (beginning at 0) when the X server for that display is started. If the
  screen number is not given, screen 0 will be used.</p>

<p>If you wish to install XFCE in Ubuntu, install either xubuntu-desktop (for XFCE + Xubuntu branding + all Xubuntu default apps), or just xfce by itself if you don't want to end up with two sets of default apps.</p>

"How to increase swap space?","135650","","<p>I have, by default, 250MB of swap space in Ubuntu, and I want to expand it to a larger size. I need 800MB, which I think will be enough to open several applications without having to hit the current limit of swap. I hope someone can help me.</p>
","<h2>You can always create swap file</h2>

<p>to add more swap space. This is not same (in every aspect) as swap partition but it will be easy and dynamic.</p>

<p>Change <code>/media/fasthdd/swapfile.img</code> to anything you like, for example it can be <code>/swap.img</code> as well. <code>/media/fasthdd/swapfile.img</code> is just example filename, if you are using this one then of course there must be directory <code>/media/fasthdd/</code> with enough free space for your new swap file.</p>

<p>Use any of terminal applications to run commands. All command should be run <b><i>with root privileges</i></b>, to do this you can either add <code>sudo</code> to beginning of every command or run <code>sudo bash</code> before running commands.</p>

<p><b>1. Create empty file:</b><br/>This file will contain virtual memory contents so make file big enough for your needs. This one will create 1Gb file which means +1Gb swap space for your system: </p>

<pre><code>dd if=/dev/zero of=/media/fasthdd/swapfile.img bs=1024 count=1M
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to make 3Gb file then change count value to <code>count=3M</code>. See <code>man dd</code> for more information.</p>

<p><b>2. Bake swap file:</b><br/>Following command is going to make ""swap filesystem"" inside your fresh swap file.</p>

<pre><code>mkswap /media/fasthdd/swapfile.img
</code></pre>

<p><b>3. Bring up on boot:</b><br/>To make sure that your new swap space is activated while booting up computer you should add it to filesystem configuration file <code>/etc/fstab</code>. Add it to end of file, this is recommended because other filesystems (<i>at least one that contains swap file</i>) must be mounted in read-write mode before we can access any files.</p>

<pre><code># Add this line to /etc/fstab
/media/fasthdd/swapfile.img swap swap sw 0 0
</code></pre>

<p><b>4. Activate:</b><br/>You can either reboot your computer or activate new swap file by hand with following command:</p>

<pre><code>swapon /media/fasthdd/swapfile.img
</code></pre>

<p><hr/></p>

<h2>If everything goes well</h2>

<p>you should see that more swap space is available for use. You can use following commands to check your new swap and confirm that it is active:</p>

<pre><code>cat /proc/swaps
  Filename                           Type       Size    Used    Priority

<p>I'm a somewhat experienced noob on this Linux-thing. I'm growing quite familiar with Ubuntu and I just love Gnome(3+).</p>

<pre><code>sudo find / -name my.cnf
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Backup and remove <code>/etc/mysql/debian.cnf</code> files (not sure if needed, but just in case)</p>

<pre><code>sudo mv /etc/mysql/debian.cnf /etc/mysql/debian.cnf.bak
sudo apt purge mysql-server mysql-server-5.7 mysql-server-core-5.7
sudo apt install mysql-server
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>In case your syslog shows an error like ""mysqld: Can't read dir of '/etc/mysql/conf.d/'"" create a symbolic link:</p>

<pre><code>sudo ln -s /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d /etc/mysql/conf.d

"Do I need to have 'antivirus software' installed?","133940","","<p>I thought that there was no need to scan for viruses either in Ubuntu or any Linux distros until I found virus scanner packages '<code>clamtk</code>' and '<code>klamav</code>' in Ubuntu software center yesterday.</p>

<p>This leads to the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do viruses differ between Linux and Windows?</li>
<li>How do the strategies for protection differ between Linux and Windows?</li>
<li>Should a virus scanner package be installed on my system? If so, which would be a better option?</li>
</ul>
","<p>There are viruses for most all platforms (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm"">the first worm was for DEC VAX</a>) , they are just more common on Windows.  Different platforms are more secure than others, but a virus can typically gain user level security, which is often good enough, on most platforms.  You can actually run Windows without a virus scanner if you keep it patched and are really careful.</p>

<p><strong>Differences</strong> from Windows to Linux for viruses: On Linux it is harder for the virus to get root (or system) level access.  But it could probably still access your address book or saved passwords in Firefox (user level access).</p>

<p><strong>Strategy</strong>: If you are really careful and know what you are doing you can get away without a scanner.  A good strategy is to have your scanner just scan downloads or if you are bringing a file from another computer on a USB drive or floppy disk (assuming you have one).  If you want you can have it do regular full system scans too.  It is all about how paranoid you are, and how likely you are to get a virus.</p>

<p>For your <strong>laptop</strong> I would suggest only having the scanner scan downloads and when you are brining files from another computer.  Having it do full system scans can be a battery drain.  </p>

<p>A very important element of a virus scanner is having it <strong>updated with new signatures</strong>, so pick the package that has the best signature updates, and that works best for how you want to use it.</p>

","<p>Chromium 34 in the main repos have started using Aura (early), which does not include support for NPAPI (this is a planned phaseout of NPAPI in Chromium). Therefore, you need to use Pepper Flash to be able to use Flash.</p>

<h2>Installing Flash</h2>

<p>If you have Trusty, you can just run <code>sudo apt-get install pepperflashplugin-nonfree</code>.</p>

<h3>Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise) and newer</h3>

<p>If you don't have Trusty, you can use <a href=""https://launchpad.net/~skunk/+archive/pepper-flash"">this</a> PPA to install Pepper Flash for any supported Ubuntu version above Precise. Run the following commands to add the PPA and install Pepper Flash:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:skunk/pepper-flash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install pepflashplugin-installer
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you need to configure Chromium to use Pepper Flash. To do this, open <code>/etc/chromium-browser/default</code> and add the following line to the end of the file on a new line:</p>

<pre><code>. /usr/lib/pepflashplugin-installer/pepflashplayer.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Close all windows and re-open.</p>

<h2>Updating Pepper Flash (on Trusty)</h2>

<li>Users in a guest Ubuntu must be in the group <code>vboxsf</code> to be able to access shares.</li>
<li>Define a directory on the host that will be used in the virtual machine using the settings dialogue of Virtual Box.</li>
<li>Do not share personal folders like <code>/home/username</code> or <code>My Documents</code></li>
<li>avoid special characters or empty spaces in the path to the shared folder</li>
<li>use different names for share and mountpoint</li>
<li>create a mountpoint on the guest OS (best in your HOME directory).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Testing</strong> shared folders functionality can thus be done by creating a shared directory on the host (e.g. <code>C:\myshare</code>), define this as a shared folder for your guest system in Virtual Box settings (e.g. <code>share</code>), create a mount point in your guest os (e.g.  <code>mkdir /home/username/host</code>)and mount this in the guest OS with the command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 share /home/username/host

<p>where the option -o makes sure that you will have access to the mount (that will otherwise be owned by root).</p>

<p>For further information on shared folders see also the <a href=""http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sharedfolders"" rel=""noreferrer"">Virtual Box User Manual</a>.</p>

<p>I wouldn't recommend it. You probably could compile it but you wouldn't have any Ubuntu-compatible package repositories for it to handle.</p>

<p>You <em>can</em> convert single RPM files into DEBs with Alien:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install alien
sudo alien my_package.rpm
sudo dpkg -i my_package.deb
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It might change the filename a little more than just the extension.</p>

<p>This won't work for everything as packages link to other packages to fulfil dependencies. Obviously Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS use different package names to Ubuntu so you're likely going to run into a whole load of pain.</p>

<p>Chances are if a DEB doesn't exist, you'll be better off just getting the source and compiling it.</p>

"How can I change the icon of an application in the Unity launcher?","132971","","<p>I'm trying to change the icon of a specific application (Pidgin) in my Ubuntu 11.10 Unity launcher.

<p>I can change the theme but that's not what I want. </p>

<p>I am willing to edit configuration files to get this change. It doesn't have to be a UI solution.</p>
","<h2>For Ubuntu 11.10</h2>

<hr>

<p>The first thing you would need to do is take a .png icon file that you would like to use and copy it to the respective <code>~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/</code> directory. This will contain the following directories (which are the dimensions of the icons) : <code>16x16/apps/</code> <code>32x32/apps/</code> <code>48x48/apps/</code></p>

<p>I downloaded a free 16x16 free icon sampler and picked a 16x16 icon called <code>Alien.png</code></p>

<p>I took the <code>Alien.png</code> file and copied it to <code>~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/16x16/apps</code>, When you copy yours, you can do that through either the GUI or terminal.</p>

<p>From there you would need do the following in a terminal (you may need sudo to copy this over):</p>

<pre><code>cp /usr/share/applications/pidgin.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
</code></pre>

<p>Next edit the pidgin.desktop file:</p>

<pre><code>vi ~/.local/share/applications/pidgin.desktop
</code></pre>

<p>Look for the line that says: </p>

<pre><code>Icon=pidgin
</code></pre>

<p>This will need to change to the new icon name without the .png prefix...</p>

<p>Although my <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> has <code>PermitRootLogin yes</code>, I can't seem to be able to log in as root, presumably because it's not a ""real"" account with a separate password.</p>

<p>How do I configure SSH keys, so a process can remotely log in as root on Ubuntu?</p>
","<p><strong>EDIT bodhi.zazen</strong> This answer had some serious issues and I am attempting to re-write the answer to resolve the problems with the original answer.</p>

<p><strong>Part 1 : SSH key without a password</strong></p>

<p>To set up a passwordless SSH connection for the root user you need to have root access on the server. Easiest method is to <strong>temporarily</strong> allow root to log in over ssh via password. One way or another you need root access on the server to do this. If you do not have root access on the server, contact the server administrator for help.</p>

<p>--- On the client ie where you ssh FROM ---</p>

<p>First make a ssh key with no password. I highly suggest you give it a name rather then using the default </p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -f foo
</code></pre>

<p>The -f option specifies a file name, foo is an example, use whatever name you wish.</p>

<p>When you are prompted for a password, just hit the enter key and you will generate a key with no password.</p>

<p>Next you need to transfer the key to the server. Easiest method is to use <code>ssh-copy-id</code> . To do this you must temporarily allow root to ssh into the server.</p>

<p>--- ON THE SERVER where you ssh to ---</p>

<p>ON THE SERVER, edit <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you allow root to log in with the following syntax</p>

<pre><code>PasswordAuthentication yes
PermitRootLogin yes
</code></pre>

<p>Restart the server</p>

<pre><code>sudo service ssh restart
</code></pre>

<p>Set a root password, use a strong one</p>

<pre><code>sudo passwd
</code></pre>

<p>--- Done on server ---</p>

<p>From the client, Transfer the key to the server</p>

<pre><code>ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/foo root@server
</code></pre>

<p>change ""foo"" the the name of your key and enter your server root password when asked.</p>

<p>Test the key</p>

<pre><code>ssh -i ~/.ssh/foo root@server
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming it works, unset a root password and disable password login.</p>

<p>--- ON THE SERVER ---</p>

<pre><code>sudo passwd -l root
</code></pre>

<p>Edit <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo nano `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
</code></pre>

<p>Change the following :</p>

<pre><code>PasswordAuthentication no
PermitRootLogin without-password
</code></pre>

<p>Restart the server</p>

<pre><code>sudo service ssh restart
</code></pre>

<p>--- DONE ON SERVER ---</p>

<p>Test, you should now be able to ssh in with your key without a password and you should not be able to ssh in as any user without a key.</p>

<p>From the client</p>

<pre><code>ssh -i ~/.ssh/foo root@server
</code></pre>

<p><strong>PostgreSQL packages for Debian and Ubuntu</strong></p>

<p>The PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG) maintains an APT repository of PostgreSQL packages for Debian and Ubuntu located at <a href=""http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/"">http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/</a>. We aim at building PostgreSQL server packages as well as extensions and modules packages on several Debian/Ubuntu releases for all PostgreSQL versions supported.
Currently, we support
Debian 6.0 (squeeze), 7.0 (wheezy), and unstable (sid) 64/32 bit (amd64/i386)
Ubuntu 10.04 (lucid), 12.04 (precise), 13.10 (saucy), 14.04 (trusty) 64/32 bit (amd64/i386)
PostgreSQL 8.4, 9.0, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4 beta
Server extensions such as Slony-I, various PL languages, and datatypes
Applications like pgadmin3, pgbouncer, and pgpool-II
Packages for older PostgreSQL versions and older Debian/Ubuntu distributions will continue to stay in the repository; updates for those will be provided on an ad-hoc basis.</p>

<p><strong>Quickstart</strong></p>

<p>Create /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list. The distributions are called codename-pgdg. In the example, replace wheezy with the actual distribution you are using:</p>

<p><code>deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ wheezy-pgdg main</code></p>

<p>(You may determine the codename of your distribution by running lsb_release -c.)
Import the repository key from <a href=""https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc"">https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc</a>, update the package lists, and start installing packages:</p>

<pre><code>wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.3 pgadmin3
</code></pre>

<p>Alternately, this shell script will do the above steps for you.
9.4 beta only: See FAQ on beta releases
Have a look at the FAQ.
Note: This repository provides ""postgresql"", ""postgresql-contrib"", and ""postgresql-client"" meta-packages that depend on the latest postgresql-x.y, ... packages, similar to the ones present in Debian and Ubuntu. Once a new PostgreSQL version is released, these meta-packages will be updated to depend on the new version. If you want to stay with a particular PostgreSQL version, you should install specific packages like ""postgresql-9.3"" instead of ""postgresql"".</p>

"What is ""Steam"" and how does it work?","131193","","<p>I've heard Steam is recently available for GNU/Linux. A lot of people are talking about it. What is Steam? What's the fuss all about? Is Steam just for people who develop and play games? What should I know about Steam, as an user of Ubuntu?</p>

<p>Should I install Steam?</p>
","<h2>If You Are a <em>Developer</em></h2>

<p>Steam is particularly relevant to:</p>

<ul>
<li>developers of games already provided through <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/"">Steam</a> (by <a href=""http://www.valvesoftware.com/"">Valve</a>),</li>
<li>developers making mods for those games, and</li>
<li>game developers planning proprietary software projects (or, potentially, games with proprietary art but FOSS engines). Basically, anything where content whose distribution is restricted by copyright and must be distributed selectively to customers.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is interesting and important that Steam <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_%28software%29#Linux"">is being ported to GNU/Linux</a>. Whether or not a developer should distribute a game over Steam depends on many factors and is a highly subjective question.</p>

<h2>For End Users: One Simple Question</h2>

<p>For <em>users</em>, however, it's usually pretty simple to figure out if you might benefit from subscribing to, installing, and using Steam:</p>

<p><strong>Are there programs you want to run, that are available for your operating system, and that are distributed on Steam?</strong></p>

<p>If there are, Steam might be the best and most convenient way to get them. Or, often, there are other alternatives, which you might prefer. This mostly depends on the application, rather than the Steam service itself.</p>

<p>(The Steam service also has a <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/"">Subscriber Agreement</a>. Since signing it affects your legal rights, you should make sure you understand it first, and consider your options, as you should when contemplating the use of any service. <strong><em>By the way, this is not legal advice, and I am not a lawyer.</em></strong> I don't work for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation"">Valve Corporation</a> either.)</p>

<p>You can <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/search/?snr=1_4_4__12&amp;term="">search here</a> to see what games (and other content) are available through Steam. Just remember that not all games on Steam are necessarily available for your platform (especially if your platform is Linux-based).</p>

<p>Or <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/browse/linux/"">browse Steam games currently available for GNU/Linux</a> (that includes Ubuntu).</p>

<h2>Core Concepts</h2>

<p>There is a saying (which I think <em>might</em> originate in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution"">BSD</a> culture, but I'm <em>really not sure</em>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>You don't use an operating system, you use applications.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anything you want to use your computer for, you use some program to do it. The program may run on a particular OS, or be provided as part of a particular OS, or have no support on that OS at all. But what matters about an OS is whether or not you can run programs that provide the functionality you need.</p>

<p>Now, Steam is not an operating system. It is a distribution platform, sort of like the iTunes Music Store, but focused on games instead. Potentially Steam could be used to distribute other software, and it actually <em>is</em> used to distribute some videos.</p>

<p>If you want to run software that is distributed through Steam, then you should consider using Steam. Otherwise, though Steam has a few side features--chat with other Steam users--there is really no reason to use Steam.</p>

<h2><em>You don't play a distribution platform, you play games.</em></h2>

<p>The reason it's big news that Steam is coming to GNU/Linux (such as Ubuntu) is not that Steam is particularly cool <em>itself</em>, but that <strong>a number of Steam games formerly available only on other platforms seem to be coming along with it</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, a <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em> player who uses Ubuntu may be very happy that Steam is being ported to GNU/Linux, so they can install and play <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em> it on Ubuntu. But really, Steam being ported to GNU/Linux is just a tiny part of what's beneficial there. The real benefit is that <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em> <a href=""http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/"">is being ported</a>.</p>

<p>Ports of many other games currently available to Windows and Mac OS X users are planned, too. But many games are distributed on Steam, and some of them will not support multiple platforms (just as some don't now, even though Steam has been out for Mac OS X for quite some time).</p>

<h2><em>Games run on an operating system, not a distribution platform.</em></h2>

<p>Steam is an infrastructure for distributing and managing the installation and use of games. It manages user identity information, and it has a (minor) role in providing multiplayer functionality. But it is not a game engine, graphics API, or sandbox in which a game runs.</p>

<p>When Steam runs on Linux, that doesn't make Steam <em>applications</em> run on GNU/Linux. They have to be ported. And if they were ported <em>without</em> Steam, they would run, too.</p>

<h2>Packaging Software ...and Managing It Too!</h2>

<p>People can debate the advantages and disadvantages of Steam as a distribution platform; I'm not going to try to do that here. But there's one advantage-disadvantage pair that's important to understanding Steam at all:</p>

<ul>
<li>Advantage: <em>Your software is available from anywhere.</em> You can download, install, and update it through automated means. You can use it from multiple machines.</li>
<li>Disadvantage: <em>Your software is tied to being logged in to Steam.</em> Generally speaking, you can only use your Steam account--and thus, the games that are associated with it--on one machine at a time. Games are usually downloaded over the Internet when they are installed, rather than installing from local media, and sometimes downloads are slow.</li>
</ul>

<p>Steam ran on Windows first. Windows software can be packaged into discrete units (<code>.msi</code> files). There is a utility that performs installation (Windows Installer), information about what software is installed is stored in a local database (the registry), and there is a Control Panel applet providing a central place to browse installed software and uninstall whatever is unneeded (Add/Remove Programs).</p>

<p>That is to say that Windows has a <em>package manager</em>. It is not as sophisticated at managing dependencies as <code>dpkg</code>, but it is otherwise comparable.</p>

<p>What Windows did not have (and still does not have) is a package manager that automatically retrieves software from the Internet, installs it, retrieves and installs whatever other programs or libraries your software needs to run, and keeps your software up to date automatically. <strong>That's always been the main benefit of Steam to users.</strong> It is a highly functional, third-party package manager for Windows.</p>

<p>GNU/Linux operating systems, though (and our BSD cousins) have had advanced package managers built into the OS for decades! In Ubuntu this functionality is currently provided mainly by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool"">APT</a>, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Update_Manager"">Software Updater</a>, and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Software_Center"">Software Center</a>. Ubuntu has always had this functionality. And we've had it for every part of the system, and many thousands of additional programs.</p>

<h2>In Steam, <em>games are installed for users, not (just) computers.</em></h2>

<p>The Debian package management infrastructure has already been extended in Ubuntu to support installation and license management for proprietary payware applications. The Software Center adds this functionality, and is thus <em>somewhat comparable</em> to Steam. For example, users can purchase a number of for-pay games in the Software Center, such as <a href=""https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/amnesia/""><em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</em></a> (which can also be purchased <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/app/57300/"">through Steam</a> and <a href=""http://www.amnesiagame.com/#buy"">in other ways</a>).</p>

<p>When you install software in the Ubuntu Software Center, you must authenticate with your password. The software is installed systemwide. If you've purchased software, you can install it on other machines too. (Though you should consult the relevant license agreements, applicable law, and <strong><em>I am not a laywer and this is not legal advice</em></strong>.) However, often license agreements will prohibit you from using one license in two places at once.</p>

<p>With Steam, you log in to the Steam service to install and play games, and this is entirely separate from your Ubuntu user account. Multiple Steam users can be and often are set up on the same machine. A game two users have purchased is not (generally) stored twice on the hard drive, but it is accessible just while logged in to Steam as a user who has purchased it.</p>

<p>In some ways, this is inconvenient--if I purchased two unrelated games, why can't my friend play one of them on one of my computers while I play another one on my computer? On the other hand, this is also convenient--I needn't worry about what computers are available; I can log in to my Steam account anywhere and install the games (and they won't affect anybody else's Steam account, even on the same machine).</p>

<p>After all, <strong><em>games are played by people, not computers</em></strong>.</p>

"How to prevent computer from automatically sleeping and/or hibernating?","131006","","<p>I'm running Ubuntu 12.04, and my laptop* won't wake from sleep/suspend/hibernate. (Is sleep the same thing as suspend?) I'm not even sure which of these things it's doing. When I am done working for the day, I lock my screen (Control-Alt-L). When I come back the next day, the screen is in power saving mode, and no amount of typing or clicking (on the usb keyboard/mouse or the builtin keyboard/trackpad) nor tapping the power button will bring it back to life.</p>

<p>The only way I can get my machine to work is to hold down the power button until it shuts off, then press the power button again to turn it back on. Obviously, anything I had open from the previous day is pretty much gone -- in particular, my VMs all get rudely shut down without any warning.</p>

<p>This is driving me INSANE. I spend the first hour of every work day trying to figure out how to get my computer to stop locking up over night.</p>

<p>What I've tried:</p>

<ol>
<li>Editing the org.freedesktop.upower.policy to disable suspend and hibernate.</li>
<li>Setting power management options in ""Power"" section of ""System Settings"".</li>
<li>Looking at all power management options in the BIOS (none appear to be relevant to sleep/suspend/hibernate).</li>
<li>Reading every forum post/askubuntu post that I can find that's even tangentially related to the subject.</li>
<li>Add acpi=off to kernel args. (Results in USB keyboard and mouse not working, so I didn't wait to see if it fixes the suspend.)</li>
<li>Add apm=off to kernel args.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My question:</strong> how to disable the <strong>automatic</strong> sleep and/or hibernate (and/or anything similar) in Ubuntu 12.04. I don't care if it's still possible to sleep/suspend/hibernate/whatever by pushing buttons or running some command or reciting led zeppelin lyrics backwards. I just want my laptop to be ready for work in the morning.</p>

<p>*The laptop is a Dell Latitude something or other. I don't want to get too specific because I've seen a lot of similar questions get closed for being too specific. I think my question is generic enough to stand -- it's a question about the latest, stable version of Ubuntu.</p>

<p><strong>Link to</strong> <a href=""http://pastebin.ca/2165607"">/var/log/kern.log</a></p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Nothing I've tried so far has prevented Ubuntu from sleeping at night, and when it does sleep, nothing I have tried can reliably get it to wake back up. I've seen a few posts that say buggy video drivers can cause problems with waking.</p>

<p>Last night, on a hunch, I tried switching to console (ctrl+alt+1) before leaving work, just to see what would happen. This morning when I woke up the computer, it instantly woke up back to the console. I switched over to Gnome (ctrl+alt+7) and although the screen looked frozen, I typed my password, pressed enter, and made some coffee. When I got back a few minutes later, my desktop was ready, just like I left it last night.</p>

<p>I'm going to keep trying this to see if this is a reliable solution.</p>

<p>EDIT 2:</p>

<p>No dice. Switching to the console after logging out does nothing for me... still have to reboot my computer each morning. It's driving me nuts... I can't believe how erratic suspend is on Ubuntu. Or the fact that it can't simply be disabled. </p>
","<p>Here are the two common Gnome 3 ways which usually disable suspend; otherwise you can try booting with the <code>acpi=off</code> parameter:</p>

What is the technical reason for this, and is it possible to do this some other way?</p>
","<p>The reason you can't do this is simple and two fold</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p><code>cd</code> is not a program but an in-built command and <code>sudo</code> only applies to programs.</p>

<p><code>sudo foo</code> means run the program foo as root</p>

<p><code>sudo cd /path</code> returns</p>

<pre><code>sudo: cd: command not found
</code></pre>

<p>because <code>cd</code> is not a program.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>If it were possible to use <strong>sudo</strong> to <code>cd</code> to a protected directory then having run the command <code>sudo cd /var/named</code> you would be in that directory as a normal user but normal users are not allowed to be in that directory.</p>

<p><strong>This is not possible.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Workaround:</strong></p>

<p>You can use <code>sudo -i</code> to elevate yourself to super user. For example:</p>

<pre><code>sudo -i
cd /var/named

<p>You are now logged on as root and can use whatever commands you wish. When finished type <code>exit</code> and you are back to being logged on as a normal user.</p>

<p>Could anybody help me, guiding me through the downloading and installation of Handbrake?</p>
","<p>There are two official HandBrake PPAs, <code>ppa:stebbins/handbrake-releases</code> and <code>ppa:stebbins/handbrake-snapshots</code>. </p>

<p>The former contains stable releases, which are updated about once a year. These releases tend to be rather out-dated when their end-of-life is approaching. The current stable version (0.9.8) was released on 2012-07-18.</p>

<p>The latter contains nightly builds, which are updated daily (or nightly, as it were). These are of course less stable, and undocumented to boot, but they are good software nonetheless. Additionally, as the stable release ages, the developers tend to start recommending users to try the nightly builds instead.</p>

<p>To add one of these to your sources, simply run:</p>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:stebbins/handbrake-snapshots

"How do I boot into a root shell?","130049","","<p>When booting to the graphical desktop fails we sometimes are recommended to boot into a ""root shell"" or to boot in ""recovery mode"".</p>

<p>How do I do that?</p>
","<h2>for 12.04.3 LTS and later</h2>

<p>During boot press <strong>and hold</strong> the left <kbd>Shift</kbd> key or any other key. This will bring up the Grub2 menu from where we can select ""Advanced options for Ubuntu"".</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/01e8n.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>After that we will be able to select the kernel we wish to boot in <em>""Recovery mode""</em>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UP5j7.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This will lead us to the advanced options. By selecting <em>""Enable networking""</em> we gain access to our network and the internet for upgrades or downloads, and we will also <strong>mount our hard drives in read/write mode</strong> in case we need to edit files.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fdmNg.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>After the network has loaded, and fielsystems were mounted we will be presented again with the menu, from where we can choose <em>""Drop to a root shell propmpt""</em>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tHkmh.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Note that we are root in this shell. Hence no sudo is needed for administrative tasks. This also means we have full access to all files, and we may cause irreversible damage to our system if we made a mistake. </p>

<p>If we had not enabled read/write access with <em>""Enable networking""</em> the filesystem will be mounted <strong>read only</strong>, and we are unable to edit files.</p>

<p>In case we don't have access to a network, or this was not desired, we can remount our filesystem(s) giving write access with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>mount -o rw,remount /
</code></pre>

<p>From the root shell type <code>exit</code> to go back to the menu.</p>

<h2>for 12.04.0 LTS or earlier</h2>

<p>During the boot process of the computer we press and hold the <strong>left</strong> <kbd>Shift</kbd> key. This will bring up the Grub2 boot menu from where we can select ""recovery mode"" (usually the second boot entry).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/G1U0e.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This will lead to the Grub2 recovery menu:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rwNDc.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><em>""Drop to root shell prompt""</em> gives you a command line root environment from where you can access your files as root (no <code>sudo</code> required). After having done your work on your files you can leave the command line shell by</p>

<pre><code>exit
</code></pre>

<p>Choose <em>""Resume normal boot""</em> to proceed booting as usual.</p>

","<p>Check that mysql-server-5.1 package was uninstalled, seems it might persist after upgrade.  I had the same error and had to purge MySQL server 5.1 and 5.5 then re-install.</p>

<p>First make a backup of your /var/lib/mysql/ directory just to be safe.</p>

<pre><code>sudo cp -R /var/lib/mysql/ ~/mysql

<p>Remove the folder /etc/mysql/ and it's contents</p>

<pre><code>sudo rm /etc/mysql/ -R

<p>Next check that your old database files are still in /var/lib/mysql/ if they are not then copy them back in to the folder then chown root:root</p>

<p>(only run these if the files are no longer there)</p>

<pre><code>sudo mkdir /var/lib/mysql/
sudo chown root:root /var/lib/mysql/ -R
sudo cd ~/mysql/
sudo cp * /var/lib/mysql/ -R

<p>An explanation from <a href=""http://selfsolved.com/problems/zip-command-exclude-svn-director"">http://selfsolved.com/problems/zip-command-exclude-svn-director</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The correct incantation is</p>

<pre><code>zip -9 -r --exclude=*.svn*  foo.zip [directory-to-compress]
</code></pre>
  
  <p>You can also add a<br>
  <code>--exclude=*.DS_Store*</code> to exclude the annoying Mac OS X directory display metadata files.</p>
  
  <p>Notice that the expression passed to <code>--exclude</code> is using the entire original relative directory path as the original string to match against. So <code>.svn/*</code> by itself doesn't work; the wildcard character in front ensures that it matches <code>.svn</code> directories anywhere in the directory tree.</p>

"How to blacklist kernel modules?","128401","","<p>How do I disable loading of unnecessary kernel modules. Kernel 3.2.4 </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> blacklisting will <em>not work</em> for modules which are built into the kernel image (i.e. not loaded via a separate <code>.ko</code> file. The only way to disable such modules is via a kernel parameter (if available) or by recompiling the kernel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just open your <code>/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist</code> file and add drivername using following syntax:</p>

<pre><code>blacklist driver-name
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: In later versions since 12.10 (12.04?) the file is <code>/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf</code></p>

<p>Reboot your box and use lsmod command to show the status of modules in the Linux Kernel</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: here <code>driver-name</code> is the name of your desired blacklist driver. For example, If you wanted to disable the NIC card driver, you can find the name of kernel driver for your LAN card by using the command <code>lspci -v</code> command in a terminal.<br>
For Example my output was :  </p>

","<p>From the <code>apt-get</code> man page:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>clean</b>:   clean clears out the local repository of retrieved package files.
       It removes everything but the lock file from
       /var/cache/apt/archives/ and /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/. When
       APT is used as a dselect(1) method, clean is run automatically.
       Those who do not use dselect will likely want to run apt-get clean
       from time to time to free up disk space.</p></li>
<li><p><b>autoclean</b>: Like clean, autoclean clears out the local repository of retrieved
       package files. The difference is that it only removes package files
       that can no longer be downloaded, and are largely useless. This
       allows a cache to be maintained over a long period without it
       growing out of control. The configuration option
       APT::Clean-Installed will prevent installed packages from being

"Install Skype on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit","127487","","<p>Since weeks ago I'm trying to install Skype on my computer. I imagined it would be a straight forward task but it is becoming a nightmare.</p>

<p>What I have tried so far:</p>

<h2>Installing from command line with apt</h2>

<p>The easiest one and the most likely anybody would try:
<code>sudo apt-get install skype</code></p>

<p>But I get this unfortunately:</p>

<pre><code>Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed.
This may mean that you have requested an impossible situation or if you are
using the unstable distribution that some required packages have not
yet been created or been moved out of Incoming. The following

     Depends:
       skype-bin
     E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
</code></pre>

<p>If I try <code>sudo apt-get intall skype-bin</code> I get:</p>

<pre><code> Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
 requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
 distribution that some required packages have not yet been created or

E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
</code></pre>

<p>After that I tried with commands like <code>sudo apt-get clean</code>, <code>sudo apt-get update</code>, <code>sudo apt-get autoclean</code> and <code>sudo apt-get -f install</code>, among others, in order to fix any issue with packages dependency but it was completely unsuccessful.</p>

<p>I have followed the instructions explained here (<a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/7498/how-do-i-install-skype"">How do I install Skype?</a>) but it doesn't work either.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Installing from Software Center</h2>

<p>If I try to install from Software Center I get exactly the same error than running <code>sudo apt-get install skype</code> from the terminal.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Installing with Ubuntu Tweak</h2>

<p>Fails as well, I get the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>skype: Depends: skype-bin, but it is a virtual package.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>Installing with Synaptic</h2>

<p>I have also followed the instruction described here:</p>

<p>community.skype.com/t5 / Linux / Unable-to-install-due-to-unmet-dependencies-Skype-bin/m-p/1339650/highlight/true#M3329</p>

<p>Much of the same, doesn't work either.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Installing official Skype .deb</h2>

<p>After downloading <strong>skype-ubuntu-precise_4.1.0.20-1_i386.deb</strong> from <a href=""http://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-linux/downloading/?type=ubuntu64"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-linux/downloading/?type=ubuntu64</a> I tried to install it though Software Center but it displays the following error:</p>

<p>Cannot install 'lbqt4-dbus:i386'</p>

<hr>

<h2>Trying to fix apt</h2>

<p>I have tried to fix any possible problem with packages by following this post (<a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/140246/how-do-i-resolve-unmet-dependencies"">How do I resolve unmet dependencies after adding a PPA?</a>) but didn't work.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Following Ubuntu Help instructions</h2>

<p>If I try to follow the instructions explained in <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype</a> I have problems when running <code>sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386</code>, I get the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>dpkg: error: unknown option --add-architecture</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>I have also tried other approaches by following other posts and solutions I found but nothing of this worked for me. At this point I'm completely lost and I don't know what else I can do. I hope somebody can comes up with any solution.</p>

","<p>OK, I have found a solution for my problem. I have followed the steps described here: <a href=""http://rumytaulu.wordpress.com/2012/10/26/cant-install-ia32-libs-and-ia32-libs-multiarch-how-to-fix-it/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://rumytaulu.wordpress.com/2012/10/26/cant-install-ia32-libs-and-ia32-libs-multiarch-how-to-fix-it/</a></p>

I have checked the <a href=""http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/desktop/make/Lenovo/"">Lenovo compatibility lists</a> on the Ubuntu site, but no new entries have been created yet for this model (released mid-October).</p>
","<p>just bought (last week) one (yoga 2 pro - i7 - 8 GB ram - 256 SSD) and  have installed ubuntu 13.10. </p>

<p>It comes with a small button on the side of the power button to enable the BIOS edit and boot sequence... When you press it, the computer powers up with the config menu. Then you have to edit the BIOS to unsecure UEFI mode. It was really easy.</p>

<p>To boot the ubuntu you have to edit the grub's boot line before the <code>quiet</code> parameter, adding: <code>acpi_backlight=vendor</code> </p>

<p>and after installing ubuntu, in the <code>/etc/default/grub</code> file, you have to add the same acpi conf in the 11th line:</p>

<pre><code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""acpi_backlight=vendor quiet splash""

<li>at first, wireless was hard blocked and I tried out everything to enable it (rfkill unblock, kernel upgrade to 3.12, and nothing worked) </li>
</ul>

<p>In order to use it without wireless, I bought the J5 usb 3.0 gigabit ethernet adapter... it works without any configuration.</p>

<p>I found some posts online saying that they have solved this by reinstalling windows, unblocking the wireless card via software, and then going back to linux. 
I removed all partitions and I am not planning to reinstall windows.</p>

<p>The funny thing was that <code>iwlist wlan0 scan</code> worked... so that was very strange...</p>

<p>Today I installed wicd to replace the network manager and the wireless start working !!!!!! the only thing that was needed was to copy the resolv.conf from the ubuntu location to /etc (replacing the symbolic link)</p>

"How do I install the Nvidia drivers?","127273","","<p>I just ordered the Nvidia GTX card. I have a dilemma, though. Should I keep using the driver which is available in ""additional drivers"" in Ubuntu, or should I install the driver from the Nvidia site?</p>

<p>So which driver is the best for me?</p>
","<p><strong>Updated - Nov 2, 2016</strong></p>

<h2>The quick way:</h2>

<p>Before adding this PPA, please <strong><a href=""https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa"" rel=""noreferrer"">read the PPA's Description on their page</a></strong> which mentions important information about using it. This is for desktop users who want the latest version of the driver.</p>

<p>To install run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa   
sudo apt-get update   
sudo apt-get upgrade   
</code></pre>

<p>This will update the system taking into consideration any packages the PPA offers. If you already had an Nvidia driver installed, this will also update that driver (But not from a major version to another, eg: 355 to 370). If you did not have a driver already install, you could run something like this (Assuming you have one of the latest Nvidia cards):</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install nvidia-370
</code></pre>

<p>Then reboot to use the new drivers. </p>

<h2>Common questions regarding Nvidia:</h2>

<li><strong>5.</strong> How to install a driver?</li>
<li><strong>6.</strong> Difference between Proprietary Drivers?</li>
<li><strong>7.</strong> How to know if my video card is supported in Ubuntu?</li>
</ul>

<p>For Troubleshooting Nvidia Problems or Overclocking Settings please see <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/431824/7035"">this answer</a> which covers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1.</strong> What common bugs are solved by using the latest drivers?</li>
<li><strong>2.</strong> My video card is not installing (Installation problems)</li>
<li><strong>3.</strong> Tuning and Tweaking by Video card</li>
</ul>

<p>Top questions asked about video cards:</p>

<h2>1. Can I use the latest driver on an older version of Ubuntu?</h2>

<p><strong>Ubuntu 12.04+</strong></p>

<p>Since 12.04+, video drivers are maintained and updated more often. It is easier to handle and solve the problems that showed with older ones. You'll most likely won't need additional PPAs unless you have the latest Nvidia card.</p>

<h2>2. Difference between video cards &amp; drivers: Official Nvidia site, Ubuntu's Default, PPA &amp; Nouveau</h2>

<p>I recommend them in the following order according to problems found, how the ""out of the box"" experience feels to end users, how compatible they are, how easy it is to update, install or remove and how it will feel once you have it set up:</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa"" rel=""noreferrer"">Nvidia PPA</a></strong> - Great Performance. It works out of the box for most cards by using the driver included in the PPA (Which are different for each generation of Nvidia cards (This is explained below).</p>

<p><strong>Ubuntu Default Recommended Driver</strong> - Ubuntu does an amazing job in figuring out which Nvidia driver you need depending on the card you are using.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/FeatureMatrix/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Nouveau</a></strong> - This is the open source implementation of the Nvidia driver. They also do an amazing job and although they are not on par with the official drivers or the ones in the PPA (Even more so with the latest Nvidia cards), the speed of development, the commitment, dedication and advancements that they do per week, gives confident that this is fact an option to have and promote.</p>

<p><strong>Official Nvidia Site</strong> - This are the official drivers (Same as the ones in the PPA), but the difference is that they do not upgrade automatically and have some issues when updating, uninstalling and installing (Very rare but it happens).</p>

<p>The differences can be summed in the following points:</p>

<p><strong>-- Official Site --</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Offers the latest driver</li>
<li>Installation is through the terminal</li>
<li>When an update appears you have to manually download the new package</li>
<li>It has more issues than any other method (Specially for Nvidia)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>-- PPA Repositories --</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Offers the latest driver hours/days after it's official release</li>
<li>Installation is either through terminal or GUI</li>
<li>If you have a previously installed driver it will update the package automatically  </li>
<li>When an update appears you will be notified to update using the Update Manager</li>
<li>It is more stable and tested than the official ones</li>
<li>It has less issues than using any other method (Less issues for all video cards)</li>
<li>It is the 1st recommended way for Nvidia Cards.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>-- Default Ubuntu Drivers --</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>For every new release the drivers get better and better</li>
<li>Gets updated less frequently than a PPA</li>
<li>In most cases the drivers will work out of the box (Nouveau for Nvidia)</li>
<li>Not up to date when compared with the official site or a PPA</li>
<li>It is by far, more tested in Ubuntu than any other way (PPA or Official)</li>
<li>Easier to update</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. How to know which driver or package to install?</h2>

<p>Depending on how many video cards you have and if they are integrated or not, the installation method and packages to install will change from the PPA mentioned above which is for Single Cards.</p>

<p><strong>COMPUTERS WITH TWO VIDEO CARDS IN HYBRID MODE</strong></p>

<p>Starting with Nvidia 319.xx, both Nvidia Optimus and the common PCIe drivers are integrated into one, so if you install the Nvidia-319 package or newer, you will get the driver for the Integrated Nvidia cards and also for the PCI ones.</p>

<p>There are two solutions possible for hybrid cards: The first one is a package called <code>bumblebee</code>, which is able to use different configurations for different applications. To install it, run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install bumblebee linux-headers-generic
</code></pre>

<p>The second one is an official NVIDIA package called <code>nvidia-prime</code>, which is automatically installed together with the <code>nvidia-355</code> package. It is able to decide on which card to use at profile level, i.e. when the user logs in. This decision is adjustable at NVIDIA X Server Settings Control Panel. Note that <code>nvidia-prime</code> and <code>bumblebee</code> are incompatible: If <code>bumblebee</code> is installed then <code>nvidia-prime</code> won't function correctly, and its options won't be shown at NVIDIA X Server Settings Control Panel. You'll have to 1. remove <code>bumblebee</code> 2. <em>reinstall</em> <code>nvidia-355</code> in order to make it work again.</p>

<p>After this, it is recommended to <strong>turn off the computer</strong> and then back on.</p>

<p>The following picture should be seen with <code>nvidia-prime</code> installed, but not necessarily when <code>bumblebee</code> is also installed.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VRCC4.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p><strong>COMPUTERS WITH A SLI SETUP</strong></p>

<p>If you have 2 or more video cards in SLI mode you can do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For NVidia cards, when creating the <code>Xorg.conf</code> add the following to the line:</p>

<pre><code>sudo nvidia-xconfig --sli=On
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, Ubuntu has a neat way of recommending which driver to use depending on your video card and drivers available (This is why I also recommend adding the PPAs first). Simply type:</p>

<pre><code>ubuntu-drivers devices
</code></pre>

<p>It should show you a list of driver packages available for your hardware, including but not limited to the video card. If you wish to see which driver is recommended for your video card then simply type the following:</p>

<pre><code>ubuntu-drivers devices | grep recommended
</code></pre>

<h2>5. How to install a driver?</h2>

<p>The method used will be depend on how many video cards you have and which type of video cards you are using. The following are some of the ways of installing an Nvidia video card:</p>

<p><strong>NVIDIA (Old Drivers that need the headers)</strong></p>

<p>For Nvidia, many times you need to first install the header files of the kernel version you are using at that moment for the driver to install correctly. So you would first need to execute the following line:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic  
</code></pre>

<p>And then install the package related to the driver (nvidia* for Nvidia cardss). In other cases you might need to go a little further and install the sources and specific header files, for example:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install linux-source linux-headers-3.5.0-16-generic  
</code></pre>

<p>which installs the <code>linux-source</code> package and the specific header file assuming you have in this case the <code>3.5.0-16-generic</code> kernel version. </p>

<p>To check which version you have at any given time type <code>uname -r</code> which should give you the specific kernel version in use.</p>

<p>For Nvidia, it depends on the video card and package needed for it, for the latest video cards and assuming you added the PPA mentioned above, the terminal line would be:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install nvidia-370
</code></pre>

<p>The number at the end would change depending on how old your video card is or how new it is (Some versions available are 304, 340, 355 and 370). </p>

<p>For GeForce 8 and 9 series GPUs use <code>nvidia-340</code><br>
For GeForce 6 and 7 series GPUs use <code>nvidia-304</code></p>

<p>The latest versions bring more fixes and correct issues related to graphics corruption, HDMI support, thermal support and more for the latest Nvidia cards. Normally, updating the video drivers solves many issues.</p>

<p>Note that Fan Control and any other Nvidia features that are not found on the <code>nvidia-settings</code> app, are not Ubuntu related, but Nvidia related. I would recommend, asking the Nvidia developers in the official Nvidia forum about features you may want to include (Fan Control, Overclocking features, etc...)</p>

<p>For CUDA you can follow this link <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/451672/installing-and-testing-cuda-in-ubuntu-14-04"">Installing and testing CUDA in Ubuntu 14.04</a></p>

<p>For Bumblebee (NVIDIA Optimus) you can use the following PPA (Ubuntu 15.04+ users can optionally not do this since it is already included):</p>

<pre><code> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install bumblebee linux-headers-generic

<h2>6. Difference between Proprietary Drivers?</h2>

<p>Please visit <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/216286/difference-between-additional-drivers-nvidia/218181#218181"">Difference between Additional Drivers (Nvidia)</a> for more information about Proprietary Drivers.</p>

<h2>7. How to know if my video card is supported in Ubuntu?</h2>

<p>Here are a couple of hints to know if your video card is supported in Ubuntu:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the video card existed <strong>BEFORE</strong> the release of the Ubuntu version you are using, it has a 99% change it will be supported.</p></li>
<li><p>If the video card appeared less than 6 months <strong>AFTER</strong> the release of the Ubuntu version you are using and you kept that Ubuntu version updated, then you have a pretty good chance it will be supported.</p></li>
<li><p>If you added one of the PPAs I mentioned above then you have a 99.99% chance that it will be supported.</p></li>
<li><p>Checking the Nvidia Site or the PPA for support might yield a quicker answer, but in almost 100% of all cases, your video card will be supported either by the open source driver or by the proprietary driver.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the latest Ubuntu version will also improve your chances of having your latest video card supported.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In general, I make it a rule of thumb that if you have the latest video card or almost one of the latest video cards, you will need the latest drivers. So always install the latest drivers through the PPA or the Software Sources that come with Ubuntu if you have the latest Nvidia card.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> - Ubuntu might show in the Graphics option in ""About This Computer"" the value <strong>Unknown</strong>. If this is happening, please install the <code>mesa-utils</code> package.</p>

<p>This answer is oriented towards resolving common Nvidia bugs (Black screen, drivers not working in general, low FPS, etc...)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1.</strong> What common bugs are solved by using the latest drivers?</li>
<li><strong>2.</strong> My video card is not installing (Installation problems)  </li>
<li><strong>3.</strong> Tuning and Tweaking by Video card</li>
</ul>

<h2>1. What common bugs are solved by using the latest drivers?</h2>

<p>Common bugs shared by all video cards are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Missing Unity launcher or panel</li>
<li>Missing options inside Nvidia Settings</li>
<li>Desktop does not appear (Black screen)</li>
<li>Top/Bottom of the screen are cut out</li>
<li>Video looks cut into pieces</li>
<li>Higher Resolutions are not usable (Not found)</li>
<li>Video shows with VGA but not with HDMI (And Vice Versa)</li>
<li>Suspend not working on Laptop when closing Lid</li>
<li>Fan speed makes a lot of noise or is always at full speed</li>
<li>Heat Problems</li>
<li><code>nvidia-xconfig</code> not creating <code>xorg.conf</code> correctly</li>
</ul>

<p>If you happen to have any of this, or similar in some aspects, it is generally a good idea to add one of the PPAs and update your video drivers to the latest they can manage. In almost all cases, the problem is solved after updating and rebooting. For this cases I also recommend using the Graphics Drivers PPA.</p>

<p>With the above mentioned, I also invite you to take a look at some of the questions related to video cards:</p>

<p>Now some pointers I want to mention:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For NVIDIA Cards, it also helps to create the <code>xorg.conf</code> file using the <code>nvidia-xconfig</code> command line. Just go in the terminal to type the following and then reboot: </p>

<pre><code>sudo nvidia-xconfig
</code></pre>

<p>Know that if <code>nvidia-xconfig</code> throws one of the following errors you most likely need to delete the existing <code>xorg.conf</code> file first before executing the <code>nvidia-xconfig</code> command again: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>VALIDATION ERROR</strong> - It can mention section missing, incorrect information in a section, not closed sections or simply requiring at least 1 section to proceed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>WARNING</strong> - It can mention several errors in values regarding any parameter found in a section, for example not specifying explicitly a value for a parameter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FATAL SERVER ERROR</strong> - After running <code>nvidia-xconfig</code> you can get in small cases a ""no screens found"" error which most likely means that the recommendations mentioned above like installing the PPA were not applied first or a possible module is still working (Either the nouveau is loading or an nvidia driver installed using the Nvidia driver package from the nvidia site.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ERROR</strong> - You will get an error similar to <code>Unable to write to directory '/etc/X11'</code> if you executed the <code>nvidia-xconfig</code> command without sudo. If the error persists via the <code>nvidia-settings</code> you need to delete the <code>xorg.conf</code> file first.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For all the cases where you need to delete the <code>xorg.conf</code> file, please make sure to backup any changes to did to it before deleting it.  </p></li>
<li><p>Reinstalling the driver solves several issues. For example, if you are using the <code>nvidia-graphics-drivers-355</code> driver package, then do the following to reinstall it:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-graphics-drivers-355
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Reinstalling Xorg also helps in other cases:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Remove existing xorg using the following command</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Install xorg using the following command</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Reconfigure xorg using the following command</p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>After this it is recommended to reinstall the video driver if you are using Nvidia or Ati as mentioned above.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>I have to add that if you suffer from Black Screen after installing the Nvidia drivers from the PPA and rebooting (And you don't have a Hybrid System) then your problem might be the need to remove the bumblebee package along with the bumblebee.conf file. Follow the steps provided in <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/404845/installing-latest-nvidia-from-xorg-ppa-gives-black-screen"">Installing latest Nvidia from Xorg PPA gives black screen</a> for this or simply run the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get purge bumblebee primus   
sudo rm -fr /etc/modprobe.d/bumblebee.conf
sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<h2>2. My video card is not installing correctly (Installation problems)</h2>

<p>Most installation problems related to Ati or Nvidia can be solved by following the steps provided in <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/147576/can-not-install-nvidia-driver"">Can not install Nvidia driver</a> but in short I can summarize that in the following steps assuming you have one of the following issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Installed the official Nvidia drivers and have a problem updating or removing them</li>
<li>Screen looks wrong/corrupted</li>
<li>Unity does not load of fails to load</li>
<li>Can not access the GUI environment in no way</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have installed the official Nvidia Drivers, follow all steps below after having started Ubuntu in <strong>Recovery Mode</strong>. If not, skip to step 2:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you installed the Nvidia driver from the Nvidia site or the Ati driver from the official AMD site, then type the following on the terminal (In this example assume you have the Ubuntu 64Bit with the 304.51 version of Nvidia):  </p>

<pre><code>sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-304.51.run --uninstall
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you have install any nvidia package like <code>nvidia-current</code> or <code>nvidia-current-updates</code> remove them. Same goes with ATI drivers. <code>sudo apt-get remove nvidia-current</code> for example.</p></li>
<li><p>ANY change you did to blacklist the Nvidia/ATI driver for instance or changes to any other files related to the Nvidia/ATI drivers should be reversed. This is just in case you went ahead and started editing like crazy (Which happens I know ^^).</p></li>
<li><p>Delete or backup/move the <code>xorg.conf</code> file. You will not need this file right now.</p></li>
<li><p>After doing all the steps above then Reboot the PC and make sure it loads with Nouveau and not with any Nvidia drivers for Nvidia cases or with ATI drivers and not with fglrx for Ati/AMD cases..</p></li>
<li><p>If right now you KNOW you are running Unity with the Nouveau driver (Or Ati open source driver) or if you just happened to get a video error, or it just fails to correctly load LightDM, do not worry, all 3 options will end the same way. When rebooting, in the GRUB menu, select the ""Recovery Mode"". After the recovery mode shows you the recover options, choose the <strong>root</strong> option or the <strong>Failsafe X</strong> option. In this modes and after all previous steps have been done, install the nvidia/ati driver using the PPA I mentioned above. Always try to install the latest driver if you have a recent video card: <code>sudo apt-get install nvidia-313</code> for Nvidia cards or <code>sudo apt-get install fglrx</code> for the latest Ati/AMD Cards. Remember there should not be anything installed before doing this in regards to Nvidia/Ati drivers (Except obviously the Nouveau drivers).</p></li>
<li><p>Now reboot and all should work.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>NOTE - In Step 6, if it looks as though the PC is stuck loading just press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> to go to the TTY1 terminal and do step 6 from there.</p>

<p>Other common installation problems involve resolution. You can check and change the resolution via terminal in the following way:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open the terminal and type <code>xrandr</code> this will show you all possible supported resolutions (This depends on your video card and monitor/tv). Take note on the order they appear listed. The first line that shows the resolution is line 1, the next one is 2 and so on for all resolutions supported. A value of 0 will reset the resolution to the default one after you actually set a resolution.</p></li>
<li><p>Type <code>xrandr -s X</code> where X is the line number as mentioned above. So it would look something like: <code>xrandr -s 1</code>.</p>

<p>Lastly for users that have reported <strong>not seeing the Unity Launcher/Panel</strong> after updating the Kernel and/or Nvidia version, the first thing to do is to check if the Unity Plugin is enabled. For this go to the Compiz Config Settings Manager (Am assuming it is already installed) and go to the Unity Plugin. Check to see that the checkbox for it is activated. If not then activate this option and follow the on-screen suggestions.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>3. Tuning and Tweaking my video card</h2>

<p>For Nvidia Video Cards follow this steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the terminal type: <code>sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf</code></p></li>
<li><p>Find the <strong>device</strong> section and add the following line:</p>

<pre><code> Option ""Coolbits"" ""4""
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>it should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code> Section ""Device""
     Identifier     ""Device0""
     Driver         ""nvidia""
     VendorName     ""NVIDIA Corporation""
     Option         ""Coolbits"" ""4""
 EndSection
</code></pre>

<p>Now save and reboot. You should now see (Depending on your video card model) a new option about Fan Speed like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/E9D0D.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>A brief explanation of CoolBits:</p>

<p>CoolBits enables various unsupported features, such as support for GPU clock manipulation in the NV-CONTROL X extension. This option accepts a <strong>bit mask</strong> of features to enable. Which means a value of 0, 1, 2 or 4.</p>

<p><strong>CoolBits = 1</strong> - When ""1"" (Bit 0) is set in the ""Coolbits"" option value, the nvidia-settings utility will contain a page labeled ""Clock Frequencies"" through which clock settings can be manipulated. ""Coolbits"" is only available on GeForce FX and Above.</p>

<p><strong>CoolBits = 2</strong> - When ""2"" (Bit 1) is set it will attempt to initialize SLI when using GPUs with different amounts of video memory.</p>

<p><strong>CoolBits = 4</strong> - When ""4"" (Bit 2) is set the Thermal Monitor page will allow configuration of GPU fan speed, on graphics boards with programmable fan capability.</p>

<p>The default option is 0 (unsupported features are disabled).</p>

<p>As of Nvidia 337.XX the following options are available:</p>

<p><strong>CoolBits = 8</strong> - When ""8"" (Bit 3) is set the PowerMizer page in the nvidia-settings control panel will display a table that allows setting per-clock domain and per-performance level offsets to apply to clock values. This is allowed on certain GeForce GPUs in the GeForce GTX 400 series and later. Not all clock domains or performance levels may be modified.</p>

<p><strong>CoolBits = 12</strong> - When ""12"" (Bit 3 + 2) this will be the same as activating the effects of Coolbits 8 + Coolbits 4. So you will get the new overclocking features and the fan control.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YBXNR.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>This options can also be activated by issuing the following command:</p>

<pre><code>nvidia-xconfig --cool-bits=4
</code></pre>

<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> this may cause system damage and void warranties.</p>

<p>I also want to add that the information for Proprietary drivers are typically saved in the home folder. For example the information saved by <code>nvidia-settings</code> is stored in <code>~/.nvidia-settings-rc</code> which you can access by typing the following:</p>

<pre><code>nano ~/.nvidia-settings-rc
</code></pre>

<p>I mention this because if the <code>xorg.conf</code> is not used, then how is the settings for Ati or Nvidia working. The reason is that X can automatically detect and configure many options of xorg.conf like input/output devices and Video cards. This did not happen automatically before, but since 2010, X can handle many options and detect them without any problems or the need to configure a file for them.</p>

<p>Note that, many of this are still present but divided into more specific files in <code>/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/</code></p>

<p>For example, some video cards do not show the Unity Launcher or top panel unless <code>xorg.conf</code> is present. In other cases, users that want to tweak their video card, may need the Coolbits option which is added to xorg.conf. This are the reasons why nvidia-xconfig exists. To provide an additional level of support in case X does not detect or offer all the options for the video card.</p>

<p>Another trick is to run <code>update-pciids</code> so it updates the PCI Id List. On very rare cases, the ID is not found or detected incorrectly for the video card (Actually any PCI device) so this will help solve any problem related to it.</p>

<p>In some cases it also helps to change the <strong>Texture Filter</strong> value to <strong>Fast</strong> in the OpenGL Plugin inside the Compiz Config Settings Manager.</p>

<p>Lastly, changing the <strong>Image Settings</strong> options to ""High Performance"" in the <strong>OpenGL Settings</strong> of the Nvidia Settings Panel can help in some cases.</p>

"Mount USB drive with write permissions for everyone or specific user","127173","","<p>I know there are similar questions but I get some specific problem I can't overcome.</p>

<p>I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>HDD split into two partitions. <code>/dev/sdb1</code> and <code>/dev/sdb2</code>.  <code>sdb1</code> is NTFS and I don't need it. I need <code>sdb2</code> which is fat32.</li>
<li>Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS (server)</li>
</ul>

<p>I want:</p>

<p>Ultimately I need a perma-mount <code>/dev/sdb2</code> to <code>/home/storage</code> with access right (rw) for the user <code>media</code>.</p>

<p>Problems I'm facing:</p>

<p><strong>1) Using manual mount from command line.</strong></p>

<p>If I just use</p>

<pre><code>server# sudo mount /dev/sdb2 /home/storage
</code></pre>

<p>It mounts but the <code>/home/storage</code> receives root as owner and group and doesn't allow <code>media</code> user to write there.</p>

<p>If i use <code>mount</code> command without <code>sudo</code> as the user <code>media</code> - i'm not allowed. Says only root can use mount.</p>

<p>If I use <code>mount</code> with options: <code>server# sudo mount /dev/sdb2 /home/storage -o umask=000</code> I get what I need. A bit overdone of course, since the storage folder becomes writable for everyone. <strong>BUT - that is manually mounted - now i need it to remount on every reboot.</strong></p>

<p><strong>2) Remounting on reboot - using <code>fstab</code></strong></p>

<p>So I thought I'll be fine if I use <code>fstab</code> to mount this partition (<code>/dev/sdb2</code>) every time i reboot. The <code>fstab</code> line I added:</p>

<p><code>UUID=8C52-C1CD /home/storage auto   user,umask=000,utf8,noauto  0   0</code></p>

<p>got uuid with <code>blkid</code>. The fs type <code>auto</code> i changed few times...tried <code>vfat</code> too, but always on the reboot ubuntu stops when processing fstab (as i think) with the message (took from the log):</p>

<p><code>fsck from util-linux 2.20.1

mountall: Filesystem could not be mounted: /etc/fstab:

<p>And also - <code>sudo mount -a</code> never really does anything.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? I do suspect I messed up something:)</p>

<p>As it seems - fstab should hold only mounts for static drives, not any sort of usb stuff. I'm puzzled how then this works with all the people posting on the net their success stories...</p>

<p>however..if this is not possible - i would like to know how to remount my usb after every reboot...if not with fstab - than how?:)</p>

<pre><code>UUID=8C52-C1CD /home/storage auto user,umask=000,utf8, --&gt;noauto&lt;-- 0 0

<p>The ""noauto"" makes this NOT automatically mount when the system starts and parses the /etc/fstab file.  Remove that option and it will mount on startup. You can set the permissions on the mount point once it's mounted with <code>chmod</code> or specify them in /etc/fstab.  </p>

<p>If you need the media user to access it, you can set the permissions to 764, and add them to the security group. Root always has access to everything.  </p>

Is there some reason you need to use FAT ? If not, I would back up the data and use a linux native file system. You can then set ownership and permissions.</p>

<h3>Note:</h3>

<p><em>If you get an error massage saying something about ""root"" or ""permissions"" it is because for most mounting options you will need root privileges. In unity you can achieve that by prepending <code>gksudo</code> (graphical applications) or <code>sudo</code> to the usual command and typing your password.

<h2>Gigolo</h2>

<p>Gigolo is self-explanatory. It works hand in hand with nautilus' remote file system and mounting capabilities. You need to add the partitions to your nautilus bookmarks (nautilus is ubuntu's default file manager). After that you will find them in Gigolo. The rest is said <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/43363/how-to-auto-mount-using-sshfs/43380#43380"">another post</a> of mine.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Fstab</h2>

<p><em>Edit</em>: Since guessing from your comments you are not that acquainted with linux I will explain the procedure in more detail:</p>

<p>The fstab-method is cleaner and more basic than gui-tools or gigolo. It will also work on other systems even those that are text-mode only. In principle you don't need to install anything. For each ntfs-partition you will have to add one line to the file called <code>/etc/fstab</code>. For me the line I added looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>#Windows-Partition
UUID=&lt;xxxxx&gt; /media/win ntfs rw,auto,users,exec,nls=utf8,umask=003,gid=46,uid=1000    0   0
</code></pre>

<p>The part that says <code>UUID=&lt;xxxxx&gt;</code> tells your system which partition to mount. If you follow this procedure and have duplicate devices showing up, replace <code>UUID=&lt;xxxx&gt;</code> with <code>/dev/disk/by-uuid/&lt;xxxxx&gt;</code>.  Each partition has it's own unique UUID. Spaces are important, so best copy&amp;paste the line. Replace <code>auto</code> by <code>noauto</code> to manually mount. Users should be in the group <code>plugdev</code>.</p>

<p><em>Note that if this line is at the very end of your file there should be a newline after it. Mount will complain if you don't have it.</em></p>

<h3>finding the uuid:</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5isVN.png"" alt=""Disk Utility and blkid""></p>

<p>Open <strong>Disk Utility</strong> and identify the proper partitions by their size (e.g. 120 GB), file system (e.g. ntfs) and name. Note their ""Device:"" file (e.g. <code>/dev/sdb1</code>). Instead you can run the following command in a <strong>Terminal</strong> such as <code>gnome-terminal</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo fdisk -l
</code></pre>

<p>You can find out the uuid of your partitions by running <code>sudo blkid</code> in shell. The output looks somewhat like this: </p>

<pre><code>confus@confusion:~$ sudo blkid
[sudo] password for confus: 
/dev/sda1: LABEL=""boot"" UUID=""cc425c68-704f-4836-9123-bbb3aea64471"" TYPE=""ext2"" 
/dev/sda2: UUID=""1c8b1489-e111-481c-89f2-743203c3ee7d"" TYPE=""crypto_LUKS"" 
/dev/sda3: UUID=""7258CB9858CB598D"" TYPE=""ntfs"" 
/dev/sda4: LABEL=""HP_TOOLS"" UUID=""1405-0A4C"" TYPE=""vfat"" 
/dev/mapper/lukslvm: UUID=""xZSNtR-MocS-dLMk-vOWa-Ay65-wS9b-GqaNhV"" TYPE=""LVM2_member"" 
/dev/mapper/vgubuntu-swap: UUID=""f415f3b9-4e4d-48b1-99c2-605e16532f9e"" TYPE=""swap"" 
/dev/mapper/vgubuntu-root: UUID=""62a862b4-e6c8-4efd-90b5-55eab8e83e39"" TYPE=""ext4""
</code></pre>

<p>The correct UUID will have the proper device file in front of it and <code>TYPE=""ntfs""</code> after. So for me the UUID is ""7258CB9858CB598D"". For you this number will be different. Also I have only one NTFS partition. Subitute my UUID in the lines you add to fstab by the one you found this way.</p>

<h3>setting the mount point</h3>

<p>Now the mount-point. For each partition this will be different. I chooose <code>/media/win</code> You can choose whatever you like. It just has to be an existing empty folder. You could just as well create the folder <code>/home/yourusername/windows1</code> and then put it in your fstab.</p>

<h3>the other parameters in my line</h3>

<p><code>ntfs</code> just tells the fstab, that it is a ntfs-type partition.</p>

<p><code>rw,auto,user,exec,nls=utf8,umask=003,gid=46,uid=1000    0   0</code> need not concern you. Just use those values as they are. They should be fine. It not or if you're just intrested, you can read an explanation of these parameters in the <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab"" rel=""noreferrer"">link I provided</a> earlier.</p>

<p>When you added the lines and did all of the stuff I described, save the file and run <code>sudo mount -a</code> in shell. If you can access your partitions through their mountpoints and no errors are printed out, then all went well. If not check for typos and obvious errors. <strong>Don't reboot if <code>sudo mount -a</code> displays errors!</strong> With errors a reboot might fail.</p>

<h3>finding your user and group id</h3>

<p>You can find out your user and group id with the <code>id</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>confus@confusion:~$ id
uid=1000(confus) gid=1000(confus) groups=1000(confus),4(adm),7(lp),20(dialout),24(cdrom),46(plugdev),112(lpadmin),120(admin),122(sambashare)

<hr>

<p>As you have already <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/232497/how-to-access-gvfs-mounts-from-command-line"">found out</a>, the mountpoints are in <code>/run/user/$USER/gvfs/</code> and are named after the protocol, connection type and address they use. Which makes things more difficult, because the connection address may change every time you replug the device, even if it is the same port. If you have the same device twice it gets even worse.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>As you have noticed Nautilus also gives this information via tool tip. You will find the encoded form of e.g. <code>mtp://[usb:002,025]</code> in <code>/run/user/$USER/gvfs</code> (or <code>/var/run/user/$UID/gvfs</code>) as <code>mtp:host=%5Busb%3A002%2C025%5D</code></p>

<p>This assumes your locate-database is up to date but you can update this manually with: <code>sudo updatedb</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>grep</code> as explained by dr_willis.
One remark: <code>-R</code> after <code>grep</code> also searched within directories.
Example: </p>

<pre><code>cd\
grep -R {something_to_look_for} {where_to_look_in}

<p>If I recall correctly: <code>locate</code> is the fastest one (assuming your database is up to date) and <code>find</code> is the slowest one. And <code>grep</code> is the most complex but also the most versatile one of these since you can use regexes.</p>

<li>I installed something that crashed my Wifi drivers that I compiled earlier.</li>
<li>Un-installing the same package doesn't helped.</li>
<li>Finally, I re-compiled my wifi drivers and things are good.</li>
</ul>

<h3>My Question</h3>

<p><strong>But, is there anything like System Restore or System Rollback in Ubuntu/LinuxMint?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Is there anything that can <code>undo</code> an <code>apt-get install package</code> command?</li>
</ul>
","<p>The complement of <code>apt-get install package</code> is <code>apt-get remove package</code>. To remove all associated settings too, you need to run <code>apt-get purge package</code>.</p>

<p>Note that these commands rely on the uninstallation scripts provided with the package. All packages in the main repository I know of do their job of uninstalling very well. This may not be the case for third-party packages.</p>

<p>As for your driver issue, there are a few possibilities why installing a package broke your wireless driver:</p>

<ul>
<li>The driver has a post-installation hook which is executed when a condition is met, e.g. kernel updates</li>
<li>The package overwrote a file that the wireless driver depended on</li>
<li>The package in question was a kernel update but the driver does not have a post-installation hook for recompiling the driver (most likely)</li>
</ul>

<p>As for the ""System rollback"" / ""System Restore"" features, the closest feature you'll get is a system image using software like <a href=""http://clonezilla.org/"">Clonezilla</a>. Unfortunately, this cannot be done within a running system and must be performed from a Live CD.</p>

<p>We use <code>sudo apt-get install subversion</code> to install subversion on the server. </p>

<p>SVN client is only needed and we don't need the server on all machines.</p>

<p>Also we don't need GUI access on Ubuntu machines.</p>
","<p>Your question in fact contains the answer.</p>

<ol>
<li>Install the subversion commandline tool using <code>sudo apt-get install subversion</code>.</li>
<li>Use the client by typing the command <code>svn command [options] [args]</code>.</li>
<li>Do not do anything else. The server will not start and you can happily use the client without the server. You will also not have GUI access.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>subversion</code> package </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>includes the Subversion client (<code>svn</code>), repository administration tools
  (<code>svnadmin</code>, <code>svnlook</code>) and a network server (<code>svnserve</code>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Installing the whole packages (including both server and client) <em>might seem</em> like a lot of overhead, but it is the most <strong>easily maintainable solution</strong>. You easily get future updates, security releases and more. Also if ever one of your users desperately needs a subversion server, it is only a few commands away. </p>

<p>Use <code>svn --version</code> for the modules included:</p>

<pre><code>* ra_neon : Module for accessing a repository via WebDAV protocol using Neon.
  - handles 'http' scheme
  - handles 'https' scheme
* ra_svn : Module for accessing a repository using the svn network protocol.
  - with Cyrus SASL authentication
  - handles 'svn' scheme
* ra_local : Module for accessing a repository on local disk.
  - handles 'file' scheme
* ra_serf : Module for accessing a repository via WebDAV protocol using serf.
  - handles 'http' scheme
  - handles 'https' scheme
</code></pre>

<p>and use <code>svn --help</code> for more information. The available commands illustrate that the <code>subversion</code> package is the way to go.</p>

<p>I've heard about <code>fglrx</code>, but if I try to install it on my machine, it breaks and I have no GUI.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to get my AMD card working to its full potential?</p>
","<h1>PRE-NOTES</h1>

<p>This answer also applies to the latest HWE upgrade for 14.04 (AKA 14.04.5). That upgrade brings Xorg and the kernel to the versions on 16.04. Read below for more details on why this is important.</p>

<h1>BACKGROUND</h1>

<p>Let's start off with a general description.</p>

<p>With the release of Ubuntu 16.04, came the lack of proprietary drivers for AMD. ""Why?"" you might ask. Well, it's because of a few things.</p>

<p>Firstly, it's just not compatible. You won't find <code>fglrx</code> in 16.04 repositories, nor will you find a version for 16.04 online. If you download the latest version from AMD's website and install it, you'll run into Low Graphics Mode, blank screens, and other nasty stuff you don't want to happen.</p>

<p>You might be hoping that AMD will step in to update the driver, but then you must not know AMD's reputation for ditching support for even slightly older cards on Linux. Since AMD doesn't want to update the driver, Canonical could make one for Ubuntu, except it won't. Since 16.04 is an LTS release, Canonical would have to maintain an AMD driver for at least 5 years, which would be hard to do. </p>

<p>There's always the possibility that AMD will release another widely compatible graphics driver or that people might just move away from AMD on Linux. It doesn't make sense to spend a lot of effort on a driver for a few Linux OSes (doing it for all would be harder), which would still have to be supported if a new driver came out from AMD.</p>

<p>More on this here: <a href=""http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/03/ubuntu-drops-amd-catalyst-fglrx-driver-16-04"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/03/ubuntu-drops-amd-catalyst-fglrx-driver-16-04</a></p>

<hr>

<h1>PERFORMANCE</h1>

<p>Now, just because you don't have a proprietary driver doesn't necessarily mean you'll have a terrible time. After all, Intel does it just fine.</p>

<p>If you just use your computer for web browsing, email, answering/asking questions here, a few YouTube videos, and not much else, then the lack of proprietary drivers probably won't bother you. You may notice some stutter in video, and you may not. Honestly, there's no way to tell beforehand.</p>

<p>If you game, use rendering applications, 3D modeling programs, or any other graphically advanced or intense software, you're in a much more complicated situation.</p>

<p>Personally, I've mostly seen reports here and on reviews and articles elsewhere that say AMD with open source drivers is terrible: programs don't work, since they need OpenGL/CL versions that the default drivers can't provide; games are laggy and stuttery; videos cut out, and take the audio with them; etc. However, I've also seen a few people say they can game just fine, videos are perfect, and there's no trouble.</p>

<p>This contradiction may be due to the two different open source drivers available: <code>radeon</code> and <code>AMDGPU</code>. <code>AMDGPU</code> provides better performance I believe, but it's only available for newer cards. Older cards (which to AMD could mean 6 months if you're unlucky) are stuck with <code>radeon</code>, and a search of Google and Ask Ubuntu will show you there's no way to switch which one you're using. At least, there's no way that's been released.</p>

<p>Just like with many things, you can't know what will happen unless you try, so if you're willing to risk an upgrade, go ahead.</p>

<hr>

<h1>OPTIONS</h1>

<p>So maybe you took the plunge, hoping you'd have the card that would get <code>AMDGPU</code>, but weren't so lucky. Maybe you installed or upgraded without knowing the situation with AMD. Maybe you got <code>AMDGPU</code> and it just isn't enough. Whatever the reason you're on 16.04 with AMD graphics, there are a few options for you.
<br><br><br>
 1. <strong>The first, and most obvious, is to just to downgrade to 14.04</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>It's still supported until 2019, so you have 2-3 more years to use it. Who knows? By that time, AMD may have decided to completely change its business model and actually provide good support.</li>
<li>You get to use <code>fglrx</code> and get the performance you want/need.</li>
<li><strong>Please Note:</strong> 14.04.5 brought with it Xorg 1.18, which is what causes the problem in 16.04 to begin with. Luckily, it is completely possible to downgrade Xorg to 1.16 (<strong>on 14.04</strong>), so you can still use <code>fglrx</code>. Read <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/676216/downgrade-xorg-server"">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe 14.04 is too old for you, though. Maybe it doesn't have compatibility for that new application you use so much. Maybe you don't want to go through the trouble of backing up data and reinstalling. Well, there is another option.
<br><br><br>
 2. <strong>Try out <a href=""https://launchpad.net/~oibaf/+archive/ubuntu/graphics-drivers"" rel=""noreferrer"">Oibaf's drivers</a>.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>They work for AMD, NVIDIA and Intel, so you can even try them out if you dislike NVIDIA's proprietary drivers or are hoping for more performance from your Intel card.</li>
<li>They support newer OpenGL and OpenCL versions, so stuff that depends on those will work. </li>
<li>They claim to be optimized, so you could see an real boost in performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oibaf's driver seems like a great replacement to <code>fglrx</code>, and it probably is. However, if you have a really recent AMD card, you may want to try out AMD's own offering.
<br><br><br>
 3. <strong><a href=""http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/AMDGPU-PRO-Driver-for-Linux-Release-Notes.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">AMDGPU-PRO</a></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It's proprietary and maintained by AMD, so it should provide the same performance as <code>fglrx</code> did.</li>
<li>It actually works on 14.04 too, so you can try it if you're still on that.</li>
<li><strong>UPDATE</strong>: 16.60 was released, which adds support for quite a few older (3-4 years old) cards. Link updated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, AMDGPU-PRO is <strong>not</strong> a true replacement for <code>fglrx</code>. While it does provide support for 16.04, it's only compatible 20 models. That's not very much.</p>

<p>If you don't care about performance, or you already have what you need, then don't bother with all the proprietary stuff, downgrading or weird installations.
<br><br><br>
 4. <strong>Just stick with the open source drivers.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>No hassle to install, since they're already running.</li>
<li>They provide you everything you need if you don't do anything special.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just be aware that these won't generally work for games, especially high end ones.
<br><br><br>
 5. <strong>Downgrade Xorg</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>This will not work on 16.04.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>It may work, it may break your system until you reinstall the correct version. However, if it does work, then you have <code>fglrx</code> back.</p>

<p>Read the answer <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/676216/downgrade-xorg-server"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Options are far from limited on 16.04, but some of them may not be the best. I recommend trying Oibaf's driver before doing anything else, and only downgrading if you really can't stand the performance and can't use AMDGPU-PRO.</p>

"Does ssh key need to be named id_rsa?","125098","","<p>I have come across this problem a couple of times when creating build servers with keyed authentication. </p>

<p>I was wondering if anyone else has experience this. I have a couple of keys for my current user that may connect to different machines. Let say machine1 and machine2. I have pasted my public key into their respective authorized_keys file. The first one I have named the first key id_rsa and the second key bender. </p>

<p>When I try to connect to bender I get the following output with my verbose ssh connection </p>

<pre><code>debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sent
debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS
debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS received
debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST sent
debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey
debug1: Next authentication method: publickey
debug1: Trying private key: /home/bozo/.ssh/.ssh/identity
debug1: Trying private key: /home/bozo/.ssh/.ssh/id_rsa
debug1: Trying private key: /home/bozo/.ssh/id_dsa
debug1: No more authentication methods to try.
Permission denied (publickey).
</code></pre>

<p>It only offers the id_rsa key, as you can see above. Is this correct? If so why? How do I get it to offer more keys? I know it is a problem I see intermittently, because I at home I have multiple keys without much trouble. </p>

<p>I would also appreciate a overview on how the pub and private keys interact with the client and server. I thought I had a pretty decent idea, but apparently I am missing something. </p>

<p>Please and thank you. </p>
","<p>By default, ssh searches for <code>id_dsa</code> and <code>id_rsa</code> files. The keys do not have to be named like this, you can name it <code>mykey</code> just as well, or even place it in a different directory. However, if you do either of those, then you need to explicitly reference the key in the ssh command like so:</p>

<pre><code>ssh user@server -i /path/to/mykey
</code></pre>

<p>If a command does not accept <code>-i</code>, e.g. <code>sshfs</code>, use the <code>IdentityFile</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>sshfs -o IdentityFile=/path/to/mykey user@host:/path/on/remote /mountpoint
</code></pre>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>When generating a key, you'll get two files: <code>id_rsa</code> (private key) and <code>id_rsa.pub</code> (public key). As their names suggest, the private key should be kept secret and the public key can be published to the public.</p>

<p>Public-key authentication works with a public and a private key. Both the client and the server have their own keys. When installing <code>openssh-server</code> the server public and private keys are generated automatically. For the client, you'll have to do that on your own.</p>

<p>When you (client) connect with a server, public keys are exchanged. You'll receive the servers one, and the server yours. The first time you receive the server public key, you'll be asked to accept it. If this public key changes over a time, you'll be warned because a possible MITM (Man in the middle) attack is going on, intercepting the traffic between the client and the server.</p>

<p>The server checks whether you are allowed to connect (defined in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>) and if your public key is listed in the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file. Possible reasons why the public key is denied:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:

<ul>
<li><code>AllowUsers</code> or <code>AllowGroups</code> is specified, but your server user is not listed in the groups or users list (default not defined, placing no restriction on the users or groups from logging in).</li>
<li><code>DenyUsers</code> or <code>DenyGroups</code> is specified and you're in the users or groups list.</li>
<li>You're trying to login as root, but <code>PermitRootLogin</code> is set to <code>No</code> (default <code>yes</code>).</li>
<li><code>PubkeyAuthentication</code> is set to <code>No</code> (default <code>yes</code>).</li>
<li><code>AuthorizedKeysFile</code> is set to a different location, and the public keys are not added to that file (default <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, relative to home dir)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>: your public key is not added in this file (note that this file is read as root user)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using multiple keys</h2>

<p>It's not uncommon to use multiple keys. Instead of running <code>ssh user@host -i /path/to/identity_file</code>, you can use a configuration file, <code>~/.ssh/config</code>.</p>

<p>Common settings are the IdentityFile (the keys) and port. The next configuration will check ""id_dsa"" and ""bender"" only when connecting with <code>ssh youruser@yourhost</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Host yourhost
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/bender
</code></pre>

<p>If you omit <code>Host yourhost</code>, the settings will apply to all SSH connections. Other options can also be specified for this host match, like <code>User youruser</code>, <code>Port 2222</code>, etc. This would allow you to connect with the shorthand <code>ssh yourhost</code> instead of <code>ssh -p2222 youruser@yourhost -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa -i ~/.ssh/bender</code>.</p>
