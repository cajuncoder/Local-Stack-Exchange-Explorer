"How long will uncooked chicken keep in the fridge?","1300431","","<p>My wife is obsessed about not leaving uncooked meats in the fridge longer than a day (esp. Chicken). If we buy chicken breast and we're not going to use them the next day, she'll put them in the freezer. I always tell her it should be OK at least a week, but she thinks I'm crazy.  Can anyone give me some factual ammo I could use against her?</p>
","<p>Sorry, USDA recommends 1-2 days of refrigerated storage (40°F). Beyond that and you're tempting fate a bit. You're gonna have to eat some humble pie for your wife on this one (just don't ask here for the recipe).</p>

"What temperatures should I keep my refrigerator and freezer set at?","1235883","","<p>For a refrigerator, if it's cooler, items like milk and meat last a bit longer. However if I set it close to freezing then some items start showing frost on them. What temperature should I set my refrigerator to for best overall results?</p>

<p>Since the person answering is likely to know, I'm also asking what temperature I should set my freezer to.</p>
","<p>Daniel is spot-on with <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/4531/60"">his answer</a>. I'll elaborate on it a bit here.</p>

<p>As indicated by his bottled water in the freezer trick, a full freezer is a happy freezer. The same applies to the refrigerator too. While I wouldn't put random bottles of water throughout my refrigerator, it's important to know that the fuller your refrigerator is, the more it holds its temperature when opening/closing, and the less energy you'll use. However, you don't want to <em>jam pack</em> it so full that there isn't any airflow around your stuff, because this can hamper the cooling efficiency as well.</p>

<p>The ideal refrigerator temperature is 35°F (1.6°C). You're not hugging the danger zone like you would be at 40°F (4.4°C), and you're distancing yourself sufficiently from 32°F (0°C) that you don't freeze half the stuff in your refrigerator. That said, the temperature within your fridge can vary rather significantly with normal usage.</p>

<p>The coldest parts of your refrigerator are the back, and the bottom. The back because the cooling element is there, and the bottom because warm air rises. If items you don't want frosty are getting frosty, then move them away from the back of the fridge. I would avoid putting items in the door of your fridge that are particularly sensitive to spoilage. The items in the door of your fridge can easily get as high as 59°F (15°C), and do so often. Putting milk and eggs in your door will significantly decrease their shelf life. Butter is OK in the little covered section in the door, because the door actually helps keep it's temperature a little better. You also generally don't want rock solid frozen butter. </p>

<p>So, put your meats on the bottom shelf in the back, your condiments (mayo, ketchup, mustard, etc.) in the door, and put everything else where it fits.</p>

"How do I know if food left at room temperature is still safe to eat?","1018663","","<p>If I left food out of the refrigerator for some period of time, is it still safe? If I left it out too long, can I salvage it by cooking it more?</p>
","<h2>When in Doubt, Throw it Out!</h2>

<p>You cannot always see or smell bacterial contamination. Mold that appears to be growing only on the surface may grow invisible roots into softer foods. Do not rely on a visual inspection or ""smell test"" to tell you whether or not a food is safe. It's not worth the risk - food poisoning can be much, much worse than an upset stomach.</p>

<h2>The Danger Zone</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Potentially hazardous food that stays in the temperature ""danger zone"", 40-140 °F (4-60 °C), for more than 2 hours should be discarded.</strong><sup>*</sup></p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentially_Hazardous_Food"" rel=""noreferrer"">Potentially hazardous</a> foods are those foods that spoil most easily, such as unshelled eggs, raw meats, fish, shell fish, dairy products, almost all cooked foods.</p></li>
<li><p>This time is <em>cumulative</em>, so it includes time bringing the food home from the grocery store, time before cooking, time after cooking, and so on.   The reason is that while cooking may destroy bacteria or other pathogens, it doesn't always destroy the toxins that they have produced.</p></li>
<li><p>So in general, regarding perishable foods like meat, most dairy, unshelled eggs and <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/2947/3649"">shell eggs (in the US)</a>, cooked casseroles, and so on:  if the food (or its perishable components) have been at room temperature for more than two hours, you should discard that food.</p></li>
<li><p>To avoid the danger zone, keep cooked food hot until ready to eat, then refrigerate immediately. Separate large items into smaller containers to help them to cool more quickly. If you’re defrosting something, do it in the fridge or under cold running water.</p></li>
<li>If you can be certain that the food was not in the danger zone, then yes, it is safe. For example, if you left a large chunk of frozen meat out and it is still frozen solid when you come back to it, it was not in the danger zone. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Why does cooking not completely ""reset the clock""?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Some bacteria leave behind harmful protein toxins that cannot be ""killed"" (denatured) by cooking.</strong> Cooking food is only effective against live organisms, not their toxic waste products. Spoiled food cannot be cooked back to safety and <em>must</em> be discarded.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cooking is pasteurization, not sterilization.</strong> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pasteurization</a> means killing <em>most</em> microbes, so as to render the food safe for human consumption.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)#Foods"" rel=""noreferrer"">Sterilization</a> methods (e.g. pressure-canning and irradiation) are the only safe methods for longer-term room-temperature storage. Otherwise, the danger zone rules always apply.</p></li>
<li><p>Even sterilized food can only <em>remain</em> sterile under an airtight seal, e.g. when properly canned or vacuum-sealed. Once it is opened, it is no longer sterile. Air contains countless bacteria and molds, and their spores, which will readily re-colonize any suitable environment they encounter. Cooked food tends to be an ideal medium for growth.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>What can I leave out longer?</h2>

<p>For foods that aren't potentially hazardous as described above, there's no solid rule, but things are generally safe for much longer than the 2 hours given above. For example, things which are sold at room temperature (e.g. fresh produce, bread, or cookies) are most likely safe at least all day or overnight if not for days or even months. You can find guidelines for common things at <a href=""http://www.stilltasty.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">StillTasty</a>.</p>

<h2>Regulation and Risks</h2>

<p>Follow the guidelines set out by reputable regulatory agencies, <strong>especially</strong> when serving others. Local organizations include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/FoodCode/default.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">FDA Food Code</a> (USDA)</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.inspection.gc.ca/about-the-cfia/acts-and-regulations/eng/1299846777345/1299847442232"" rel=""noreferrer"">CFIA</a> (Canada)</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.food.gov.uk/enforcement/regulation/#.UbybmfnVB8F"" rel=""noreferrer"">Food Standards Agency</a> (UK)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other regulatory sources apply in other parts of the word, but major food safety organizations usually agree in essence (if not in complete detail) on most issues.</p>

<p>Failure to follow reputable guidelines is irresponsible if you are serving guests, and failure to follow your specific local codes is likely to be illegal if you are serving customers.</p>

<p>Health codes tend to be very conservative, to fully protect the community.    You have the right to take risks on yourself by ignoring their recommendations, but please do not risk the safety of others.</p>

<h2>Again, When in Doubt...</h2>

<p>Once again, if you suspect spoilage or contamination, <em>please, <strong>throw it out.</em></strong></p>

<p><sub>* Note: this is the FDA's rule. Other agencies may have variations on it. Additionally, government agencies generally make very conservative recommendations - they're trying to make sure that <em>no one</em> who follows the rules gets sick. Breaking the rules means maybe taking on some risk. That's up to you - just remember, eventually someone gets unlucky, and food poisoning is not fun.</sub></p>

"What's the difference between latte, mocha, and all the other drinks on a coffee-house menu?","862556","","<p>There are many different coffee-based drinks on an average coffee-house menu.  But what makes them different from each other?  What are the differences / distinguishing characteristics between: latte, caffe misto, cappuccino, mocha, macchiato, Americano, and Cafe Au Lait?</p>
","<ol>
<li><p>Espresso: This is a finely ground very dark roast coffee, packed somewhat tightly in a special metal filter, with water ""expressed"" through it under pressure.  A very strong dark coffee, typically served in 1-2 ounce portions. Very commonly incorrectly called ""Expresso.""</p></li>
<li><p>Americano:  Italians typically don't drink American Strength coffee.  They drink espresso in tiny cups.  Then the tourists came and wanted a mug of coffee like they get at home.  The Italian solution was to make an espresso and keep the water running through the grounds to weaken the coffee, and make the desired quantity. (edit: Some locations may simply add hot water to the espresso in the cup. This doesn't change the basic concept.)  An Americano is simply an espresso that has been drawn out with extra water to an American strength beverage -- Not to be confused with the typical brewed coffee, which is usually filtered. </p></li>
<li><p>Caffe au Lait: This is strong filtered or brewed coffee (not espresso), with warmed milk. This is probably the easiest specialty coffee to make at home.  Just scald some milk in a pot and pour it over strongly brewed coffee.</p></li>
<li><p>Cappuccino:  A 1:1:1 ratio of espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam.  Typically the milk is steamed through a special high pressure steam pipe on the espresso machine. This serves two functions.  To warm up the milk and to create a stiff foam on the top.  When pouring, the foam is held back with a spoon, and then scooped out on top.  I'll arbitrarily define the cappuccino as the base beverage for all that follow.</p></li>
<li><p>Macchiato: Typically in North America, this is a cappuccino, but with the steamed milk component missing.  That is, it is espresso and frothed milk foam only.  Also called a ""Dry"" Cappuccino. Macchiato has different meanings elsewhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Latte: A ""wet"" cappuccino.  Hold back the foam with a spoon, and pour the warm milk over the espresso.  Put a little bit of foam on top for decoration only.</p></li>
<li><p>Mocha: Any one of the above espresso + milk drinks with chocolate added.  Some places will add hot chocolate to the drink, others will add a chocolate syrup.  A mocha latte is the common preparation.  Not to be confused with Mocha beans, which are an Ethiopian coffee bean which has a little bit of a naturally occurring chocolate flavour.</p></li>
<li><p>Misto: A Starbucks synonym for a Cafe au Lait. </p></li>

"Is it safe to eat potatoes that have sprouted?","676864","","<p>I'm talking about potatoes that have gone somewhat soft and put out shoots about 10cm long. </p>

<p>Other online discussions suggest it's reasonably safe and the majority of us have been peeling and eating soft sprouty spuds for years. Is this correct?</p>
","<p>Not safe enough for me to try it. Potatoes actually contain a very dangerous toxin called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanine"">solanine</a>. This toxin is concentrated enough in the green parts in the plant to cause solanine poisoning. This includes the sprouts/eyes, and the potato itself if it's green.</p>

<p>This <a href=""http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/poison/potato-poisoning-green-tubers-and-sprouts/overview.html"">article</a> from the New York Times health guide indicates that it is something to be taken seriously. Per this article, if the sprouts have been removed, and the potato is not green then it is safe to eat as far as solanine poisoning is concerned. </p>

<p>However, a potato as far gone as you have described sounds <em>disgusting</em>. A <em>soft</em> potato is on its way to going bad. Where I am from, potatoes are cheap enough that it's just not worth the gross factor for me to eat a potato that has 10 cm sprouts and is squishy. I do eat potatoes that have little nub sprouts on them and that are slightly less than firm, after removing the sprouts of course.</p>

"How to quickly and safely defrost chicken?","673126","","<p>What is the safest, quick way to defrost chicken? Microwave? Running water over it?</p>
","<p>I suppose that depends on what you're defrosting it <em>for</em>.</p>

<p>The microwave (on low power) is safe and quick.  The downside is that you're using a microwave, which means there's a good chance you'll actually cook the outside slightly in the process, and you're killing enzymes that are normally part of the flavour.  The lower the heat, the less the impact of this, but it's still a problem.  If I'm preparing the meat for marinating, stir-fry, etc., something with a powerful or thick sauce, then I wouldn't worry about it, but if it's going onto a grill with just a little bit of seasoning, you might want to avoid this.</p>

<p>Running it under warm water would seem to work, but I've found that it takes forever to defrost this way (the exterior will loosen up but the interior stays stubbornly frozen), and you're soaking it in the process.  This really isn't suitable if you need to pound or fold the meat or do anything complicated with it.</p>

<p>I would use the microwave if desperate, but it's really best to thaw the meat in the refrigerator or, if you're in a bit of a hurry, the sink.  It takes longer, but it'll turn out much better than the microwave in terms of flavour and tenderness.</p>

<p>P.S. One other word of advice: If you're making a dish that requires the chicken to be cut or sliced, it's best <em>not</em> to defrost it all the way.  It's easier to cut when frozen, and will defrost very quickly once it's in pieces.  I'm mainly talking about the breast here, this doesn't work so well with meat stuck to bones.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I'm noticing a lot of recent hubbub about the dangers of defrosting in the sink / on the countertop or using warm water and I wanted to clarify something.  Please note that that the advice above applies to chicken that will be <strong>immediately cooked after defrosting</strong> and that the defrosting is done over a period <strong>shorter than 2 hours</strong>.</p>

<p>Raw chicken must <strong>not</strong> be kept at any temperature above 40° F <em>(4.4° C)</em> for more than an hour or so.  Do not defrost a chicken breast in the sink and then toss it back in the fridge.  <em>Definitely</em> don't try to defrost a whole bird this way - stick to the refrigerator or very cold running water.</p>

<p>As long as you follow the above precautions and cook the chicken thoroughly (up to an internal temperature of 165° F), you're not in any serious danger of salmonella poisoning, even if the original piece of meat was contaminated - and most chicken sold today <em>is</em> contaminated, for the record.</p>

<p>If the meat is going back in the refrigerator for marinating or you plan to delay cooking for any other reason, then you <em>need</em> to either thaw it very fast (using the microwave) or at a very low temperature (using the refrigerator or cold running water).</p>

How much damage can one more thawing and refreezing really do?  Can it really be that dangerous disease wise? Or is this just one of those urban myths?</p>
","<p>In theory you could thaw and refreeze as many times as you like, though the changes in temperature would definitely alter the quality of the meat's taste and texture.</p>

<p>What matters most is how long the meat has been in the so-called ""danger zone"" speaking from a temperature perspective. The ""danger zone"" is defined as being between 41 to 135 °F (5 to 57 °C).</p>

<p>Here is an excerpt from <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=GYNmPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=the%20professional%20chef&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions"">The Professional Chef, by the Culinary Institute of America</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Foods left in the danger zone for a period longer than four hours are considered adulterated. Additionally, one should be fully aware that the four-hour period is cumulative, meaning that the meter starts running again every time the food enters the danger zone.

How quickly will milk spoil (unopened) in warm summer weather like that? </p>
","<p>I don't think anything will be wrong with that milk.</p>

<ol>
<li>If it's fresh milk, which I doubt, you should consume it in less than three days.</li>
<li>If it's pasteurized milk, which is much more likely, it'll be unaffected.</li>
</ol>

<p>Signs of spoilage are a sour smell and sour taste. You should make a habit of always smelling your milk (food) before drinking (eating) it. If it doesn't smell like you'd expect, taste it. If it doesn't taste like you'd expect, ditch it.</p>

<p>Milk is cultivated with lactobacillus, a bacteria that's beneficial for us. So, even though milk may taste sour, it doesn't mean that it's undrinkable. In Holland, there's sour-milk (karnemelk), that some people consume (I don't like it, myself).</p>

"Is there a problem with defrosting meat on the counter?","513629","","<p>I generally defrost meat on the kitchen counter. A friend of mine suggested that this was dangerous and suggested that I defrost meat in the refrigerator. I am no biologist but it seems to me that as long as the meat doesn't get warm defrosting it on the counter should be safe.</p>

<p>Generally, I remove the frozen items from the freezer and place them on a plate on the counter in the packaging they were frozen in. When they are mostly / completely thawed I place the meat in the refrigerator.</p>

<p>Am I wrong and should I be defrosting in the refrigerator?</p>
","<p>A lot of bacteria grows in the range of 40-100°F (4-38°C) (i.e. room temperature). It's definitely not recommended to defrost meat at room temperature. In fact, you are not supposed to leave meat at room temperature for more than an hour. </p>

<p>However, defrosting in the refrigerator can take a long time and require you to plan at least one day ahead of time. I'm not so good at this, which leads to a safe and fast solution: Defrost meat in a waterproof ziploc bag in cold water. Change the water every 30 minutes until defrosted. The water is a better  conductor of heat than air, so the defrosting is quite fast and the water is cold so there's minimal safety risk.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Uh, oh! You're home and forgot to
  defrost something for dinner. You grab
  a package of meat or chicken and use
  hot water to thaw it fast. But is this
  safe? What if you remembered to take
  food out of the freezer, but forgot
  and left the package on the counter
  all day while you were at work?</p>
  
  <p>Neither of these situations are safe,
  and these methods of thawing lead to
  foodborne illness. Food must be kept
  at a safe temperature during ""the big
  thaw."" Foods are safe indefinitely
  while frozen. However, as soon as food
  begins to defrost and become warmer
  than 40 °F (4 °C), any bacteria that may have
  been present before freezing can begin
  to multiply.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Foods should never be thawed or even
  stored on the counter, or defrosted in
  hot water. Food left above 40 °F
  (unrefrigerated) is not at a safe
  temperature.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Even though the center of the package
  may still be frozen as it thaws on the
  counter, the outer layer of the food
  is in the ""Danger Zone,"" between 40
  and 140 °F (4 °C and 60 °C) – at temperatures where
  bacteria multiply rapidly.</p>
  
  <p>When defrosting frozen foods, it's
  best to plan ahead and thaw food in
  the refrigerator where food will
  remain at a safe, constant temperature
  – 40 °F (4 °C) or below.</p>
  
  <p>There are three safe ways to defrost
  food: in the refrigerator, in cold
  water, and in the microwave.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Refrigerator Thawing Planning ahead is
  the key to this method because of the
  lengthy time involved. A large frozen
  item like a turkey requires at least a
  day (24 hours) for every 5 pounds of
  weight. Even small amounts of frozen
  food -- such as a pound of ground meat
  or boneless chicken breasts -- require
  a full day to thaw.</strong> When thawing foods
  in the refrigerator, there are several
  variables to take into account. Some
  areas of an appliance may keep the
  food colder than other areas. Food
  placed in the coldest part will
  require longer defrosting time. Food
  takes longer to thaw in a refrigerator
  set at 35 °F (2 °C) than one set at 40 °F (4 °C).</p>
  
  <p>After thawing in the refrigerator,
  ground meat and poultry should remain
  useable for an additional day or two
  before cooking; red meat, 3 to 5 days.
  Foods defrosted in the refrigerator
  can be refrozen without cooking,
  although there may be some loss of
  quality.</p>
  
  <p>Cold Water Thawing</p>
  
  <p>This method is faster than
  refrigerator thawing but requires more
  attention. The food must be in a
  leak-proof package or plastic bag. If
  the bag leaks, bacteria from the air
  or surrounding environment could be
  introduced into the food. Also, meat
  tissue can also absorb water like a
  sponge, resulting in a watery product.</p>
  
  <p><strong>The bag should be submerged in cold
  tap water, changing the water every 30
  minutes so it continues to thaw. Small
  packages of meat or poultry – about a
  pound – may defrost in an hour or
  less.</strong> A 3- to 4-pound package may take
  2 to 3 hours. For whole turkeys,
  estimate about 30 minutes per pound.
  If thawed completely, the food must be
  cooked immediately. </p>
  
  <p>Foods thawed by the cold water method
  should be cooked before refreezing.</p>

"Is it bad to cook frozen meat without thawing it?","459684","","<p>I wonder if it is bad to cook frozen meat (chicken, fish, beef,...) without waiting for it to thaw?</p>

<p>Sometimes, I realize I forget to take meat out of my freezer beforehand, when I am too hungry already.</p>
","<p>It's really a question of taste.  It's not going to <em>hurt</em> you, but there will be some undesirable effects.  For example, to cook turkey properly, it must come to an internal temp. of 180. If the meat is frozen, it is going to take a lot longer for the internal temperature to rise that high, so the outside of the bird will be somewhat overcooked (compared to roasting a thawed bird). That meat will be much tougher than it would be otherwise.</p>

<p>If your question is querying as to whether it will cause ill health, then no, it will not. My mom does it all the time.  Her roasts are tough, though. I have done this, but only when I am braising the meat, or using a slow cooker, which will cause the meat to be tender either way.</p>

"Is it safe to leave cooked poultry at room temperature overnight?","391026","","<p>Assuming that I've already cooked the poultry (or eggs) to recommended temperatures - does it need to be refrigerated immediately, or is it safe to eat if it's been left at room temperature overnight?</p>
","<p>Time for a safety lesson.</p>

<p>When you are dealing with food products that can spoil, what you are concerned about is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_zone_%28food_safety%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Danger Zone</a>, which is the temperature range at which bacteria multiplies fastest. While specific numbers will vary, a decent rule of thumb is 4-60 degrees Celsius. What that means is any food prone to spoilage must be kept <em>out</em> of that temperature range, and if it is going to be within that temperature range, it must be for less than four hours, aggregated across the product's lifetime. What this also means is that when you are chilling hot food you need to do so as fast as possible, in order to minimize the time spent in the Danger Zone. </p>

<p>Foods that are dangerous are the ones you would expect: anything which requires refrigeration. Potatoes, for example, are perfectly safe to keep at room temperature <em>when raw</em>, but must be refrigerated once cooked. (Perhaps a poor example, as potatoes fare better when kept below room temp but above fridge temp, but you catch my drift I hope). So we're talking about raw meats, most dairy (very hard cheeses may be kept at room temp with no ill effects other than possible softening), many vegetables and fruits, that sort of thing. Eggs and butter can be considered a somewhat special case; eggs can be kept at room temp with few problems (and in fact eggs used to be kept right out on kitchen counters, in the shell of course, not after they have been cracked), while butter can generally be kept at room temperature for a few days before the fats will start to become rancid (anecdata: we <em>never</em> kept butter in the fridge when I was a kid, except for butter my mother needed for baking, where the temperature is a matter of physics in the recipe, and not health. Never had any problems.) Harder vegetables--potatoes, carrots, parsnips--can generally be kept at room temp without problems, as can many fruits--apples, oranges (all thick-rind citrus really), bananas, and so on.</p>

<p>So. According to the food safety experts, you absolutely should not leave even cooked poultry out overnight, as any bacterial contamination will be severe after a few hours. In real terms, unless you are very young/old or immunocompromised in some way (e.g. leukemia, chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS, etc) you're <em>probably</em> going to be okay. I am a professional chef, and at home I'm pretty lackadaisical about expiry dates, how long most things have been sitting out, etc. In the context of work, however, I am extremely anal about rapid chilling/heating and keeping food safe, and I will always advise other people to be cautious with their food; what I choose to do with my own body is my concern. <strong>When In Doubt, Throw It Out</strong> is <em>always</em> good advice; there's a reason it was stencilled across the inside of the walk-in refrigerator door at one restaurant I worked at.</p>

<p>You should also bear in mind that much of the time bacterial contamination is <em>not</em> detectable by the eye, nose, or tongue until it has become severe. Even when contamination is not detectable with our senses, serious illness can occur (see, for example, recent outbreaks of <em>E. coli</em>, listeria, and salmonella, none of which can be detected with eyes/nose/tongue). So the 'smell test,' while in use by almost everyone who cooks food, is really not all that reliable as a gauge for spoilage; taste and smell can definitively say that a given product has gone bad, but it <em>cannot</em> say that a given product is definitively okay to eat.</p>

<p>(As a side note on food safety, if cheese has gone mouldy, don't trim off the mouldy bits. Just throw it out. While much of the time any such mould will be entirely harmless, it's not worth taking the chance over, especially given that if mold has bloomed on the surface of the cheese, spores will be present on the entire surface, with penetration into the cheese itself. Seriously, just toss it, and re-examine how you store your cheese and/or how much you're buying at a time).</p>

<p>Even easier to remember: keep hot food hot (above 60C) and cold food cold (below 4C). Make things hot as fast as possible, and cold as fast as possible.</p>

<p>(Note that I am a cooking professional, not a medical professional, and nothing here should be construed as medical advice. Always err on the side of caution.)</p>

"Is it bad to leave the crock pot on ""warm"" (not low) all day?","378305","","<p>I just bought all the ingredients to make a soup in the crock pot. I was planning on having it cook all day, but I just realized the recipe only calls for it to cook on low for 3-4 hours. If I cook it on low for 3-4 hours, and then put it on warm before I leave for work, will it be a bacteria minefield or will it be warm enough to keep the food safe from bacteria?</p>
","<p>I suspect ""warm"" is meant to maintain temperature, rather than raise it. My crock pots are too ancient to have anything other than ""high"" and ""low"", so I can't assert any real authority. However, if you reach 145F within the first hour at the highest setting, then keep it at ""warm"", and test the temperature after about 30 minutes with an instant-read thermometer and it stays around 140-160F, you'll probably be fine. Personally, I'd test the temperature first by cooking water.</p>

<p>If the temperature stays above 140F at low, the worst risk you'll have is overcooking. Beans  and vegetables like carrots and celery can overcook fairly easily in a crock pot, but higher collagen meats meant for stews tend to be fine when cooked for extended periods. Most crock pot recipes for stews and soups usually hold fine when at low for a full workday, although that's presuming a somewhat 70s-era soup aesthetic, which is probable for a crockpot recipe.</p>

<p>However, I would be inclined to attempt the recipe using the low setting rather than reducing it to warm, if you're not going to test the temperature first. If it turns out to be overcooked, you can always puree the ingredients with a blender...</p>

<p>I also doubt that switching to ""warm"" would be dramatically less likely to overcook the food than ""low"", unless it holds at a pretty stable 140F, and low ends up somewhere around 160F.</p>

","<p>I don't think a pork sirloin roast will stand up to that kind of cooking very well.  That is a very lean piece of meat, which does not lend itself to long cooking times at low temperatures.

If you put a pork sirloin roast in your cooker for 8 hours on low, you're going to have one tough, dry piece of meat when you are through.</p>

<p>You would be better served by cooking it in the oven at higher heat, for a relatively short period of time, like 400F for an hour or so.  Bear in mind, you're not going to get to a fall-apart tender state with a sirloin roast.  This isn't a pork butt with which you're dealing, which you'd take up to an internal temperature of 195F or more.  Rather, you're going to want to target the safe temperature, and no higher.

","<p>What Tim said. Eggs just don't hold very well, and they are very sensitive to temperature--reheating them basically will mean re-cooking them. I would never store eggs in this manner, because the texture and flavour degradation will make them unpleasant to eat.</p>

<p>So here's the setting. I'm making vichyssoise, because I'm intrigued by the possibility of making a dish that has no color at all. I've been instructed to ""bring to a boil and simmer the soup for 35 minutes.""</p>

<li><a href=""http://answers.ask.com/Sports/Other/what_does_simmer_mean"" rel=""noreferrer"">""Simmer"" means ""low or off position,""</a> suggesting basically no heat at all.</li>
<li>To ""simmer"" is <a href=""http://www.bestrecipes.com.au/glossary/Simmer-L77.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">to heat to a temperature point just off boiling, generally acknowledged as somewhere around 95 degrees C or something like 195 degrees F.</a> </li>
<li>""Simmer"" is something like a <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/15432/at-what-point-is-water-considered-at-a-boil"">""soft boil,"" a vague state that appears to be between ""not bubbling"" and ""roiling""</a>, but which by definition must boil in some way, since you know, it's bubbling.</li>

<p>Each of these examples mean fundamentally different things. As far as I can tell, a ""simmer"" is a phase transition whereby the suspension in question, whatever the soup, sauce, or solid (apparently you ""simmer"" bratwurst, you never boil it) may be, cooks in a way that only years of experience or training can identify. Hence, my question:  </p>

<p>What does ""simmer"" mean? Does it differ per recipe or is it universally defined? </p>

<p>EDIT: Did a bad copy/paste job from another window. </p>
","<p>Personally, I would argue that 2 and 3 are actually the same, and they are your answer.</p>

<p>If you heat a pan of water you'll notice the bubbles forming before the water is actually boiling, hence the talk of between not bubbling and full on roiling.</p>

<p>Also, when you're making your soup, it isn't pure water, so the boiling temp will not be a perfect 100 degrees C in any case.</p>

<p>So, I would say, that simmering is when you keep it just under a full boil. Watch what you're cooking, there should be gentle movement, but not a full roiling pan of whatever it is you're cooking.</p>

"How can you make a sauce less spicy/hot?","275044","","<p>Sometimes when I'm making a sauce or soup that needs to be a bit spicy, I have no troubles spicing how I want to.</p>

<p>But if the dinner party is a bit late, or I made the sauce in advance to really draw out all the flavors of the spices, vegetables and meat, sometimes I end up with a way too spicy/hot dish.</p>

<p>You can always pour a bit water and try to dilute it a bit, but that also takes away all of the good flavor. So is there some trick that I'm missing I can use, when this happens to me (other than being more careful or using the spices later)?</p>
","<p>In general, it is a good idea to go light on spices when trying a new recipe, if you're not intimately familiar with the flavor and spice combinations in question.  It's a great deal easier to add spice later than it is to mask it once you've added too much.</p>

<p>Assuming you are reading this because you <em>didn't</em> do that, and have now ended up with a sauce that's far too spicy, then read on.</p>

<p>The pertinent question here is <strong>where is the spiciness coming from?</strong>  There are actually several kinds of compounds that can produce that general aroma and/or sensation.  In most dishes they'll tend to fall loosely into one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piperine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Piperine</a></strong>, which is the active alkaloid in <strong>black pepper</strong>.  This has poor solubility in water, however, it has better solubility in <strong>alcohol</strong>.  If you can incorporate wine or better yet, brandy or vodka or some other strong alcohol, this can go a long way toward reducing the heat from pepper.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Capsaicin</a></strong>, the heat-producing compound in most types of <strong>hot peppers</strong>, is the highest on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scoville Scale</a>; extremely piquant and can produce a ""burning"" sensation in very small quantities.  It is also poorly soluble in water, but is far more soluble in <strong>fat</strong>, especially oils.  Adding some olive oil or a good quantity of butter to your recipe is a good bet for reducing capsaicin/capsicum heat.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Garlic, onion</strong>, and other members of the <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allium"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Allium</a></strong> family put out a volatile sulfur compound called <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allicin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Allicin</a>.</strong>  Although this is not ""spicy"" in the same sense as pepper, many people perceive it as such.  Like piperine, it is more soluble in <strong>alcohol</strong> than in water.  <strong>However</strong>, and here's the catch: That allicin breaks down into various <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysulfide"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">polysulfides</a> when cooked, and those polysulfides are <strong>fat soluble</strong>.  So if you're trying to mask a strong garlic or onion flavour, it's best if you can add alcohol <em>and</em> fat to cover all your bases.</p></li>
<li><p>If you've added too much <strong>Ginger</strong> - another ingredient often perceived as spicy - then you're dealing with <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingerol"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gingerols</a></strong> and <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogaol"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Shoagols</a></strong>, the latter of which pack a much bigger punch.  One of the things you can actually do with ginger is <strong><a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/10080/41"">cook the spice off</a></strong> which converts those into much milder <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/10080/41"">Zingerone</a>.  In other words, add some water to the sauce and then boil it to reduce the sauce again - you'll lose some flavour but in the process you'll break down the ginger spice.</p>

<p>Alternatively (for ginger), all of the above compounds are <strong>alkali soluble</strong>, so if you add a buffering agent - say, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisodium_citrate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Trisodium citrate</a> (additive E331), it will improve the solubility a great deal.  If, like most people, you don't happen to keep food additives in your kitchen, you can try using something like baking soda, but too much of that will completely ruin the taste, so be careful.  In fact, don't add too much of <em>any</em> buffer because the acidity of most sauces is an integral part of their flavor.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think that about covers it for common ""spicy stuff"" that goes in sauces.  If you want to fix a dish that's too spicy, you need to know where the spice is coming from and choose what's most appropriate for that particular sauce.</p>

<p>You can also try to <em>mask</em> or <em>balance</em> the spice with something sweet, for example roasted vegetables or plain old sugar.  That will not eliminate the heat at all, but does seem to make it more tolerable for many.</p>

"What temperatures do low-medium-high on the stove correspond to?","273863","","<p>I'm quite suspicious that my electric stove runs hot.  Recipes that suggest medium-high on my stove are incredibly, incredibly hot and you can feel 'high' radiating heat from across the kitchen.</p>

<p>As such, I've semi-recently purchased an IR thermometer - what pan surface temperature should low, medium-low,medium,medium-high, and high approximately register as?</p>
","<p>They don't correspond to a temperature, they correspond to a rate of heat input.</p>

<p>The elements in your oven are connected to a thermostat with regulates their temperature, they are really constant heat/fixed temperature devices, like the heat in your home. The oven turns the elements on and off to regulate temperature, but the elements are only ever ON or OFF.</p>

<p>The stovetop elements, by contrast, are variable heat/variable temperature. There is no thermostat, but the elements can be variably adjusted between MAX and OFF. For every setting the temperature will just keep getting hotter and hotter (unless something is removing the heat, like cooking food) - the higher settings will just get hotter faster.</p>

<p>The important thing to know (for an electric range) is the wattage of the elements - most 8"" elements are ~2500W, and most 6"" elements are ~1500W. But there is a lot of variability. Additionally, if you are living in a home with 240V power but have recently lived in an apartment (which likely had 208V power, but 240V elements installed in the oven, even if you didn't realize it), your heater elements will seem much hotter than before. It is also possible that the oven maker or previous owner installed higher wattage elements (perhaps by installing elements intended for a 208V service in a home with 240V service, which would have the effect of ""turbocharging"" them a bit).</p>

<p>Temperature measured with an IR thermometer may not be useful for you to determine if your oven is hotter than usual, since an empty pan on Low will still reach 400+ degrees (it will just get there slower).</p>

<p>What might be more useful is to find out what setting people do certain cooking tasks at, and see if that is different than what works on your oven. You can also remove the elements and find the voltage/wattage stamped on the bottom - let us know what those values are and we may be able to tell you if they are abnormally high.</p>

<p>Personally, I sweat onions on 4/10, fry an egg at 6/10, simmer soup at 2/10, and maintain 1 gallon water at a consistent, but not vigorous boil at 8/10.</p>

"How do you properly defrost frozen fish?","270948","","<p>I recently bought a package of frozen cod that contains about 6 pieces. How do you go about properly defrosting them? Thanks. </p>
","<p>There are two safe ways to defrost, one more rapid than the other.</p>

<p>First method is to defrost in the refrigerator.  This keeps temperature below 40 degrees F, in the safe zone.  This will, also, take a while.</p>

<p>Second method is to defrost in the sink under cold running water.  The water doesn't have to run rapidly, but it should change regularly.  This will defrost the fish more rapidly than in the air (water is a better conductor of heat than air) and will keep the fish in the danger zone for the shortest period of time.  If you are not going to cook it immediately, then return to the refrigerator.</p>

<p>If you are deep frying, there are some techniques that will allow you to go direct from frozen to fried, but that is generally done in a professional kitchen where they have powerful fryers that can take the temperature hit and come back strong.</p>

I believe she is planning on baking cookies with them, so they would be baked at fairly high temperatures for probably at least 10 minutes. Would this be safe, or are eggs left unrefrigerated for that long not safe for consumption?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After eggs are refrigerated, they need to stay that way. A cold egg left out at room temperature can sweat, facilitating the movement of bacteria into the egg and increasing the growth of bacteria. Refrigerated eggs should not be left out more than 2 hours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(They also say some very sad things about Easter egg hunts.)</p>

<p>So if you're being strict, three days would be way too long. In reality, you'd <em>probably</em> be okay. The chances of getting salmonella are definitely higher, but are presumably still small (though I can't say exactly how small, of course). Personally, given the price of a dozen eggs, I'd probably play it safe.</p>

<p>Another answer mentions that in the UK eggs are stored at room temperature. That's true in quite a lot of places, but I'm guessing that they've avoided the large temperature swing issue mentioned by the FDA, so if your friend's eggs were refrigerated in the store, the situation's not quite the same as in the UK.</p>

"Is a ""cup"" on a coffee maker always 6 oz? Is this a standard in the US?","267905","","<p>Our coffee maker instructions often refer to a ""cup"" of coffee. These cups are whats marked on the side of the coffee maker showing how much water is in the reservoir. The instructions never define what a ""cup"" actually equates to. It appears to about 6 oz. An old coffee maker seems to also have had this definition of ""cup"". The coffee beans we got from the local coffee shop also have instructions indicating one scoop of beans per 6 oz cup.</p>

<p>To be clear -- Is a ""cup"" to a coffee maker always 6oz? and therefore it has nothing to do with the Imperial unit ""cup"" which is 8oz? Its more a notion of a typical serving size of coffee? </p>
","<p>Assuming you're talking about USA usage, you're correct, a ""cup"" is usually 6oz.  In the USA, the standard size for a ""cup"" of coffee is 6oz, even though nobody drinks cups of coffee that small (12oz to 20oz is more common).  For that matter, the size of a ""cup"" of tea can be 5oz or 6oz when the number of ""cups"" a teapot holds is listed; a ""6 cup"" teapot is only 32oz.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, be careful how the word is used in American recipes.  If a recipe calls for a ""cup"" of coffee, they are more likely to be calling for an 8oz cup, rather than a 6oz cup.</p>

<p>I can't find a clear reference as to where the unrealistic 6oz measurement for a cup of coffee started.  Likely it was some episode of cost-cutting validated by Federal regulation -- or possibly the result of Mr. Coffee -- but we're stuck with it as customary now.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, even though a 6oz cup of coffee may be customary, specific coffee maker manufacturers may use different measurements on different models, including cups as small as 4.2oz.  So don't assume unless you've checked.</p>

<p>Oh, and also note that the 8oz cup is <em>American</em>, rather than Imperial measurement.  An <em>Imperial</em> cup is around 10oz, although you're unlikely to encounter this measurement in any recipe published after World War I.</p>

"Do slow cookers require liquid to operate?","267400","","<p>I have a <a href=""http://www.butterball.com/product/boneless-breast-of-turkey-roast"">Butterball turkey breast roast</a> that I'd like to cook tomorrow, and I'm planning to do it in my slow cooker.</p>

<p>The recipe as provided online is the same one that is on the turkey packaging:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Slow-Cooker Instructions:
  Place THAWED roast, skin side up, flat in 8” diameter slow-cooker. Add 1/2 cup water. Cover, cook on low 7-1/2 hours to internal temperature of 170 degrees as measured with a meat thermometer. After 4 hours, check temperature at center, ends and near top for food safety. Turkey must reach 140 degrees within 4 hours. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I haven't done a lot of slow cooking before, but when I have, I've always added enough liquid to fill the slow cooker up to about 3/4 full.  Half a cup of water will barely cover the bottom of my slow cooker.</p>

<p>I did some research, but found nothing conclusive.  <a href=""http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/03/08/the-art-of-the-slow-cooker/"">Some people</a> say that slow cookers should always be more than half full, <a href=""http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,1612,142191-241196,00.html"">while others</a> seem to indicate that it's fine to run them almost empty.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a minimum level of liquid necessary when cooking in a slow cooker?</strong></p>
","<p>It's really no different from cooking something on a stove: if you have no liquid at all, things are probably going to start getting too hot, sticking on the bottom, and maybe burning. As long as there's some liquid, you'll be fine. The important thing is to add enough; if you keep having to open it to add more, it won't stay hot. This is basically the minimum level: enough that it won't boil dry in an hour or so. If you're cooking something really simple like a piece of meat, using too much water just provides more water for the flavor to get diluted into.</p>

<p>This is precisely what the first page you linked to says: if it's not full enough, it might all boil off. The writer is just way off about quantities. I suspect his cooker's lid doesn't fit well, or he's unnecessarily cooking on high. I don't think my slow cooker would boil dry from half full in 8 hours on low, and there's no reason to put it on high if I'm cooking that long.</p>

<p>The recipe at the second link isn't exactly empty - a can of cranberry sauce will provide a good amount of liquid. It also might not be a great recipe. On that note, I might suggest you look for more authoritative recipes. Perhaps check out a slow cooker cookbook from your library (these tend to be pretty common) to get an idea of the kinds of things you can do. (Of course, if all you want is a plain piece of meat, I guess you don't need much.)</p>

","<p>My own sugar cookie recipe is quite dry as well. It cracks along the edges when pressed or rolled and is easily ""broken"".</p>

<p>I'd use water over oil or milk because it's the least likely to change the structure of your cookie in the baking process. Such minuscule amounts of water shouldn't yield a detectable change in the end product.</p>

"Difference between Maida and All purpose flour","243317","","<p>I'm baking tonight and I'm out of All purpose flour. I'm lazy to run out to the grocery store. Can I replace All purpose flour with Maida (Maida is better known to Asian Indians - we use it for making Naans and such)</p>
","<p>Maida is wheat flour similar to what is sold in the US as cake flour. Like cake flour, maida is finely milled, and it has less protein than all purpose flour. You can use it for bread and cakes, as well as chapatis, parathas and puris.</p>

<p>To achieve a flour more like all purpose or other flour types, you can add gluten to maita. According to <a href=""http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/26267/gluten-powder"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Fresh Loaf</a>, maida typically contains 7.5% gluten (if anyone can find a more authoritative source, please edit accordingly).</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cookingforengineers.com/article/63/Wheat-Flour"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cooking for Geeks</a> has a good article about the gluten content of other flours:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High gluten flour and bread flour is produced from hard wheat. High gluten flour has a gluten percentage of about 12-14% while bread flour contains about 10-13% gluten. Both flours are almost completely made of hard wheat, but some high gluten flours are treated to reduce starch content, raising the gluten content to around 14%. These flours are generally used for making breads. High gluten flour is reserved for breads that are extra elastic such as bagels and pizza.</p>
  
  <p>Cake flour is produced from soft wheat and is low in gluten content (8-10%). This flour is used for making delicate cakes. Baked goods made with cake flour has a tendency to crumble because of the low gluten content.</p>
  
  <p>All purpose flour is made from a mixture of hard and soft wheats. The gluten content ranges from 9-12%. This is the most versatile flour because it can be used to make both cakes and breads. However, breads won't be as chewy and cakes won't be as tender as if you used bread or cake flour.</p>
  
  <p>Pastry flour is also a mix of hard and soft wheat flours with an emphasis on soft. Generally, the gluten content is 9-10% and is often recommended for pie crusts. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, again according to <a href=""http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/26267/gluten-powder"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Fresh Loaf</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then if you're interested in the details of the math, start out with a formula like (100parts/100parts * 7.5%) + (Nparts/100parts * 75%) = 10.5% [or 9.5% or 12.5% or whatever your desired result is], then solve for N. Skipping intermediate steps, simplification gives N = ((end-percentage-goal * 100) - 750) / 75 (Even this math is actually an oversimplification that's not quite right. It takes the not-quite-correct shortcut of directly adding percentages without accounting for the total being more than 100 grams. Hopefully though it's ""good enough"" ...)
  The bottom line is: for every 100 grams Maida, add somewhere between 2.6 and 6.6 grams GlutenPowder. Adding 2.6 grams GlutenPowder will give a result with about 9.5% gluten, adding 4 grams GlutenPowder will give a result with about 10.5% gluten, and adding 6.6 grams GlutenPowder will give a result with about 12.5% gluten.</p>

"How much does a ""large"" potato weigh?","241177","","<p>I have a recipe that calls for ""6 large baking potatoes."" So the question becomes, what is considered the average size of a large baking potato?  I've looked online, but sadly do not have time to continue my search and the results appear to be all over the place.  </p>
","<p>Tough question - there are a lot of non-scientific ways to measure small/medium/large potatoes and nobody seems to agree on exactly what weight each is.  However, there are a few ways I identify large vs medium at home.</p>

<p>In my experience, a large potato is about the size you would get in a restaurant (I know, not very specific).  That is, when I cook at home, the potatoes I purchase tend to be medium - round (not oval) and about the size of a tennis ball or baseball.  When I'm at a restaurant their potatoes are noticeably larger, and generally more oval shaped it seems (closer to a sweet potato in shape and size), which makes them great for stuffing like for a loaded baked potato.  Luckily most of the recipes I have at home that involve potatoes don't require precise measurement, so I just stick with my eyeball measurements and don't even bother weighing them.</p>

<p>I found a source online that says this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to Shape magazine, eatbetteramerica.com and prevention, a medium potato is the size of a computer mouse, so somewhat bigger than that. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I think I can get behind that answer.  I'd say your average computer mouse (like, one you would get with a new PC, not a fancy third-party mouse) is about the size of an average medium potato.  Another way to eyeball: I'm a 30 year old male with hands that are neither very large or very small.  The medium potatoes in this bag are about the size of a loose fist for me.  So a large potato would be bigger than either of those things.</p>

<p>As for measurements, I have a bag of medium potatoes and it says they're 5.3 oz (150g) a piece.  I weighed one and it was closer to 6.5oz (185g).  Based on that I'd say a large potato would be anything over 8oz (225g), pushing as high as 12oz (340g).  </p>

<p>I found a way to search online for this info: calories.  By searching for ""large potato calories"" I was able to find pages with weights and measures:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/usda/russet-potatoes-%28flesh-and-skin-baked%29?portionid=34403&amp;portionamount=1.000"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3 to 4 1/4 inches in diameter</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://caloriecount.about.com/calories-potato-baked-flesh-skin-i11674"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">300 grams (about 10.5oz)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So, in short, it seems like I would consider these good numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Medium potato: 2 to 3"" in diameter, 5-8oz (140-225g)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Large potato: 3 to 4.25"" in diameter, 8-12oz (225-340g)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a picture of the medium potato from my bag, compared to some common household/kitchen items.  The gift card is the size of a normal credit card, and the knife is a common steak knife from my utensil drawer.  Apparently a medium potato is almost exactly the size of a 1 cup measure!</p>

There is an <a href=""http://www.ehow.com/how_5560702_tenderize-meat-baking-soda.html"">eHow</a> that you may follow</p>

<p>The baking soda will work like other meat tenderizers, by denaturing the proteins on the surface of the meat, so it should work on pork or chicken as long as the baking soda is on the meat (and not the skin or fat).  The tenderizers penetrate the meat very slowly, millimeters per day at refrigerator temperatures, faster at cooking temperatures, so in practice it will only work on thin slices.  If you use thicker pieces, you will still change the meat's surface texture.</p>

<p>If you use the baking soda straight into the dish in the same proportion (some people like it this way), adjust your salt accordingly, as the baking soda will make the dish salty.</p>

"How do Chinese restaurants tenderize their meat?","239833","","<p>I eat at a lot of Chinese restaurants now and also while growing up. I often wondered how is it that the chicken, pork, and beef in dishes are always so tender. I can never replicate it when I cook.
What do the Chinese chefs use to tenderize their meat?</p>
","<p>One technique, but not the only, is velveting. Here the meat is tenderized in an egg-white/cornstarch mixture for 20+ minutes, then cooked briefly (a minute) in oil or simmering water with a small amount of oil prior to using in stir fries. </p>

<p>I've never velveted in straight oil but water/oil definitely gives the chicken that smoothness that Chinese Restaurants obtain and the shorter stir fry cooking time makes it much more tender. </p>

<p>Super thin slicing (you'll need to cut the meat semi-frozen to get such thin slices), plus cutting across the grain also lead to tenderness. </p>

"How long should I keep a cut onion?","239793","","<p>Since I only cook for one or two, I will tend to buy an onion and only use part of it, and then keep the rest in the fridge. Sometimes it will be a while before I use the rest. Is there any guidance on when I should finally just throw it out? What are the signs to look for? What degradations should I expect to trade off against constantly throwing out half an onion (decreased flavor, increased bitterness)?</p>
","<p>When I use fresh onions, we store the unused parts for up to a week in our fridge in either a ziploc or a sealable rubbermaid-style container.  For particularly pungent onions they go in the crisper drawer to keep the smell from being too strong in the rest of the fridge, but usually they're just on one of the shelves.  <a href=""http://www.stilltasty.com/fooditems/index/17826"">Stilltasty says</a> 2-3 days but my personal experience says otherwise.</p>

<p>Generally in our house, they don't last long enough for the flavor to degrade too much, but they will get a little dried and the smell will get stronger over time.  After a week, they shouldn't be bad in the sense that you'll get sick - but you'll want to use them in a meal where the onion is the star, as the aroma will take over the dish.</p>

<p>Another option that I'm a big fan of is to dice or strip the leftovers (or, a 5 lb bag at once!) and freeze them on a cookie sheet (instead of in a bag, where they'll turn into a giant clump).  Once fully frozen, dump them into a plastic freezer bag, and store in the freezer for easy access to a handful at a time.  For most applications, you can defrost them right in the pan/pot/casserole as you cook, so they're very handy and accessible.  We do the same with peppers in our house for convenience.</p>

"Is ground beef that was in the refrigerator for two weeks and has turned brown still usable?","239765","","<p>I bought some ground beef around 2 weeks ago and used half of it, putting the rest in a freezer bag in my fridge (not the freezer).  It has since turned brown (not red, as when I bought it).</p>

<p>Is it safe to use to make hamburgers?</p>
","<p>I'm not going to comment on whether or not it is safe, because that could be any number of issues other than the brown coloring of the meat. However, the brown in and of itself is not an issue. When meat is exposed to air it turns a brown color. This does not effect the falvor of the meat, but the color turns a lot of people off. Grocery stores will actually throw this meat away, not because it is bad but just because people won't buy it. Terribly wasteful. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From the <a href=""http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/Color_of_Meat_&amp;_Poultry/index.asp"">USDA</a>: Optimum surface color of fresh meat (i.e., cherry-red for beef; dark cherry-red for lamb; grayish-pink for pork; and pale pink for veal) is highly unstable and short-lived. When meat is fresh and protected from contact with air (such as in vacuum packages), it has the purple-red color that comes from myoglobin, one of the two key pigments responsible for the color of meat. When exposed to air, myoglobin forms the pigment, oxymyoglobin, which gives meat a pleasingly cherry-red color. The use of a plastic wrap that allows oxygen to pass through it helps ensure that the cut meats will retain this bright red color. However, exposure to store lighting as well as the continued contact of myoglobin and oxymyoglobin with oxygen leads to the formation of metmyoglobin, a pigment that turns meat brownish-red. This color change alone does not mean the product is spoiled</p>

But I'm curious how I should be grinding my coffee.</p>

<p>When I bought it, I grabbed a bag of pre-ground coffee at the grocery store and this worked well. But recently, I bought a can of beans and put it thru the coffee grinder at the store and I may have chose too coarse a grind as I seem to be getting very weak cups of coffee now.</p>

<p>The manual said pick a ""coarse"" grind, so it turned the dial all the way to the left labeled ""coarse"". I'm thinking it should have been somewhere in the middle, like ""Percolate"".</p>

<p>Any advice on the optimal grind?</p>

<p>EDIT: Also, What ratio of Tbsp to oz of water? (or grams to ml, if you prefer metric.)</p>
","<p>You <em>do</em> want a coarse grind for french press coffee. The key is letting the coffee steep for long enough to make a strong brew. I have good results with a 5 minute steep time. Be sure to use a timer, and compare different times to find the optimal brew. As a general rule, if you are at altitude, then you need to add time because boiling water is cooler. (Note that I am at 5000ft, so 5 minutes may be too long for you.)</p>

<p>EDIT: The reason to use a coarse grind for a french press is that finer grinds will get stuck in the filter and/or push their way through. This has three potential problems: 1) it will be harder to press down the filter, possibly leading to spillage or breakage; 2) your coffee will have grinds in it; 3) the coffee may become bitter, as the finer grinds that passed through the filter remain in contact with the coffee for too long. </p>

","<p><em>Red</em> pizza sauce is often (but not always) two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Thicker.  Thinner sauce will tend to run in the oven and also steam the pizza crust as it cooks - if loaded with toppings, otherwise thin is fine.  Depending on the crust, the heat of the oven, the toppings above sauce, and how watery it is, this may not be needed.  If you've just got some crushed tomatoes and a few bits of cheese in a super hot oven - the sauce should be fine without reducing beforehand.  If you've loaded up a bucket of sauce and a pound of cheese, precook and reduce the sauce.</p></li>
<li><p>It's often simpler.  Many pasta dishes like spaghetti highlight the sauce and hours of simmering happen for the sauce to bring it to perfection.  They're all about the sauce.  Pizza is really about the crust and what highlights it.  Many of the best pizzas are simply topped.  Crushed san marzano tomatoes (sometimes) reduced with a hint of salt is often all I do, and franky, it's enough. I'm not talking about the jarred varieties here, but what you might cook at home.

Sorry if this question is too open-ended such that it would require pages and pages for a proper response. Like a good start would be the difference in over-{insert proper word} preparations or distinctions between some of the more popular methods.</p>
","<p><strong>Fried Eggs:</strong></p>

<p><em>Sunny Side Up</em> -- Not flipped, unbroken yolk. The top of the egg is just barely set.</p>

<p><em>Basted</em> -- Sunny Side Up, hot fat spooned over until the white surrounding the yolk is opaque.</p>

<p><em>Over Easy / lite</em> -- Flipped,  whites  fully cooked, unbroken yolk, yolk runny.</p>

<p><em>Over medium</em> -- flipped, whites fully cooked, unbroken yolk, yolk creamy (not completely runny).  </p>

<p><em>Over Medium Well</em> -- Flipped, unbroken yolk, yolk cooked to have a firm but wet-appearing center.</p>

<p><em>Over Hard</em> -- Flipped, broken, fully-cooked yolk.</p>

<p><em>Over Well</em> -- Flipped, <em>intact</em>, fully-cooked yolk.</p>

<p><em>Broken / Lightly Scrambled</em> -- Broken in pan and gently stirred while cooking - yolk and whites should not be mixed entirely.</p>

<p><em>Scrambled Eggs</em> -- Made in many different ways. Generally the eggs are mixed in a bowl before being put into the pan, and often stirred while cooking. Some recipes add fat to the eggs in the form of milk, cream, butter, or oil. A distinction can be made between Wet/Loose or Dry, which refers to the degree of doneness.</p>

<p><strong>Omelettes:</strong></p>

<p><em>Filled Omelette</em> -- Eggs mixed before cooking, possibly with added fat as in <em>Scrambled Eggs</em>. Cooked in fat in a saute pan; when set but the interior still wet, previously-cooked fillings (cheese, onions, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes...) are added, and the eggs folded over into a half-moon shape.  </p>

<p><em>Spanish Omelette / Western Omelette</em> -- Same as filled, but the egg mixture is poured over the fillings in a hot pan and cooked, thus incorporating the fillings into the egg.</p>

<p><em>Fluffy Omelette</em> -- Whites and yolks beaten separately. Yolks are gently folded into the whites without breaking the structure of the whites. Optional toppings are added. Cooked slowly in a pan, or baked (an electric frying pan with a lid works well for this preparation).</p>

<p><strong>Boiled:</strong></p>

<p>Cooked in shell in water for a timed period. Some people will refer to degree of doneness by cooking time, i.e., a ""3-minute egg"" is soft-boiled with some runny white around the yolk. Some recipes call for eggs to be added to boiling water, others to be started in cold water. In the cold-water start, the pot may be left on the heat or removed when the water reaches a boil. The eggs may be shocked in ice water when removed.</p>

<p><em>Soft</em> -- Yolk runny, potentially with slight unset white around the yolk.</p>

<p><em>Medium</em> -- White completely set, yolk firm but with a dark, wet appearance.</p>

<p><em>Hard</em> -- Yolk completely set and pale yellow.</p>

<p><strong>Poached:</strong> </p>

<p>Egg cooked, out of shell, in water, stock, or other liquid --  excluding fats or oils -- at a temperature in the range of 160-180˚F (70-82˚C). There are possible degrees of doneness, however the typical poached egg has a runny but warm and thickened yolk and fully-set white.</p>

<p><strong>Coddled:</strong></p>

<p>An egg that has been very lightly cooked (poached eggs are sometimes considered coddled). This can either be accomplished with an egg coddler or cooking an egg in its shell with water that is slightly below boiling point.</p>

<p><strong>Shirred:</strong></p>

<p>An egg cooked in an oven at the low-mid 300's˚F (~160˚C), contained in a ramekin, until the whites are just set and the yolk is runny but thickened. Often butter or another fat is placed on top before cooking.</p>

<p><strong>Steamed:</strong></p>

<p>Very similar to shirred eggs, but the ramekin is covered with some aluminum foil and put in a steamer for 7-15 minutes. </p>

Eggs fried in a hole made in a slice of bread</p>

<p>So, I was wondering if I really need to cut those salmon fish into tiny slices so that when I cooked them, the fish will be between ""Medium well"" to ""Well done"" throughout. (Notice that I did not want a ""Well Done"" because I don't want to have ""black ash"" on the outside of the salmon fish)</p>
","<p>The most reliable way to test any meat is with a thermometer. Be careful to insert it all the way into the center (since the outside will be hotter). As has been mentioned in the comments, the 130-135F range is cooked, but very soft. It's more likely that you want something in the 140F-150F range.</p>

<p>This is where the second method comes in - just test it. When fish is cooked, it should easily flake apart, and you can see the inside and verify that it's cooked how you want it. Remember, you can always cook it a bit longer, but you can't go backwards, so don't be too shy about checking it. There's no shame in having to check it a couple times before you decide it's done; within a try or two you'll know exactly what you're looking for. And you can do this along with a thermometer, since it's hard to tell exactly what temperature would be best for you. </p>

<p>Whatever you do, be careful not to overcook it - remove it from the heat as soon as you think it's done. It'll still cook a little bit more, as heat transfers from the outside to the inside.</p>

<p>You still haven't mentioned how you plan to cook it. The picture you think looks bad might actually be really good - if it was cooked on high heat, it may be done perfectly on the inside, with a bit of browning and charring on the outside. If you're cooking it more slowly, that's obviously not what you want it to look like on the outside - then inside would be totally overcooked.</p>

<p>All that said, the easiest way to cook fish (especially if you don't have a lot of experience) is baking it, wrapped in foil (or in a foil-covered dish). It's a slow heat, so it's a lot harder to accidentally overcook it, and it cooks more evenly than a hot pan or a grill. There are a lot of other great ways, but this might be good to start with. You could look for recipes for baked salmon to get some ideas here, if you don't just want a plain piece of fish.</p>

","<p>Soft bread is soft because CO2 produced by yeast and water that gets turned to steam by the baking process gets trapped into pockets by a mesh of gluten, causing the dough to expand. The dough then solidifies, keeping its shape. If your bread is not soft then it hasn't expanded enough for one or more reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dough too dry: as much as the yeast, water is responsible for getting a good rise in your bread. Gluten requires moisture to relax and stretch, forming the structure that traps the air that causes a rise, dough that is too dry won't form good gluten. Also, dough that is too dry won't have the elasticity to rise. Yeast needs water to do its work, dough that is too dry will inhibit the yeast. Also, the expansion of water into steam is as important for a good rise as yeast. If there's one mistake many bakers make (including myself for years) it is making dough too dry. </li>
<li>Yeast inactive or inhibited: if your yeast is old, came into contact with salt, or doesn't have enough water to work then your yeast won't work well for you. Yeast does several things for you: it converts sugar into CO2 causing a rise, it improves the structure of your dough, and it adds flavor. Put the salt on the opposite side of the bowl from the yeast to avoid inhibiting it. Also, adding the yeast to sugary water doesn't work well, especially with more modern yeasts. Just get quick acting yeast and add it to the flour bowl, then add water to that. </li>
<li>The dough is not worked (kneaded) enough: Kneading improves the structure of your dough by stretching gluten molecules and getting them to link together, making your dough stretchy and pliable, and forming a structure that will trap air for a rise. Under-worked dough won't have enough structure</li>
<li>the dough has been worked too much: as a home baker using hands this is unlikely, but still possible. Once you have the structure of the dough you need, stop and let it rise as any further working will form too much of a structure, making it too strong to expand</li>
<li>Dough under-risen: the times in baking recipes are just guidelines, you need to go for a result rather than a time. I've had books say 45 minutes but it takes 3 hours, especially if my yeast was old</li>
<li>Dough over-risen: if your dough rises too long the yeast will exhaust the sugars in the dough and die out, leading to the loss of all the air. This will make the dough dense. </li>
</ul>

<p>For a nice soft sandwich bread I start with a really sticky dough. I then use it's stickiness to stretch the dough, smearing it all over the countertop and using a pastry scraper to bring it back together. This is a really quick way to build some gluten. Then I knead in flour bit by bit, kneading for at least 1 minute between adding flour until I have a soft dough that still sticks a bit to the counter. That stickiness means that there's enough moisture in the dough. I'll add a bit more flour to that and then stop adding flour to avoid drying the dough. If I want to knead it more I'll knead with a bit of vegetable oil instead to keep it from sticking. </p>

<p>It's consistency you're looking for, not time. Time is relative depending on your strength and kneading technique, 5 minutes for a skilled and strong baker may translate to 15 minutes for normal humans, so knead until you have the consistency you want. When you start kneading the dough it will pull into pieces easily, and have a rough texture. As you knead that roughness disappears and it will stretch longer without breaking. For a sandwich loaf I'll knead until I can stretch the dough from the middle of my torso to my knee without it breaking. </p>

<p>Next, rising your dough may take much longer than recipes say as it all depends on the ambient temperature of the room, humidity, the activity of the yeast, and other factors. Again, make this results driven, not time driven. A good sandwich bread dough should rise a lot, not the ""doubled"" many recipes say. For me tripled is more like it. Make sure you put it in a big enough bowl! This advice goes for the initial as well as the secondary rise in the pans. Let it rise enough in the pans until it looks like the recipe picture, that's about right. Ideally your oven will have been pre-heating for 30 minutes by now. </p>

<p>Now, slash your loaves the long way with a razor blade like a carpet knife, about 1/2 an inch down. Do it quick and avoid punching down the dough. Slashing will split the top skin and allow the dough to rise efficiently after you put it into the oven. Once you put it in the oven it's going to rise a lot as the yeast goes crazy before the heat kills it, and the moisture in the dough is going to vaporize into steam. If you don't slash you won't get as good a rise. </p>

<p>The new deep fryer has a cold zone, which means the oil won't become dirty due to particles over-frying. I don't overheat the oil either. So, in principle, I'm frying correctly, I think.</p>

<p>So, how long can my oil safely sit in the deep fryer, if I ensure it's thouroughly heated next time I fry? Should I be allowing the oil to cool and store the fat in (sealed) containers instead, if there's going to be this long a gap between uses?</p>

<p>Edit: yes, I've seen this question and answers: <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/3014/frying-oil-reuse"">Frying Oil Reuse</a></p>
","<p>I would not reuse that oil. The frying-oil reuse that occurs in fast food chains is reuse for the same day or over just a few days. They also store it properly and not just sitting exposed in the fryer.</p>

<p>justkt is correct that more saturated fats are less sensitive to breakdown, this is why bacon grease can be kept for a rather long time.</p>

<p>Three factors play a significant role in oil degradation:</p>

<h3>Oxidation</h3>

<p>Any contact with air causes oxidation in oil. High temperatures, metal alloys, surface exposure, and even UV light act as catalysts to this reaction.</p>

<h3>Hydrolysis</h3>

<p>When water interacts with oil it causes it to taste tainted or acidic. This is exacerbated by high temperatures, heating/cooling cycles, and oxidation products.</p>

<h3>Polymerizaton</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>When frying oil deteriorates, the resulting products form both volatile (or reactive) and non-volatile compounds. Non-volatile compounds remain within the frying oil, and can produce polymerization at frying oil temperatures above 200°C (390 F) or in isolated hot spots within the frying system. These molecules bond together to form large, different-sized clusters that accumulate on the oil’s surface. Since they don’t dissolve, they cause foaming; trapping air under the oil, and increase the possibility of hydrolysis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given all these, the best environment for any oil is an cold, dark, airtight place. Cold temperatures may cause clouding, but this is not a cause for worry.</p>

"Difference between parsley and coriander(cilantro)?","214162","","<p>A lot of falafel recipe calls for both chopped coriander/cilantro and parsley. Online images look the same to me. Is there a difference between the two? Would omission of one drastically change the flavor?</p>
","<p>Coriander leaf/cilantro looks VERY similar to flat leaf parsley. When I have both at the house I sometimes resort to smelling them to know which is which. </p>

<p>Cilantro is very strong smelling, and you'd definitely change the flavor of the dish if you left it out.</p>

<p>Flat leaf parsley is significantly more subtle and has a much milder flavor and scent. It is not flavorless, and in a recipe that calls for a lot of it, you'd really be missing something by leaving it out.</p>

<p>When you've got a recipe that calls for both parsley and cilantro, you're definitely going to be more able to taste/smell the cilantro more than parsley, but they'll both contribute different notes. If you have to leave one out, leave out the parsley, but don't try to make up the volume with more cilantro, as you may wind up overpowering your dish. Just leave the parsley out and proceed as normal.</p>

<p>Do not use curly leave parsley in anything--it is tough and virtually flavorless. It is ONLY a garnish and not worth wasting your time on.</p>

<p>Note: I'm aware that the rice is cooked differently in a paella compared to a risotto -- I'm asking about the differences in the rice itself, not the cooking method.</p>
","<p>'Paella rice' is not actually a variety of rice, but a category suitable, as the its name suggests, for making paella. Some common varieties are: Bahia, Balilla, Bomba, Senia, and Calasparra; the particular variety should be indicated on the packet that you choose.</p>

<p>These varieties differ from risotto rices, such as arborio and carnaroli, in not creating a creamy 'sauce' around the rice. Paella rice should stick together, but be distinct and not in a creamy 'sauce'.</p>

<p>Arborio rice has a creamy, chewy texture due to its higher amylopectin (one of two components in its starch) content. Paella rice absorbs more liquid than risotto rices, however it too would become 'creamy' if you stirred it like a risotto, since it also has a high starch content.</p>

","<p>They're the same thing. About the only difference is that ""garbanzo bean"" is less common in British English than in American English, and chickpea is more common either way, but it's just a language thing.</p>

<p>There are indeed different varieties, with some smaller and some larger, but they don't have common language names like that.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickpea#Types"">Wikipedia mentions three varieties</a>:</p>

  <p>Desi, which has small, darker seeds and a rough coat, cultivated mostly in the India and much of the Indian Subcontinent, as well as Ethiopia, Mexico, and Iran.</p>
  
  <p>Bombay (Bambai), which is also dark in colour but slightly larger in size than the Desi variety. They too are popular in the Indian Subcontinent.</p>
  
  <p>Kabuli, associated with Kabul in Afghanistan. These are lighter coloured, with larger seeds and a smoother coat, mainly grown in Southern Europe, Northern Africa, South America and Indian Subcontinent, having been introduced during the 18th century to India.</p>

<p>Note that it says that one of the smaller varieties is commonly grown in Mexico, so the blog isn't really even quite correct to say ""large Mexican chickpeas"" (though I've certainly also seen large chickpeas from Mexican brands).

"Stock vs Broth - What's the difference in usage?","202558","","<p>I've now learned (from this site) that broth and stock are not the same product (see <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/2960/use-any-part-of-an-animal-for-making-stock-broth/2970#2970"">this great answer</a>). </p>

<p>So, in any given scenario, why should one use stock rather than broth, or vice versa?<br>
i.e. What's the practical difference? </p>

<p>EDIT: I'm mostly looking for when to use one vs the other.</p>
","<p><strong>Classification and use of Stocks vs. Broth:</strong></p>

<p>Broths are the result of cooking meat, not just bones. They're generally the result of preparing another item and usually not prepared specifically on their own. The juices poured off from a roasted turkey (after being degreased) would be considered broth.  Whole chickens being poached for another preparation would create broth.</p>

<p>Stocks are made from just the bones. They are prepared specifically for use in other recipes (sauces, soups, stews, rice, etc.)  Stocks are never salted in their preparation or the finished dish will most likely end up too salty due to reduction that will take place upon further cooking. Note that homemade stock will be often a bit more broth-like than restaurant/commercial stocks, since it's really hard to get all the meat off the bones.</p>

<p>Stocks are usually simmered for a very long time (4-6 hours for chicken &amp; 8-12 for veal/beef) to extract maximum flavor and gelatin from the bones.</p>

<p>Broths aren't usually cooked nearly as long due to the fact that cooking the meat for extended periods (even chicken surrounded by the liquid) will result in tough, flavorless meat.</p>

<p>Consomme: a fortified and clarified stock.  The stock is fortified in flavor by the addition of a ""raft"" which is a combination of lean ground meat (appropriate to the type of stock being used) with brunoise (1/16 inch) mirepoix (carrots, onions, celery), and egg whites.  The raft mixture is stirred into the cold stock and as it gently heats, the proteins coagulate forming a ""raft"" on top of the stock.  A small hole is poked in the center (if one hasn't already formed) and as the stock bubbles through the hole it leaches back through the ground meat/egg white raft which filters out impurities to clarify the stock and fortify it with flavor.</p>

<p>Bouillon:  French word for broth.</p>

<p>Court Bouillon: sometimes called a ""short broth"".  A poaching liquid usually used for fish that is usually comprised of water,  acid (lemon juice, vinegar, wine), parsley stems, bay leaves, peppercorns, and some salt.</p>

<p>When to use Stock vs. Broth:
Use stock when a sauce is to be reduced significantly or when clarity of the final result is preferred.</p>

<p>Broths can be substituted for stock when the body of the liquid or clarity isn't important, and when the liquid will be thickened by addition of a starch.</p>

","<p>The risks of eating undercooked steak vary based on the the region, the risk status of the person involved (are they a child, elderly, or immunocompromised in any way).</p>

That's not the Stromboli or Calzone I'm familiar with - but if the definitions change drastically based on geographic area I'm interested in that as well.</p>

","<p>The cut is important for both techniques. For sauteing, you need a lean cut - fillet, sirloin, or good rump steak. These should be cooked quickly over a high heat. As Cerberus has suggested, if you are cooking something else in the same pan, take the beef out and re-add it later; don't boil it in a sauce.</p>

<p>Stewing beef needs some fat and cartilage which breaks down during slow cooking and tenderises the meat. Packs of such beef are usually sold as such in the supermarket; look for a pack with plenty of fat marbled through the meat; 'Lean stewing steak' is as useful as a waterproof teabag! My personal favourite stewing beef is brisket, as it breaks down into nice tender fibres after 2-3 hours cooking.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, browning meat does nothing to 'seal in the juices'. It simply provides a bit of extra colour and flavour by 'caramelising' the outside a little.

"What kind of cookware is suitable for a glass ceramic stovetop?","188820","","<p>I have a glass ceramic stove surface. I need to buy some cookware, but I'm not sure what kind I need to buy.</p>

<p>The manual has the following opinions about what cookware I should use (paraphrased):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Aluminum:</strong> Care must be taken when using aluminum because it can break, fuse to, or mark the stove surface</li>
<li><strong>Copper:</strong> May leave metal marks on stove surface.</li>
<li><strong>Stainless Steel:</strong> Uneven cooking results.</li>
<li><strong>Cast Iron:</strong> Not recommended.</li>
<li><strong>Porcelain-Enamel on Metal:</strong> Heating characteristics vary based on core material. Coating must be smooth or it will scratch the stove surface.</li>
<li><strong>Glass:</strong> Not recommended.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on that information, it seems stainless steel or porcelain-enamel on metal are the only two types that aren't going to ruin the stove surface, and that I'll get the best results while cooking if I choose porcelain-enamel.</p>

<p>However, I see mixed opinions all over the net about what is suitable for the glass ceramic stove surface.

Contrary to what my manual says, this person says I should include cast iron cookware in sets.</p>

<p>What kind of cookware can I buy that will not damage my glass ceramic stove surface?</p>
","<p>I wouldn't pay much attention to this list. I would just get my cookware based on what functionality I need, not based on what my stove manufacturer says.</p>

<p>The idea of not using cast iron on glass to protect the glass from scratches is as perverse as keeping a sunhat in the closet and going to the beach bareheaded to protect the sunhat from color fading. Your stove's purpose isn't to gleam, it is to cook. The manufacturer probably tries to shield himself from customer complaints: ""your stove got scratches"" ""nothing we can do, you treated it against our recommendation"". This would explain the overly cautious list. </p>

<p>I have an induction stove with a glass plate myself. I don't have cast iron cookware from the type common in the US (Lodge pans and similar), but I have a wrought iron pan, not seasoned on the outside (it developed  black rust during seasoning the inside, as well as something which I suspect must be ferrous sulfide). It is smoother than cast iron, but rougher than a typical stainless steel pan. I regularly use it on my stove. Also, I regularly clean the stove with a mild abrasive (equivalent to Unilever's brand Cif) and once or twice, I had a baked-on spill which wouldn't go away with this cleaner, so I used a steel wool scouring pad instead. I worked gently, but still applied enough force to remove the residues. After cleaning and polishing with a glass-ceramic cleaner, my stove literally mirrors the ceiling. I bet it has less scratches than my phone screen. So, I think that all the stories about iron cookware damaging the stovetop are greatly exaggerated. But if you are really scared, you can sand and season the bottom. </p>

<p>The other claims are also dubious. Alu melts at 660°C, you probably won't reach it even if you forget an empty pan on high for hours. Nobody uses pure copper pans anyway, and if it is an inner layer of a sandwich bottom, there is no way it will leave marks. And so on.  Only the glass warning is good - not because it would damage the stove, but because you risk the glass vessel itself to shatter. </p>

<p>Bottomline: Buy based on what material is best for cooking whatever you plan to cook. The stove should be able to take it. And if you are rough and it does get a scratch or two, then I don't see why it should bother you - it is a tool, not a fashion statement. </p>

"Why is it dangerous to eat meat which has been left out and then cooked?","188235","","<p>If cooking meat kills bacteria, and bacteria are responsible for problems with eating meat which has been left out, then why is it dangerous to eat meat which has been left out at room temperature and then thoroughly cooked?</p>

<p><a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/2642/what-do-i-need-to-know-about-temperature-and-food-safety"">A related question</a> mentions that ""Even if the bacteria is dead, toxins can remain if the food was out too long, causing problems"".  However, there's no further detail given.  Are these toxins as dangerous as the bacteria themselves?  How long does meat have to be left out to accumulate a dangerous level of toxins and thus be dangerous even if thoroughly cooked?  Are these toxins the reason for the usual guideline of keeping meat unrefrigerated for a maximum of 2 hours?</p>

<h2>update</h2>

<p>The revelation, courtesy of Aaronut, that <em>e. coli</em> is actually dangerous because of its toxins — which cannot be denatured at temperatures which will leave meat in an edible state — has pretty much answered this question.  And also given me further incentive to stop eating meat altogether :)</p>

With the vast majority of foodborne illnesses, the bacteria aren't particularly harmful at all; what you need to worry about is the protein toxins they produce.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">E.Coli</a> - probably the most well-known form of food poisoning along with Salmonella - is actually a harmless bacteria that already lives in your lower intestine.  But there is a particular strain of E.Coli, notably <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_O157:H7"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">O157:H7</a>, that is primarily associated with food poisoning.  The reason?  It produces what's called a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiga-like_toxin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Shiga-like Toxin</a>.</p>

<p>E.Coli contamination is actually dangerous on two fronts.  Because the bacteria are so well-adapted to surviving in the human digestive system (as I pointed out earlier, that's their primary habitat), ingesting even a relatively small number of the bacteria will result in them multiplying and producing those toxins <em>in your gut</em> (and the rest of the way down).  This is why it normally takes several days for you to feel the effects of this type of food poisoning; that's how long it takes for them to produce the toxins in sufficient quantity for your body to notice.</p>

<p>But they don't need to be in your gut to produce those toxins; a piece of meat at room temperature provides good enough conditions and more than enough raw material for them reproduce and emit those same toxins.  So if you leave it sitting out too long, then it really doesn't matter how many bacteria you kill, you are going to end up with E.Coli poisoning <em>fast</em>, because you don't even need to wait for them to produce the toxins; they're already there.</p>

<p>The problem is that you can't ""kill"" a <a href=""http://www.textbookofbacteriology.net/proteintoxins.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">protein toxin</a> with a brief burst of heat because a protein isn't alive.  It's just a protein.  The temperatures and times needed to <em>destroy</em> that toxin would be similar to the temperatures and times needed to destroy all of the protein in the food, draining all the nutrition value and quite possibly turning it into a lump of charcoal.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Salmonella</a> seems to be a fountain of misinformation with all sorts of people saying that it doesn't produce toxins.  This simply isn't true.  Inside the host it produces what's called an <a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25267073/ns/health-infectious_diseases/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AvrA toxin</a> (which isn't ""toxic"" per se, but allows the bacteria to grow to larger numbers), and some strains can also produce a <a href=""http://www.mgc.ac.cn/cgi-bin/VFs/vfs.cgi?VFID=VF0407#VF0407"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CdtB toxin</a>, which is <em>highly</em> toxic.  (Apparently there's also a <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3176037"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">similar toxin</a> produced by other strains.) I'll be honest, a lot of the medical mumbo-jumbo is way beyond my ability to comprehend, but it seems that a lot of the public confusion comes from the fact that salmonella can do some nasty things even without the toxins - but that doesn't mean that the toxins themselves can't do plenty of damage even if you manage to kill the bacteria.</p>

<p>The same applies to many other types of dangerous bacteria; C.diptheriae produce the diphtheria toxin, C.botulinum produce the botulinum toxin (botulism); even the infamous <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mad cow disease</a> was, as far as we know, caused by a protein, not a bacteria, which is why it was able to be transmitted to humans even through cooked beef.</p>

<p>Are protein toxins the <em>only</em> reason why the USDA insists on a maximum 4-hour cumulative danger zone?  Probably not.  As hobodave says, the more the bacteria multiply, the harder is to kill all of them, even at high temperatures.  The figure of 74° C / 165° F that the food agencies give us for poultry is not going to kill exactly 100% of all the bacteria, and if it only kills - I'm just throwing out a number here - 99.999% of them, that may be good enough for relatively fresh poultry but won't be enough if you've got a whole bacterial <em>colony</em> to worry about.</p>

<p>We can only speculate as to exactly what's entailed by the ""danger zone"" but my guess is that it's actually a combination of statistics, probabilities, and safety margins, which include, but are not limited to, the effects of protein toxins.</p>

"What does it mean to ""fold in"" an ingredient into a mix?","186639","","<p>I see this in baking recipes, but I've never been quite clear on the difference between mixing and ""folding.""</p>
","<p>""Folding"" is a more gentle mixing technique than ""stirring"" and ""mixing"".  Stirring and mixing both denote a more vigorous action.</p>

<p>Folding is usually used for items where something has previously been whipped (such as egg whites or cream) or where tenderness is desired and thus less mixing is advisable (muffins &amp; biscuits).</p>

<p>Folding is usually done with a rubber spatula (for liquid &amp; dry ingredients) or with a wire whisk (often beneficial for whipped cream and egg whites so that the mixture gently incorporates as it falls through the wires).</p>

<p><em><strong>To ""fold"" ingredients together:</em></strong>  Hold the spatula or whisk in your dominant hand and grasp the far edge of the bowl (side that is away from you) with your non-dominant hand.  Turn the bowl towards you with your non-dominant hand while simultaneously scraping around the edge (also toward you) and finish by folding the mixture over on top of itself.  Return both hands to the far side of the bowl and follow-up by cutting through the center of the mixture with your utensil and once again folding the mix over on top of itself (again, turning the bowl simultaneously).  Alternate scraping around the side and through the middle of the bowl until the mixture is just combined together. </p>

<p>Note that if an airy mixture such as egg whites or whipped cream start to go from soft and billowy to more liquid-like, you are overworking it and need to stop to maintain volume.</p>

<p>In the case of whipped cream and egg whites you typically add a small portion to the heavier mixture and actually <em>DO</em> stir this in.  While yes you're losing some of the volume of that portion, it serves to help lighten the heavier batter/mixture.  The rest of the whites/cream are then folded in to the mix in several additions.</p>

<p>Sometimes dry ingredients may be sift on top of whipped eggwhites before being folded.</p>

<p>The larger the spatula or whisk, the fewer strokes that will need to be made and the better the results will be.</p>

"Is it ok to store open cans in the fridge?","182491","","<p>I'd been taught growing up that you should never store canned food in the fridge in the open can. Is there any scientific basis to this, or is it just an old wives tale? </p>

<p>What types of foods should not be stored in their can once open? Would olives, for example, be harmed from this sort of storage? Or only more acidic foods like tomato paste or pineapple be affected?</p>
","<p>Short answer: storing food in an open can is normally safe for a short period, but inadvisable. </p>

<p>Longer answer:
There are three main issues with storing foods in an open can.  They are metal oxidation, contamination, and funk.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Oxidation.  As commenters have observed, cans used to be made of tin, which is toxic.  Modern cans are made from either steel or aluminum.  If the contents of the can are acidic, cans are lined with a polymer (plastic) inner layer.  If that layer is broken -- say, by a major dent in the can or by using a knife to scrape out contents -- then the acid can get to the metal and, over time, corrode it, and some of the now-oxidized metal will dissolve into the food.  As far as we know, the oxidized metal is not toxic, but it tastes horrible.</p></li>
<li><p>Contamination.  Any open container of food can become contaminated when an airborne water droplet (tiny -- microns wide) containing a nasty microbe drips or settles into it.  The major biological culprit here is Listeria, which can grow in any moist environment, including spaces refrigerated below 40F (5C).  Also, if juices from your raw meat drips onto an upper shelf, which later gets wiped inadvertently into your container of ready-to-eat food, you are likely to get Salmonella or E coli.  This risk can be mitigated if you keep your raw meats on the lowest shelf, but not eliminated.  Also, it is worth noting that contamination through this pathway is a relatively rare event -- but even so, it is not worth the risk.</p></li>
<li><p>Funk.  Have you ever put an ice cube in your beverage and notice your beverage tastes strange?  The chemical compounds that give food their flavor tend to be volatile (meaning they will readily leave the food into the surrounding air).  Also, the mustiness of a refrigerator/freezer is due to volatile compounds produced by mold and mildew.  Foods that are wet and/or fatty can be molecular velcro to these compounds.</p></li>

"What kind of cheese does Pizza Hut or Domino's use?","182461","","<p>I have been experimenting with Pizza and cakes.

","<p>Pizza hut uses skim milk mozzarella on it's pizza, at least in the USA.  Not sure what they use in other countries, but I would imagine it is still the same.  Skim milk mozzarella is extremely stretchy, but loses a little on the flavor end.  More expensive pizzerias normally spring for the full fat mozzarella cheese.</p>

<p>Dominos uses a mix of cheese, made up of mozzarella, Pecarino, Parmesan, and asiago cheeses. I think in their most recent reboot they switched to part skim mozzarella but I am not one hundred percent on that.</p>

"How do you make a cake lift equally and minimize doming?","181858","","<p>Some time ago, I baked a cake (Sachertorte to be exact).
The taste and texture was fine, so my recipe is okay.</p>

<p>My biggest issue was the shape. In the middle it was really a lot higher than on the sides.
I would like to redo it in the near future, but preferably with a flat(ter) surface.
(Especially since I put icing on top and I don't want it to drip off this time.)</p>

<p>Anyone knows the cause of my problem, or even better a solution?
I think I put enough butter on the side of my springform pan, in case this is an option.</p>
","<h2><strong>Why the doming happens</strong></h2>

<p>When you heat leavened dough, two things happen: </p>

<ol>
<li>leavening agent creates bubbles, causing the soft dough to rise. For chemically leavened doughs (baking powder or baking soda), the amount of lift mostly depends on the time the bubble creating reaction goes on and the concentration of non-spent leavening agent. </li>
<li>The gluten in the dough sets, building a sturdy 3-d mesh of long, branchey molecules. When the mesh is strong enough, further bubbles cannot stretch it more, despite the fact that the leavening reaction is still going on. The setting of the mesh depends mostly on heat and the amount of gluten present in flour. </li>
</ol>

<p>The pattern you are seeing means that your cake gets hotter on the sides than in the middle. <strong>The sides get set early and stop rising, while the middle is still soft and continues rising.</strong>  </p>

<p>This happens because the walls of the pan conduct heat to the sides of the cake quicker than heat is conducted inside the cake. You see the phenomenon in an exaggarated form in a muffin, which is usually higher than wide: it is always rounded on top, and often split, because the liquid core from the middle continues to rise after a crust has formed on the surface. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SYx35.jpg"" alt=""muffin rising""></p>

<h2><strong>How to prevent it</strong></h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Slower heating</strong><br>
One good solution could involve a slower, more even heating method.  </p>

<p>This can be accomplished by using a pan which insulates well. With an insulating pan, the sides will stay liquid longer and rise more. Unfortunately there are no insulated drop-out-bottom pans. </p>

<p><strong><em>Porcelain</em></strong><br>
I have had good results in a porcelain or Pyrex pan. The pan insulates the cake from the bottom and the sides, but not from the top, so you will need to bake it on a lower rack and/or reduce temperature on the upper heater in order to not burn the upper surface.</p>

<p>Getting a cake layer out of the pan in one piece can be hard.<br>
To deal with this problem, if your batter is not too sticky, <strong>the bottom of the pan can be lined with parchment paper</strong>. The sides can be lined with a strip of parchment or well lubricated with fat. This approach is a hassle.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IRKOZ.jpg"" alt=""papered cake pan""></p>

<p><strong><em>Insulate a metal pan</em></strong><br>
Perhaps, when combined with other approaches, a metal cake pan with thicker walls will work well enough.<br>
You could also try a more DIY solution, like attaching 2-3 layers of a cut-to-fit silicone rolling mat stripes to the outside of the walls of a metal pan. However, it is quite hard to come up with a good attachment method (glue could release toxic fumes at oven temperatures, if it holds at all). So this method should work, but is somewhat hard to apply. </p>

<p><strong><em>Glass and silicone pans</em></strong><br>
There are pans with glass bottoms and silicone walls but I think these would not help because the glass would insulate better than the thin silicone.</p>

<p><strong><em>Preheating</em></strong><br>
Perhaps preheating the detached bottom of a metal pan with the oven could help, but I haven't tried it. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Minimize the center</strong><br>
A second approach is to minimize the liquid core by making a thin cake.<br>
If the middle of the cake is heated quickly enough from above and below, it will set shortly after the walls do, and there will be no unset center to ""bloom"".  </p>

<p><strong><em>Use a bigger pan.</em></strong><br>
I think that Americans mostly use 9 inch pans, but if you used an original sacher recipe from Austria, it is probably meant for a 26 or a 28 cm pan.  </p>

<p><strong><em>Bake the two layers separately</em></strong><br>
Divide the batter into two pans instead of making a single layer and cutting it. This is unorthodox, as you get more crust but it's better than a hunchbacked sacher. You should use a scale or at least a measuring jug to divide the batter, or you'll end up with different thicknesses. Also remember to reduce the baking time, as the core will heat up faster. </p>

<p>Use a toothpick for probing doneness. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reduce the leavening</strong><br>
The third idea is to reduce the amount of leavening agent.  </p>

<p>The walls will always set before the core and, if there is enough baking powder, the core will still expand a little bit more. If the concentration of baking powder is low you'll get less bubbles, so less lift.<br>
Of course, using too little baking powder will also ruin the cake, so you'll have to be cautious and experiment a bit before hitting the correct amount. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lower heat</strong><br>
The fourth approach is to give the outer portions of the cake more time to rise by baking at lower heat.  </p>

<p>This is somewhat risky, as it can result in a different texture of the final product, due to the different rate at which water will evaporate from the dough and a longer baking time. Also, if your temperature is too low, you won't get a golden crust on a light-coloured dough. This should not be a problem for a frosted cake like the sacher. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Less gluten</strong><br>
The fifth approach is to use a flour with less gluten.  </p>

<p>With less gluten you get a mesh which is less dense and needs more time until it gets firm enough to prevent rising. <strong>Use cake flour instead of all purpose flour</strong>. A bit more fat will also help to inhibit gluten development but too much will change the taste and texture.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All methods I described should attribute to a solution, but probably none of them will be sufficient by itself. You'll have to pick a combination of them and see what works best for you. </p>

<h2>General Cake Techniques</h2>

<p>You should also apply all the usual methods for getting a good cake:  </p>

<ul>
<li>measure with a scale  </li>
<li>use room-temperature ingredients  </li>
<li>sift your flour  </li>
<li>only combine dry mix with fluid mix at the last moment before putting it into the oven  </li>
<li>preheat the oven well  </li>
</ul>

<p>These techniques ensure a better batter texture, which means a more even heating. They will also ensure a more consistent leavening process because:</p>

<ul>
<li>the ratio of leavening to other ingredients will be correct</li>
<li>the batter will be more thoroughly mixed</li>
<li>the leavening reaction will not start early</li>
</ul>

<p>Not following these techniques is more likely to result in a lopsided cake or a big bubble. I realize that this hasn't happened in the case you describe, but it would be too bad to get an asymmetrically risen cake after you took all the precautions against a disproportionally rising center. </p>

"Will avocado stay fresh longer if stored in the refrigerator?","181060","","<p>Should I store avocado in the refrigerator or will it make no difference for how long they stay fresh?</p>
","<p>Ripening of the avocado is slowed down greatly by refrigeration, so it is usually a good idea to let the avocado ripen fully at room temperature. Once it is ripe, it can be stored in the refrigerator for at least a week. This way, it is ready to use whenever you want it. Fortunately, there is a day or two when the avocado is ripe, but not too ripe, so if you check on it everyday when ripening, you will be able to save it at the correct ripeness without worrying about it too much.</p>

<p>Putting an unripened avocado in the refrigerator may prevent it from ever ripening completely. Once cooled to near freezing (40F in most refrigerators), it seems that some avocados (maybe it depends on the type) don't ripen anymore, even when removed to room temperature. </p>

"Cream based substitute for milk","175927","","<p>I typically have heavy cream on hand but not milk so I'm frequently in need of a method to substitute the milk in recipes with cream.  It seems to me that adding some amount of water and sugar to the cream would get it closer to milk in composition.  I realize that the exact method and appropriateness of the substitution depends on the specific recipe but am looking for general substitution guidelines.  </p>
","<p>Yes, you can often do this substitution and I've done it successfully many times when I've run out of milk unexpectedly, but you should know that the substitution is never going to be perfect.</p>

<p>On a purely mathematical basis, let's say your heavy cream is 36% M.F. You need partially-skimmed 2% milk for your recipe.  If you go purely by weight (which is almost 1:1 for volume when talking about mostly water), then 250 mL of 2% milk will contain about 5 g of milk fat.  To get that from 36% cream, you only need about 14 mL, or approximately 3 teaspoons of cream.  (<strong>Note - don't do this, read on!</strong>)</p>

<p>Of course, diluting cream at a ratio of 15:1 is ridiculous and you'll end up with something that's just really watery, and that's because milk is more than just water and fat.  I only provide the above calculation for illustrative purposes, to show why there's no hard rule or even rule of thumb for this particular substitution.</p>

<p>With normal cream, most people go with half water, half cream, or if they're trying to approximate skim milk then maybe 1 part cream to 2 parts water.  If you have double cream, I would probably use 1 part cream to 3 or 4 parts water; that will give you a reasonable approximation of the consistency of whole or skim milk without making it too watery.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that different recipes/preparations use milk for different reasons, so this isn't going to work everywhere.  I certainly wouldn't do it in baking, but for many stovetop recipes, the main purpose of the milk is just moisture, so you're fine to substitute cream + water and it doesn't really matter if you're ""exact"" - which you can't be anyway.</p>

","<p><strong>1. Chemical leaveners</strong></p>

<p>There are two ""oldfashioned"" chemical leaveners, both still used today in traditional German and Scandinavian gingerbread recipes: </p>

<ul>
<li>Potassium carbonate (potash or pearl ash) and </li>
<li>Ammonium bicarbonate (salt of heartshorn)</li>
</ul>

<p>They do have their own quirks and pitfalls, but if nothing else is available...</p>

<p>If you can get baking soda, mix with cream of tartar to make baking powder. <br>
If your store does not stock it, you pharmacy most likely will carry ""sodium hydrogen carbonate"" (which is another name for baking soda) either as treatment for heartburn, it's an antacid (because it reacts with acid, neutralzing it and making these nice bubbles, as we know from baking...) or as topical treatment for allergic reactions of the skin (poison ivy and others).</p>

<p><strong>2. Biological leaveners</strong></p>

<p>This boils down to <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>, aka. baker's yeast or brewer's yeast. Of course you get <em>very</em> different results and have to follow a different procedure. But here are some recipes where they are used somewhat interchangeably, e.g. some types of pancakes or waffles and, obviously, bread (vs. sodabread). <br>
The charming thing about yeast is, that if your are <em>really, really</em> far from a store, you can still get your hands on yeast: Start a sourdough using the yeasts naturally occuring on fruits or the air around you. <br> 
Probably not the kind of substitution you had in mind, though.</p>

<p><strong>3. No leaveners</strong></p>

<p>With good technique, you can incorporate a lot of air (because that's what all leaveners are supposed to do) in your baking goods by whipping your eggs well. There are various approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can whip the whole eggs. </li>
<li>Whip the yolks (with hot water or over a water bath to stabilize them) to Zabaione-like consistency.</li>
<li>Whip the whites and fold into your batter.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will want to bake these batters right away before the bubbles get a chance to burst. The air will expand during baking and the hardening egg/flour-mixture will trap them in the baked goods. Contrary to many recipes out there there is no real need to bake a pound cake or even sponge cake with baking powder if it's done right.</p>

<p>Other recipes without leavener (or rather with the egg trapping steam generated by a rather high water content) are the members of the popover family (Yorkshire pudding in the UK, Pfitzauf in Swabia, some dutch pancakes) and pâté a choux. </p>

","<p>This depends on a lot of things. </p>

<p>The idea of preheating is that you want to get all the surfaces inside your oven (walls, floor, door, racks) up to the desired cooking temperature. This makes for more even temperatures throughout the oven, and gives a little thermal mass so you don't lose ALL your heat when you open the door for a few seconds or put something cold in there.</p>

An aluminum sheet with a few room temperature cookies on it won't pull the temperature in the oven down like a 25 pound turkey that's 40F/5C inside.

<p>Our oven, which has a large baking stone in the bottom all the time, takes a while to get uniformly up to temperature, even after the oven says it's preheated, because the stone doesn't heat up as fast as the rest of the surfaces. It takes at least 20 minutes after the ""I'm fully heated"" beep before the stone is fully up to temp. We have problems with things baking poorly if we don't preheat for quite a while, but on the upside, if we put a cold roast in or open the door a lot, the temperature in the oven stays pretty high.</p>

<p>If your oven is lightweight, flimsy or drafty, it may be as hot as it's going to get the moment the preheat alert goes off.</p>

<p>45 minutes is probably a lot more preheat than you'll need in almost any case. In some cases even 15 minutes is more than you need. It really depends on your oven and what you're putting in.</p>

"How to cook fall-off-the-bone beef spare ribs in oven or on stove top?","171915","","<p>All,</p>

<p>I would like to cook spare ribs to a fall-off-the-bone consistency.  I don't have access to a grill.</p>

<p>I know how to do that with pork shoulders (dry rubbed, then uncovered in the oven at low heat for 6-8hrs), but spare ribs are a different type of animal.  They are individually smaller pieces (my ribs are sawed in chunks), and they are fairly fatty, with a big bone.</p>

<p>What should I do?  Should I pan-sear them first, do I need some liquid in the dish?  Should I cover them?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>JDelage</p>
","<p>You can do a low temperature cook on your ribs the same way you would do your pork shoulders.  It's just the cooking times are shorter, that's all.</p>

<p>Set your oven to 250-275F, and roast those ribs until they're done.  I've had beef ribs done in as few as 3-4 hours, but as many as 5.  Optionally, you can foil your ribs about halfway into your cook, with some liquid in the foil pack.  Just be aware that they'll cook faster if they're foiled.  And depending on your preference, you may want to take them out of the foil to finish them.</p>

"Pan frying chicken breasts?","171776","","<p>I've got these nice chicken breasts, pre-marinated, from the supermarket meat counter.</p>

<p>There was a little sign on 'em that said ""Great for pan searing!"" (Is that different from frying, really?)</p>

<p>How do I go about this? How do I know when they're done? It's not like I can check the middle to see if it's still pink, as can be done with beef. How long should it take, what heat, etc? General advice appreciated.</p>
","<p>I've never been one to keep track of cooking times with meats, since it will vary wildly with meat thickness, burner strength and type, phase of the moon, etc.</p>

<p>Edit: I forgot to answer ""how to go about searing"".  I sear chicken like I sear beef: hard and fast.  The point is to get that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maillard reaction</a> going to add some deliciousness and texture (not to ""seal in flavor"", which is hogwash).</p>

<ol>
<li>Pat the chicken dry with paper towels.</li>
<li>Put just enough oil in a heavy-bottomed pan to cover the bottom.</li>
<li>Put the pan over medium-high heat and get it good and hot - the oil may just start showing wisps of smoke.</li>
<li>Lay the chicken in the pan carefully, being sure to start at the edge closest to you and lay it down <strong>away from you</strong>.  This will prevent you from getting splashed with hot oil.</li>
<li>Let it cook for 2-4 minutes until you get a nice sear on it.</li>
<li>Flip, (the chicken, not you) again being careful to <strong>flip away from you</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now if the breast is thin enough (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqjfQP3Mp2k"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">maybe you butterflied it beforehand</a>), you can just let it finish in the pan.  Often, though, after flipping I'll pop the whole pan into a 400F oven and finish it in there.  Again, times will vary, but I would start checking it after 5 minutes.</p>

<p>The most accurate way to determine doneness of any meat is with an instant-read thermometer.  I love my <a href=""http://www.thermoworks.com/products/thermapen/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Thermapen</a>, but it's a bit pricey.  You can find inexpensive dial or digital ones at your local grocery.  The <a href=""http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes-and-cooking/meat-and-poultry-temperature-guide/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">recommended internal temp for poultry</a> is 165F.</p>

<p>Normally, I poke my chicken with a finger to determine doneness, then double-check it by cutting it open.  Fully-cooked chicken is white all the way through, and the juices run clear when you cut into it.  Under-cooked chicken is pink, and the juices run pink as well.  I get fresh chicken from a local farm, so I cook it until it is barely done to be sure it stays moist and delicious.  For supermarket chicken I would err on the side of completely done, since you have no idea where the meat came from.</p>

"Eating food from a slightly rusting cast iron dutch oven...is it safe?","170406","","<p>I have a cast iron dutch oven. It has a self-basting lid, basically it has a grid of little cone shapes on the underside of the lid. The idea is that liquid condenses on underside of the lid and these little cones help the liquid drip back down onto the stuff that is cooking.</p>

<p>I noticed that the tips were a little rusted but I decided to cook a one pot chicken and rice dish in it any way. It the food safe to eat? I couldn't discern any type of rust flavor or anything in the food. I searched around on the web a bit and couldn't really get a straight answer about eating rust. All I've read is that you have to injest quite bit to be of any concern. I think that cooking and eating the food this one time probably won't put my health at risk.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a more definitive answer on this? </p>
","<p><strong>You're going to die horribly from cooking in a rusted pan!</strong>  </p>

<p>Just kidding! A little iron in your food isn't going to hurt you, and can actually help prevent anemia.  To quote On Food and Cooking (pg 790): <strong>""Excess iron is readily eliminated from the body, and most people can actually benefit from additional dietary iron.""</strong>  </p>

<p>Now, to back this up further:</p>

<p><strong>You won't get much iron out of the pan unless you cook something acidic in it.</strong>  Rust is insoluble in water without acid present, and in order to become soluble you have to convert to iron nitrate, sulfate, or chloride, according to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility_table."">solubility table.</a>  Nothing you cook in there is likely to cause the necessary reactions to render it highly soluble.</p>

<p>I found a <a href=""http://whatscookingamerica.net/Information/IronCastIron.htm"">source</a> quoting specific numbers for iron from cast iron cookware, if you are concerned.  <strong>The gist is that most cooking in cast iron added from 1 to 5 mg of iron to the food, with the highest numbers coming from acidic foods with tomatoes.</strong>  Applesauce was the highest, good for about 7 mg.  </p>

<p>This level of iron intake is quite safe and healthy. To give you a point of comparison, the <a href=""http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/"">FDA suggests</a> iron intake of 8 mg/day for men, and 18 mg/day for women, and 80% of the world may be iron deficient.  Iron toxicity occurs at about 45 mg/day.  So, as I initially stated, you're perfectly safe cooking in your cast iron, and are probably helping your health rather than hurting it!</p>

"Why is fish not considered as meat?","169504","","<p>While reading <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/14385/fish-and-cheese-an-unbreakable-rule/"">a thread</a> on cooking.SE an old question popped into my head: I am an Asian and had no problems with dishes with both meat and “fish”. But some of my elder German friends say that meat and “fish” don't fit. </p>

<p><strong>Why is fish not considered as meat? And what kind of species are considered as ""fish""?</strong></p>

<p>Some thoughts about that: </p>

<p>When I was a child I thought every creature that has muscle tissue has meat. Fish (these animals that swim in the water and have fins like Nemo or your goldfish) included.</p>

<p>A friend of mine calls herself a vegetarian. I thought a vegetarian is someone who doesn't eat meat or more explicit: Someone who avoid dishes that contain parts of something that has central nervous system or called ""animal"". But she eats fish. <br>
Another case: On Good Friday (or friday in general?!) some Christians in Germany (or anywhere else) eat ""vegetarian"" food - but including fish.</p>

<p>Then I heard about the biblical story: God hated the humans but liked Noah, Noah built an arch, rescued himself, his family and some animals and God made it rain until everything drowned. The only species that didn't drowned... fish. So I thought fish were the holy animal since the Protestants had a fish as a symbol (aside the cross).</p>

<p>And what about shrimps, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, squids, clams, crustaceans (I avoid to use “shell fish” ;D),  …? They are also called “fish”. I don’t think that the bible would refer to these kinds of … fish. The texture of these compared to real fish is completely different. </p>

<p>After some googleing I found some “nutrition scientists” in a forum who claim that fish are no mammals and therefore have no “meat”. But then I would conclude that poultry and reptiles would neither have “meat”. 
Other claimed “scientists” say that only animals with red meat would have meat. No. Then whale meat, tuna meat, duck meat and beef would exist but no chicken meat, turkey, pork, ... </p>

<p>A mutual property of real fish, shrimps, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, squids, clams, crustaceans is the ability to stay for some time in the water (sea, lake, river or pool) and the ability to reproduce themselves by laying (?) eggs. What about sea snakes, jelly fishes, lungfish, whales, dolphins, seals, frogs, turtles and other animals which go for some time from water into land and vice versa?</p>

<p><hr>
<sub>Sorry for the dozens grammar mistakes ._.</sub></p>
","<p>I suspect that this is a question that it's impossible to give a definitive answer for.</p>

<p>In reality it's probably a mixture of religion, culture and confusion.</p>

<p>I reckon that in most cases that it boils down to ""Fish isn't a meat because when I was growing up I was told it's not a meat"", or something like that.</p>

<p>In terms of etymology, ""meat"" originally just meant ""food"" and as such could be used for food of any kind. This carries over to some extent in modern usage - we sometimes talk about <em>meat</em> of a fruit/vegetable to describe the inside of it, <a href=""http://superhumancoach.com/benefits-of-coconut-meat/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">coconut for example.</a></p>

<p>Personally I use <em>meat</em> to describe animal flesh regardless of the origin, I don't view the meat/fish deviation as being one that is either meaningful nor useful.</p>

<p>RE: fish and vegetarianism,</p>

<p>Fish isn't vegetarian.</p>

<p>Phew, glad we could clear that up.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xQNiwm.gif"" alt=""enter image description here"">
There's an accepted meaning for the word and it excludes the eating of fish. There are a lot of people who eat fish and are otherwise vegetarian*, which is perfectly fine, but it's a misuse of the word. At the end of the day we all eat what we're comfortable eating, but it can be difficult grouping that many variations. This confuses others and in the end leads to inconvenience to vegetarians.</p>

<p>Oh language...</p>

<p>*Although this probably isn't true. If you're eating fish than it's obviously not on moral grounds so you're less likely to exclude animal products in some of the more obscure places, like may be in wines, cheeses, or indeed any processed goods.</p>

<p><strong>Is Frozen Food Safe?</strong>
Food stored constantly at 0 °F (-18 °C) will always be safe. Only the quality suffers with lengthy freezer storage. Freezing keeps food safe by slowing the movement of molecules, causing microbes to enter a dormant stage. Freezing preserves food for extended periods because it prevents the growth of microorganisms that cause both food spoilage and foodborne illness.</p>

<p><strong>Does Freezing Destroy Bacteria &amp; Parasites?</strong>
Freezing to 0 °F (-18 °C) inactivates any microbes — bacteria, yeasts and molds — present in food. Once thawed, however, these microbes can again become active, multiplying under the right conditions to levels that can lead to foodborne illness. Since they will then grow at about the same rate as microorganisms on fresh food, you must handle thawed items as you would any perishable food.</p>

<p>Trichina and other parasites can be destroyed by sub-zero freezing temperatures. However, very strict government-supervised conditions must be met. Home freezing cannot be relied upon to destroy trichina. Thorough cooking, however, will destroy all parasites.</p>

<p><strong>Freshness &amp; Quality</strong>
Freshness and quality at the time of freezing affect the condition of frozen foods. If frozen at peak quality, thawed foods emerge tasting better than foods frozen near the end of their useful life. So freeze items you won't use quickly sooner rather than later. Store all foods at 0° F (-18 °C) or lower to retain vitamin content, color, </p>

<p>However, in the UK provolone is hard to come by outside of Italian delis, and Italian delis are relatively rare. I understand that it's similar to mozzarella but drier. </p>

<p>So, what is a good substitute for provolone? Is it usually used for flavour or for its melting texture?</p>
","<p>There are two main types of provolone: <em>piccante</em> (sharp) and <em>dolce</em> (sweet).  Most <em>braciola</em> recipes I've seen call for the sharp version.  Sharp provolone tastes very similar to cheddar, which I assume is abundant in the UK.  The issue is that ""real"" cheddar is a hard cheese and provolone is only semi-hard.  Here in the US, we have a softer version of sharp cheddar-style cheese that is made in Wisconsin.  If a similar semi-hard sharp cheddar variant is available in the UK, I would recommend that.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that the term ""braciola"" (or sometimes ""braciole"") means a lot of different things to different people.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian-American_cuisine"" rel=""nofollow"">To most Americans</a>, likely including the author of your book, it takes on the Sicilian meaning of an <em>involtino</em>.  Sometimes the meat will be filled with a soft cheese mixture like mozzarella mixed with grated pecorino romano.  However, if the recipe calls for a harder cheese like provolone, it is likely referring to a variant that is very popular in the US in which the provolone is cut into thin slices (usually using a deli slicer) and layered on the meat before the meat is rolled.  Therefore, any substitute for the provolone should ideally be thinly sliced.</p>

"Does it matter what kind of sugar is used in baking?","163666","","<p>The baking recipes I use specify many kinds of sugar e.g. caster, raw, white, soft etc.</p>

<p>Generally, I always just use raw sugar, mainly for convenience.</p>

<p>Does it really make a difference?</p>
","<p>Yes!</p>

<p>Sugar is often used as a ""wet"" ingredient in baking.  That means it needs to be dissolved in the water in order to prevent too much gluten from being produced (making the result fluffy/flaky, and not chewy).  Different sugars hold different amounts of moisture (for example, brown sugar holds more than white) and using sugar with crystals that are too large (or too small) will make the texture come out completely wrong.  Too small and your cake will be rubber; too large and your biscuit will fall apart.</p>

<p>Also, if you're using the sugar for creaming (with fat), you generally need to use a coarser sugar.  Superfine sugar will dissolve too quickly and won't allow enough air to be incorporated.  Confectioner's sugar is good for creaming but has completely different properties from crystal sugar - it's been ""processed"" and has cornstarch added, so you can't just substitute in equal quantities.</p>

<p>Of course, it goes without saying that the taste is different as well.  But even more important than the taste are the solubility characteristics which, as explained above, will have noticeable effects on other parts of the recipe.</p>

<p>It does depend what you're baking; if the sugar is being used purely for flavouring, then you can use whatever sugar you like.  Much of the time in baking though, sugar is used for more than just sweetening, and it's important to be aware of that.  If the sugar is being creamed or dissolved, don't substitute unless you're sure you know what you're doing.</p>

I feel like I'm probably just missing one or two ingredients that make the difference, but my trusted recipe books and google haven't been of much use. </p>
","<p>I have just looked in the book ""Thai Food"" (by David Thompson).</p>

<p>Both are very similar. The main difference I can see is that there are souring agents in the red curry (fish sauce and shrimp paste). These are absent in the panaeng which has peanuts as a major ingredient in the paste (and nutmeg).</p>

<p>The panaeng is also usually made with beef which is simmered in count milk until tender.</p>

"How can I tell when chicken thighs are sufficiently cooked to eat?","156602","","<p>Last night I was grilling chicken thighs on a barbecue and I was told that if there was any pink inside them, they are not safe to eat. My question is twofold:</p>

<p>(a) Is this true?</p>

<p>(b) Is there a way to tell that doesn't involve cutting the thighs open to have a look at the colour?</p>
","<p>Pink has to do with blood, which typically runs clear once it reaches a certain temperature.  This is not a great rule of thumb for making delicious food.</p>

<p>It's particularly problematic with thighs, because they contain a vein that can remain red or pink well through the cooking process.  This is less so if the chicken is washed or the veins cleaned.  </p>

<p>The key is temperature, not color.  If you have a meat thermometer, aim for 165-170°F (74-77°C), keeping in mind that meat will continue cooking for 5-10°F (3-6°C) once it's pulled and allowed to rest for 5 minutes.  If you don't have a thermometer, aim for meat that is responsively tender but not too firm, opaque rather than transparent, and not slimy or gelatinous in texture.  Thighs are a little more tolerant than breasts when it comes to drying out because they have more fat, but nothing is sadder than overcooked meat (except maybe salmonella poisoning).</p>

"What's the best way to tell that pasta is done (when boiling)?","155761","","<p>I've tried a number of different ways to tell when spaghetti, capellini and other pasta types are done, but I'm curious if there are more specific rules of thumb.  With regular spaghetti, I've tried biting-in-half to see if it's still white in the middle, throwing it against the fridge (which seems more amusing than useful), etc., but are there better and more reliable ways?</p>

<p>Also, how much does pasta 'cook' once you take it out of the water?  So if you want an <em>al dente</em> pasta, do you take it off slightly before done?  If so, how much?</p>
","<p><em>Al dente</em> cooking is a transitional state that lasts for a very short amount of time (one minute longer in boiling water makes pasta too soft, one minute shorter and it's still crunchy). For this reason, authentic Italian pasta packages state a precise cooking time, which is very reliable to make a good <em>al dente</em> pasta.
A cooking time interval (e.g. ""7 to 10 minutes"") is usually given to accommodate to other countries taste, who may prefer a softer pasta, and therefore its presence could be a good indicator of an Italian look-alike pasta brand. In this case the lower figure indicates the <em>al dente</em> cooking.</p>

<p>Lacking this information, a good cooking time can be figured by cross section size, length and shape of pasta: obviously, thicker and squat formats require more time. Complex shapes, such as farfalle, can be trickier because a thick core could reach the <em>al dente</em> cooking while the thinner edges are already too soft.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, cooking times for common pasta formats are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Long and very thin (spaghettini, bavette): 6 min</li>
<li>Long and thin (spaghetti, linguine, bucatini): 8 min</li>
<li>Short and thick (maccheroni, rigatoni, fusilli): 12 min</li>
<li>Small and thick (farfalle) : 8 min</li>
<li>Small and thin (pasta usually boiled straight into broth): 6 min</li>
</ul>

<p>These cooking times apply only for dry durum-wheat pasta; other types (such as fresh egg pasta) usually have a shorter cooking time.</p>

<p>After straining the boiling water, pasta continues to cook by its own heat; for this reason it has to be eaten as soon as possible. Only for some Italian regional recipes (typically pasta boiled straight into a thick vegetable juice, e.g. pasta with beans, pasta with potatoes) you may want to let it rest for up to 5 minutes after straining to let the juices coagulate.</p>

<p>Also, for recipes where pasta has to undergo a second cooking after boiling (e.g. stir frying in a pan with vegetables, shrimps, mushrooms, etc.) a better result is obtained by boiling pasta just one minute less than the cooking time given on the package.</p>

"Do you heat the pan first, then add oil? Or put the oil in and heat up with the pan?","154725","","<p>As the title says...</p>

<p>I personally heat up the pan first, then put the oil in and after it's heated up add the ingredients.  I go with the line of reasoning that doing it this way gives the oil less time to burn, thinking that if you do it the other way, by the time the pan <em>and</em> oil has heated up, the oil could already be starting to burn.</p>

<p>I've never experimented, but I think this is more of an issue with electric stoves since you can modulate the heat more quickly with gas, ie turn it off if the oil's starting to smoke.</p>
","<p>The typical rule of thumb is that if it's a non-stick pan you do add a little oil to the pan first before heating.  Most manufacturers usually recommend this to extend the life of the non-stick coating.</p>

<p>For regular pans (those without non-stick coating) you should heat them dry until you can feel the radiating from the surface when your hand is held about 6-inches above the bottom.  Add your oil at this point.  You'll actually need to use less oil because the same amount will spread across a greater surface area due to its decreased viscosity as it heats.  Plus your oil will heat up instantly and when you add your food it's less inclined to stick.  Most people get impatient waiting for pans to heat (and in general) and this also ensures that the food isn't going into a pan with oil that's cold or not hot enough.  When cold oil goes into a pan and cold food ends up on top of it you'll end up with one big sticky mess.  As for adding oil before heating the pan, the longer fats heat without anything else in the pan, the quicker they'll break down and burn.  </p>

"Why let dough rise twice?","153210","","<p>I'm just wondering, what's the point of letting dough rise twice? I've seen a bunch of recipes in the form:</p>

<li>Let it rise</li>
<li>Knead again</li>
<li>Let it rise again</li>
</ol>

<p>Why do they do this? Doesn't kneading just push the air bubbles out?</p>
","<p>Allowing dough to rise twice results in a finer gluten structure than allowing it to rise once.  It results in a smaller crumb and prevents huge gaping airholes in your bread.  The reason that you have to let it re-rise is that you just pushed all the air out with the kneading you did developing that gluten structure.</p>

"Why use yeast instead of baking powder?","152934","","<p>Both yeast and baking powder are used to gas-fill the pastry, make it expand and thus make it soft and fluffy.</p>

<p>Using yeast is rather inconvenient - it can be dead already or if the yeast is submerged in too hot water it can die and also waiting for yeast to work to let it gas-fill the pastry before baking is also not that convenient. Looks like the baking powder is more convenient - it can be stored for ages, can be mixed with hot water, baking can be started immediately after mixing the pastry.</p>

<p>Why is yeast used then? What are those advantages of yeast tham make people use yeast and not the baking powder?</p>
","<p>Baking powder, especially if too great a quantity is used, adds an unpleasant flavor to a baked good.  Even in an appropriate quantity it can be noticeable and it certainly doesn't do anything to enhance the flavor.  Many baked goods traditionally don't use a chemical leavener at all, but instead rely on technique.  Creaming butter and sugar together or whipping egg whites was historically used to make cakes which rose solely based on the bubble network that was created.</p>

<p>Yeast, on the other hand, creates a delightful flavor that you associate with your favorite crusty loaf of bread.  Yeast can be used not only in making bread but also in some excellent cakes (<a href=""http://smittenkitchen.com/2010/03/st-louis-gooey-butter-cake/"">St. Louis Gooey Butter Cake</a>, for example, although many ""knock off"" recipes cheat here and miss out on the true goodness).  Yeast also provides a significantly different texture during the rising due to the intentional creation of a gluten network (usually something you absolutely don't want in a quick bread or quick cake)&nbsp;— you don't get a crumb with big, airy holes from baking powder or baking soda with an acid.</p>

<p>Also, in my experience baking powder lasts six months in the pantry and yeast lasts at least six months in the fridge.  The shelf life is not so different.</p>

<p>What is the proper method to maintain the quality of the food as much as possible?  Cooking and thawing times when we decide to serve it are less of a factor. </p>

<p>We used standard noodles (not the no-boil type) and it has canned sauce, pork sausage, ground beef, ricotta, and fresh mozzarella in case the ingredients impact is the best option.  </p>
","<p>I'd say freeze nearly all of them uncooked and bake when ready.  That way they go through only one cooking and maintain the fresh lasagna taste/feel.</p>

<p>The sauce and and the cheese will freeze ok.  Mozzarella is a pretty sensitive cheese and once it's been baked, it's not going to hold as well when thawed and re-warmed. In my experience it gets gummy and the fat runs off.  You have much better chance of enjoying a good meal with the cheese frozen raw.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, your noodles will likely take the hardest hit, but will likely fare better than going through two heat cycles.</p>

<p>The ground beef and sausage will also fare better that way.</p>

<p>The reason I suggested freezing <strong>MOST</strong> and not all, is that there are times when you're behind the 8-ball, hungry, and don't have the time to bake the sucker, and even ponder settling for dog-food.

<p>Also: is it bad to have the oven going (even at a low temp) if I'm not at the house? </p>
","<p>To achieve ""done"" pork ribs should reach an internal temp of 160°F (71ºC). The longer it takes to get there be more tender they will be. I would not recommend going any lower than 200°F (93ºC) for your cooking temp, even if that means turning the heat up a little at the end to reach your internal temp of 160°F. Put a good rub on, wrap the racks of ribs (individually) in aluminum foil, with some beer or cola in there (or other braising liquid) and let them go. For a video of how to do this watch this episode of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktCSk18cTss"">Good Eats</a>"" All of that said, I have never tried to let the ribs go 7 hours unattended, so I would try it when you have the time to hang around and monitor the internal temp, again <em>looking for 160°F internal temp</em> and that will give you a means to determine what is ""<em>done</em>"".</p>

This rice will be used as both a food-storage food source and as my everyday source of rice for cooking, so the storage solution should (hopefully) be resealable, rather than once-it's-open-it's-open. I eat rice maybe three times a month, so it isn't really ""everyday"" but it will be my go-to when I have it.</p>
","<p>If you are only using it three times a month then this 25lbs bag may last a very long time indeed.</p>

<p>The problem is that even white rice can eventually develop off flavors when exposed to light and air. Additionally- even if pests don't have access to the rice, it is not unlikely that the rice has some eggs on it that can hatch and spoil the whole bag.</p>

<p>The solutions to these problems all make it difficult to use the rice in the short term. For long-term food storage dry foods are typically sealed in either #10 cans or mylar bags. An oxygen absorbing packet is also included. This will prevent spoilage and pest growth. Mylar bags are less expensive and you can open one bag at a time for short term use.</p>

<p>Alternatively- if you can freeze the rice to ensure there are no pests then the rice can be stored, sealed, in a cool, dry place as others have described.</p>

","<p>You can refrigerate all kinds of yeast-bread dough. Right after kneading, before the dough has had a chance to rise, oil the dough lightly, cover with plastic wrap or use a ziplock, and place in the refrigerator. As the dough cools in the refrigerator the action of the yeast will slow down until the dough has reached refrigeration temperature. At that point the yeast is still working, but at a snail's pace. So, during the first few hours in the fridge it may require a punch down or two, as there may still be enough warmth in the dough for the yeast to show active signs of life. After the dough is completely cool, it may not need anything from you, but still check it at least every 12 hours or so - it may need another punch down. If at any point it grows to close to double it's original size, go ahead and punch it down. Most doughs will be fine if babysat like this for up to 3 or 4 days. When you're ready to bake, punch down the dough again (if necessary), shape, and allow to rise as if it had never taken its little nap in the refrigerator. Of course this rise is going to take longer than non-refrigerated dough as it reaches room temperature, but it should be ready to bake when it looks like a non-refrigerated dough of the same type would look when it's ready to bake.

","<p>It should be about 7 crackers per cup, maybe 8, depending how finely you crush them. One of the inner packages from your 14.4oz box should be plenty (there are probably three packages with 9 in each, or 4.8oz). If you need to go the other way, that's 1/7 to 1/8 cup per cracker, or more simply, 0.5oz or 15g per cracker.</p>

<p>I know this from making graham cracker crusts - and you can confirm it by looking at some recipes. You generally need 1.5 cups of crumbs for a pie crust, and it takes 10-12 crackers. I've seen recipes ranging from 9 to 12 crackers (and checked ten or so when writing this), but I don't think I've ever used fewer than 10. One cup is 2/3 of that, 7 or 8 crackers.

<p>For what it's worth, the Martha Stewart crust recipe says ""6 1/2 ounces graham crackers (12 crackers), finely ground (1 1/2 cups)"", and 2/3 of that is 4 1/3 oz, pretty close to 1/3 of your box, maybe a cracker short, so by weight this works out too.</p>

You can eat it raw. (In fact, I often do when I need a quick sandwich). It can be a bit tough to tear apart with your teeth, so pre-cut it. </p>

<p>The reason for this is that bacon is cured meat. There are two reasons not to eat raw meat: taste and food safety. Taste is individual, some people are OK with the taste and eat raw meat as long as they can find a source of meat fresh enough (think sashimi, carpaccio, steak tartare). Food safety is not a problem with bacon. The process of turning pork to bacon includes salt and smoke. Both of these kill bacteria, create an environment which is not hospitable to new colonization (dry, salty), and give the meat a new flavor which is better than the raw meat. </p>

<p>If you are now asking yourself why we are bothering with the fridge for bacon and other ex-""cellar foods"" at all, there is still a reason. First, most of us don't have a convenient cellar at 12° - 15°C, and not only is the bacon's life shortened if kept at usual kitchen temperatures, it also doesn't taste too good. It is just greasy. Second, you seldom get dry bacon at the supermarket; even if the curing process doesn't include brining, bacon is often aged much less than in old times, and then packed in vacuum, so it doesn't get really dry on the outside. So bacteria could very well start growing on it outside of the freezer. Inside the freezer, it keeps much longer than raw meat, and is certainly OK for consumption without frying. I guess that the popularity of fried bacon is mainly due to taste reasons. </p>

"Will spoiled food always make you sick?","142858","","<p>Kind of a strange question, but say something has spoiled, i.e. smells bad, tastes bad, etc.</p>

<p>Will it actually always make you sick? Like for instance spoiled dressing, let's say it tastes sour, smells nasty and you eat it, will it make you sick?</p>

<p>If so what actually makes you sick? The toxins/bacteria? or it just being unappetizing?</p>

<p>I ask because I tried a TINY bit of ranch and while it tasted mostly fine (it was a bit tangy) it smelled quite tangy but looked fine. I also saw <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2011/08/poison_party.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article about people eating bad food and not getting sick</a>.</p>
","<p>What most people don't get when it comes to food safety: Spoiled food has a <em>chance</em> of making you sick. </p>

<p>When food is visibly spoiled, it has large bacterial colonies growing in it. This means that it has been exposed to conditions which were promoting bacterial growth. Anything which was present on your food will have grown, unless outcompeted by something else. </p>

<p>The bacteria which make food gross are rarely the ones which make you sick. But if they had the chance to grow, the real pathogens had a chance to grow too. If they were present, then they grew, and you will consume them, together with whatever waste products their colony produced. </p>

<p>Assuming that there were infectious bacteria on your food, you will ingest them. From there on, it depends on a ton of factors whether you will get sick or not - the amount you ate, the acidity of your stomach contents, the state of your immune system. The last does not mean ""you'll only get sick if you're immunocompromised"" - it is like being around a person with the flu, even if your immune system is intact, you can still catch it. </p>

<p>There are pathogens which cannot infect you, but simply produce toxins. Botulinum is the poster child for these, but I think B. cereus also works through a toxin. In this case, eating the food poisons you. Depending on the type and amount of toxin ingested, as well as the current state of your body again (mostly liver function), the symptoms can run the entire spectrum from ""so weak you don't notice them"" to ""you die despite being correctly diagnosed and treated"". </p>

<p>Then there are a few more exotic possibilities, for example Hep C cannot cause liver cancer alone, but it does so (sometimes) in the presence of a type of toxin produced by moulds. But this is not actually considered foodborne illness any more, even though it's possible that eating mouldy food was the trigger. It falls outside of the scope of food safety, as the fault cannot be pinned on a specific dish you ate. Nevertheless, it's one more reason to not eat spoiled food. </p>

<p>There is also the possibility that your spoiled food has no pathogens at all, and the spoilage microbes outcompeted all the bad guys, and then of course nothing happens. </p>

<p>So, to sum it up: if you eat spoiled food, there are four possible outcomes: </p>

<ul>
<li>You get sick (right away or with an incubation period of 2-3 days) and notice it </li>
<li>You get sick (right away or with an incubation period of 2-3 days) but the symptoms are so weak you don't even notice it </li>
<li>You get a different health problem, soon after eating or even years later, without knowing that it was the spoiled food which caused it </li>
<li>Nothing happens. </li>
</ul>

<p>There is no way to predict which one will occur. Actually, these outcomes are possible with any food you eat, including safe food, but eating unsafe food increases the probability of the first outcomes a lot, and eating spoiled food increases it even more.  </p>

","<p>Even if you just pull them out for about 30 minutes once you get home that will be better than not letting sit out at all.

I myself don't typically pull meat out an hour before cooking it.</p>

<p>As long as they <strong>haven't</strong> previously been sitting out for an extended period of time, most likely you'll be ok for 1 1/2 hours since the steaks will be cold when set out.  Make sure that they remain tightly wrapped/covered to minimize exposure to air.</p>

"How would I susbtitute fresh spinach for frozen?","141557","","<p>I have many recipes that call for frozen spinach but only have fresh spinach on hand. </p>

<p>Suppose I have a recipe that calls for, say a 10 oz. package of frozen chopped spinach with the water squeezed out.  Short of blanching and freezing, how can I prepare the functional equivalent using fresh spinach?</p>

<p>I'd like to know the approximate equivalent weight of the fresh spinach, plus some procedure for removing the moisture such that I don't end up with a watery mess in the end product.</p>
","<p>Frozen spinach has been boiled/blanched. You can do this if you really want it to be as much like frozen spinach as possible, but really, you can just cook it with the water left on the leaves from washing - effectively a bit more like steaming. There's no need to freeze it. This will result in something with fresher flavor and a bit more substantial texture than frozen spinach (not as eager to disintegrate). And you don't have to worry about moisture much - a lot of the water will cook off - but you can certainly drain it additionally if it's too much for you.</p>

<p>If you really want it exactly like frozen spinach, you could boil it, and maybe even freeze it to help mess up the texture, but I'm guessing you'd prefer cooked fresh spinach anyway. In this case, you'd have to squeeze and drain it just like with frozen spinach to get the water out. (If it's unclear how to do this, see <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/6471/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-squeeze-water-out-of-cooked-spinach?rq=1"">What is the most efficient way to squeeze water out of cooked spinach?</a>.)</p>

This fits with my experience cooking down spinach. Most things you'll use it in are really forgiving, so probably best to err on the larger side with your bunch of spinach!</p>

"What meats can I serve medium rare and why?","138388","","<p>It is generally accepted that pork and chicken <strong>must</strong> be cooked completely (unless put through a strong curing process) while certain cuts of beef and lamb can be served on the rare side.  Why is this?</p>

<p>Are particular bacteria populations present in some animals but can't survive in others? What is the inherent differences between these animals that makes the difference when eating? How can I objectively decide if it is safe to eat something partially on the rare side that does not involve simply trusting the ""common knowledge"" of the more experienced.</p>

<p>(Don't get me wrong - I appreciate any and all advice that I get from anyone who is more experienced than I am in anything, but I'd like to know <em>how</em> they came to their conclusions).</p>
","<p>Beef (and Lamb): The surface of beef is often contaminated with pathogens such as e-coli. However, the meat is very dense and the bacteria cannot migrate from the surface into the flesh. Therefore, beef is safe to consume once the external temperature exceeds, 160 degrees F. The internal uncontaminated meat is safe to eat raw.</p>

<p>Pork: Like beef the surface of pork needs to be fully cooked.  Unlike beef, pigs harbor a parasitic roundworm called Trichinella spiralis. Infection with the worm is called trichinosis and can be fatal. This worm is killed when the flesh reaches 150 degrees F and is held there for several minutes. Therefore pork is safe to consume when cooked to medium. (Commercial pork in North America almost never has the roundworm present. Almost  every case (all?) of trichinosis in the last 15-20 years have come from undercooked wild boar or bear meat). Trichinella spiralis can also be killed by freezing (time and temperature dependent).</p>

<p>Chicken: Almost all chickens have Salmonella or Campylobacter present on the surface (at 
least). However, chickens have a less dense flesh than pigs, sheep or cows. Therefore, the bacteria can migrate deep into the flesh. Also, the processing of chickens is much more invasive than the previously mentioned animals which also means the interior meat can get contaminated. This means the meat must be cooked to well done throughout.</p>

<p>Duck: With duck it seems to come down to a matter of processing verses chicken. Also, they are raised in a much less confined manor, which helps prevent the spread of pathogens. There is still a chance of getting a salmonella infection from undercooked duck but cooking the breast well done basically ruins it, so people take the (small) risk.</p>

<p>Ground meat: Grinding meat, by its nature, implies the surface and the interior is mixed. Therefore, one must assume the meat is fully contaminated and must be entirely cooked to well done.</p>

I'd love to learn if there's a particular type of cheese that will work best, how to heat the cheese, and any other tips that you can provide.</p>
","<p>Normal cheese melts like that. It is made of proteins, fats, and water, and these separate when they are heated. </p>

<p>If you want to do it ""for real"", without processed cheese, you have to make a cheese fondue. It is traditionally made with Swiss cheese (I am fond of Appenzeller fondue), but you can use most types of semi-hard yellow cheese. It also contains some fluid, traditionaly white wine, and is emulsified with simple starch. It is preferable to have a special pan for this, as you can serve it heated. But if you make a big portion in a pan with a high thermal capacity, and make it immediately before serving, you can do without the special gear. </p>

"How can I tell if bell peppers have gone bad?","136542","","<p>I regularly buy bell peppers from a local supermarket, but unfortunately they don't always have the freshest vegetables. Sometimes I can tell that the peppers have gone bad when they have brown spots or even mold, but more than once now I have bought peppers that looked fine from the outside but when I opened them they had mold in them and smelled bad. On the other hand I also had peppers that were very wrinkly or had dark seeds, but other than that seemed fine.</p>

<p>So my question is: <strong>How do I know if a bell pepper has gone bad?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>What are indicators that a pepper has gone bad?</li>
<li>Are there indicators that I can see or feel from the outside?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Here are a few things to be wary of when buying peppers:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wrinkled skin -- it's a sign that they're drying out.  It should be firm and smooth.</li>
<li>Soft areas -- it's a sign that it's starting to rot in areas.  It should be firm all over.</li>
<li>Fuzz near the stem or blossom end -- you can't always see outward signs of the fuzzy mold, but if you do, it'll be right around where the stem attaches, or in the crevice on the other side.</li>
<li>Cracks -- it's a sign that someone's dropped it, and opens up the possibility of rotting faster</li>
<li>Spots -- besides the soft areas, you can get small dots in an area ... it's a sign of disease.  (I'm not sure which; I typically get this when growing my own, don't see it in the store).</li>
<li>Holes -- a sign that there's an insect that's eaten its way inside.  (again, I see this more on home grown ones)</li>
</ol>

<p>Things that aren't always a problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>Discoloration : if it's a green pepper, it might start turning red, yellow or orange.  Red peppers might have an area that looks black or brown.  So long as that area isn't soft, and the color changes look blended in (not where it's an obvious line between colors), it's fine.</li>
<li>Weight : you typically want heavier specimens, but some varieties are thinner skinned, and won't be as heavy.  If you find one that seems abnormally light, compare it to similar sized ones in the display.  If they're all the same, and don't have wrinkled skin, they're probably okay.</li>
<li>White lines : you typically see this more on hot peppers, but it can happen on bell peppers, too.  They'll be roughly parallel to each other, along the line from stem to blossom.  It's a sign that they got a sudden burst of water while growing, which caused the skin to crack (but then heal).</li>
<li>Folds : some varieties of peppers are more balloon-like, while others may have a few folds; so long as it's still smooth skin (not wrinkled), relatively heavy for its size, and you don't see fuzz in the folds, it's not an issue.</li>

<p>Used Canadian all-purpose flour with <a href=""http://www.essortment.com/all/howtomakebrea_rloi.htm"">this recipe</a>, unmodified; results were delicious.</p>
","<p>Bread is basically just flour, water, and yeast, so it's pretty hard to make it <em>inedible</em> unless you burn it to a crisp in the oven.</p>

<p>The difference between all-purpose flour and bread flour is gluten strength; if you substitute all-purpose flour then your bread won't rise as high or be as strong; this is a desirable quality in, say, cake, but not bread.</p>

<p>However, AP flour isn't <em>that</em> far off from bread flour in terms of gluten; while cake flour may be as low as 6% and bread flour can be as high as 14%, AP flour tends to weigh in at around 10% or more, which is why it's called ""all-purpose"".  As Michael says, yeast bread is actually not as sensitive to the exact quantities as (for example) most pastries, but it's still better to use a recipe that was actually built around AP flour instead of just trying to substitute it for bread flour.</p>

<p>If you are determined to make the substitution, then I would suggest you try to find some wheat gluten and add a small amount of that to the AP flour.  Mathematically, if you assume that you're lacking some 3% protein, then you'd want to add about 1 tbsp of gluten for every 2 cups of flour.  It's really not much, though, and if you don't have or can't find wheat gluten then your bread would probably survive anyway with AP flour, it just might be a little denser than you expect.</p>

<p>In any case, I always wondered which is the difference between Champagne and SPumante (apart the fact that they come from different countries).</p>

<p>Are they the same? 
Is one more precious than the other?
When do you use one or the other?</p>
","<p>Champagne is sparkling wine that is produced in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_%28wine_region%29"">Champagne region of France</a>. The grapes used in champagne are usually Pinot noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier. I think that there are a few sparkling wines that are grown outside of Champagne, France, that are allowed to be labeled as champagne but for a purist, they aren't actually champagne. The politics are complicated, and you can get an overview of the idea at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne"">champagne wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>Spumante, on the other hand, is a sparkling white wine from the Piedmont region of Italy. (It is also called asti or asti spumante.) It's made from the Moscato Bianco grape. More information can be found on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asti_wine"">spumante wikipedia page</a>. </p>

<p>I find spumante wines to be very sweet, whereas you can purchase champagnes that are brut (dry), demi-sec (half-dry) and doux (sweet). Most champagnes are pretty dry. Champagnes are also typically sold at a premium, whereas you can find bottles of spumante for about $5.</p>

<p>I think it's a matter of taste for when you want to drink champagne vs. spumante. If the cost is an issue, then champagne should be saved for special occasions. Spumante is good for a meal or occasion that calls for a sweeter sparkling wine. If I want a dry sparkling wine and don't want to shell out for champagne, there is always <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecco"">Prosecco</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cava_%28Spanish_wine%29"">Cava</a>, or other generic sparkling wines. </p>

"Is it normal to see flames inside my self-cleaning oven?","134085","","<p>I spilled some sauce, cheese, and pepperoni in the oven last night while trying to transfer some homemade pizza from the pizza peel onto the pizza stone, so I decided to clean it today.</p>

<p>I wiped the bottom and glass door, but the rest of the stuff was crusty and stuck to the bottom of the oven.  I started the cycle and went about my business.</p>

<p>About 15 minutes later I hear a loud POP and I run over to find little flames dancing at the bottom of the oven.  I freak out, turn off the self-cleaning feature, grab the fire extinguisher and try to open the door, which wouldn't open (which I later found out was a safety feature because the temperature inside was close to 900 degrees, whew!)</p>

<p>Anyway, now my kitchen and living room are filled with light smoke that I'm trying to ventilate, and I am terrified to run the self-clean again for fear of my house bursting into flames unless I watch it (which I don't particularly want to, since the smoke is nasty).</p>

<p>So, were these little dancing flames and the resulting smoke safe and normal in the operation of the self-clean cycle?  If not, what can I do before running the cycle again to minimize flames and smoke?</p>
","<p>Smoke is normal in an electric oven, but flames are definitely not.</p>

<p>In order to start a fire, you either need a spark, or you need to heat something beyond its <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoignition_temperature"">autoignition temperature</a> (AKA kindling point).  You might have had a short - or you might actually be using a gas oven with spark ignition - but I'm guessing your issue was the latter.</p>

<p>Cooking oil or grease being heated beyond its autoignition point is one of the most common causes of kitchen fires (grease fires).  Supposedly, <a href=""http://www.combat.com.sg/news/newsletter11a.html"">some oils have autoignition points as low as 550° F</a> (or 288° C), though I'm not sure which oils those are.  Olive oil would be my guess as the lowest, but pepperoni grease could very well have ignited at self-cleaning temperatures (which, as you noticed, go up to nearly 1000° F).</p>

<p>Fortunately for you, all modern ovens have a mechanical interlock which prevents them from being opened during a self-cleaning cycle.

"How long does grease take to go bad/rancid when sitting out?","133426","","<p>If I make a skillet full of bacon, how long can I leave the grease sitting out before it is unsafe/rancid?  Is the answer different for ground beef grease?</p>
","<p>Fat doesn't spoil like other foods. No bacteria can live in fat. Going rancid is a chemical reaction in which the fat molecules break down. So ""leaving out"" is not a problem. </p>

<p>The major factors in going rancid are light and air. The more light hits your fat, the sooner it goes rancid. Also, rancidity occurs when the fat is oxidized, meaning that if you prevent contact with air, your fat will last longer. </p>

<p>Both factors are minimized by transferring the fat to a tightly closed opaque container. With liquid oils, you use a dark colored bottle. As bottles are impractical for solid fat, just strain your grease into a jar, close it, and put it in a cupboard. The shelf life should be many months, probably more than a year. </p>

<p>Also, don't worry that you can get something nasty when the grease goes bad unnoticed. Rancid fat isn't a big safety risk, and ingesting it in small amounts is not problematic. If it stinks, throw it out. Before that, there is no problem eating it. </p>

<p>The above assumes pure, well-strained fat. Pieces of fried meat left over in the fat are a safety risk, even tiny ones. </p>

"How long does it take for unopened cheese to go bad?","132206","","<p>I bought one of those blocks of Dubliner cheese (at Costco, sealed relatively well in wax paper) and left it in my car all afternoon and overnight by mistake.</p>

<p>Given that it is unopened and the weather is relatively cool, what are the chances that it is still good? </p>
","<p>The term ""bad"", when applied to cheese, can actually refer to a <a href=""http://www.fantastic-flavour.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/cheddar_cheese.276140645.pdf"">great many defects</a> (p. 14), several of which are caused by improper or over-aging and only some of which are dangerous.  The issues that you most likely need to worry about are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Moisture loss</strong> applies primarily to soft cheese and is probably the first negative effect you'll see.  In a sealed package, it will ""sweat"" as Ivo points out, caused by water evaporating and then condensing again on the packaging, forming little droplets.  Unsealed, it will simply dry out and become hard.</p>

<p>This is <em>not</em> spoilage, and the cheese is still perfectly good to eat, it just might not have as pleasant a texture and might have a slightly flat flavour.  You can just cut off any hardened edges.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oxidation</strong> gives a slightly metallic taste but more importantly leads to rancidity - discoloration and a sour smell/taste.  This is caused by <em>light</em> and is why you should store cheese in a dark place.  If you left it in the car during the afternoon, it may have been exposed to a good deal of light.  However, <a href=""http://www.dairy-journal.org/index.php?option=com_article&amp;access=doi&amp;doi=10.1051/dst/2010019&amp;Itemid=129"">proper packaging greatly slows oxidation</a> and wax paper in particular is an oxidation inhibitor (that's why cheese is often wrapped in it!).  Light exposure also would have been minimal at night.  You're <em>probably</em> fine in this respect, but use your nose.  If it smells sour, don't eat it.</p>

<p>The chemical process itself results in peroxides and free radicals, which are obviously not good to eat, although there seems to be some debate about just how dangerous they are (some say it raises the risk of cancer, although I'm unable to find an authoritative source, and this might just be an urban myth).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mold</strong> is the most obvious form of spoilage and usually also the last.  Although most mold is technically aerobic, many strains are capable of growing with very <em>little</em> oxygen, and I personally have seen mold growing on an unopened package of cheddar that I'd forgotten about for several months.  I'm sure I don't need to tell you that mold isn't safe to eat; however, by the time there's enough mold to be dangerous, you'll be able to see it.</p>

<p>Contrary to what Ivo's post suggests, the mold you'll see growing on spoiled cheese is <em>not</em> the same as the mold that the cheese was made with - some cheeses, like parmesan, aren't made with any mold at all, although they can certainly grow mold later on.  The molds used in cheese-making are typically some variety of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillium"">penicillium</a>, which is safe to eat.  The mold that grows weeks later could be anything, and is <strong>not</strong> safe to eat.  Ivo is also partially correct in saying that the packaging does not prevent mold growth; however, it does slow it down by restricting the available oxygen.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>On the whole, I tend to agree with the other answers that your cheese will almost certainly still be good after only 1 day.  Keep in mind that cheese is thought to have been popularized as a <a href=""http://www.californiadairypressroom.com/Products/Cheese"">method for <em>preserving</em> milk</a> before refrigeration existed - the whole idea is that it lasts a long while, usually well over 24 hours before food safety becomes an issue.</p>

How much prime rib should I purchase to feed my guests?</p>
","<p>Prime rib is usually sold two ways, Bone-In or Bone-Out. For a Bone-In prime rib an 8 pound should serve you well, for a Bone-Out, Six will do nicely.

<p>[Edit]</p>

<p>Most restaurants that I have either had or seen Prime Rib served at will offer 10 oz or 12 oz serving size, with some variations in the overall 8-16 oz (225g - 450g) range. Appetites will vary from person to person, and you may wish to not serve the 'heals' as they will be more well done than the center, though some guests may prefer this..so, 'your-mileage-may-vary'. The very size of beef ribs makes <em>serving</em> them 'bone-in' impractical, as it results in a serving that is too thick for a single serving (though some restaurants do this for eye-appeal). For your home dinner party I would not recommend planning based on 'bone count'. Even if you buy and cook your roast ""bone-in"" your first cut after preparing and resting the meat should be to remove the bones from the roast. Since leftovers are goal you have set for this preparation you may wish to then slice the roast ""on the bias"" (about a 15°-20° angle from perpendicular to the bone section) as it will produce a larger footprint on the plate. The ends will provide you with good meat to include in a soup or slice up for sandwiches. </p>

"What's the difference between a cupcake and a muffin?","130311","","<p>I was debating with someone today whether what we were eating was a cupcake or a muffin, but realized we didn't really know the difference. So <strong>what's the difference between a cupcake and a muffin</strong> in American English?</p>

<hr>

<p>In case you're wondering, what we were eating had a sweet batter, but not overly; had blueberries in the batter; had no icing or frosting; was perhaps about three fluid ounces (1 dL) big; and had been baked with a paper wrapper.</p>
","<p>There is considerable overlap between cupcakes and muffins.</p>

<h3>Method</h3>

<p>From a technical point of view, muffins are made by the <em>muffin method</em>, making them small quickbreads.  In the muffin method, the wet ingredients are combined in one bowl; and the dry ingredients are combined in another bowl.  Then the two are quickly incorporated together with minimal mixing to avoid gluten development.  This gives muffins a somewhat coarse crumb.</p>

<p>Cupcakes are small cakes, and are made by one of the traditional cake methods such as the creaming method, the reverse creaming method, the genoise method, the chiffon method, and so on.  They tend to have a finer crumb than muffins.</p>

<h3>Contrast</h3>

<p>While no single criterion distinguishes a muffin from a cupcake if you do not adopt the technical definition above, the following trends exist:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cupcakes tend to be sweeter than muffins; there are savory muffins such as cornbread</li>
<li>Cupcakes are often iced or frosted, whereas muffins tend to have no topping, or a simple crumb topping</li>
<li>Cupcakes usually have a head or top no larger than the body of the cupcake; muffins are often encouraged to overflow their baking cup, so that their top is larger in diameter, giving them somewhat of a mushroom shape</li>
<li>Cupcakes are almost always, well, cupcake shaped; muffins can be made as just muffin tops</li>
<li>Cupcakes are almost never crispy or crunchy; muffins are often encouraged to brown and develop texture, especially on the tops</li>

","<p>Margarine has less fat than butter, but it doesn't give quite the same flavor as butter does. You also have to be careful what KIND of margarine you are using.

<p>Is it now safe to put that chicken in the oven to finish cooking it or am I risking major health issues?</p>
","<p><strong>Please don't bother.</strong></p>

<p>Meat spending any significant amount of time in the danger zone of 40 F - 140 F (4.4 C - 60 C) that has not been fully cooked should never be re-chilled to be served later. Given that <em>Salmonella</em> can be found throughout poultry, not just on the surface, and that it's <a href=""http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/food/food-safety/chicken-safety/chicken-safety-1-07/overview/0107_chick_ov.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">almost guaranteed</a> that your poultry had <em>some</em> level of a pathogen present, you shouldn't risk it.</p>

<p>Your not so thorough cooking, likely to an internal temperature of 120 F - 130 F, has basically heat-shocked the bacteria present imbuing them with a much higher than usual heat resistance. On top of that it likely took at least a few hours to get the meat back below 40 F (at which they can still grow, albeit slowly), so depending on the initial amount of infection and the time spent in the danger zone you likely have a bacteria population minimally in the hundreds of millions, possibly in the billions.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/4292/is-it-safe-to-eat-a-cooked-steak-that-briefly-touched-the-plate-that-was-holdin/4307#4307"">this answer</a> of mine I give a lot of detail regarding the relation between temperature and duration and it's effect on <em>Salmonella</em>. The important take-away is that with any reasonable temperature <em>death is not instant</em>, it's merely a percentage of the population that is killed at any given temperature and duration. As few as 100,000 <em>Salmonella</em> cells can get you sick, and it takes much fewer for <em>E. Coli</em>. So even if you're killing five-9's worth of bacteria, is it really worth it?</p>

<p>I'm all for eating rare meat (not poultry), but only if I'm confident in the quality and handling of said meat before it reaches my plate. Think of it this way, if the meat were exposed to these conditions before it reached your plate it would be considered gross negligence, and would likely result in a recall.</p>

<p>The guidelines that many agencies publish to safely cook meat all assume <em>typical</em> levels of contamination, given proper handling (though they do err greatly on the side of safety). They simply aren't accurate when you are starting with meat that has a population large enough to sicken or kill a small village.</p>

<p>I'm not even going to begin to address the toxic waste products produced by some pathogens, which are not destroyed by heat.</p>

<p>Throw it out and prevent this in the future by being sure to cook it all the way through. It sounds like you likely just grabbed the chicken out of the refrigerator and threw it directly on the heat, this can lead to the exterior cooking too quickly before the interior has time to cook. Get in the habit of setting your meats out for 30m to an hour so that it reaches room temperature throughout, <em>but cook it immediately, do not re-chill it.</em></p>

<p>I'll quote the <a href=""http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/ground_beef_and_food_safety/index.asp"">full-explanation from the USDA</a>, just for reference:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Why is pre-packaged ground beef red on the outside and sometimes dull, grayish-brown inside?</strong></p>
  
  <p>Oxygen from the air reacts with meat pigments to form a bright red color which is usually seen on the surface of meat purchased in the supermarket. The pigment responsible for the red color in meat is oxymyoglobin, a substance found in all warm-blooded animals. Fresh cut meat is purplish in color. The interior of the meat may be grayish brown due to lack of oxygen; however, if all the meat in the package has turned gray or brown, it may be beginning to spoil.</p>

I have tried to scrape it off with a razor (also to no avail, and this is why I know that it is flat to the surface of the stove).  Any ideas?</p>
","<p>First of all, razor on glass is a <em>bad</em> idea.  I hope I don't have to explain why.  Just think about what you're doing there.</p>

<p>You definitely did the right thing by buying the cooktop cleaner (I assume you used Cerama-Bryte or some similar product), but that's only half the equation; if you just use a cloth or paper towel with that, you won't get good results.  There's a product called a <a href=""http://www.vileda.ca/en/scourers/ceran/"">""Scrunge""</a> that's specifically designed for cleaning (scrubbing) glass cook tops.  Use that with the cleaning solution and it can clean almost anything off.</p>

<p>With a little bit of elbow grease (okay, a <em>lot</em> of elbow grease) I managed to clean off over a year of caked-on grease and charcoal around the burner rings that I was never able to get with the Cerama-Bryte alone.  I don't want this to sound like a product endorsement as there may be other, similar kinds of specialized ""sponges"" on the market, but this is the only one I know of that's safe to use on glass (i.e. won't scratch it like a scouring pad or those double-sided 3M sponges).</p>

<p>You can also try baking soda.  Make a concentrated paste (say 3 parts baking soda to 1 part water) and scrub it in as hard as you can.  This is often enough to clean by itself, but if that fails...</p>

<p>Finally, you can use the baking soda/vinegar track.  Use roughly equal parts of each but don't mix them in advance.  Instead, pour vinegar onto the stain and sprinkle on the baking soda afterward, or vice versa, and scrub right away while it's fizzing.  That will usually dissolve anything under it.</p>

<p>How can I tell if it's still ok to use?</p>
","<p>Buttermilk is already thoroughly packed with live bacteria. During its manufacture, that bacteria already consumed some portion of the available lactose and turned it into lactic acid.</p>

<p>Because of the lack of food, acidity, and the extreme competition it is pretty hard for buttermilk to go bad. The good bacteria will stay active and the buttermilk will get thicker and more sour until it runs out of lactose. In fact- when your buttermilk container has about 1/2 cup left you can make more just by refilling the container with milk and leaving it to ferment on the counter for a day. If you use it up more quickly than the bacteria eat the lactose then you can keep this up indefinitely.</p>

<p>Don't worry if it is thicker- if it still smells good then it probably is. As Noctrine said- mold around the lip is the worst risk. I am not a food chemist and despite my personal experience- if you ever suspect that food is bad just throw it out. $2 of buttermilk isn't worth an unpleasant afternoon.</p>

","<p>There are a variety of tips for quickly softening hardened brown sugar here: <a href=""http://tipnut.com/10-ways-to-soften-hard-brown-sugar/"">10 Ways to Soften Hard Brown Sugar</a>.</p>

<p>The one that worked best for me personally, when I had to do this in a hurry, was to chip off a large chunk of the hardened sugar, put it in a (microwave-safe) Ziploc bag with a damp paper towel, and microwave it for 5-10 seconds at a time until it was soft enough to use.  <em>Don't</em> pierce the bag; the whole point is to allow the steam to re-hydrate the sugar.  But obviously don't leave it in the microwave for too long either, otherwise the bag will either melt from the heat or explode from the steam.  You should also let it cool for a minute or two between zaps; the sugar will continue to absorb moisture as long as the steam can't escape.</p>

<p>I also use the paper towel trick if I need to re-hydrate the sugar the day before.  Place a piece of wax paper on top of the sugar, then a damp paper towel on top, and seal it.  It'll be good as new the next day.  Don't leave the paper towel in there for too long though, otherwise it'll grow mold (doesn't seem like it should, but I personally witnessed it happen).

<p><strong>Edited to clarify</strong>: I'm just asking a basic question, not for ingredients, per se. For example - Dish ""X"" is stir-fried vegetables (with or without meat) in sauce served with soft rice noodles. </p>

<p>I understand that much of the difference is in the type of noodles used and how they are prepared. However, I've always heard that much of the American-Chinese cuisine was loosely adapted and not really the same thing or possibly didn't originate in China. So, I'm just trying to find out what is authentic.</p>
","<p>The problem with your question is that you're kind of asking something akin to ""what is the universally accepted traditional preparation for Spaghetti"". While conventionally in much of the English speaking world, that refers to spaghetti and meat sauce. The word/dish itself refers to a specific style/type of noodle and could be topped with anything.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo_mein"">Lo Mein</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chow_mein"">Chow Mein</a> refer to the method of preparation and not the contents (""Stirred Noodle"" and ""Fried Noodle"" respectively). They are both often wheat based egg noodles. Lo Mein is typically cooked in a broth, whereas Chow mein, by definition will be cooked in oil. Sometimes it'll be cooked till crispy, sometimes not.</p>

<p>If you happen to be in some location that serves authentic Chinese food, you could order dozens of different preparations for each of the above; It could include various combinations of proteins, vegetables. There are also different types of specific noodles used (eg: the small flat ones usually called ""chow mein"" in north american restaurants, larger round noodles often referred to as Shanghai Style Chow Mein, etc...). If I walked into a chinese restaurant in Hong Kong and asked for ""Chow Mein"" in Chinese, I imagine the response would most likely be, ""what would you like on it?"" Generally speaking there would be some protein and one or more vegetables. This is highly dependent on what is available locally. This varies greatly in China. Hong Kong will have access to more ingredients having been an international westernized port for a long time. The rest of China is more subject to local farming/fishing. That said, Seafood is very common in Hong Kong Cuisine given that it's a port. My friend from the north grew up with a lot more pork. But now my answer is becoming less about the dishes themselves.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.chinesefood-eye.com/info_100696_what-is-mei-fun.aspx"">Mei Fun</a> means ""Rice Noodle"". Again, there is no accepted universal rule for what goes into it. My mom who comes from Hong Hong cooks those noodles half a dozen different ways depending on her mood.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chop_suey"">Chop Suey</a> like @Ching Chong said, just means ""miscellaneous leftovers"" or ""assorted pieces"". The origin is heavily debated and full of myth (see the wiki page). It is most commonly found these days from my understanding in Americanized Chinese restaurants in the US. I don't remember seeing it in Canada for example. Wherever it started, what makes it difficult to answer as it depends on what the cook wants to put in it. Anecdotally, I'm Canadian Chinese and have eaten at Chinese restaurants all over the world since I was born and have never actually ordered this dish, so take my answer for what it's worth. :-)</p>

<p>Always gently stir your pasta every minute or so while cooking to ensure it cooks evenly. Then near the end of the cooking time, bite into a piece of paste every 15 seconds or so to see if it has nearly cooked through. It should be firm to bite, and not soft all the way through. It should not resist biting though</p>

<p>With some pasta types like Penne etc. you can sometimes actually see the uncooked inner layer (a thin white line) if you carefully slice it in half which a knife, or just bite cleanly with your teeth</p>

<p>Since there may be more than one kind of pink salt, I'm talking specifically about ""Himalayan Pink Salt"".</p>
","<p>In my experience, the difference between various salts has little to do with flavor, once you've moved beyond iodized table salt and bulk kosher salt, and assuming we aren't talking about salts that are flavored by additions like herbs or smoke during processing. </p>

<p>So limiting the discussion to natural, high quality finishing salts, the differences are mainly texture and color. Some salts, like Maldon, are flaky, while others are large pyramids or cubes, and others tend to a small grain size and hold on to a bit of moisture. Each of these textures can bring something special to a finished dish. For example, flaky Maldon adds a delightful crunch, while another salt might adhere better to a French fry. </p>

<p>Color, like the pink salt you mention, is used pretty much for the visual interest. And there is nothing wrong with that. Simply save it for a dish where it will be noticeable. For example, those pink grains would look amazing on a chocolate truffle, or a savory meringue.</p>

<p>If anyone thinks they can actually <em>taste</em> the difference among unflavored finishing salts, I'd challenge them to do a triangle test with those salts dissolved in water (in equal amounts by weight) so that texture and color isn't confusing the issue.</p>

"What is the best way to reheat a sub-style sandwich?","121745","","<p>So you go to a deli, pizza place, or any number of places that will sell you a 12""+ hot sandwich (e.g. a philly cheeseteak).  You eat half and save the other half for another day.  When that other day comes, what's the best way to reheat it?</p>

<p>For many other foods, the most common ways are microwave, toaster oven, regular oven and skillet.  Unconventional ways I can think of would be steaming and sous vide (though the latter seems excessive for a sandwich).</p>

<p>The goal would be to get the sandwich hot enough to remelt any cheese, but to not render the bread too mushy or too crunchy (toast).</p>

<p>What method or combination of methods would you recommend to reheat a sandwich from the refrigerator?  Be sure to specify whether you'd use higher or lower temps or power.  If no one method would work well for all sandwiches, could you post guidelines?</p>
","<p>The truth is, there really is no good way to reheat such sandwiches.  The bread will have gotten soggy while the sandwich was in the refrigerator, and the densest part (which requires the most energy to get hot) is on the inside.</p>

<p>The option which is probably the least poor is to use the microwave, as more of the energy will be transmitted to the filling directly than with other heating methods.  This is still likely to leave the bread kind of mushy and rubbery.</p>

<p>Your best option is to only buy the size of sandwich you want to eat, or to split one with someone.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that you mentioned store bought subs.  If the sandwiches are homemade, there <em>is</em> a good answer:  <em>don't assemble them until you want to eat them</em>.</p>

<p>You can then toast the bread, and heat the filling separately, and then combine them, and thus have a very fine sandwich.</p>

"How to prevent ""sweating"" chocolate covered strawberries?","121355","","<p>Last year for Valentines day, I decided I was going to be romantic and make some chocolate covered strawberries for someone special. I melted and tempered some milk chocolate. Then dipped the washed and thoroughly dried strawberries into the chocolate and put them on a plate in the refrigerator to quickly ""set"" the chocolate.</p>

<p>Later that night as my special someone and I were eating the chocolate covered strawberries, we noticed that there was condensation both on the outside and in between the chocolate and strawberry. It was delicious nonetheless, but I was curious as to why it was ""sweating"" and if there is anything I can do to prevent this if I decide to ever be romantic again. </p>
","<p>Very simple: don't store your chocolate in the fridge. The ideal temperature for setting chocolate is 20°C. You can store it at less or more than that, but not too much. Setting in the fridge results in bad chocolate. Remember, when you work with chocolate, exact temperatures are extremely important. </p>

<p>Here a loose translation from a <a href=""http://www.bedello.ch/pralinengrundlagen/couverture/couverture.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">good article</a> on chocolate/couverture coating: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CEjSc.gif"" alt=""good"">
This is the usual case. You only want a temperature difference of 12° to 13° between the chocolate and its environment as well as between the chocolate and the confect interior. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rqeCX.gif"" alt=""interior too cold"">
If the interior is colder than the room, the setting will happen ""inside out"". The cocoa butter film which gives a confect its shine will build on the inside, leaving the outside looking dull. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yQBeP.gif"" alt=""interior warmer""> 
This is a really good case for some types of confect, but you can't do it with most types of filling (definitely not with strawberries). Cooling from the outside gives you a beautiful shine. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3eNfw.gif"" alt=""later cooling""> 
If you want to achieve a good shine, it is possible to put the confects in the fridge for a short time, but <em>only after they have cooled to 20°C</em> at room temperature. Don't let them fall to fridge temperature, take them out at 15°C. The continued cooling from the outside is beneficial. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/047wn.gif"" alt=""not enough temperature difference"">
This shouldn't happen. The temperature difference is too small, and the confect doesn't set quick enough. In this case, cocoa butter pools on the surface and creates a yellowish layer after it hardens. </p>

<p>When you make your confect, you should time the first piece. The setting should need 10 minutes. If it is less, you don't get all the possible shine. If it needs more, it will get grey or whitish yellow. </p>

"Why is expired frozen chicken safe to eat?","120195","","<p>It seems to be a widely held belief that that freezing chicken, and then defrosting, cooking, and eating it much later (well past the expiration date) is a perfectly fine thing to do.</p>

<p>What makes it safe? And are there any food safety hazards to watch out for when doing this?</p>
","<p>It's safe because freezing greatly slows (if not completely arrests) the growth of the bacteria that would otherwise make the meat spoil. It doesn't kill them, it just puts them in 'stasis'. The expiration date is given based on the meat only being refrigerated. If you intend to store the meat past its expiration date, best practice is to freeze the meat ASAP, and to use it within 24 hours of defrosting.</p>

<p>The main hazard is in that defrosting. At no point should the chicken (any part thereof) be at room temperature for more than 2 hours. The safest method is to defrost the meat slowly in the fridge. You can also defrost it under cold running water, providing you keep it under the 2 hour mark.</p>

<p>Of course, you <em>can</em> also cook the meat straight from frozen. There is absolutely nothing wrong with doing this for small cuts like chicken breasts. Slicing and cooking a partially defrosted chicken breast is perfectly safe, especially as it often easier to make really thin strips with semi-solid meat. You just have to be extra careful that the meat is at a safe temperature (170°F/75°C).</p>

"How to adapt brownie recipe to cook well in a mini-muffin tin?","117159","","<p>I've got a great brownie recipe that works awesome in a 9x11 pan.  The top comes out crunchy, the bottom cake like and the middle nice and fudgy.  I figured I would try to make them in a mini-muffin tin, thinking it would be easier for the kids to eat.  Ended up with a mini disaster.</p>

<p>Things I had not counted on:  they rose seemingly more than in the 9x11 pan.  Too much cake like vs not enough fudge center.</p>

<p>Should there be things I need to be aware of?  I cut a good 7 or 8 minutes off my cooking time of 25 minutes int eh 9x11 pan, and even still, they were over cooked.  But more importantly, I realized that with all edges being cooked (as opposed to square in the 9x11), there is a lot of ""cake surface"" vs soft and fudgy centre.</p>

<p>Is there something i should consider doing specifically to the recipe?  Is there a way to make good fudgy brownies in a mini-muffin tin, or am I just looking for trouble?</p>

<p>Recipe is butter-free (just uses vegetable oil) and only 1 tsp of baking soda as a leavening agent.</p>
","<p>Brownies are bar cookies.  Note that the brownies are at the edge of the pan are more cooked, and raised higher:  they set before they settle back down.</p>

<p>Baking the brownies in a mini-muffin tin will essentially make each mini-brownie <em>all</em> edge.  They will rise and set very rapidly, and then easily over bake.</p>

<p>I would suggest that brownies are not ideal in a mini-muffin tin.  Instead, cutting them smaller would be a better solution.</p>

<p>If you do want to try it again, I would suggest:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don't overfill the tins.  You don't want the batter more than about 1/2 inch deep; you want about the same depth it would be in the pan for which they are designed.</p></li>
<li><p>Let the batter sit for about 5-10 minutes after portioning into the muffin tins.  This will give some additional time for the sugars to dissolve, and the flour to hydrate since they won't have as much time in the oven.  This should help texture and crust development (the shiny crackly top).</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce or eliminate the chemical leavening.  I would experiment with cutting the baking powder by 50% to start.</p>

<p>There are ways to incorporate air into brownie batter mechanically, by (for example) beating air into the egg-butter-chocolate mixture, but the exact way to approach it would depend on your particular brownie recipe.  If you go that route, you can probably completely eliminate the baking powder.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce the oven temperature by about 25 F (maybe even 50 F in a second trial, if they still over bake and are too crusty too rapidly) or so, to allow the baking process to slow, and give more time for the mini-brownies to rise and settle.</p></li>
<li><p>Check them much sooner.  Mini-brownies are going to go from not-done to overdone very, very quickly.  I would start checking as early as 15 minutes, until you have an expectation.  When you can smell the chocolaty aroma is a good time to start checking.</p></li>
<li><p>Bake only one mini-muffin tray at a time, so that they are even.  You don't want shadow effects and changes in oven convection to throw off the baking by having more than one tray in the oven at the same time, although that is more an issue of consistency than it is of the complete character of the outcome.</p></li>

"Can dry ice in a liquid poison you?","117047","","<p>I remember hearing a long time ago that putting dry ice into a liquid that is then consumed by people could potentially poison them.  I was just looking at halloween drink recipes and a few of them used dry ice in the liquids that people were drinking.</p>

<p>So, can putting dry ice in a liquid (say, punch) and then drinking that liquid poison you?  Or ws this information wrong?</p>

<p>Please note, I do not mean that the carbon dioxide that's released into the atmosphere can poison you, I mean the physical consumption of the liquid that the dry ice was put in.</p>
","<p>No it will not poison you to drink a liquid that is directly cooled by dry ice.  At normal pressures there may be some gaseous CO2 dissolved in the liquid giving it a mild carbonation.  However, dry ice can be dangerous to bare skin, mouth, or GI tissue if someone swallows a medium to large pieces of dry ice.  Small pieces are not poisonous, but can produce an unpleasant popping or tingling sensation in the mouth (like extra tingly PopRocks).  In a process similar to making <a href=""http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/001366.html"">liquid nitrogen ice cream</a>, dry ice can even be used to make ice cream if it is crushed very finely.</p>

<p>Dry ice will sink to the bottom of a drink ""cauldron"".  If more cooling is needed, do not add regular ice to the cauldron, instead add it to individual drink glasses.</p>

<p>Some simple rules to remember when working with dry ice:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do not allow dry ice to come in contact with bare skin or other bodily tissue. Keep the dry ice in its packaging at all times. Dry ice has a temperature of -79°C and direct contact can cause freeze burns. If you must handle dry ice, use gloves or newspaper. </p></li>
<li><p>Always handle and store dry ice in well ventilated areas. Carbon dioxide gas is heavier than air. If it is allowed to accumulate in poorly ventilated areas such as boat holds, cellars, cars and vans, it can become a safety hazard, as it will displace oxygen and could lead to asphyxiation. Do not leave coolers in closed vehicles for extended periods and always make sure a window is open. Adequately ventilate areas before entering. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not place dry ice in airtight containers such as stoppered glass jars, bottles or other sealed containers as they could explode. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not store dry ice in refrigerators or freezers. Store in the best insulated cooler possible. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not pack dry ice in direct contact with glass bottles, jars, etc. as the glass could crack and shatter; use non-glass containers. </p></li>
<li><p>If the block is to be reduced in size by breaking or cutting, leave it in the packaging provided to avoid contact with skin and eyes. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not use dry ice in individual drinks. Use only in large punch bowls for effect. Under no circumstances should dry ice be placed in the mouth.</p></li>

","<p>Where do you live? European Pyrex is made from borosilicate glass, the same as in laboratory's equipment; American Pyrex is made from common soda-lime glass. </p>

<p>If you are in America, don't bother trying it at all; soda-lime glass is sensitive to thermal shock. Even though it's tempered for kitchenware, it is nowhere near good enough for the burner.<br>

"Calories in toast vs bread","116029","","<p>Does toasting bread change the amount of calories in the bread?
i.e Does a slice of toast have more/less calories that a slice of bread?</p>

<p>I know that some moisture is lost in the toasting process but does the browning of the bread change its characteristics in such a way that it changes the calories?  </p>
","<p>If you are interested in the theory, the answer is yes, there is a change. If you are interested in dieting, the answer is still yes, but it is quite irrelevant to you. </p>

<p>There are two types of browning reactions, Maillard and caramelization. Both start with highly complicated molecules and end with different kinds of highly complicated molecules. For a very precise answer to your question, one would have to know every possible chemical reaction occuring there, the energy trapped in the precursors and in the resulting molecules, and whether this energy is accessible for the human body (e.g. there is quite a lot of energy in raw petrol, but your body can't extract it if you happen to eat it). As these reactions haven't been studied in this level of detail, it isn't possible to give you a really precise answer. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the tendency would be for the calories (at least the digestible ones) to fall somewhat. First, the calories from amino acids and carbohydrates (which are the inputs for browning) are digestible; some of the reaction products can be digestible, but not all will be. Second, some of the calories will literally disappear in thin air - because some of the products of these reactions are volatile. </p>

<p>But if you are expecting to reduce your dietary calorie intake by eating toasted bread, it will probably make no difference at all. First, the calorie-reducing effects will only occur for a small part of the molecules involved. Second, and more important: even if it did occur for all molecules involved, browning only happens on the surface (theoretically, it could happen on the inside too, if you heated it in the 154°C - 190°C range. Practically, if you are doing that, nobody will want to eat that food). The surface is quite small as opposed to the rest - let's assume a slice with 1 cm thickness and a generous browning of 0.5 milimeter depth. (I know that the part which gets hard is thicker, but it doesn't really get browner). I'll disregard the surface enlargment caused by leavened-bubbles in the crumb (because I'm afraid I might end up with an infinite fractal surface :) ) and then we have ~10% of the slice browned. As I said, there is no chance that all the calories in this part disappear completely, and I doubt that the reduction will be really significant. But even if it was at really high 50%, you only get 5% reduction in total, or 10 calories per slice of white bread, less for diet-friendly breads (and this number is just an inflated best-case guess). </p>

<p>My family and I love this dish, but I would really like to perfect its preparation. What steps can I take to prevent the coconut milk from separating from the curry?</p>
","<p>Even though it isn't really milk (in the dairy sense), coconut milk still naturally separates into a thick cream and thinner liquid like regular milk. As such, when working with coconut milk you should still follow the same procedures you would to make a milk-based cream sauce.</p>

<p>The number one rule when making any creamy sauce is: <strong>DON'T LET IT BOIL!</strong> Boiling will guarantee that your creamy sauce (including sauces made with coconut milk) will break in some form or fashion. At most, you should cook these at a bare simmer.</p>

<p>Other than that, there are some techniques you can use to keep your curry smooth.</p>

<p>You could use an emulsifier like honey (common in vinaigrettes, where it is used to make sure the oil and vinegar don't separate), added toward the end of cooking.</p>

<p>You could also use a thickening agent, like a cornstarch slurry or a quick roux. Curry paste is also a thickening agent. As a general rule of thumb, when making Thai-style curry I usually cook my vegetables in a little more oil than I think they need, then add the curry paste and sauté that until it has absorbed the oil (along with any dry spices). It will act as a roux for the coconut milk and make sure there are no lumps in the final curry.</p>

The problem is that the cake is shaped liked a cartoon character, and I want to colour parts of it appropriately. My question is what is my best approach to colouring this icing? Is it possible for me to knead food colouring into the icing, or should I try something else? </p>

<p>I've did previously try to shop-bought royal icing that I could microwave to a paste then colour, but the overall effect wasn't great (mainly due to my spreading technique!).</p>
","<p>Although Aaronut is entirely right in stating that you would be better off using alternate colourings that do not damage the texture of your icing, you can use normal food colourings, I do quite often.</p>

<p>When I use them on fondant or marzipan, the main issue is the capacity of the icing to absorb the colouring.  They have limited ability to tolerate the liquid, so if you need a deep colour, expect a bit of a fight.</p>

<p>The best method I have come up with, is to treat it like pulling candy.  Put the required amount of icing in a bowl and make a well and enough material to fold over that well.  Put in a small amount of colouring and fold over.  I tend to start off by squidging it about in folding motions to get the liquid in to the material, it'll be quite tacky at first.  Then I roll it between my hands in to a sausage, fold in half lengthways, roll, fold, roll, fold...</p>

<p>It'll marble up to start with, given the folds, but eventually become one solid colour and will become less tacky with each fold, in a similar way that kneading bread makes it progressively more coherent.</p>

<p>Once settled, roll towards a ball/block rather than a sausage, then you can roll it out ready for use.  If you are a very minute amount over the moisture level that you can roll it, try to incorporate a small amount of icing sugar (confectioner's) whilst folding to dry it out, like adding flour to bread.</p>

<p>It works, but is messy, take all rings off and expect to need to wash your hands a lot.</p>

<p>Found a video that roughly shows how I would do it, except the demonstrator has a different way of applying the colouring to the fondant initially and is using a much larger quantity than I tend to, so does not hand roll in the air as much as I would or as fast.</p>

"Why won't my beans soften?","115406","","<p>I have an old jar of 9 bean soup mix which is basically dried beans. In order to cook them, they must first be softened and according to some prior research a few methods exist, though the most common method is to soak the beans over night. I have done just that. They have been soaking for more than 12 hours now and they are still quite hard. When I began soaking them I used boiled water from the kettle so that the process might be sped up. </p>

<p>Is there a better way to go about this?</p>

<p>Would adding an acid help to soften the beans?</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong?</p>
","<p>Soaking beans will not soften them.  If done for a very long time (i.e., days), some beans will eventually begin to sprout or ferment, at which point they will become softer.  But that is generally not desirable for basic cooking.</p>

<p>Instead, you'll need to cook the beans to get them to soften.  Bring to a slow boil and then simmer until the interior is the desired texture.  (A common test is to take a few beans out on a spoon and blow on them; if the outside of the bean breaks open a bit when you blow, they are likely soft and cooked through.)</p>

<p>By the way, the main purpose of soaking is to hydrate the seed coat (the outer covering of the beans).  Once that happens, the moisture can more easily penetrate the interior when cooked, allowing the beans to soften.  If you don't soak, you'll simply waste the first part of your cooking hydrating the seed coat.  Depending on the type of beans, their age, and other factors, that could increase your cooking time by anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour or so.  (For more details, see my previous answer to another question <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/30246/15018"">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Also, do NOT try using an acid.  Acids can actually toughen the seed coat, making the beans take longer to cook and soften.  This is one of the reasons chili recipes (for example) often recommend cooking the beans first, before adding to acidic ingredients like tomatoes.</p>

<p>(Note that cooking times for beans and lentils can vary significantly, depending on type of bean and age.  For a mixed bean soup, I'd expect about 1-2 hours of simmering for pre-soaked beans, and perhaps as many as 3 hours.  Older beans can take longer, and I've occasionally had old batches of dried beans which never quite softened to a consistent texture.)</p>

<p>EDIT: Just to add onto Joe's great advice from the Dry Bean Council, Harold McGee has this to say about beans which never soften (from <em>On Food and Cooking</em>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Hard-to-cook"" beans... are normal when harvested, but become resistant
  to softening when they're stored for a long time -- months -- at warm
  temperatures and high humidities.  This resistance results from a
  number of changes in bean cell walls and interiors, including the
  formation of woody lignin, the conversion of phenolic compounds into
  tannins that cross-link proteins to form a water-resistant coating
  around the starch granules.  <strong>There's no way to reverse these changes
  and make hard-to-cook beans as soft as regular beans.</strong>  And there's no
  way to spot them before cooking.  Once cooked, they're likely to be
  smaller than normal and so may be picked out before serving.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>McGee also mentions that occasionally you may encounter batches of ""hard-seed"" beans, which hardened during particularly hot and humid growing conditions.  In such cases, the beans will be tough no matter how early they are used; they may take much longer to cook than usual (and sometimes may never soften).</p>

"What should be the material of the vessels to be used in an electric oven?","115258","","<p>Could you please provide a general guide figure out if a piece of cookware can be used in the oven, based on what material it is made of?</p>
","<p>The usual materials used in an oven (no matter if electric or gas) are almost all food-safe non-melting materials used for cooking vessels. If you can use it on a stove top, it should be OK for the oven too (unless it has a handle from a different material). </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Metal. Oven pans are made from non-reactive metals (like stainless steel) or reactive metals with a protective layer (e.g. seasoned cast iron). Don't use metal vessels which have non-metal parts, like wooden or plastic handles (except for oven-rated handles, like the phenolic handles on Le Creuset enameled cast iron, which are rated for up to 200°C). Else, all metallic pans and pots meant for stove top are good for the oven. Also, pay attention to temperature: PTFE (non-stick) coated vessels shouldn't be heated above 250°C. </p></li>
<li><p>Ceramics. If glazed, you should make sure that the glaze does not suffer under high temperature or does not leach dangerous chemicals into the food under high temperatures. There are many glazed ceramic pans meant for the oven, such as lasagna pans, quiche pans, tagines, gyveches, etc, and you can be sure that these are oven-safe. You can also use table porcelain for some limited scenarios, e.g. poaching an egg in an individual serving of soup, but don't risk your finest porcelain, and don't do it if the plates are decorated with adhesive designs. If unglazed, you should make sure it is intended for the oven, some types of earthenware may be damaged by the heat. The ones meant for the oven (like römertopf) should be fine. </p></li>
<li><p>Glass. If it is borosilicate glass (sometimes called Jena glass), you can use it in the oven. Don't subject it to temperature shocks, use room-temperature glass pans (don't layer a lasagna the day before in a glass vessel and then bake it straight from the fridge), and don't put them in too hot an oven (up to 200°C should be OK). You can't determine if it is borosilicate glass or soda lime glass from its looks, so here you have to be sure that the manufacturer markets the vessel as oven safe. </p></li>
<li><p>Silicone. Food-grade silicone is great for baking and practically indestructible (unless you cut it). If the manufacturer gave a temperature range, go by it, I'm not sure it will hold up at above 250°C, but it is no problem in the normal cake and pastry baking range. </p></li>
<li><p>Plastics. Some plastics may be able to withstand heat, but you can't usually recognize that from their looks, and you don't know if there may be other problems (such as melamine, which releases toxic chemicals when heated). In theory, I would trust a big manufacturer who markets a plastic pan explicitly as oven-safe, but in practice, I haven't seen such pans. So don't use plastic vessels in an oven. </p></li>
<li><p>Wood. Don't use wood in an oven. It shouldn't be able to catch fire at normal oven temperatures, so it is not a hazard, but the heat will damage your vessel. While it will still be usable (especially if you take care to wet it beforehand), it will lose its smooth surface, and it will probably warp. Glued wood can also split along the glue lines. If you have a cheap bowl you don't mind damaging, you can use it in the oven, but I don't see why, when other materials are much better suited. </p></li>

"Frying Oil Reuse","115195","","<p>What are some guidelines or rules with regard to filtering and reusing (vegetable/canola/sunflower) oil that has been used for deep frying?</p>

<p>Is it safe and acceptable under some circumstances to filter and keep oil? If so, does it depend on which foods were fried? How long can the filtered oil for be kept for?</p>

<p>Or, is it never appropriate? If not, are the reasons health or flavour related? or both?</p>
","<p>It is absolutely OK to filter and reuse deep-fry oil.</p>

<p>It's not uncommon at some short-order restaurants for them to filter the oil daily and only change it once a week.  Of course, it does start to taste a little ""off"" when you reuse it that many times.</p>

<p>There's also the matter of impurities lowering the smoke point; even when you filter, the result is obviously not ""pure"" oil; the more you reuse it, the lower the smoke point gets, and eventually it will actually start to smoke at deep-fry temperatures (i.e. become unusable).</p>

<p>For home use, I'd recommend no more than 3 or 4 reuses.  Check the oil to see if it needs to be changed sooner than that - if the colour or smell is off, don't use it again.  Best to compare it against a sample of the same ""fresh"" oil; sometimes it's hard to just eyeball it without a frame of reference.  If it looks totally clear and smells fresh, you could probably go up to 5 or 6 reuses - but definitely not more than that.</p>

<p><sub>P.S. There will be some people who tell you that you should never reuse oil for general health (not safety) reasons.  My response to that tends to be that if you're eating <em>deep-fried food</em>, you're probably not all that concerned about long-term health risks.  Rest assured that if you do a lot of eating out, you've eaten plenty of food fried in ""leftover"" oil.</sub></p>

"How do you cook calamari / squid and avoid making it tough?","113179","","<p>I am having a hard time with this seemly simple 'snack'.  </p>

<p>The calamari and squid is usually given to me by my neighbor who is a seafood monger.  It's frozen and a mix of baby octopus and squid rings, no label.</p>

<p>I've tried both boiling and frying them. I've also tried boiling followed by frying. The taste is always good, but the texture is not tender and kind of gummy. </p>

<p>It is possible that this type of squid is tougher (e.g. Moroccan octopus is more tender than Thai), and a reason why neighbor says: ""arr, I can't cook these right... here... you try"".</p>

<p>Is there a trick to getting them spot on?  </p>
","<p>Calamari or squid is of course famous for being difficult to cook, because it gets tough or rubbery.</p>

<p>As Harold McGee explains in <em>On Food and Cooking</em>, octopus and squid meat are very rich in collagen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They are chewy when lightly cooked, tough when cooked to the
  denaturing temperatures of their collagen, around 120 - 130 F / 50 -
  55 C, and become tender with long, slow cooking.</p>

<p>My own interpretation of this is that it will keep the temperature of the squid below the 120 F threshold, at the risk of being below the pathogen kill point, so it should be done only with squid from a trustworthy purveyor.</p></li>
<li><p>Cook them for a long time, slowly, as in a braise, so they move through the tough phase to tender again.  This <a href=""http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/anne-burrell/braised-calamari-stuffed-with-shrimp-spinach-and-herbs-recipe/index.html"">Food Network</a> recipe  for stuffed squid by Ann Burrell is an example.

I tried my cookie recipe with convection plus fan option, my bake turn out over cooked on the outside and undercooked on the inside. What is the difference between convention oven with fan assisted and convection with fan assisted?</p>

<p>After googling for the difference, I am really confused whether convention oven can have fan? But I am sure the SMEG model I used before says ""Conventional cooking with fan assisted"".</p>
","<p>They're the same thing - convection ovens are also known as fan-assist ovens (see for example <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_oven"">wikipedia</a>), since they're basically an oven with a fan. Maybe what you had previously was marketed as a fan-assisted oven, and threw out the phrase ""conventional cooking"" to emphasize that you can still do everything you conventionally could. But it sounds like you're just talking about two different convection ovens here.</p>

<p>More likely, the problems you're having are to do with either the convection being more efficient in your new oven, or the temperature control being off on one of the two. Ovens aren't always perfect, so likely your new oven is hotter when you set it to a given temperature than the old one. It might also have a more efficient fan. You can probably learn to adjust by trial and error - reduce temperatures, and check things frequently until you figure out you've gotten it right. It might also be helpful to grab a thermometer and see if your new oven is lying to you about the temperature.</p>

<p>(If you were previously using non-convection recipes in a convection oven, without adjustment, then your old oven was probably either too cool or its fan wasn't doing much. If you were adjusting recipes for convection previously, then maybe your new oven is hotter than it should be.)</p>

"How long will homemade salad dressing stay good in the fridge?","112777","","<p>How long can I keep salad dressings that I made?</p>

<p>Since this is probably affected by what it's made up of, let's say we're talking about different salad dressings made from a combination of the following ingredients: mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, vinegar, sugar, garlic, oil, salt, pepper, lemon juice...</p>

<p>And are there any other ingredients that I should watch out for that could affect salad dressing shelf life? Any rules of thumb regarding storing salad dressings...?</p>
","<p>There is no rule of thumb encompassing all salad dressings. </p>

<p>One ""rule of thumb"" which sometimes gets used is to look at the shelf life of the most perishable component. Frequently it works; sometimes, it is dangerously misleading. <strong>A mixture of the things you listed can have a longer or shorter shelf life of that of the most perishable component.</strong> An example of lengthened shelf life is mayo; it stays good for longer time than a cracked fresh egg, because the yolk gets pasteurized and the pH is lower. But there can be examples of the other thing happening. The classic is the homemade garlic oil: you can keep pure garlic and pure oil for months in the pantry, but once you combine them, you get a botulism risk. </p>

<p>I don't usually keep salad dressings in the fridge, but if I did, I would look at why the most problematic component has the shelf life it has, and decide whether mixing it will change the condition. For example, if I had a mixture of oil, vinegar and pure emulsifier: Oil keeps for months because it has no carbs, so nothing for bacteria to eat. Vinegar can have a few carbs, but not a lot, and it also has a very low pH, so bacteria die in it. The combination still won't have enough carbs for bacteria, and will still have a low pH. So the mixture will keep for very long time, just like pure vinegar or oil. </p>

<p>On the other hand, imagine mixing vinegar with honey and water. Honey doesn't go bad by itself, because the carbs are too concentrated for bacteria. The vinegar and water will dilute them, so this mechanism of bacteria prevention vanishes. The pH of the mixture will probably rise a lot too, because the vinegar gets diluted, so no protection on that front either. Thus, this mixture is apt to go bad much earlier than pure vinegar or pure honey. </p>

<p>This method requires that you make a new decision for each new dressing you make, and that you acquire enough knowledge to be able to make such decisions. If you feel this is too much effort or too risky, you can either start adding conservants to your homemade dressings, or just start preparing a fresh dressing for each batch of salad. </p>

Our model automatically decreases the temperature, so if you set it for 300, then it will heat to 275.  Not sure if that is a magic 25 degree number, but it seems to work.  Almost all recipes cook time wise as they would with a non-convection oven.  Our also has a single and multi-rack mode, and it circulates the air differently in that case.  We have NEVER had any problems with the food drying out more with the air circulation as they say that is a common negative.</p>

<p>I am sure the effectiveness varies oven to oven, but in our case, we always use it (except for broiling of course). </p>

"Why add salt to the water when cooking pasta?","107559","","<p>What is the effect of adding salt to the water when cooking pasta?</p>
","<p>The salt adds flavor, but it also helps reduce the gelation of the starch in the pasta.  The starch in food is the form of microscopic grains.  When these grains come into contact with water, they will trap some of it (think cornstarch in cold water), but when the water is hot they swell up like balloons and merge with each other, and you have starch gelation.</p>

<p>Another thing you may want to add to the pasta water is some acid (lemon or cream of tartar).  Tap water in most cities is made alkaline, which increases the starch loss from the pasta to the water, making the pasta stickier.</p>

My family and I often must wait for our mangoes in the fridge for more than 5 days just to make sure that they're ready to serve.</p>

<p>Advice? Help? Thanks!</p>
","<p>I look for a few things...</p>

<ol>
<li>Colour: There are many different varieties of mangos. Some go from green to red, some end up Orange, some start off yellow and end up orange. So once you're familiar with the type of mango you're buying, you can get an idea of what a ripe one looks like.</li>
<li>Smell: A ripe mango will smell sweet. Check near the stem end, the smell should be stronger there. You should smell it and think ""mango"". Smell is a large part of your taste, so it should be very familiar.</li>
<li>Firmness: Mangos, like peaches will soften as they ripen. Just as it starts to go from firm to soft, it is just about ripe.</li>
<li>Weight: With most fruit you can tell their ripeness by their weight. A riper fruit will be slightly heavier than an unripe one.</li>
</ol>

<p>As an aside, if you're at a grocery store, and you see a few different types of mangos, look for these Ataulfo mangos: <a href=""http://goo.gl/IeEZ4"">http://goo.gl/IeEZ4</a>. They're my personal favourite. The flavour is richer, and they are a lot less stringy.</p>

"How long will a whole turkey keep in a refrigerator?","107266","","<p>My daughter bought a fresh, organic, kosher turkey from Trader Joe's last night (her first turkey!), 8 days before she will start cooking it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The company customer service representative as well as the store manager all reassure us that their turkeys are fine to refrigerate in the coldest part of the refrigerator for as long as 10 days.</p></li>
<li><p>The turkey's sell-by date is Nov. 28 - two days after Thanksgiving.  The information on their own food storage guide as well as some other info I have read say that 1 - 2 days is the proper amount of time to store a fresh turkey.</p></li>
<li><p>TJ's says that the manner in which they transport their turkeys - at a nearly, but not quite frozen, state extends that time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As long as she stores it unopened in the coldest, bottom part of her fridge (and turns the temperature down as well), will the turkey survive until Thanksgiving? She plans to brine the turkey a day or two ahead of cooking it also. </p>
","<p>Not all turkeys are the same, and personally, I would not risk letting an entire turkey go rancid in the refrigerator.  There is <em>so</em> much you don't know about this turkey:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How was it butchered?  In particular, how long was it sitting on the block and was it packed immediately afterward or left sitting out for a long time?</p></li>
<li><p>How quickly was it cooled down to ""transporting"" temperature after butchering?</p></li>
<li><p>Was it transported immediately, or was it stored for a while before transport, and if so, what were <em>those</em> storage conditions?</p></li>
<li><p>How <em>specifically</em> was it transported?  What were the environmental conditions, aside from temperature?  Was it exposed to air?  Could it have picked up any other contaminants?</p></li>
<li><p>Just how cold was the refrigerator at Trader Joe's?  Are you sure that it's consistently that cold?</p></li>
<li><p>What if the turkey was shifted around?  For example, what if some other customer picked it up, tossed it in a shopping cart, then after an hour of shopping decided to put it back?</p></li>
<li><p>How did <em>she</em> transport it?  I'm guessing in a non-temperature-controlled trunk?  How long was it in that condition/environment before finally making it into the fridge?</p></li>
<li><p>Was the temperature in the fridge turned down as far as it can go long <em>before</em> putting the turkey in there?  If not, how long might it have taken to get down to the desired temperature, especially with a massive slightly-warmed-up turkey in there?</p></li>
<li><p>How cold does her refrigerator get?  Is it a new refrigerator?  Are you both certain that it gets as cold as the rep at TJ's is assuming?  Have you actually stuck a thermometer in there to measure the environmental temperature around where the turkey would be stored?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not expecting you to answer any of these; my point is just that there are <em>so</em> many variables, so many things that can go wrong, and the quoted 10-day storage period (as well as the sell-by date) is for storage under <em>ideal</em> conditions.</p>

<p>I've seen turkeys go rancid in the fridge after just 2 days.  I've seen others take longer, but still far less than 10 days to go rancid.  It's an incredibly frustrating <em>and completely avoidable</em> experience.  Just put it in the freezer!  She just needs to make sure she gives it a couple of days to thaw in the fridge, due to the size of the bird.  A half-frozen turkey on Thanksgiving day is almost as useless as a rancid one.</p>

Is there something I am doing wrong? As far as I can tell, I am following the recipe exactly. Does it have something to do with my oven? With my technique?</p>
","<p>There are a few things I can think of.  The first is, are you sure your oven is at the right temperature?  Although your oven may beep that it's preheated, without checking it with an oven or infrared thermometer you can't be sure that it's actually at the temperature you need - and even if it is at that temperature where the sensor is, it might not be the same temperature elsewhere in the oven.  Try moving the rack you're using one or two levels closer to or further from the element and see if it makes a difference (further will probably be better if you're trying to increase spread).  My oven has a 50-75&deg;F range from the top rack to the bottom - a major difference when it comes to baking!  Understanding my oven's temperature range changed my baking outcomes significantly.</p>

<p>Second, are you letting the dough come to room temperature before baking?  I've found that the colder my dough, the less spread I get.</p>

<p>On Betty Crocker's site, there is <a href=""http://www.bettycrocker.com/products/cookie-mix/faq"">an FAQ</a> and under ""Why don't my cookies spread"", they recommend using an aluminum sheet - the darker the cookie sheet, apparently, the less spread you will get.  I haven't tested this personally, but I trust the source :) I get good spread on my silpat baking sheets, for what it's worth.</p>

<p>The only other thing I can think of is your butter, is it truly softened, or is it a hard block, or is it melted?  I'm not an experienced enough baker to explain the science behind the differences as they relate to baking, but I do know that those three options will produce significantly different results.  I <em>believe</em> that if your butter is too cold, they won't spread as much as they could - but hopefully someone can chime in and confirm or deny that.</p>

<p>Oh, and I asked a friend of mine who's a baker - she said that it's possible that your baking soda is old, and that could cause it, but I don't know from first hand experience if that's possible or not.  I trust her judgment though, as she's my go-to with baking questions and she's never led me astray.</p>

"How to cook chicken cutlets in a cast-iron skillet","106100","","<p>We want to cook healthy chicken cutlets and were wondering if the best is to use our cast-iron pan rather than a regular pan.</p>

<p>Any advice on best practices for chicken cutlets cooked in cast-iron? Cooking time? Heat level?</p>

<p>We want to avoid the breaded version so we keep it even healthier.</p>
","<p>Chicken breasts do not require extremely high heat, nor strong searing (in fact, they are quite easy to overcook), so while a cast iron pan is certainly effective, it is not required.  Any quality pan will do.</p>

<p>If you are sauteing simple chicken breasts (perhaps lightly marinated or seasoned), the technique is quite simple.</p>

<p>Often, you are better off pan-roasting as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Preheat your pan for about 5 minutes over medium high flames (or burner setting if you are electric), and oil it lightly.</p></li>
<li><p>Put the chicken breasts in, and leave undisturbed at medium heat until they are lightly browned on one side and released from the pan, 4-5 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Flip the breasts over and again, leave undisturbed until lightly browned.</p></li>
<li><p>If not done, place in a moderate (350 F, 180 C) oven until done, probably 5-10 minutes, depending on the thickness of your breasts.</p>

<p>You will know they are done when they register 160 - 170 F (depending on your preference; I like the lower end of the range) on a high quality instant read thermometer.   You will also learn to know when they are done based on the texture an how much resistance they have to being poked.</p></li>
<li><p>Once they are done, remove them from the pan and let them rest a minute or two. </p></li>
<li><p>During this time, you may optionally return the pan to the stove top and create a pan sauce of your choice.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>While a little more work, pounding the with meat mallet (I don't own one, so I use an 8 inch skillet as a mallet) to an even thickness of no more than a little less than an inch (2 cm) will help them cook quickly and evenly.</p>

<p>Note:  if you have true cutlets (which are about 1/4 inch thick, less than a CM), you will need to raise the heat slightly, and only cook for 2-3 minutes.  The oven phase is unlikely to be necessary.  Otherwise, the technique is the same.</p>

"Cooking an egg without oil or butter","106039","","<p>I like scrambled and fried eggs but the butter or oil probably add unnecessary calories. How can I fry an egg with no butter?  I tried in a Teflon pan but it was a mess.</p>
","<p>Well, frying means to cook in oil, so technically you can't. Fat also is delicious, so you'll lose something in the process besides just calories.</p>

<p>If you are using teflon, ceramic, or some other non-stick, don't bring the heat up too much. Scrambling your eggs with milk will make them more fluffy, and I bet less likely to stick. Use (sigh) PAM or another aerosolized cooking spray. Or just 'wipe' the pan with an oiled paper towel. It would impart minimal calories.</p>

<p>It's sad, but microwaving eggs will cook them without adding calories (or anything else). You can also make absolutely delicious eggs by soft-boiling them, which adds nothing at all. </p>

<p>My more general advice is to learn to love a little fat and to consume a variety of fresh, unprocessed foods which taste great.  It's much healthier in the long run than just cutting away at a number.  Better to go for some walks/runs/lifts then sacrifice flavor.  And fat leads to fullness, which leads to less wasted calories on junk later in the day.</p>

However, I cannot find the statement of it anymore. Now I'm starting to suspect my memory.</p>

<p>Could this statement be true?  Is it unsafe to reheat chicken?</p>
","<p>Taken out of context, that doesn't make much sense, but I can think of several <em>similar</em> claims you might have heard - all of which are true and most can be found on the <a href=""http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/how_temperatures_affect_food/index.asp#1"">USDA fact sheet</a> and the sites of most other agencies:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Perishable food should not be left in the ""danger zone"" (4.4° C - 60° C or 40° F to 140° F) (room temperature) for more than a total of 2 hours; 1 hour if the temperature is above 32° C / 90° F (mouth/gut temperature).</p></li>
<li><p>Freezing does <em>not</em> reset this countdown, it only stops it temporarily.  Thus, it is not a safe practice to thaw and refreeze food several times (especially if it's being brought above refrigerator temperatures).</p></li>
<li><p>Cooking <em>does</em> reset the countdown, but unless you are in a completely sterile environment (hint: you aren't), you still have to keep food out of the danger zone <em>after</em> cooking, which is why guidelines say to refrigerate within 2 hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Most people reheat their food to ""warm"" or even ""hot"" but not <em>cooking</em> temperature.  Unless you reheat to an <em>internal</em> temperature of 74° C / 165° F, then all that time in the danger zone <em>after</em> cooking is cumulative.  So if you do what most people do and reheat food to 40°-50° C, a nice comfortable eating temperature, then you'd better either (a) only reheat the portion you plan to eat, and/or (b) throw out any uneaten portion instead of putting it back in the fridge.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Really it's all about the cumulative amount of time, since being fully cooked, that the food has spent in the danger zone.  Theoretically, if you boiled the same piece of chicken every 12 hours and quick-froze it immediately afterward, it would stay safe indefinitely. It would also have no flavour or texture left, so I don't recommend it.</p>

<p>Since most people don't carefully measure the internal temperature of food when they reheat it, we have the ""best practice"" of <strong>only reheating perishable food <em>once</em> after it's been cooked</strong>, because otherwise it gets really hard to estimate how much time is left on that metaphorical clock.  And, obviously, don't leave it in the fridge for more than a few days, because it can still spoil in there, just slower.</p>

<p>A coffee mug isn’t always what it seems. Coffee mugs come in many varieties, are made from different materials, differ in decoration, and so on.</p>

<p>Moreover, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and other hot drinks commonly served in mugs, are seldom; read never, served at temperatures above 100 ºC / 212 ºF. However, due to competition, special on sale items, and so on, coffee mugs of low quality might not be able to withstand temperatures much higher than this. The reason is simply that manufacturers, or the manufacturers’ customers, want to save a few pennies to gain a market advantage. There might also be a consumer demand for cheap low quality coffee mugs.</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<p>Most coffee mugs are made from some kind of ceramic.  Others are made from wood, plastic, clay, pewter, steel, and a long list of other materials. Obviously, some of these materials will never be reckoned as oven safe. To keep it simple, I’ll stick to ceramic for the reminding part of this answer, although other materials might be oven safe.</p>

<p>Ceramics commonly found in a kitchen environment include Earthenware, Stoneware, Porcelain, and Bone china. Of these Earthenware and Bone china are seldom, read never, reckoned as oven safe, although this isn’t completely true as far as Bone china is concerned. Nevertheless, only a complete idiot would use a Bone china mug to make French Onion soup au gratin, cup cakes or any other kind of food. </p>

<p>That leaves us with Stoneware and Porcelain. Both Stoneware and porcelain are normally oven safe, unless decor elements have been added after the finale glaze is applied and the coffee mug is baked in a furnace. </p>

<p>One final remark needs to be added about coffee mugs made out of thin porcelain. Although these mugs might very well withstand the heat, it’s advisable to ensure that they are not exposed to any other kind of force while hot, e.g. handled without care. </p>

How long does chocolate last before losing flavor (or does it)?  And once it gets that white stuff on the outside, is it done?  What's the best way to store it for as long as possible?  Thank you.</p>
","<p>Regardless of type, all chocolate should be stored in a cool and low humidity (dry) place away from direct sunlight. It would be best to seal it in an air-tight container, because, as ElendiTheTall said, the cocoa butter in it will absorb flavors.</p>

<p>Dark chocolate will last for years. Milk and white chocolate will last for a much shorter time (a few months), because of their milk content.</p>

<p>Improperly stored chocolate will develop bloom, which shows as a white or grey streaking or spotting on the surface. The spotting or streaking is cocoa butter fat separating and is a sign that the chocolate's temper has been lost. This kind of chocolate is still suitable for any application where the chocolate will be fully melted (most baking). It can even be used as the base (non-seed) chocolate for tempering with the seeding method, but it should not be used for other candy making.</p>

<p>Pine nuts are very expensive here. I'm wondering if I can substitute any of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Walnuts</li>

<p>Would any of these be appropriate in a pesto sauce?</p>
","<p>First, I'm assuming by ""pesto"" you mean ""Pesto alla Genovese"", given your question about pine nuts.  Basil, pine nuts, garlic, olive oil, and cheese is a delicious combination, but it's only one of many ""pestos"" (peste, actually), since pesto refers in general to any sauce which is made from crushed or pureed ingredients.  Mix and match to your heart's content.  </p>

<p>Walnuts are actually a traditional alternative to pine nuts for Pesto alla Genovese; pine nuts have always been scarce, even in early-20th-century Italy.  As a caution, though, you need to get good, fresh walnuts and make sure to get all of the skin off the nuts, or the pesto will taste bitter and rancid.</p>

<p>Almonds could also work, although I'd think they'd be rather bland.  The herb pastes which traditionally have crushed almonds -- such as Romanesco sauce -- include some hot pepper.  Again, freshness and getting the skin off is important.</p>

Some additional Info on storing eggs:</p>

<p>Eggs should be stored in a refrigerator at about 40 degrees F, mainly to reduce the chances that any bacteria on the shell will multiply and cause a risk of illness.</p>

<p>Buy refrigerated eggs and store them in the refrigerator as soon as your get home. However, even under refrigeration, eggs slowly lose carbon dioxide, which enlarges the size of the air cell and causes the yolk to flatten and the white to spread.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fresh Egg - Refrigerated raw shell eggs will keep without significant quality loss for about 4 -  5 weeks beyond the ""sell by"" date or about 3 weeks after you bring them home.</li>
<li>Fresh egg whites - 2 to 4 days</li>

"What's the size of the plastic cup that came with my rice cooker?","101876","","<p>I have a cheap-o rice cooker that works fine for me.  It came with a plastic cup to measure 1, 2 or 3 ""plastic cup"" units of rice.  Water is added to match the '1', '2' or '3' mark in the cooker bowl.   It was great until the cup vanished.  </p>

<p>Now how to pour in the right amount of rice?</p>

<p>Do all rice cookers use the same standard ""plastic cup"" unit?  By any luck, would it be exactly 1 cup, or 1/2 cup, according to a standard measuring cup?  Maybe I could dump rice and water into the bowl in any amount as long as they're in the right proportion by volume.   Meeting the '2' or '3' mark isn't important, actually, just getting great rice in the end.</p>

<p>The actual model I'm using is CKRVRCM061 and yes, of course I could google it, but it would be great to have a general answer which could apply to any cooker I or anyone will use in the future - for those of us with a talent for losing small important items!</p>
","<p>Assuming you bought a rice cooker designed by a Japanese company (and apparently even other brands tend to meet that market's expectations), the measurement is 1-<em>gou</em>, slightly more than 180ml, which, by no coincidence, is also the typical measure of a wooden sake, cup, and is closely associated with a historical sake bottle size (approximately 1.8l)</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masu_(Japanese)"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masu_(Japanese)</a></p>

<p>It turns out that this amount, 1 gou of dried rice, neatly corresponded to a typical serving of rice. In practice, most contemporary Japanese eat about 1.5-2 <em>gou</em> per day; 1 gou of dried rice cooks up enough for 2 Japanese adults for one meal if you have several side dishes. There are other measurements that derive from the gou (or perhaps the other way around), such as the <em>koku</em>, which was considered the amount of rice that a single person would consume over the course of a year.</p>

<p>This is one of the human-centric forms of measurement that has survived the metric push; you can find various examples of this in many otherwise metric-converted countries. It turns out some studies show that those metrics often make certain categories of estimation easier for people.</p>

<p><strong>Edited to cover the concern about matching the right amount of water:</strong></p>

<p>It's worth noting that you don't need perfect precision for the amount of water, as long as you cook with the full cycle and not one of the express cooking modes. I can't remember the exact scientific principle behind it, but perhaps something to do with osmotic pressure. Some people use the remarkably effective method of measuring a certain amount of space between the dried rice and the water based on the size of their forefinger segment or thumbnail. It apparently works well for almost any imaginable size of pan (though you can have other problems with a pan too wide to have the rice cover the bottom). (Some types of rice do prefer more water than others, but within a single type, you have a fairly flexible range for the water ratio)</p>

","<p>It likely depends on what 'turning bad' means ...</p>

<p>For those that have started to sprout, but are still firm, you can cut away the sprouted bits (this time of year, you might even be able to plant them), peel them, and then boil them and turn 'em into mashed potatoes (which you can then vary for the next couple of days ... you can mash 'em with other stuff to make a sort of potato salad; you can add cooked greens to make colcannon or bubble and squeek; you can use as a topping for a cottage pie (the technically correct term for shepherds pie when you're not using mutton or lamb)</p>

<li>White wine vinegar (for acidity and a richer flavor, and pairing with the cabbage and onions)</li>
<li>Dry vermouth or white wine. Some flavor compounds are more soluble in alcohol than water, so this can help bring to the front additional flavors that are already present but undetectable.</li>
<li>A jigger of sherry or cooking sherry (the latter has salt, so add it before salting the soup). This is a common suggestion when serving canned soups to guests, to make the soup taste fancier.</li>
<li>Rosemary, thyme, and parsley flakes/stems (adds aromatic and herbal flavors)</li>
<li>Worcestershire sauce (use carefully, it's potent stuff) -- this adds umami and spiciness</li>
<li>Paprika and a pinch or two of cayenne -- adds warmth and back heat, and smokiness</li>
<li>Dijon mustard (use sparingly).  Adds front heat and a little richness to the soup</li>

"Why can applesauce be used in place of oil?","101206","","<p>In many recipes, mostly desserts, it is suggested that you can substitute oil with applesauce to reduce the fat content. But why applesauce?</p>

<p>Is there something special about applesauce or are there other ingredients than can be used?</p>
","<p>Fundamentally, the reason for this substitution is that applesauce contains <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectin"">pectin</a></strong>.</p>

<p>In baking, the role of oil is to <strong>coat</strong> the flour, preventing it from combining with the water (or other wet ingredients) and developing <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten"">gluten</a></strong>.  Gluten is what causes dough to rise, and also gives <em>elasticity</em> to the final product - what most people think of as ""chewiness.""</p>

<p>When you're baking, for example, a cake, or even a pie crust, you want to <strong>limit</strong> the amount of gluten that develops.  A cake or pie crust should be moist, light, and fluffy, not tough and chewy.  When you bite into a cake and find it very dry and bread-like, that is because it has developed a lot of gluten.  A good amount of oil or other fat leads to a lighter, moister, less-glutinous result.</p>

<p>The pectin in applesauce can also, to a certain extent, help to inhibit gluten formation in a dough, but the similarities end there.  I cannot stress this point enough, and I've seen many other online resources get this dead wrong: <strong>Pectin (applesauce) is <em>not</em> a <em>straightforward</em> or <em>foolproof</em> substitute for fat.</strong></p>

<p>The <em>mechanisms</em> by which pectin and oil work in this context are <strong><em>completely</em> different:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Oil is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"">lipid</a>.  Lipids bind to starch (including the ~75% starch in flour) and are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobe"">hydrophobic</a> - the traditional example of this is dew drops forming on the surface of grass or plants (the latter being the hydrophobe).  In a sense, oil forms a protective ""shield"" around the flour molecules.</p></li>
<li><p>Pectin, on the other hand, is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelling_agent"">gelling agent</a>, and specifically a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide"">polysaccharide</a>.  Pectin is <strong>not</strong> hydrophobic and does not actually protect the flour molecules.  In fact, <em>pectin is of the same family as starches</em>, which are also polysaccharides.  What's really happening here is that <strong>the pectin competes with the flour for water</strong>.  That means less water overall reaches the starch and gluten-forming proteins (giladin and glutenin) in the flour, and because of this, it is not able to develop as much gluten or gelatinize much of the other starch.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What does all of this actually mean for you, the baker?  Quite simply, it means you have to be <strong>very careful</strong> with this substitution:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Too much pectin can turn your recipe into a jelly-like consistency.</p></li>
<li><p>Too little pectin will fail to prevent glutenization (in other words, you'll get bread).</p></li>
<li><p>Pectin has the property of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syneresis_%28chemistry%29"">syneresis</a> - meaning that once it starts to gel, it also starts to expel liquid, and your dessert will dry out or deflate over time.</p></li>
<li><p>Pectin is actually water-soluble at high temperatures (technically, it forms a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid"">colloid</a>), it just happens to absorb a <em>lot</em> of water along the way.  Baking for too long, or at too high a temperature, will cause the pectin to break down and dissolve completely, making it useless.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are also several other problems (or at least ""gotchas"") when making the apple sauce substitution:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Applesauce is <a href=""http://www.ehow.com/facts_5867454_composition-apple_.html"">not <em>just</em> pectin</a>.  It has a good deal of water and various proteins and acids, and even a certain amount of lipids.  The exact quantities, however, depend on how the applesauce was made, so it is very hard to get precise control over the amount of pectin, and the textbook 1:1 substitution ratio is almost <em>never</em> correct.</p></li>
<li><p>Another thing that applesauce contains is <strong>sugar</strong> - even unsweetened applesauce.  You will almost certainly need to reduce the amount of sugar elsewhere in your recipe.  This may be difficult, especially if the bulk of the sugar is used as a dry ingredient.</p></li>
<li><p>Applesauce behaves somewhat similarly to <em>oil</em>, but do not even <em>try</em> using it as a substitute for any other fat.  Butter, in particular, contains milk proteins which act as natural emulsifiers; pectin does have certain stabilizing properties but is a rather poor emulsifier compared to butter<sup>[citation needed]</sup>.  And it goes without saying that the flavour is <em>substantially</em> different from that of applesauce; oil is ""OK"" to substitute for because it has very little flavour of its own.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you plan on using applesauce as a substitute for oil in a recipe that does not specifically explain how to use it as a substitute, then I strongly suggest you do two things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Don't substitute the entire quantity.  Use 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce, or maybe 1/4 oil and 3/4 applesauce.  You will likely also have to lower the total quantity of oil/applesauce to approximately half of what it originally was (give or take 1/4).</p></li>
<li><p>If you can, try this substitution on a small scale first, and experiment with the quantities of oil, sugar, and applesauce, before going all-out and putting it into the oven while your guests arrive.  It's very likely that on the first few attempts, you'll end up with something that's palatable, but nowhere near the quality of the oil-based recipe.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Ignore these disclaimers at your own risk!</p>

"Is there any substitute for saltpeter / sodium nitrate in corned beef brine?","100803","","<p>I realize there is another question about corned beef from scratch, but the answers don't really cover my question. Many recipes for making your own corned beef still refer to the use of saltpeter (potassium nitrate) or sodium nitrate.  From what I've been able to find out saltpeter is never used anymore nor available to the home cook, and sodium nitrate is  not commonly available.</p>

<p>Sodium nitrate in the brine gives cooked corned beef its classic reddish color (without it corned beef comes out gray), and it kills botulism spores. I like my corned beef pink (the gray color is somewhat unappetizing), but more than that I'm concerned about the flavor of the corned beef. The last time I made corned beef I tried to use Morton Tender Quick. The cooked brisket turned out beautifully pink and almost inedible. It was terribly salty and actually made my tongue numb.</p>

<p>So, is there anything that can be used in place of the sodium nitrate, if used in the proper quantities does its absence or presence have any effect on the flavor of the corned beef, and is there any good place to get it?</p>
","<p>Saltpeter is potassium <em>nitrate</em>, which does not directly cure meats. Bacteria convert <em>nitrate</em> into <em>nitrite</em>, which is the real preservative. Saltpeter can be replaced by a smaller amount of nitrite to get the same curing effect (most commercial cured meats do this), though a prolonged cure that converts nitrate into nitrite can develop more flavor.</p>

<p>Tender Quick is not a direct substitute because it contains mostly salt. I've heard that you can replace the salt in your recipe with Tender Quick, and drop the saltpeter, and have a success. You would have better luck finding a recipe that was meant to use Tender Quick, though.</p>

<p>It is definitely possible to buy (food-grade!) saltpeter. I would check online, or at specialty stores. It's a little more difficult than picking it up at your local grocery store, of course.</p>

<p>(Chemistry lesson, courtesy of McGee: nitrate (NO3) is converted to nitrite (NO2), which then reacts to form nitric oxide (NO), which bonds to myoglobin in the meat, which turns it pink and prevents oxidation.  Nitric oxide is also present in smoke, which gives that ""pink ring"" around the outside of smoked meats.)</p>

"How long will food last in a refrigerator that is turned off?","100776","","<p>We will be having a power outage in our building soon and our fridges are pretty full. The power will be off for about 10 hours. Will our food last safely during this time?</p>
","<p><strong>[Edited]</strong> I think 10 hours would be safe enough for most food: the first couple of hours the fridge will still be quite cold, and after that it takes more than a few ours for most food to spoil. When I leave milk out of the fridge for three hours at room temperature (say, 20 °C), nothing happens. I do this often. And the temperature inside the fridge will never reach room temperature in those 10 hours. When it is really hot in summer, it might spoil after 2 hours outside the fridge, but otherwise it takes much longer.</p>

<p>Cheese, food in jars, sauces, leftover cooked food: none of these are more sensitive to spoiling than milk. Fresh herbs are probably equally sensitive. Eggs are much less sensitive. The most sensitive kinds of food I can think of are probably raw meat and raw fish without preservatives. Smoked or salted meat and fish do not count: they can be kept much longer. I think even raw meat and fish will pull through, but you might want to apply the following tips to be sure.</p>

<p><strong>Tip 1:</strong> put as much material in your fridge as possible, a day before the outage. That will ""absorb the cold"" that your fridge feeds it while power is still on. Then, once power goes out, the ""cold reserve"" in your fridge will be significantly increased, so that the average temperature of the interior will stay colder for a much longer time. The higher the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_heat_capacity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">volumetric heat capacity</a>, the better. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_heat_capacity#Table_of_specific_heat_capacities"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this table ('volumetric heat capacity')</a> for the best material; water probably wins. So stuffing bags of water in every nook and cranny would seem like a good idea. Or else bottles.</p>

<p><strong>Tip 2:</strong> if you have a freezer, stuff it with bags and/or bottles of water, and put most of those in the fridge once power goes out (swap with some of the bags/bottles that were in the fridge). The freezer will probably do better, because it has much better insulation than the fridge. And put the most sensitive foods in the freezer maybe a few hours after power goes out (or maybe later—lest they freeze after all).</p>

<p>Actually, start putting as much water bags/bottles in the freezer as you can several hours before power goes out, and move them to the fridge once frozen. They will remain half-frozen for hours and hours in the fridge, so they will add extra coolness to the fridge. This way you're ""saving up"" cold from the freezer and increasing your cold reserve even more.</p>

<p><strong>Tip 3:</strong> most refrigerators have a temperature slide/wheel/thing, which determines what temperature the thermostat aims at. You could set the slide to maximum power (so lowest temperature) a few hours before the power outage. Most people, including me, have the slide somewhere in the middle normally. The slide usually doesn't mark the exact temperature, but rather some symbols. It is usually found inside the refrigerator.</p>

<p><strong>Tip 4:</strong> cook and/or eat any raw fish and meat before the outage. I think it would not be necessary at all if you follow the above tips, but cooking your meat now may just be simpler. Then either store the cooked meat or eat it. Incidentally, I wouldn't half-cook any meat: that may actually increase the rate of bacterial growth if it doesn't kill the bacteria completely. But something like salmon can be (fully) cooked first, reheated later.</p>

"How long can you freeze raw chicken before it seriously affects its taste?","100501","","<p>The dramatic effects of freezing something almost always has an immediate impact on taste.  But it seems like the longer something is in the freezer the worse it tastes.  Recently, I found some months old raw chicken in the back of the freezer and it definitely tasted slightly strange.</p>

<p>So, beyond the initial freezing process, how long can you store frozen chicken before being frozen affects its taste?</p>
","<p>The change in flavor is mainly affected by packaging and how long before it gets frozen.</p>

<p>Packaging: If you have vacuum sealed chicken it will last quite a while. It won't get freezer burnt, dry out or pick up flavors from other freezer occupants. I would say properly packaged will last months to a year range depending on your taste buds.</p>

<p>Time before freezing: I have a habit of buying meat to cook right away, but end up freezing it raw several days after the fact. I then see it a week or two later and pull it out to cook. It never tastes as good as when I freeze it immediately.</p>

But if the meat has a good temperature straight after it's been cooked, it seems as though it will be too cold after resting it for a few minutes.</p>

<p>How do you rest meat in such a way that it is not too cold for eating?</p>
","<p>Straight after it comes out of the pan it will usually be too hot to eat.  Regardless of resting or not, you can't fully taste things which are too hot, they need to come down to a comfortable temperature before you eat them.</p>

<p>Some things you can do to stop the meat being too cold when you serve it: </p>

<ul>
<li>You can rest the meat wrapped in foil, this will stop it from getting too cool too quickly if you are not ready to serve once its had the time to rest.</li>
<li>you can rest it and then warm it again before you eat it, either under a hot grill for a little, or in an oven.</li>
<li>serve it with a hot sauce which will warm the meat</li>
<li>serve it on a warmed plate which will stop it cooling more too quickly on the table</li>

"Is there any difference between cheap and expensive vodka?","100072","","<p>Vodka is supposed to be odorless and flavorless (with the exception of flavored vodkas). So if I switch to a dirt-cheap vodka, can I save some money?</p>

<p>Is there any difference between cheap and expensive vodka?  Are there any reliable studies demonstrating this?</p>
","<p>Here's a report on an informally conducted taste test suggesting that there are indeed detectable differences between various vodkas: (the report does not say so, but I suspect that much like wine, whether one vodka comes out as better as another one has little to do with its price, except at the very bottom end of the price range)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And, yes, there are differences—a truth known by anyone in the liquor industry with a little sense. But one that is frequently forgotten— partly because our government insists on characterizing vodka as a ""colorless, flavorless, odorless"" beverage; [...] That there are subtle, and sometimes dramatic, differences in flavor and odor between one vodka and another was driven home recently by a daylong seminar hosted by Absolut. [...] Central to the event was a blind tasting of 12 different vodkas. [...]</p>
  
  <p>The main lesson of the tasting—or re-learned lesson, since many of us in the room knew it already—is that the biggest difference between the flavors of various vodkas derives from the source material, and that difference is easily detected, if you pay attention. Vodka can be distilled from anything, but the most common raw materials are grain and potatoes, with a few using molasses and grapes and other things. Grape-sourced vodka typically has a fruitier character; grain-sourced has the expected bready, yeasty and, yes, grainy notes, with the rye vodkas having more bit and spark than the barley or wheat ones; and potato-sourced vodka has a rounder, sometimes buttery flavor.</p>
  
  <p><em>From:</em> <a href=""http://offthepresses.blogspot.be/2010/03/vodkas-and-their-differences.html"">http://offthepresses.blogspot.be/2010/03/vodkas-and-their-differences.html</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another taste test conducted by the New York Times suggests the same thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Delving into the world of vodka reveals a spirit unlike almost any other, with standards that make judging it substantially different from evaluating wine, beer, whiskey or even root beer. A malt whiskey should be distinctive, singular. The same goes for a Burgundy or a Belgian ale. But vodka? Vodka is measured by its purity, by an almost Platonic neutrality that makes tasting it more akin to tasting bottled waters, or snowflakes. [...]</p>
  
  <p>A lack of distinctiveness is a separate matter from a lack of distinction. The vodkas we tasted had character and their own flavors and aromas, even though the differences among them were often subtle and difficult to articulate. [...]</p>
  
  <p>That being said, at the end of our tasting it was Smirnoff at the top of our list, ahead of many other names that are no doubt of higher status in stylish bars and lounges. [...] The prices of these vodkas ranged from a low of $13 for the Smirnoff to a high of $34 for Potocki, a Polish vodka that did not make our cut. The Belvedere also cost $34, but that was for a liter rather than the usual 750 milliliter bottle. Imported vodkas tend to cost more, partly because of taxes levied by various governments, currency exchange rates and, not least, marketing concerns: as has been proved in many industries, wine not least of all, raising the price of a product increases its status among consumers.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As a counterpoint, here's another report suggesting most people can <em>not</em> tell the difference:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To summarize our findings,</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Given a particular brand of vodka, people prefer its taste after it has been filtered, but this is most likely because filtration reduces the alcohol content.</li>
  <li>Most people can’t tell the difference between an expensive vodka with high alcohol content and a cheaper vodka with lower alcohol content.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Our second experiment demonstrated approximately equal preferences for Pavlova and Ketel One. Although Pavlova contains 3-5% less alcohol by volume than Ketel One, it is also 70% cheaper, so it would seem a clear winner.</p>

  <p>LOW OVEN</p>
  
  <p>Just like in a pot roast, cooking the pork low and slow (325 degrees for 5 to 6 hours) pushes the meat well beyond its “done” mark into the 190-degree range, encouraging intramuscular fat to melt, collagen to break down and tenderize the meat, and the fat cap to render and crisp.</p>

"Soaking fruit in alcohol","98796","","<p>I thought that soaking fruit in whiskey would be tasty so last night, I filled a mason jar with pear pieces and filled it up with Jack Daniels.</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the optimal amount of time this should be soaking?</li>
<li>Is it better to soak it refrigerated or at room temperature?</li>
<li>Are some types of liquor better than others for this? Clear (vodka) or colored (whiskey)? Should I use higher proof liquor (e.g. 90-100 proof whiskey).</li>
</ol>
","<p>The optimum amount of <strong>time</strong> depends on what you want to achieve:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you aim for <strong>alcohol-infused fruit</strong>, you should be fine with a short time. The taste of the fruit will start to change after only a few hours (think of soaking fruit for a punch), from then the extraction of fruit flavours into the alcohol continues. For this approach, choose a liquor that complements your fruit because it will remain quite discernible.</li>
<li>A good middle ground is usually reached after two (soft fruit) to eight (harder fruit) weeks. The alcohol should have absorbed a good amount of fruit flavour but the fruit keep enough to be still tasty. Just sample a bit occasionally until you reach the desired state.</li>
<li>For <strong>flavoring alcohol</strong> you want to soak for a minimum of six weeks, but here often longer is better. The taste will change over time, usually getting ""rounder"" or even change significantly from the original taste of the chosen fruit + alcohol combination. The fruit may or may not be tasty after this time, but usually should have given up most aromatic compounds into the alcohol - alcohol is a solvent, after all. Because you aim to take the flavour from the fruit, you can go with a ""neutral"" kind of liquor here, but you may just as well use something with more character. I currently have a batch of quince liquor made with only the peels and cores (in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn_%28liquor%29"">Korn</a>) in my storage area that has been there for four(!) years. It has developed beautiful undertones of almond, vanilla and honey and is ready to be strained whenever I have a bit of free time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another element to consider is the <strong>fruit-to-alcohol ratio</strong>:</p>

<p>The less alcohol is present, the less solvent is there to draw the aromatics from the fruit. This means, for flavoured fruit, barely covering them is enough while to ""fully"" extract the fruit you might go for a liquid level that is up to twice as high as the fruit in your container.</p>

<p>For longer soaking times, the alcohol content is crucial. I learned that everything over 40 %vol (= 80 proof) should be fine to keep the fruit from spoiling during extraction even at room temperature. Use higher proof if using a higher (soft) fruit content w/o sugar if you plan on soaking long term. <em>But</em> always use unblemished fruit. Not only to ensure the shelf life of your product, but also because even slight traces of an ""off"" taste can be amplified and and spoil your whole batch.</p>

<p>The addition of <strong>sugar</strong> is optional, keep in mind that your fruit bring sugar, too. Sugar may speed up the extraction process a bit because it helps breaking down the cells. This may or may not be desired. Also, sugar acts as a preservative, so it's recommended for lower-alcohol concoctions.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you like the results of your pear experiment, you might consider setting up a ""<strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumtopf"">Rumtopf</a></strong>"" as an ongoing project for summer:</p>

<p>Starting in June with strawberries, layer about 1/2 to 1 pound of fruit with 1/2 the weight of sugar in a large jar, cover with rum (preferably 110 proof) and weigh down with a plate. Rum should be always 1 inch above fruit level. Close the pot and store in a dark space if the pot is not opaque. During summer, top up with more fruit and sugar whenever they are ripe (cheries, peaches, raspberries, pears, plum...). Start serving 6 weeks after the addition of the last fruits.</p>

","<p>It is about the same thing as putting A-1 on prime rib. Mixers, like cola or ginger ale, tend to mask the flavors of the whiskey, something which is understandable for an 'inferior' brand but is thought of as 'taboo' for a 'fine' blend. The drink that results from mixing your fine whiskey with the mixers is (roughly) 'the same' as if you had mixed a cheaper blend, having concealed the subtleties that aging and craftsmanship have worked to create. </p>

"What exactly is ""vegetable shortening""?","98095","","<p>I have not heard about this stuff before.. It is not used in Indian cooking..! 
What exactly is shortening?
I read it in a recipe to bake a rose shaped cake and it uses shortening to grease the pan..</p>
","<p>In baking, the term ""shortening"" alone is used to mean any fat; ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vegetable shortening</a>"" is a fat made from vegetable oil to be solid at room temperature.</p>

<p>Most vegetable oils, such as corn oil, peanut oil, soybean oil and so on are liquid at room temperature because they are unsaturated fats:  their fatty acids do not have hydrogen bound to them.</p>

<p>Vegetable oil is converted into vegetable shortening by hydrogenating it, forcing hydrogen to bind on to the ends of the fatty acids.  This is done by forcing hydrogen to bubble through the oil under pressure, heat, and in the presence of a catalyst.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zg9Nis.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">  </p>

<p>Compared to vegetable oil, vegetable shortening is solid at room temperature, white in color, and much less prone to rancidity as it is a saturated fat.  It has essentially an unlimited shelf life.</p>

<hr>

<p>It is also very neutral in flavor, so is often used to grease pans. However, any fat will do for that purpose.</p>

<p>In baking, it performs very well in making North American style pie crusts, where it helps promote a flaky crust, but it has little flavor.  It also performs very well in deep frying.</p>

<p>As a solid fat, like butter, it can also be creamed with sugar to help leaven baked goods, although it does not give the flavor benefits of butter.</p>

<p>Note that margarine is essentially an emulsion of vegetable shortening (about 80%) and water (about 20%) plus colors and flavorings, meant to imitate butter.</p>

"Why is 180 degrees C so common in recipes?","97951","","<p>Is there any particular reason 180 degrees Celsius is so commonly called for in baking, roasting, deep frying? </p>
","<p>Ovens are by their nature a high-heat cooking method, and thus create a temperature gradient in the food.  The outside of the item is the hottest, because it is in contact with the hot air, and exposed to the radiant (infrared) heat coming from the oven walls, ceiling and floor.</p>

<p>Heat from the outside then conducts into the inside overtime.  The effect of this is that the surface of the food will be the hottest, and the center the coolest.,</p>

<p>180 C (350 F) is a moderate oven.  It balances:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cooking the food through</li>
<li>Overcooking the outside</li>
</ul>

<p>It is suitable for a wide range of baked goods and other dishes, although often within limits (especially for non-baked goods) you can trade temperature and time off.</p>

<p>Note that a single oven can only have one temperature, and a moderate oven is good for many cakes and cookies; for baking and heating through casseroles; for roasting root vegetables; for maintaining a braise; and for roasting many meats; and many other tasks.  If you want to have multiple items in the oven at the same time, it is a good temperature to choose that will give good results for a wide variety of items, even if it is not ideal for every item.</p>

<p>Still, it is not ideal for every cooking technique and food item.  Low and slow roasting (for tremendously succulent pulled pork, brisket, and so on) is done as low as 200 F (93 C); some people favor high temperature roasting of certain meats to get a crispy exterior while maintaining a rare interior with temperatures of 450 F (232 C), or even higher.</p>

<p>Many breads are baked at higher temperatures--and of course, pizza infamously is ideally done at temperatures home ovens cannot even achieve, so at home they are often baked at the maximum oven setting around 550 F (280 C).</p>

<hr>

<p>Deep frying is a separate matter, and it is a complete coincidence that the ideal temperature for deep frying matches that of roasting.</p>

<p>The way deep frying works is that the heat of the oil heats the outside of the food, but it is hot enough to nearly instantly vaporize the water at the surface of the food.  This water creates a small pocket of vapor around the food, preventing the oil from entering and making the item completely oily.   In order for this effect to happen, the oil must be sufficiently hot which starts around 180 C / 350 F.</p>

<p>On the other hand, again, you don't want the food to burn on the outside before it cooks through, but more importantly, you don't want the oil smoking, and developing off flavors (many culinary fats have a smoke point starting not too far above these temperatures).   For these reasons, frying much above this temperature is generally not a good idea.  Most ideal frying temperatures are somewhere in the 350 F - 365 F (180 C 0 185 C) range.</p>

<p>I suspect many recipes indicate 350 F simply because it has become common and conventional.</p>

<p>I wonder if this is just a myth or if professionals also use this trick? </p>

<p>Wouldn't you risk that parts of the chicken is not cooked properly then causing infection? </p>
","<p>While yes it can be done, I wouldn't choose to do it over another technique unless that was my only option or I just needed some chicken cooked quickly for a recipe where it is used in the cooked form and will have a lot of other flavors added (chicken salad).  Remember that a lot of flavor is due to browning and cooking in the microwave eliminates those flavors.  At least with poaching, if the liquid is REALLY well seasoned you'll still impart flavor.</p>

<p>Any cooking technique can lead to tough and dry meat, including poaching where it's being cooked submerged in hot liquid.  Regardless of the technique, if the proteins heat too hot and too quickly they will constrict quickly and squeeze out the juices.  The result will be tough, dry, saw-dusty chicken or other protein.  This is the same thing that happens when scrambled eggs are rubbery...cooked too long over too high of heat.  The proteins act like sponges that are being wrung out.</p>

<p>Personally I think you have much less control over meat cooked in a microwave because the cooking occurs from the inside outward and the residual heat continues to build more intensely than if it was cooked in a saute pan or on a grill.</p>

<p>Is this something that professionals do?  No.  Microwaves in a professional kitchen are mainly used for melting butter, chocolate, reheating things quickly...much the same as I recommend people do at home.  We do not use them for ""cooking"".  Although I do use it for sweating onions if that's the only thing I'd be dirtying a pan for...put the onions in a bowl with a little butter, cover and nuke for about a minute until tender. </p>

"Food safety concerns regarding cooked steak stored in the fridge","97411","","<p>I'm thinking of cooking some steak and storing it for later use in a cold salad. If I cook it to medium rare and cut it into strips and store it in the firdge, will it be safe to eat later? I know any bacteria mostly grows on the surface of the meat so that should be killed when cooked, but is there a higher danger of contamination on the now exposed, less cooked surface area? </p>

<p>If I put it in a clean container I'm guessing the pink parts are just as prone to further contamination as the outer surface. </p>

<p>If kept in this condition, how long should I expect this meat to stay good for in the fridge?</p>

<p>What would be different if we were talking about a partially eaten steak stored for later consumption?</p>
","<p>As you mention, cooking the steak to medium rare does indeed kill the bacteria on the surface of the steak which is where most of the risk of contamination exists, so immediately after you've cooked the steak, if you eat it, you're probably pretty safe unless there happened to be bad organisms living <em>inside</em> the meat.</p>

<p>Assuming that you've got a good piece of meat, with nothing terrible inside it, after you cook the meat, what you need to worry about most is bacteria that <em>you</em> introduce to the meat, and so to answer your question, cutting meat shouldn't affect the safety of storing meat <em>after</em> cooking at all (as long as you use a clean knife/cutting board).</p>

<p>While cooking the meat does initially kill all of the surface bacteria, the fact that the surface was once cooked doesn't really do anything to deter new bacteria from moving in and going to town on the meat.  What this means is that you need to be very careful to keep meat in sanitary conditions regardless of whether the exposed surface has been previously cooked or not if you're planning to eat it without cooking it again.</p>

<p>So, to recap, if you take a piece of meat where <em>all</em> bacteria has been killed via cooking, and seal it without introducing new bacteria, you should be safe to eat it.</p>

<p>The one remaining issue is that we're not talking about a steak that's necessarily had all bacteria killed.  There's a possibility that some bacteria survived the cooking inside the meat.  If this is the case, you may be safe to eat the meat right away if there are very few of these bacteria present (depending on what they are), but the longer you wait - even if you seal the whole thing up - the longer you're giving those bacteria to multiply into large enough quantities that they can destroy the meat and/or sicken you.  To avoid this, you want to put the meat in the refrigerator, as soon as possible to slow bacterial action, and eat it as soon as possible.  Like John, I've had success with around 3-5 days, but it really depends on what you're starting with, so I'd highly recommend that you have a good look/sniff before you eat to see if there are any signs of spoilage and discard if so.  Again, this is a risk whether you cut the meat or not, so that isn't really a factor here.</p>

<p>Regarding partially eaten steaks, this is just introducing one more place where bacteria can get on the steak before it's sealed up and refrigerated.  I could see this being no issue (if you're cutting off a piece of the steak, and sealing/refrigerating the rest while eating), or a significant issue if you're cutting the steak with utensils that have been in your mouth, or worse, trying to store a piece of steak that's been in your mouth.  In those cases you're almost certainly introducing more bacteria and decreasing the amount of time you'll have before spoilage occurs.</p>

<p>So, in summary, cut the meat if you like - that should make no difference.  Get it sealed up as soon as possible without exposing it to anything non-sterile.  Put it in the refrigerator as soon as possible.  Throw it out if at any point you detect spoilage.  Following these steps you should be safe to keep your leftovers for 3-5 days and only rarely need to discard spoiled food.</p>

"Are bay leaves dangerous to (unwittingly) eat?","97385","","<p>When I first started working as a cook, I was instructed in no uncertain terms to only use whole bay leaves when cooking so that when the leaves were removed, still whole, one could be sure that no pieces had broken off and remained in the stew (or whatever). </p>

<p>I was told that eating dried bay leaves was akin to eating broken glass in their potential effects on the digestive system. </p>

<p>Yet, just the other day I was eating a rabbit pie and I discovered a whole bay leaf in it. I asked the server, and she said that it was common practice for that restaurant to leave bay leaves <em>in situ</em>. </p>

<p>I guess they can't be that bad for you if restaurants can serve them hidden in the middle of a pie? </p>
","<p>There is no reason to worry. The worst thing which can happen is that a piece of bay leaf, being somewhat hard, can lodge somewhere in your digestive system, necessitating a trip to ER. But a medical paper on the topic starts its discussion section with the sentence ""Reports discussing ingestion of bay leaves have been exceedingly scant"". They only cite 10 references in the period 1950-1990, and most of these are general studies of foreign bodies in the esophagus, not specific studies of bay leaf ingestion. </p>

<p>Given how often bay leafs must find their ways into people's digestive systems (they feature in our food), it is safe to conclude that only a tiny fraction of ingested bay leafes cause problems, else there would be more studies mentioning such cases. The same is true for side effects different from mechanical obstruction: if this had happened, somebody would have published it. </p>

<p>The paper I mentioned is ""Bay Leaf Impaction in the Esophagus and Hypopharynx"" by Stephen K. Buto, MD; Tat-Kin Tsang, MD; Gerald W. Sielaff, MD; Laurie L. Gutstein, MD; and Mick S. Meiselman, MD. Sadly, it isn't freely available (I could read the full text because my uni has a subscription). </p>

<p>I guess that if you are working as a cook, your workplace may decide that even if the chance for a customer choking on a bay leaf is something like one in a million, they'd rather instill removing bay leaves from dishes as a policy. Probably prudent, although there are more important risks to care about. </p>

"What is the difference between whole grain mustard and regular yellow mustard?","97159","","<p>Is there any taste differences between whole grain mustard and regular yellow mustard?</p>

<p>Is the difference primarily in terms of texture and composition of each mustard?</p>

<p>Also, could each be used interchangeably?</p>
","<p>Yes, there is (generally) a significant taste difference between whole grain mustard and regular yellow mustard.  Texture plays a part of it, but it is secondary to the overall difference in flavor.</p>

<p>I say generally because there's a lot of variation in each, and some extremes of one type may approach some extremes of the other type in flavor.</p>

<p>Yellow mustard is usually very mild, and vinegar plays a very strong role in the flavor.</p>

<p>Whole grain mustard is usually stronger than yellow, and the vinegar flavor is much less pronounced, if not altogether absent.</p>

<p>In many situations, one type can usually be substituted for the other, although it is a matter of personal preference, and many people will argue that some uses of mustard are appropriate for one type, but not the other (for example, I would never use yellow mustard as a condiment for cheese and crackers, but I would use a whole grain mustard for some types of cheese).</p>

I mean, the scrubbing works for potatoes (so long as they're not green under the skin), and carrots grow in dirt, too.  I don't think it's a pesticide issue, as we did it growing up, and I don't think we cared about pesticides back then.</p>

<p>I admit that sometimes there's odd crooks that might be harder to scrub dirt out of, but is there something fundamental that I'm missing here?</p>

"What is meant by ""neutral"" oils?","96754","","<p>What is meant by ""neutral"" oils? Conversely, what would make an oil not neutral? When is it important that the oil be neutral (or not)?</p>
","<p>Context would make me more sure, but I expect this is referring to neutral flavor.</p>

<p>If you need oil in something for purposes other than flavor, and want to make sure that the other flavors in the dish aren't affected or obscured, then you'd want a neutral oil. For example, for frying and sauteeing, we rarely use strongly flavored oil. (There's the additional problem that many flavors are destroyed at high heat; many more aromatic oils have lower smoke points.)</p>

<p>Oils like sesame oil, chili oil, and walnut oil are decidedly not neutral. On the other end, oils like canola oil and grapeseed oil are neutral. Close to neutral, there are very mildly-flavored oils like peanut oil. Somewhere more in the middle there are things like olive oil, which has some flavor but isn't overwhelmingly strong.</p>

<p>Note that sometimes there's more than one type of oil from a given source, often a more refined one that's more neutral and a less refined one with more flavor. For example, refined olive oil is quite neutral, but extra-virgin olive oil has plenty of flavor; ""regular"" peanut oil is fairly refined and mild, but there are also flavorful roasted peanut oils.</p>

"Uncovered Raw Meat or Milk in Fridge","96700","","<p>I believe the harm in leaving raw meat uncovered in the fridge is that more bacteria will enter, more oxygen will enter (causing faster bacteria multiplication), and more water will escape (causing dryness which probably slows bacteria multiplication, but toughens the meat, so let's consider dryness to be bad; I'm not making beef jerky).  Please ignore the stinky odors that escape; just consider the quality of that one uncovered piece of meat after we eventually cook it.</p>

<p>How much faster will the food spoil (percentage, compared to the same meat wrapped in plastic wrap)?  I imagine that meat with skin, like a whole chicken, is not effected as much as meat without skin, like a bare chicken breast, and that ground meat would be effected the most.  I wish I had some data to convince my roommate to cover his meat; is there any research on this?  Feel free to answer this for milk instead if there is more research for it.</p>
","<p>There is no practical difference in spoilage time for wrapped versus unwrapped.  Spoilage is a factor pretty much of temperature, since in practice, all foods have pathogens present which can breed.</p>

<p>Assuming your refrigerator is free of insects, dogs and similar macro-fauna, wrapping is to prevent odors from going from one food to another, drying, or cross-contamination of one food by another through drips or splashing.  Now, <em>outside</em> of a refrigerator, where ants, flies, and so on are abundant, wrapping also provides a physical barrier to prevent infestation, but the body of the refrigerator already does that.</p>

<p>In fact, in some rare occasions, you may wish to specifically refrigerate your meat unwrapped:  for example, after brining a turkey, refrigerating it for 24 hours unwrapped will permit the skin to dry out, and permit a more crispy result.</p>

"When baking, is it better to use a gas or electric oven?","96685","","<p>I'm looking for an oven and wanted to know if there is any difference between a gas or electric oven when it comes to baking things like cakes, biscuits and scones?</p>
","<p>For baking cakes and breads it is important to control the humidity in the oven. In early stages of baking one typically needs the humidity to remain in the baking chamber, which is hard to do with a gas oven.  Two of the bakeries near my house use electric ovens with brick lined baking chambers; the other uses gas. </p>

<h3>Expansion</h3>

<p>Gas and electric ovens can be built to bake the same way if cost is not an issue.  Most home gas ovens will circulate the combustion products (mainly water vapor and carbon dioxide) in the cooking chamber.  As the flames burn, combustion products need to be vented out of the baking chamber.  Electric ovens also need vents in the baking chamber to help maintain the pressure as the air inside expands.</p>

<p>Steam is essential in the initial stages of baking for good crust formation in breads and crack-free cake surfaces. The oven cavity can hold much more steam than released from the gas combustion and it is my inference that the steam content of an electric oven will be higher  (I cannot find published steam measurements inside ovens). After the dough expansion, the vapor coming off of the dough or batter needs to removed quickly for browning and for the inside to cook well.  The constant flow in a gas oven makes it better at that. In an electric oven a peep or two during the last baking stages will handle excess moisture.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ix5Gj.png"" alt=""Openings in gas and electric ovens""></p>

<p>Two bakeries near my house use electric ovens, the other, which makes excellent French baguettes, uses a gas oven.  The baker there has had both electric and gas ovens and he prefers the caramelization of the gas oven.  But note that he can handle the moisture problem with the steam injector of his professional gas oven.  He also noted that using gas ovens require skill as they have temperature and moisture quirks.  </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.hi-tm.com/Documents/Bloody-chik.html"">Bloody Chicken</a></p>

<p>The author (a Ph.D according to that page) did a number of experiments where he cooked a chicken and checked the internal temperature everywhere, ensuring that it was in fact pasteurized and thus free of any bacteria, and parts of it were still bloody on the inside.</p>

<p>According to him (and a few other sources I found), it's because the chickens are very young and their bones have not hardened properly; when you cook them, the marrow seeps out and ends up looking as you describe.</p>

<p>If you're using a meat thermometer to test the chicken for doneness, and you are certain that it got hot enough, then don't worry about the blood.  It's not appetizing, but it's not harmful either.</p>

Note that when I was adding in the aubergines, I was not paying close attention to the original recipe's quantities.  </p>

 Tonight, I will not have much time to fix the curry's flavor before dinnertime.  Does anyone know what the best way would be to quickly add more flavor into this pre-made curry?  Is it as simple as adding some raw ginger and spices, or is there a better approach?</p>
","<p>Indian curry traditionally has - in addition to the ginger, turmeric, cumin and chili (I assume you mean chili powder) that you used - a generous amount of garam masala, coriander powder, and garlic.</p>

<p>Sometimes you'll see ""curry powder"" used in recipes instead of garam masala; they are similar but not exactly the same.</p>

<p>Either one of these would be fine, and arguably the most important missing ingredient here. I'm not even sure you could legitimately call it a curry without one of the above.</p>

<p>Depending on your spice tolerance, you might need to add more chili powder as well.</p>

<p>Note that most spices in a curry will need to be heated before they'll really release their aromas (and therefore flavour), so you can't just add them cold, and I definitely don't think you'd want the taste of <em>raw</em> garlic/ginger in your curry, even if it is presently tasteless. Give it a good simmer after adding some garlic (powder is fine) and garam masala or curry powder and you <em>might</em> be able to salvage it.</p>

Is there any reason that I can't just add the dry noodles 10 minutes before the soup is done, and add a little extra water or broth to compensate for that the noodles take? Doing it this way would allow the noodles to take up some of the broth's flavor, and also save dirtying an extra pot and a colander.  </p>
","<p>similar to what julio said, the main reason is that typical wheat-based noodles release a lot of starch into the water, which changes the consistency of the soup. the starches can add a dirty colour to the water, but more than that, they can also thicken the soup undesirably (think of making a roux). Finally, if there are leftovers, the noodles can sometimes become completely water logged, making eating it the next day a bit of a soggy experience. </p>

<p>That said, with all these considerations there are times when you might add the noodles directly in-- non-starchy noodles (eg. like rice noodles) seem to do ok. also parboiling regular pasta before hand seems to help a lot with the starch and can still help you achieve the flavour integration you mentioned. </p>

","<p>Butter and cooking oil are <strong>not</strong> interchangeable in every recipe.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Butter actually has water in it, while oil is a pure lipid.  This can cause problems with water-sensitive preparations, for example a choux paste (where the proper ratio of water to flour is extremely important) or anything using melted chocolate (where the water in butter can cause it to seize).</p></li>
<li><p>Butter can also be whipped; oil definitely cannot (except coconut oil).  You normally wouldn't use olive or sunflower oil in, for example, an icing.</p></li>
<li><p>Butter is a solid at room temperature, while oil is a liquid.  When making something that needs to be relatively solid - for example, bread or pie dough or anything requiring a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beurre_mani%C3%A9"">beurre manié</a> - you do not want to substitute butter for oil.  Shortening is a better substitute.</p></li>
<li><p>Butter has a <em>much</em> lower smoke point and will scorch at temperatures that oils are often subjected to.  You have to be very careful when frying anything in butter, and you'll need to watch carefully if baking with butter at very high temperatures.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You have to understand the recipe you are making if you want to know how to do the conversion (or if a conversion is even possible).  If the recipe is fat-dependent, you need to use more butter than oil.  If it is water-dependent, you generally should use <em>less</em> butter.  If it is both, you likely can't do a direct substitution and will have to add or remove something else.  And if the recipe relies on the solid/liquid state of the fat, then you simply cannot substitute.</p>

<p>Muffins just happen to be one of those things where it really doesn't matter much.  Like all quickbreads, you can vary the amount of fat substantially and all it will do is change the texture of the final dish; quickbreads with more fat tend to be richer, more moist, and less dense.  The Joy of Cooking recipe for waffle batter recommends anywhere from 1/4 cup to 1 cup of butter, which is a pretty wide margin of error; in recipes like that, you can usually play fast and loose with the substitutions.</p>

At some point, I'll add some cheese (monterey jack or muenster, no comments on the cheese!).</p>

<p>What I'd like is a bit of meaty flavor, greasy of course, but also crunchy to a degree (but not a lot). Should I pre-oil my pan?</p>

<p>Thanks!

","<p>The way to make a proper griddled hamburger:</p>

<p>Start with beef that is between 70/30 and 80/20.  You need to use a fatty beef because you are going to be doing a few things that will restrict the amount of juice in the burger and the extra fat will mitigate that.</p>

<p>Season your beef and roll into balls less than 1/4 of a pound.  Let the size of your patties be determined by the size of your pan, you need them small enough that once you smash you won't be touching the sides of the pan.</p>

<p>You then want to preheat your pan.  You want your pan to be as hot as possible.  A commercial griddle can range in heat between 375 F and 650 F, so the temp here can vary quite a bit between places, I find hotter aids crust formation and allows the interior stay closer to medium.</p>

<p>Do not use oil.  I can't stress that enough.  Your beef will put out plenty and oil will fry the burger instead of allowing a seared crust to develop.  </p>

<p>Place your balls of meat on the pan and smash them flat with a spatula.  You might need a second spatula to remove the patty from the smashing one, as you lack the space space to heat it like you would on a griddle to prevent sticking.  Allow it to cook about two to three minutes, then flip and top with cheese, if desired.  Two more minutes and remove.</p>

<p>As an added bonus, you can toast/fry some bread in the beef juices to create a patty melt style burger that will be oozing beefy goodness.  You can drop the bread in right after the flip and it will be perfect by the time the patty is done.</p>

","<p>In <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/267/how-to-properly-cook-a-steak"">this thread</a>, Lorenzo notes that steaks may end up raw in the center if you only leave 'em out for 10-15 minutes to come up to temperature. I recommend 30 mins, but it will probably vary on what room temperature actually is for you.</p>

<p>From <em>Weber's Way To Grill</em>, which recommends salting right when you take them out of the fridge, here's Mr. Purviance's take on why you should consider salting early:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's true that salt draws moisture toward itself, but over the course of 20 to 30 minutes that's a good thing, because the salt begins to dissolve into that little bit of moisture. When the steak hits the hot grate... [you] create a delicious crust. Any moisture you might lose is well worth the flavor of that crust.</p>

"How do I make homemade Salsa thicker?","90948","","<p>I have been playing with homemade salsa for a few weeks now and I can't seem to figure out how to get that thicker tomato texture that a lot of southern Mexican restaurants have.</p>

<p>Right now I play with these ingredients:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tomatoes</li>
<li>Onion</li>
<li>Jalapeño</li>
<li>Cilantro</li>
<li>Lime Juice</li>
<li>Garlic Salt/Cumin</li>
</ol>

<p>This seems pretty basic stuff for salsa, but it has a pretty water'd down feel no matter how I swing it. How do I get the tomato base that some of the classic salsa's have in order for everything to hold on the chip a little better?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I really wanted to accept two answers because I like both depending on what I am doing. For a fresh salsa(pico de gallo) straining the juice from the tomatoes seems to work really well. But for the thickness I was going for the key was experimenting with Tomato Paste/Cooking the salsa. I am able to get a much thicker salsa that I enjoy much more. I did learn how to create killer pico de gallo from this though.</p>
","<p>There's a few types of salsa -- salsa fresca (aka pico de gallo, aka salsa cruda), which is ""fresh salsa"" and uncooked, and if made fresh, it shouldn't be too watery (unless you add to much liquid, eg, lime juice), but letting the vegetables sit after salting will start to draw out extra liquid and could become watery.</p>

<p>For truly thick salsa, you have to treat it like a jam, and cook it to release the pectin in the tomato.  (or I guess you could use some other thickeners ... I've never tried.  tomato paste, maybe?)  You don't necessarily have to cook the other ingredients, too, but I personally like roasting the peppers and onions to sweeten then up and remove some of the extra liquid.  (halve the peppers and seed them, lay them on a tray cut side up with the onion cut into wedges, roast 'til they're softened, then dump into a food processor and either pulse or liquify it, depending on how chunky you like it.  And the skin falls off the peppers, so I leave 'em out).</p>

<p>You can do the same roasting with the tomatoes, and it'll be thicker from the food processor, but you won't get the same cling without letting them cook slowly in liquid to develop the pectin.  If you roast the tomatoes, I like to use plum tomatoes, as they have more ""meat"" to the gel around the seeds, and take out the gel and seeds.</p>

","<p>While using a hot oven and keeping the tin hot while filling are both critical elements, equal concern needs to be taken with making sure that your batter is at room temperature.
If the eggs and milk aren't room temp to even slightly warm, then it will take a significant amount of heat to simply warm the batter in the pan before significant steam can build for their expansion.</p>

<p>You can warm eggs quickly by placing the whole egg (in shell) in a bowl and covering with hot water from the tap.  Let it sit for 5-10 minutes and you'll have room temperature/warm egg.  Milk can simply be microwaved to warm only slightly or you'll cook the eggs.</p>

<p>You might also try using bread flour.  Here in the south all-purpose flour has a lower gluten content than most other all-purpose flour in the US and it's also bleached to weaken the gluten content that's there.  I've recommended to guests of mine that have had issues with popovers not rising that they try bread flour and I've heard positive responses following the use of bread flour.    Bread flour will also have a bit more flavor and produce more browning from the additional protein.</p>

<p>If you don't have a steamer insert of any kind, I would imagine you could fashion something out of aluminum foil without much problem.  The most important thing is that you keep the tamales out of the water.  In a pinch, an upside-down colander would work if you have a pot that's large enough to hold it.</p>

<p>Another (very low-tech) option is <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Quick-Homemade-Steamer-Hack/"" rel=""nofollow"">this hack</a>, that basically uses a disposable aluminum pan to create the steamer/upside-down colander part of the rig.

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> as Michael points out in the comments, this seems like it could be a huge mess.  I would recommend getting a disposable pie pan that's just smaller than your pot, poking holes in that, and putting it upside down in the pot like a steamer insert - seems a lot safer and more efficient than a large rectangle on <em>top</em> of the pot!</p>

"When is best to apply sauce on to BBQ chicken?","89762","","<p>I'm cooking a full chicken divided into 8 pieces...</p>

<p>When is the best time to put sauce on chicken cooked on a BBQ?</p>

<p>Is it better to do it after it sits for a while on the BBQ?
Is it better to let it sit in the sauce over night?</p>
","<p>If you let it sit in the sauce overnight then it's no longer a sauce, it's a marinade.</p>

<p>That's fine, but marinating is something you generally do with tough, cheap, and/or dry cuts of meat such as chicken breasts or top rounds (beef).  For a full chicken, especially the wings, drumsticks and thighs, a marinade is entirely unnecessary and in my humble opinion simply dilutes the deliciously moist interior and often makes the whole thing soggy and depressing.</p>

<p>Generally the goal (or at least <em>my</em> goal and that of the majority of restaurants I've been to) for chicken wings or even a traditional roasted whole chicken is a nice crispy, golden-brown, well-seasoned skin with juicy meat on the inside.</p>

<p>You can't get that if you douse it in sauce before grilling it.  The water in the sauce will inhibit the Maillard reaction that causes browning (and crisping), and as Mike points out, the sauce may even burn.  In fact, it almost certainly <em>will</em> burn; most store-bought BBQ sauces only last a few minutes exposed to direct heat.</p>

<p>With that in mind, the best time to sauce a grilled (BBQ) chicken is <em>after</em> it's cooked, or more precisely, when it's <em>nearly</em> cooked.  Go ahead and season it liberally and coat it in butter or oil beforehand, but wait until it is no more than a few minutes away from being done before you sauce it.  You're not trying to cook the sauce, and it takes no more than a few minutes to get the sauce to bind to the skin - i.e. a few coats with 30-60 seconds each to reduce and form a sort of glaze.</p>

<p>This is true for almost <em>any</em> meat and <em>any</em> cooking method as long as you're not marinating - BBQ chicken, fried or convection-baked wings, smoked or oven-braised ribs - you almost always want to sauce it right at the end.  If your technique and ingredients are good then the meat, not the sauce, should be your main attraction.</p>

I have read contradictory advice online on the best way to grill it, the disagreement being whether to grill it 'low and slow' or 'high and fast' to <strong>ensure maximum tenderness</strong> (that is, to preserve whatever tenderness was there and ensure it doesnt become 'tougher').</p>

<p>As a side note, its grass fed beef, and just by throwing a few small pieces on a frying pan last night for a few minutes yielded (surprisingly) relatively tender meat.  </p>
","<p>I know and have read over and over the ""correct"" method of cooking this type of roast is low and slow (meaning for hours on end) not sliced up and on a grill like I did. Its not a traditional steak cut and its not 'supposed to' be treated that way. If you are looking for the <strong>best</strong> way to cook this meat, follow all the advice you find online and in the other answers/suggestions here. However, I chose to go against that advice and slice up a chuck roast, tenderize it and marinate it to see if I could cook it like a steak. My results were that you can, and the results were surprisingly good. Your results will vary on the quality of your cut and how you prepare it, but it CAN be done effectively.</p>

"How do you cook pork chops without drying them out?","88944","","<p>Every time I cook pork chops, they come out dry even though I only cook them to 150 degrees.  I broil them btw, like they said to at the store.  Is there a way to prevent this?</p>
","<p>First, the recommended minimum cooking temperature for pork is 145 so you can cook them a little less than you already are.  Also, keep in mind that meat continues to cook after it is removed from the pan/cooking element.  The residual heat will produce what is known as ""carry over cooking"" which can range from 5-15 degrees, depending on the size of the item and how long it sits.  Pork chops aren't going to continue rising as high as a large roast that has a greater amount of residual heat built up.</p>

<p>Also, it is very difficult to get an accurate reading on temperatures for chops and steaks with a thermometer so it's really best to learn to determine doneness through touch.  For pork you're looking for a medium doneness so touch your middle finger to your thumb.  That will contract the fleshy part between the thumb and index finger on the same hand.  Poke that with the index finger from your other hand.  It should feel somewhat springy with just a little firmness.  That's how your pork (or medium-done steak) should feel when it's ready to be removed.</p>

<p>As for other things you might consider....Brining will pull moisture into the pork so that it's less likely to dry out during the cooking process.  A brine is a mixture of water, sugar, and salt.  Additional flavors may be added but this would be a basic moisturizing brine.  Through osmosis, the liquid is pulled into the cells of the meat.  As the meat cooks it retains it's juiciness due to the fact that salt helps to retain water.  The flavor is enhanced through any seasonings that were also introduced to the brine as they will be carried into the cells of the meat as well.  </p>

<p>Basic Brine:  1 qt. water, 1/2 cup kosher salt, 1/2 cup sugar.  Add the sugar and salt to the water and stir until dissolved.  Submerge meat in brine and refrigerate if brining for an extended period of time.  Plan on about 1 hour per pound of meat.<br>
When you're ready to cook, remove the meat from brine, pat dry and then season as you normally would and rub with a little oil before broiling, grilling, searing, etc.</p>

"When to add fresh basil to a tomato sauce?","88669","","<p>Is it better to add fresh basil to a tomato sauce and then let it cook for say, 10 mins, or wait till the end and add just before serving?</p>
","<p>Fresh herbs should, generally, be added closer to the end of a recipe. Dried herbs should be added fairly early on during the cooking process so that they have time to ""develop"" and more fully release their flavors. Fresh herbs and spices, however, will generally have more subtle flavors, and they are usually best used for seasoning at the very end of the recipe, rather than actual cooking. You can check out more details about how to use different kinds of spices in <a href=""http://www.jesrestaurantequipment.com/jesrestaurantequipmentblog/fresh-vs-dried-spices/"">this article</a>.</p>

<p>For your specific case, I would say to definitely add the basil in at the end—maybe five or ten minutes before the sauce is finished, as you said. It may even be a good idea to remove the pot from your heat source after you have added the basil so that the herbs can infuse their flavor without actually cooking into the sauce. You have to be careful not to cook too much of the flavor out with fresh herbs. If they simmer too long with the rest of the dish the subtle flavors can be easily overpowered by other ingredients.</p>

","<p>I'll weigh in on this one, having extensive cooking experience on both sides of the pond. The terminology is indeed confusing when it comes to tomato products. By tomato sauce they don't mean canned tomato sauce like you get in the states, they actually mean ketchup! As for puree there's two types, one is just what it means, pureed tomatoes in a can, and the other is super-concentrated like what in the US is called tomato paste and comes in a tube. </p>

<p>Given it's this recipe is asking for 250ml of puree they must mean the canned stuff, as adding that much concentrate would be hideous. To replicate UK/AU style tomato puree I'd use a can of tomato sauce with a half mini-can of tomato paste to thicken it up a bit. That still sounds like a bit too much liquid for my taste. </p>

<p>Alternatively you can use my mom's technique and add a can of concentrated tomato soup to the mix, it makes a great meat-loaf! </p>

"Why is my Pizza Dough always too sticky to knead?","88436","","<p>I have tried to make pizza dough by hand a couple of times now but every time after mixing the ingredients the dough is far too sticky to knead, it is more like a batter than dough.  I have watched videos on youtube of people making it and it is nothing like how mine turns out.</p>

<p>The ingredients I am using are:</p>

<ul>
<li>225g Bread Flour </li>
<li>140ml Water</li>
<li>1 tsp Dried Active Yeast</li>
<li>1 tsp salt</li>

"What happens if I use vegetable oil in a cake?","87640","","<p>I want to bake a cake out of baking mix bought at a shop. The mix already contains flour, baking soda, vanillin, other minor components. The manual says I need to add butter.</p>

<p>I'd like to use vegetable oil instead of butter - most likely sunflower seed oil. Is that a good idea? Should I expect any problems? Will the result likely be a decent cake or something to just throw away?</p>
","<p>The major difference between butter and oil is that butter is only 80% oil, with the rest being milk solids and water (<a href=""http://whatscookingamerica.net/Q-A/ButterVsOil.htm"">source</a>).  This means that using oil you will lose some of the water content that your cake should have, possibly resulting in a dryer cake.  On the plus side, cakes made with oil tend to dry out slower than those made with butter.</p>

<p>The other possible different, but one that is unlikely with a mix I'd think, is that it depends on the method of mixing in your fat.  If the butter is to be whipped or creamed while softened this creates a different texture than one you could get with oil or melted butter.  Whipped butter or especially butter creamed with sugar provides a network of air bubbles that act as a raising agent during cooking, and the result is a pound cake like crumb.  If your recipe calls for melted butter, though, this is not a concern - the result is more like a traditional muffin or quick bread crumb.</p>

<p>Finally, a vegetable oil has a fairly neutral taste.  Usually when a vegetable oil is called for, this is desirable.  Butter on the other hand has a more interesting flavor.  Your cake may be a bit bland without it.</p>

I thickened it up with a slurry which helped a bit. I doubt a roux would have any more thickening power. I'm sure there's got to be a better way. Thanks in advance!</p>
","<p>First, start your Thai coconut curry sauce in a separate pot (i.e. the coconut milk and later the seasonings; no meat , no vegetables, etc.). Make sure to shake the can of coconut milk before opening to ensure it is not separated. Add 1/2 the can to the pot. Bring to boil, reduce temperature and allow the mixture to reduce to almost a paste like texture. This will allow the coconut flavors to intensify, and give you a thicker starting point.</p>

<p>The key is to reduce some of your sauce before cooking everything else; if you attempt to reduce your entire sauce with the vegetables, they will overcook because the process takes too long. Once reduced, add the other 1/2 of the coconut mixture. You end up with a very silky, smooth coconut sauce. Afterwards add your curry paste, fish sauce, sugar, Thai basil etc.</p>

"Is soaking beans 24 hours unrefrigerated safe?","86790","","<p>It strikes me as an unsafe food practice to follow Cook's Illustrated's advice for soaking dried beans for 24 hours unrefrigerated.  I've also seen them suggest you soak steel-cut oats unrefrigerated overnight.  </p>

<p>Is there some reason why these practices are okay?  Would there be any harm in refrigerating them, particularly the beans, while soaking?</p>

<p>From Cook's Illustrated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dissolve 3 tablespoons salt in 4 quarts cold water in large bowl or
  container. Add [one pound] beans and soak at room temperature for at least 8 hours
  and up to 24 hours. Drain and rinse well.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>In fact, although the risk is low, the <a href=""http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/soaking-beans-before-cooking"">Penn State Extension</a> does recommend soaking in the refrigerator, or using the quick soak method as opposed to an overnight room temperature soak:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be on the safe side, it would be advisable to use the quick soak method: Bring water and beans to a boil, cover and boil for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 1 hour. Drain and further cook. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, the <a href=""http://www.usdrybeans.com/recipes/recipe-facts/"">US Dry Bean Council</a> recommends (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A 12-hour soak in cold water before cooking helps hydrate the beans and considerably shortens cooking time. Ideally, beans should be put to soak the night before they are to be prepared and be kept in a cool place, <strong>or in the refrigerator, to avoid any fermentation taking place</strong>. Before soaking, wash them several times in cold water and remove any damaged or split beans. Discard any particles floating in the soaking water, such as small insects from the harvest, specks of dirt or other contaminants.</p>

"What causes curdling and how can you prevent it?","85444","","<p>Some sauces are more at risk to curdle than others. What exactly (ingredients, techniques, temperature...) causes this curdling? What can you do to have the curdling risk at minimum?</p>

<p>I'm not asking for ways to fix this, that's already asked <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/4239/what-to-do-when-curdling-occurs"">here</a>.</p>
","<p>In most cases, curdling occurs because proteins in the sauce are denatured and bind up with each other forming clumps.</p>

<p>In cooking, proteins are denatured by excessive heat, acid, salt, or enzymes.</p>

<p>Heat and acid are the usual culprits for me. For example, when making a hollandaise sauce- the egg yolks are slowly cooked to allow them to set. In most recipes the lemon juice is added later. If the sauce is heated too abruptly or too high then the egg proteins will curdle.</p>

<p>To prevent curdling you have a few options-  </p>

<ul>
<li>Don't expose the sauce to as much heat.<br>
Be careful to not overcook egg rich sauces. If possible add the protein rich ingredient later in the process- for example adding yogurt to a sauce just before serving.  </li>
<li>Heat the sauce gently.<br>
Heating too fast will also make proteins denature. Many sauces are cooked in a double boiler- not to keep the sauce from overheating but to ensure that it heats gently.  </li>
<li>Don't expose the proteins to too much salt or acid.<br>
Dropping a couple tablespoons of lemon juice into warm milk is a recipe for paneer not sauce.  </li>
<li>Take out some insurance.<br>
Proteins bind with each other after denaturing when there are a large quantity of similar molecules all together. One solution then is to introduce a lot of dissimilar molecules that will interfere with the protein's ability to bind to itself. Common candidates for this are starch or fat.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is difficult (but not impossible) to curdle the milk protein in cream based sauces with just heat because the high concentration of milk fat gets in the way. This is why reduction sauces can add cream to a very hot liquid and let it reduce. However, adding acid <em>and</em> heat can still be enough to curdle so be careful if your reduction sauce is very acidic.</p>

<p>Many otherwise fragile sauce recipes will call for a little bit of corn starch as an insurance policy. In the related question that you posted- yogurt sauces are particularly susceptible to this because low-fat yogurt is very high in protein and low in fat, and starch.</p>

<p>I hope there is some other way to remove these stains because I am starting to accrue tumeric stained clothing that I can't bleach, as recommended. </p>
","<p>For hard, chemical-resistant surfaces such as marble, bleach or peroxide cleaners will help.  On things like counters, pots and pans, a Magic Eraser will often take off the stain.  Sometimes a harsher abrasive like Comet or Barkeep's Friend will be needed. </p>

<p>Softer or porous materials, including cloth and many plastics often CANNOT BE UNSTAINED.  In my kitchen we treat turmeric like a dangerous chemical -- isolate, contain, and plan ahead to limit exposure.  It's just that destructive. </p>

<p>You might as well tie-dye or bleach white any clothing you get turmeric on; it India it is used as a dye for saris because it will semi-permanently tint cloth.  You can brush off the dry powder harmessly, but when it is moistened and allowed to sit for a moment, the color is pretty much permanent.</p>

<p><strong>Edit: UV+peroxide:</strong> I saw a patent for removing turmeric stains from upholstery using UV light and hydrogen peroxide.  You might try soaking fabrics in peroxide or Oxyclean (which uses peroxide) and leaving then out in the sun. Can't hurt right?</p>

<p><strong>Edit: strategies to manage turmeric without making a mess</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Plan ahead where you'll use it, and which utensils and vessels will hold it, so you don't mess up anything you don't need to.  </li>
<li>Re-use already turmeric-stained items so you don't wreck anything new</li>
<li>Mortars and pestles, tupperware, wooden and soft plastic utensils are a lost cause.  At least the stain is purely cosmetic?</li>
<li>ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS wear an apron. </li>
<li>Keep spilt powder dry (it won't stain) and brush it off with a paper towel into the garbage.  Brushing away promptly keeps you from inadvertently spilling liquid on it, or wiping it with a wet towel during cleanup.  That is, unless you want a neon-green counter and towel?</li>
<li>Whenever you spill something containing turmeric, promptly wipe it off, to reduce staining.</li>
<li>Hard ceramic and porcelain are immune to staining unless the surface is rough. Try to use these for storage.  Glass will stain. Stainless steel is resistant but not immune. </li>

"What is the right use of bake and broil?","84951","","<p>I look inside the oven and realize that when baking the heat comes from below and when broiling the heat comes from the top.</p>

<p>Although there's a intuition which says that the oven is small and so everything should be at the same temperature from the inside I'm sure that as I have two options there's at least one big difference.</p>

<p>What is this difference between them? Why do I bake a cake and not broil it? Which should I use for all kinds of meats? Depends? If I could extend this question to the default temperature of each, why are they different?</p>
","<p>Broiling involves high heat coming from a source very close to the surface of the food. It is appropriate for thin food, or for adding color (via caramelization/Maillard reaction) to already (or mostly) cooked items. I couldn't say what the temperature of the heating element itself is, but the resulting air temperature is usually upwards of 550˚ F (288˚ C).</p>

<p>In baking, although the <em>heating element</em> is usually on one side or the other of the oven,* the idea is that heat is being transferred to the food more or less evenly from all sides. This is part of the reason thorough pre-heating is important -- to make the air in the box all the same temperature before the food goes in. There's no real ""default temperature"" -- you use whatever will produce the desired results in your food.</p>

<p>With lower heat, coming from all sides, baking will allow the interior of a thick piece of food to cook before the exterior has over-cooked. Putting cake batter under a broiler will likely result in a dried-out or burnt top, perhaps a layer of reasonably well-cooked cake, and a raw bottom. The heat simply won't transfer through the cake fast enough to allow the entire thing to cook.</p>

<p>The appropriate technique for meat depends on the size of the meat. Steaks can do very well under a broiler -- the intense heat allows the exterior to brown and become flavorful without the interior over-cooking. A roast cut or a whole bird, on the other hand, would need to be baked (or ""roasted"") so that the interior has time to come to the proper temperature. A very thick chop or steak might be started in the oven, then finished under the broiler to give it color.</p>

<hr>

<p>*Your oven probably has just the one heating element, used for both baking and broiling. There's no reason that an oven couldn't have multiple elements for baking -- and it might produce more even cooking -- but broiling always means heat from above.</p>

<p>Well, unfortunately, my local supermarket (I think the only one in the UK that stocks them) doesn't always have them in stock, so when they do appear on the shelves, I quickly stock-up on them.</p>

<p>Storing them in the fridge, they'll last maybe a week or so before starting to deteriorate.</p>

<p>My question is, can these chili peppers be frozen and, if so, will freezing them have any ""negative"" effects ?</p>

<p>I buy these particular peppers for their heat (and also their great smoky flavour), so I'd hate for either the heat or the flavour to be negatively impacted if they were frozen.</p>
","<p>Yes, they can be, but you'll want to prick each one with a sharp knife once or twice to prevent them from bursting. Once that is done, put them into a small freezer-safe storage bag, remove as much air as possible from the bag, and seal it. They keep reasonably well for about six months without tasting ""burnt,"" but they tend to be a tad mushy upon defrosting.</p>

<p>I always thought the mushiness factor had to do with length of freezing time, but since you asked, I did a bit of research. Apparently, what makes chilies turn to mush actually has to do with how quickly they initially freeze:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The undesirable mushy end product that comes from freezing fruits and vegetables isn't from the act of freezing itself, but from how you freeze. Your ordinary freezer, or even deep freezer, freezes food slowly. Chilies have water in their membranes, and as they slowly freeze, it forms jagged ice crystals that pierce and puncture the membrane, so that when you defrost it, you're left with a leaky and ""tenderized"" result. The solution to this problem is easy … faster freezing. If the water doesn't have time to form jagged ice, you won't have a mushy membrane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.happynews.com/living/cooking/freeze-chilis-storage.htm"">Happy Living</a> (from which I pulled the above quotation) has an article about how to safely use dry ice to freeze chilies quickly. (I'll probably keep going the way I always have and accept the mushiness, but if you want to freeze a lot of chilies for a variety of applications, the dry-ice method looks promising.)</p>

"What is the shelf life for chocolate chips?","83643","","<p>Have some <em>semi-sweet</em> chocolate chips.
They have been in a bag inside a plastic container in a cupboard for 2 years but expiration date on the bag says that's one year too much.</p>

<p>What's the shelf life for different kinds of chocolate chips and what makes them go bad?</p>

<p>Side question, am I okay to eat the ones I have? </p>
","<p><em>True</em> chocolate, made with cocoa butter, especially of the non-milk variety has a very long shelf life when stored in dry, cool conditions.  The fact that the shape is a chip rather than a bar or disc or callet is not really relevant, except for the total surface area on which <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_bloom"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blooming</a> can occur.</p>

<p>Chocolate is very, very dry, which discourages mold, bacteria, or other micro-flora or micro-fauna from growing, not even counting the preserving effect of theobromine and other alkali in the chocolate.  </p>

<p>It also resists rancidity very well.  Stored properly, it can last for many years safely.</p>

<p>Many brands of chocolate chips are not true chocolate, because the manufacturer may have used less expensive fats than cocoa butter, which do not have such excellent storage properties.  Assuming you have a quality chocolate chip made from real chocolate, the issues you may find include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sugar bloom, where the sugar comes to the surface due to moisture dissolving it and then leaving it on the surface when it evaporates</li>
<li>Fat bloom, where the cocoa butter separates out onto the surface for reasons not thoroughly understood</li>
<li>The chocolate can lose its temper from warming and cooling cycles, if it gets too warm; this will change its texture to softer, more gritty, and less pleasant</li>
<li>The cocoa butter could go rancid (which I have never experienced)</li>
</ul>

<p>The first three are aesthetic and cosmetic issues, but the chocolate can still be used in recipes or melted down and re-tempered.</p>

<p>Having it go rancid would be cause to throw it out--but chocolate is very hardy, and resists rancidity--so if it tastes fine, it is still usable.</p>

<p>After two years, you are quite likely to have experienced bloom.  The chips will look like they have a white coating, and may feel gritty.  While this makes it less pleasant to eat out of hand or in applications where it won't be melted down, it will still perform well in recipes where it is melted.</p>

<p>They are certainly <em>safe</em> to eat (again, assuming real chocolate, and no rancidity), but they may not have the same pleasant texture and crispness that you would expect. This is why manufacturer's give them a best by date.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note:  you can tell whether they are real chocolate by the ingredient list (at least in the US, and other places with comparable labeling laws).  Real chocolate will consist of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cocoa solids, cocoa, cocoa mass, cocoa butter, cocoa nib, or chocolate liqueur (all words indicating products of the cocoa bean)</li>
<li>Sugar</li>
<li>Flavoring (such as vanilla or salt)</li>
<li>Perhaps lecithin as an emulsifier</li>
</ul>

<p>Signs that the product is not real chocolate include other ingredients, especially other fats in lieu of cocoa butter (which is comparatively expensive, and marketable to the cosmetics industry).</p>

<hr>

<p>Milk chocolate, which also contains milk solids and milk fat will not last as long, but still probably has a shelf life measured in years when stored under proper (cool, dry) conditions.</p>

<p>White chocolate chips do not have the additional preservative effects of the cocoa solids and their alkali, and also have dairy solids and possibly milk fat, so they have the shortest shelf life of all.  It also tends to pick up off flavors if not in a perfectly sealed, air tight container.  White chocolate, I would not keep more than year or so.</p>

<p>Of course, chips that are made from other ingredients than true chocolate are going to have a shelf life based on their ingredients, but I cannot speak to that, and anyway, in my mind, they are not worth storing.</p>

"Does store-bought Kombucha spoil? If so, how can I tell?","83087","","<p>I recently bought Ginger Kombucha for the first time in a reputable health food store. I'd never heard of it, but my doctor feels the probiotics will help my chronic digestive problem. Because of the strong taste, I only drank a small amount each day. I did this by pouring some out, not by drinking from the bottle. On the fifth day, it smelled and tasted so much like alcohol I was afraid it was rancid. I took it back to the store for advice. One clerk told me it was supposed to smell like that, just to use it for seven days and discard any remainder. Another clerk said it can't spoil, and as long as I keep it refrigerated it will last indefinitely. Can someone with experience please help me? It's expensive, so I don't want to throw it away if I don't have to, however I don't want to poison myself or use something that's no longer effective. Thank you!</p>
","<p>When they say ""probiotic"", what they mean is that there are microbe cultures present in the kombucha.  It's really nothing more than a sweetened tea which has been <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha#Chemical_and_biological_properties"" rel=""nofollow"">fermented by a symbiotic mix of yeast and bacteria</a>.  The odor and distinctive flavor is the result of a low alcohol content and acetic acid (the same acid found in vinegar) produced by the fermentation process.</p>

<p>While these cultures do tend to edge out other bacteria that would spoil the drink and potentially cause illness, it can eventually go bad like anything else.  More to the point, because the cultures are still alive, they'll continue the fermentation process as long as they can, especially once you open the container and start introducing oxygen.  This can throw off the balance of the culture, but it can also just make the kombucha unpleasantly acidic.  Once it gets to that point, it might still be effective from a probiotic stance, but the acid could have an adverse effect on your digestion.</p>

<p>If you keep it sealed and refrigerated, it'll last a couple weeks, but a week or so is probably the effective maximum when you're opening the container frequently. You'll want to stick to purchasing an amount that you can drink within a week or so, but don't worry overmuch if it has a slightly vinegary tang and odor.</p>

"Baking cakes in the Microwave ovens as compared to Electric ovens","82960","","<p>Is there a difference in the output or in the procedure when baking cakes in the Microwave ovens as compared to Electric ovens?</p>

<p>What are the basic and crucial differences found among cakes baked in the above mentioned different equipments?</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Question:</em> If we run the microwave (which has a convection feature) on <strong>""grill and convection""</strong> mode only, does it become same as rectangular ""<a href=""http://www.bajajelectricals.com/Oven-Toaster-Grillers-c-66.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Electric ovens</a>""? Please explain why and how too.</p>
","<p>Yes, there is a difference. You shouldn't be baking a cake (or anything else) in a microwave oven. </p>

<p>A microwave oven excites the water within your food. When you put in dough or batter, the excited water doesn't bind with the starch the way it does under normal heat, it escapes the starch, leaving you with a stone-hard piece of dough or batter. </p>

<p>There is something called ""five-minutes microwave cake"". I haven't tried it, but in the recipes floating around the interwebs it gets eaten while still hot (so probably before it has had the chance to get too hard). It also seems that there is a very small heat frame in which it gets OK. Bake it too much, and it will get hard, or burn. Bake it too little, and you end up with a mug of warm batter. It is also supposed to be a cupcake, I suspect that if you try to bake a bigger portion at once, there will be enough temperature difference in different zones of the batter to get underbaked, baked and hard portions all at once. </p>

<p>Bottom line: if you want to try for the fun of it, make a cupcake in the microwave, and watch your energy input (microwave watt setting and time) very closely, then eat immediately. You can find recipes all over the Web, e. g. <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/5-minute-Chocolate-Cake/step4/Eat-it/"" rel=""noreferrer"">on Instructables</a>. If you want a real cake, don't bake in a microwave. </p>

"How to convert a recipe calling for active dry yeast into rapid rise yeast?","82396","","<p>I have a recipe for rolls where the first stage calls for 2 packages active dry yeast, 1 tbsp sugar, and 1/2 cup warm water to be mixed until the yeast is proofed, and then 1/4 cup cubed butter is added to the proofed yeast.  Then all of that is added to half of the flour (2 cups) and 2 tsp salt and allowed to do the first rise.  </p>

<p>If I wanted to use rapid rise yeast instead of active dry, could I skip the proofing step?  Would I need to add the butter at all?  Could I just mix all the dry ingredients, add the warm water and start the dough that way?  What effect would this change have?</p>
","<p>First off, it's good to understand the difference between active dry yeast and rapid rise yeast.  Active dry yeast is a larger granule of yeast in which the outer shell is composed of mostly dead cells entombing the dormant nougaty goodness inside.  It has to be proofed to seperate out all the cells and rehydrate the interior active cells.</p>

<p>Rapid rise yeast is a typically a combination of 2 different strains of yeast (so those with a very discerning palate might be able to tell the difference, I've never really tried).  The granules of yeast are smaller and dried slower to preserve more yeast cells. Ascorbic acid is also added to push the yeast into overdrive a little faster.  </p>

<p>A great video that helped me a lot is <a href=""http://how2heroes.com/videos/dessert-and-baked-goods/yeast-101"" rel=""nofollow"">http://how2heroes.com/videos/dessert-and-baked-goods/yeast-101</a>  I have noticed before issues with Rapid Rise yeast not proofing very well the second time around.  Apparently it's designed to give you one really good proof and then die out (play hard and die young).  Instant yeast however is Rapid Rise yeast without the hardcore party attitude.  It's what they use at the King Arthur bakery test kitchen, so that's good enough for me!  They say to use them interchangeably, but many other sites I see show a difference of about 20%.</p>

"When is a cooking oil not appropriate to substitute for another?","82129","","<p>Frequently recipes call for a particular kind of oil for making use of certain characteristics (taste, heat tolerance, health, etc.). It's well known you can substitute cooking oils in most cases (vegetable oil for canola oil).</p>

<p>Are there circumstances in which it is <em>not</em> appropriate to substitute cooking oils?</p>
","<p>Actually, there are really only a few oils you <em>can</em> substitute for each other, at least without any significant side effects.</p>

<p>The oils which generally <em>are</em> used interchangeably are peanut oil, canola/rapeseed oil, and sunflower oil.  These oils have similar smoke points, don't impart any really noticeable flavour, and tend to be used primarily for high-heat cooking (pan-frying, deep-frying), so if you're paranoid about saturated fat for instance, you can substitute sunflower oil for peanut oil.  Corn oil is in the same group, but I rarely see that used anymore.  You can also use the ""light"" olive oil, but that <em>will</em> change the flavour of the dish.  I <em>believe</em> walnut oil has similar properties, but it's considerably harder to find.</p>

<p>But keep in mind that oils are used for far more than frying.  Many have highly-specialized uses:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Extra virgin olive oil is most commonly used in sauces and salad dressings (""oil and vinegar"" almost always means olive oil, there really is no substitute);</p></li>
<li><p>Chili oil is really more of a condiment than a cooking oil.  Even if you could cook with it, the result would be inedible due to the heat.</p></li>
<li><p>Toasted sesame oil is used as a flavourings in Asian dishes.  It's useless as a cooking oil (and cooking with it would be a terrible waste).  <em>Regular</em> sesame oil, on the other hand, is often bought in a refined form and <strong>is</strong> generally used as a cooking oil.</p></li>
<li><p>There are a lot of other more esoteric types of oil such as palm oil and coconut oil, which you really don't want to use unless you know what you're doing (you can ruin the flavour).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I could go on, but for now I'll refer you to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_oil#Types_of_oils_and_their_characteristics"">Types of oils and their characteristics</a> as a starting point.  Cooking oils really <strong>aren't</strong> freely interchangeable in all situations; even if you've accounted for smoke point and flavour, sometimes a significantly different fat content (i.e. grapeseed oil which is mostly polyunsaturated vs. canola oil which is mostly monounsaturated) can seriously mess up a delicate recipe.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tamari is a premium soy sauce made with more soybeans than ordinary soy sauce giving it a richer, smoother, more complex taste. Tamari has more flavor enhancing properties than salt. Add 1 tsp. (320 mg sodium) instead of tsp. salt (590 mg sodium) to reduce sodium intake. Stir-fry or marinate poultry, meat fish and vegetables. Add 1-2 tsp. to perk up sauces, soups, gravies and casseroles.</p>

<p>I reach for the tamari when I want a bit more of a complex flavor on something plain like rice - when the soy sauce is to be the star of the dish, essentially.  I tend to use regular soy sauce when mixing into a larger homemade sauce or where the soy sauce flavor will blend into the background because the recipe calls for so many other strong ingredients.  </p>

<p>I've made some fresh spring rolls by filling rice paper sheets with vegetables, cheese and peanuts, without any cooking. I've kept the uneaten ones in the fridge for a night in a sealed box. The rice paper has lost its flexibility and moisture.</p>

<p>Is there a recommended way to store fresh spring rolls in a fridge for a few days, without losing the moisture of the rice paper?</p>
","<p>In its recipe for Spring Rolls, <a href=""http://whatscookingamerica.net/Appetizers/SpringRolls.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">What's Cooking America</a> indicates:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Spring rolls can be made a day ahead. Cover them with a damp paper
  towel, then wrap well in plastic wrap, and refrigerate. Refrigerating
  firms and toughens the wrappers and noodles [<em>inside the roll, in this recipe</em>] slightly (if they are a
  little dry, wipe them gently with a damp cloth).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the future, consider that you might not want to make the rolls until you are ready to eat them.  Your filling ingredients will probably hold quite well on their own, and hydrating the wrappers to make the rolls is very fast and easy.</p>

"Is it safe to use plastic wrap in boiling water?","80244","","<p>While I've come across one or two recipes that call for using plastic wrap in pots of boiling water (for example, to <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/3871/how-can-i-rescue-a-soft-boiled-egg-that-is-too-soft"">cook eggs</a>), I've always been a bit wary of putting the wrap in boiling water. Can someone confirm or deny whether it is safe (or a good idea) to put plastic wrap in boiling water?</p>
","<p>Official:</p>

<p>No definitive answer, there are different governing bodies and plastic wraps (cling films) in the US/Europe.  There are also different plastic wraps for different purposes, microwave safe, safe for use with fatty foods, so on.  Whether its safe or not will depend on the product used and most likely the time boiled for.  The UKs Food Standard Agency <a href=""http://www.food.gov.uk/foodlabelling/packagingbranch/clingfilm/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">says no</a> - ""Do not use cling films where they may melt into the food, such as in conventional ovens or with pots and pans on cooker hobs"".  The cling film industry are understandably much more positive.</p>

<p>Practical:</p>

<p>I've poached eggs using cling film for ages and I'm still here.  Read the plastic wrap boxes for warnings and choose the plastic wrap that's most suited.  Poach an egg as described <a href=""http://www.aidanbrooks.blogspot.com/2007/05/gamekeeper-turned-poacher.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> (as of 2016, link requires registration to read) and check if the wrap comes away cleanly, If so you're good.  I'd revisit this advice if your recipe called for cooking like this for longer than 5-10 minutes, there are likely more suitable products/recipes for extensive boil-in-the-bag manoeuvres.</p>

"What happens when you mix whiskey and water?","80241","","<p>It is sometimes said that to best experience the flavor and aroma of a good whiskey (or whisky), one ought to add a bit of water. This practice is said to release flavors somehow.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there any truth to this?</li>
<li>Assuming that there is, what is going on? </li>
</ol>
","<p>Whisk(e)y has some crazy chemistry going on inside of it, due to the complex interactions between water, alcohols, oils, esters and other compounds of various complexity. The profile of these chemicals will vary between different whiskey/whisky styles, but the overall chemistry is similar.</p>

<h2>Simple effects of dilution</h2>

<p>Adding water, or serving on the rocks, has a number of simple effects, such as diluting the ethanol a bit (ethanol anesthetizes your taste buds a bit), and cooling it (making your taste buds slightly less sensitive to certain flavors), but the fascinating part is what happens to the oily flavor compounds during dilution.</p>

<h2>Dilution masks some flavor compounds</h2>

<p>Oily hydrocarbons are somewhat soluble in high-proof whiskey. There are long-chain esters and short-chain esters of many varieties. As you add water, the whiskey becomes more polar, and the long-chain esters become supersaturated and start to precipitate in the form of micelles, microscopic ""droplets"" of esters that have clumped together. In some liquors like absinthe or ouzo, these droplets can get so large that they become visible, and visibly cloud the drink (an intended feature of absinthe preparation). In whiskey, these droplets are usually microscopic and don't visibly cloud the drink, because most of the oils have been removed during <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_whisky#Chill_filtration"">chill-filtration</a>.</p>

<p>However, these droplets do something important, in that short-chain esters, being more soluble in the droplet than they are in the diluted whiskey, enter the droplet and become trapped inside. These compounds are now less available for tasting or smelling. Fortunately, these compounds are the oily, grassy compounds that many people do not like in their whiskey, and masking them is considered an improvement.</p>

<h2>Dilution releases other flavor compounds</h2>

<p>There is another type of micelle ""droplet"" that forms in whiskey. Ethanol, in high concentrations in water, forms it's own clusters, as ethanol molecules gather up with one another. Interestingly, warmer solutions cause more clustering of ethanol molecules, as do higher concentrations. Like before, these micelles trap compounds that are more soluble in ethanol than they are in water, volatile flavor compounds. However, unlike the oil droplets, these flavor compounds are desirable. Cooling the solution and diluting the solution both serve to ""pop"" these ethanol micelles, allowing them to release their trapped compounds for aroma and flavor.</p>

<p>So cooling and adding water can have the effect of both masking certain flavors by forcing them out of solution, and enhancing others by promoting their release back into solution. In the end, the result of the changed flavors is a matter of taste, which is why some people prefer neat, with water, or on the rocks, but one cannot deny that real chemical changes are in play.</p>

"Shiny side or not for foil?","80189","","<p>Does it make any difference when you wrap food with aluminum foil for grilling or baking or making a steam pouch whether you put the shiny side in or the shiny side out?</p>

<p>I've seen at least one answer to a questiong about grilling that made mention of this.</p>
","<p>I've been told that the shiny side should go on the inside for cooking, and the outside for freezing.  In other words, do you want to reflect the heat into the food, or away from the food?</p>

<p>However, common sense (which fails very often) tells me that with the temperature ranges involved, any benefit is marginal, if it exists at all.  </p>

<p>The only time it might matter, is if you were trying to warm something up in the sun.  Then it might make a difference.</p>

<p>EDIT:  From The Straight Dope:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The truth is that the shiny side is
  not treated with a dangerous chemical.
  Mineral oil is used as a lubricant
  during the rolling process, some trace
  of which may remain on the finished
  foil--but it's not dangerous. The
  shiny side is shiny because of the way
  foil is made. During the last pass
  through the rolling mill, a double
  thickness of foil is run between the
  rollers. The side of each sheet that
  comes in contact with the polished
  steel rollers comes out shiny. The
  other side has a matte finish.</p>

"What are the advantages of a Santoku over a French Chef's Knife?","79213","","<p>When it comes to general cooking knives the santoku and french chef's are generally the ones most often mentioned. Is the style of use very different? The only real difference I'm aware of is that you can use a ""rocking"" motion with the french chef's but not with the santoku. What is the difference between them and when would you use a santoku over a french chef's assuming quality between both was on par?</p>
","<p>Both the Santoku and French knives will work for the same types of things, so a lot of it comes down to preference. Santoku knives are lighter, so this can lead to less hand strain and quicker cutting. One thing that the Santoku are very good at is very thin slicing of vegetables, for two reasons: first, as you point out, you do not use a rocking motion, but rather chop down in one motion, which with practice can be quicker and more efficient. Second, Santoku knives usually have a much thinner blade angle (around 15 degrees vs 30-40 degrees on a French knife). This is because one side of a Santoku is flat, and the other side is beveled (like a chisel), so you only sharpen one side. To accommodate this thin blade the Santoku knives will be made with a harder steel, which helps maintain blade sharpness, but may increase the propensity for chipping if misused, and also makes them harder to sharpen. </p>

<p>Still, personal preference dictates which knife to use. Many people prefer the Gyuto style of knife, which (roughly speaking) combines features of both Santoku knifes and French knives. They are made of a hardened steel, are sharpened on both sides, but maintain edges around 22-26 degrees. The Gyutos, like the Santokus are fairly light. Gyutos also have a rounded belly but it is less pronounced than on a French knife. </p>

<p>There is much more to be said, but basically the thing to do is get your hands on some knives and start experimenting--see what you like!</p>

"Fan bake vs bake","78901","","<p>Are there any general rules to follow when choosing between bake and fan bake to cook something in the oven? What effect does each have and what are the advantages and disadvantages of both?</p>
","<p>To clarify: forced-air (a/k/a ""convection"", a/k/a ""fan bake"") ovens rely on a fan to circulate the air in the oven.  The fast-moving air substantially enhances the rate at which heat is transferred to the food.  It is particularly good where you want the surface to brown, such as roasts and breads; it is not as good for more delicate items, such as custards and cakes, which can set too quickly or get dried out.  For cookies, it depends on what effect you want, but many standard types do well in forced-air ovens because the fan helps ensure that the whole oven stays at a uniform temperature despite the presence of several trays.  (Of course, the tray closest to the heating element will still cook faster than the one farthest away, so you will still have to swap them partway through.)</p>

<p>The general rule for using the fan is to set the oven temperature 25 degrees F (15 C) lower than what the recipe calls for using in a regular oven.  Even then, don't go strictly by cooking time, as ovens vary; rather, be sure to check on your food regularly to see how fast it is cooking.  You may need to cover your food to prevent over-browning, or perhaps adjust the oven temperature.</p>

"Why can't I use toaster oven instead of real oven?","78606","","<p>My toaster oven has a temperature gauge just like my oven 200-450 degrees. I opened a package of fish sticks and the instructions said ""Do not cook in microwave or toaster oven."" It only had instructions for cooking them in a regular oven. Do you have any idea why a toaster oven that can be put at the same temperature would not be good to use?</p>
","<p>Possible reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Horrible temperature control - this is simply a problem of cheap
construction.  One could theoretically build an excellent toaster
oven with precise temperature control, but why would you? </li>
<li>Low
thermal mass -  If you get an oven to 400F and open it for long
enough to put in food, the result is an oven at very slightly less
than 400F, and which will quickly return to 400F.  Do that with a
toaster oven, and who knows what temperature you'll get, or how
quickly it will get to your desired temperature (if ever, see #1). 
This is not a slam at toaster ovens, this is just due to them being
approximately 2% of the volume of a standard oven.   </li>
<li>Closeness to
elements.  It's easy for toaster ovens interiors to vary by nearly
50F from middle to edge, simply based on distance to elements</li>
</ul>

<p>Now don't get me wrong, I once made some kickin' Oysters Rockefeller in a toaster oven, when I thought that they would be the difference between serving an appetizer and being allowed to serve breakfast the next morning (wink, wink).  If you know what you're doing, and watch carefully and continually, a toaster oven can be an excellent source of high(ish) direct heat.  But they are extremely difficult to control, and <em>extremely</em> unforgiving of errors.  I can't think of a circumstance where a toaster oven would be my first choice of cooking tool (and that includes microwave, campfire, plumber's blowtorch).</p>

"How much tea is ideal out of one tea bag?","78457","","<p>My mother regularly uses 1 tea bag for two cups or 2 tea bags for a teapot. I've read on several sites that one tea bag is ideal for one cup.</p>

<p>So, how much should I get from a tea bag?</p>

<p>Also, is the steeping time different if I was trying to get more tea out of the same tea bag? Some say that steeping it longer gets more flavour out of the bag. Somewhat more formal research suggests that releases the bitter parts and makes the tea bitter rather than thicker.</p>

<p>I know you shouldn't reuse coffee beans when making an espresso, but does this apply to tea as well?</p>
","<p>After looking into this much longer than a sane person should have, I've realized that the strength of the tea doesn't depend so much on the quantity of tea. Controlling the strength of tea is normally done by controlling the <strong>steeping time</strong>. As stated by paul, the best way to dilute the strength of a tea is by resteeping it.</p>

<p>The steeping time of a tea is most determined by the coarseness of the tea leaves. Similar to garlic, finer leaves make the taste a lot stronger, whereas large, coarse leaves will be weaker. The instructions on the bag often say what's been tried and tested.</p>

<p>Quite often, <strong>one tea bag</strong> can make quite a lot of tea, <strong>enough for a teapot</strong>. I'd recommend going for two tea bags only if you're planning to go for larger than a teapot, for tea suited to drinking by itself and with added ice, or with certain weaker teas.</p>

<p>For black tea, the common steeping seems to be 2-3 minutes. There's little harm in steeping too short, but steeping too long will create a harsh bitter taste (though some people may actually want that). For cheap, harsh, unbranded teas, 3 minutes seems to be enough unless the leaves are finely chopped.</p>

<p>Also, as bonus knowledge, steeping tea for 45 seconds then throwing away the water and resteeping it is a great way to decaffeinate tea. Don't shake the tea bag or stir the drink while steeping it, because it will cause the harsh stuff to enter water faster, and black tea should be steeped at 98 degrees C.</p>

"Can I Brown Beef For Slow Cooking the Night Before","78369","","<p>Many slow cooker recipes suggest that beef be browned before being added to the slow cooker, which is definitely better for the flavor of the dish.  I've always believed that this browning must occur just before adding to the slow cooker for food safety reasons, and <a href=""http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/Beef_from_Farm_to_Table/index.asp"">this article</a> from the USDA backs me up.</p>

<p>Yesterday in an online chat, one of the writers for the food section of a national newspaper said <a href=""http://live.washingtonpost.com/free-range-0922.html#question-73"">it is safe</a> to brown beef the night before.</p>

<p>I know that the USDA is often extra cautious and provides the strictest possible guidelines to ensure food safety.  Are they being overcautious on pre-browning, or should I skip what the food writer said and trust my original gut and the USDA?</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em>: My slow cooker recipes are usually for larger cuts of beef, not ground, and so browning will not cook them through.</p>
","<p>I assume that the section of the USDA article you're referring to is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Partial Cooking</strong><br>
  Never brown or partially cook beef to refrigerate and finish cooking later because any bacteria present wouldn't have been destroyed. It is safe to partially pre-cook or microwave beef immediately before transferring it to the hot grill to finish cooking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before I go on, I should point out that the USDA obviously has much greater expertise than I do when it comes to food safety.  Nevertheless, I find this recommendation to be <em>extremely bizarre</em> bordering on silly.</p>

<p>For full cuts of beef (not ground beef), <em>bacteria should only be present on the surface.</em>  That is why most people - or at least most people I know - choose to eat their steaks rare, or at most medium rare.  The ""interior"" is <em>not fully cooked</em>, nor is it supposed to be.</p>

<p>Searing the beef will kill any surface bacteria almost immediately.  That is why rare steak is (relatively) safe to eat.  As far as I am concerned, once the beef has been browned, <strong>it is already cooked sufficiently</strong>.  The only reason to add it to a slow cooker later would be to tenderize it or even out the cooking.</p>

<p>If the USDA expresses concern over refrigerating beef that has basically been cooked sufficiently, it must be because they believe that browning/searing kills <em>enough</em> of the bacteria to make it safe for direct consumption, but not <em>all</em> of the bacteria - such that they could multiply again and contaminate the food over a long period of time.</p>

<p>But refrigerating immediately after browning should prevent that.  No part of the beef will be in the ""danger zone"" for longer than 45 minutes or so, and even if you did miss <em>some</em> of the bacteria during the browning <em>and</em> they manage to multiply overnight, you're still tossing them into a slow cooker and that's going to kill any remaining bacteria.</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm missing something obvious, but from what I can tell, any health risks associated with browning a large cut of beef and subsequently refrigerating it for a relatively small period of time would have to be infinitesimally small.  It's not something that I would concern myself with.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I did just think of one other possible reason for the USDA warning.  The key phrase is ""partially cook.""  If the browning is being done as a means for shortening the subsequent cooking time (i.e. slow cooking for 6 hours instead of 12), <em>then</em> you might have a problem.  Because if you don't manage to kill all the bacteria, then the total required subsequent cooking time is going to creep back up as they multiply; that means your 6 hours in the slow cooker that might have been enough if you had seared the beef immediately before, are no longer enough to guarantee safe consumption.</p>

<p>So I am adding a caveat to my original answer: It is probably safe to refrigerate the browned beef, but <strong>you should calculate your cooking time as though you had never browned it.</strong>  If you are concerned about safety (and I maintain the risks are minuscule), then treat the browned/refrigerated beef as uncooked meat.  If you do that, I cannot see any reason why this wouldn't be safe.</p>

"What is the difference between green, white and black tea?","78366","","<p>What is the difference between green, white and black tea? Are all based on original tea leaves?</p>
","<p>White, green, oolong, and black tea are all products of Camellia sinensis leaves and buds, the only difference is how they are processed.  You can turn the plant matter into any of the varieties.  Different sources will give different accounts of the processing steps, but in rough order of least-to-most processed:</p>

<p><strong>White tea</strong> is minimally processed and not oxidized, meaning it retains the natural antioxidants, but does not develop as much flavor, color, or caffeine.  Sweet or flowery flavors are characteristic.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AFlFfm.jpg"" alt=""Silver Needle White Tea""> (Chinese Silver needle white tea)</p>

<p><strong>Green tea</strong> has a minimal amount of oxidation, halted by additional pan-frying (Chinese teas) or steaming (Japanese) steps.  The additional processing brings out more flavor, and allows for caffeine to develop, at the cost of a reduction in antioxidants.  Characteristic flavors are grassy, vegetal, and earthy, with sweet notes. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UCRUgm.jpg"" alt=""Japanese Sencha""> (Japanese Sencha)</p>

<p><strong>Oolong tea</strong> gets partial fermentation, and often an additional shaking/bruising step that release additional flavors.  Oolong can range in color from dark green to black. The combination of bruising and partial fermentation give many oolongs distinct flowery &amp; earthy flavors.  Darker oolongs may have buttery or smoky tastes to them.  It has somewhat more caffeine and less antioxidants than green tea. </p>

<p><strong>Tieguanyin or Iron Goddess:</strong> (light oolong)<br>

<p>Black Oolong: (Wu Yi)<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SyMktm.jpg"" alt=""Wu Yi Black Oolong""></p>

<p><strong>Black tea</strong> is fully fermented, which blackens the leaves and causes the formation of caffeine and tannins. It generally possesses the most robust flavor and highest level of caffeine, but the least antioxidants. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/s0SSmm.jpg"" alt=""Keemun""> (Chinese keemun)</p>

<p><strong>Pu-erh</strong> is tea that is pressed into cakes and post-fermented, meaning that after processing and drying it undergoes an additional ripening/fermentation. Microorganisms work on the tea, changing it chemically in a similar fashion to aging cheeses.  Traditionally this is accomplished over years in controlled climate conditions (10-15 years being ideal), but in recent decades a several-month fast ripening process is sometimes used. </p>

<p>Pu-erh develops a richer, more complex flavor, and has the widest range of flavors of any of the varieties. Before post-fermentation, it may resemble a white, green, or oolong tea, but the ripening process can impart darker black-tea flavors, giving a unique character.</p>

<p>Pu-er Cake<br>

<p><strong>Rooibos,</strong> sometimes called red tea, is made from another plant entirely, <em>Aspalathus linearis</em>.  It is a traditional South African infusion, prepared like a black tea but without caffeine. There are two varieties, green and red.  Green is un-oxidized, where red is oxidized.  Rooibos is characterized by a sweet, woody/malty flavor.  Health-wise, it is a source of anti-oxidants, may aid in digestion, and some say it may aid with nervous tension and allergies. </p>

<p><strong>Yerba mate</strong> is from the South American plant <em>Ilex paraguariensis</em>, whose leaves are steeped like tea.  It is generally toasted in processing, and produces a brew with caffeine similar to coffee.  Despite its caffeine, mate is actually relaxing to smooth muscles, so you don't get jitters, and it also helps control appetite. The flavor is vegetal and herbal, and can be bitter if brewed hot. Although it contains antioxidants, this is balanced by traces of carcinogens from the toasting, and the jury is still out on whether mate overall increases or decreases cancer rates. </p>

<p><strong>Tisanes or herbal infusions</strong> these are various blends of dried herbs, fruits, spices, and flowers which are steeped like teas, but do not contain tea leaves.  Generally, the ingredients are dried, although fresh ingredients can be used too.  To confuse matters further, black and green teas may also have flavorings added to them, giving a similar result.</p>

<p>For cooking techniques where you drop ingredients in simmering or boiling water - such as for vegetables, pasta, many rice recipes - I have often seen the recommendation that you start by putting <em><strong>cold</strong></em> water into a pot, then bring it to a boil. Why would you not start with hot water from the tap? It's going to be quicker than heating cold water, and your water heater is going to be way more energy efficient than your stove top at heating the stuff.</p>

<p>In particular, is there any physical or chemical process that starting from cold water encourages or prevents from happening?</p>

<p><em>(To reiterate: in the case where you add stuff to cold water and then start heating it, there clearly is a difference with starting with hot water; this question is about the case where you drop your ingredients in pure water that's already boiling.)</em></p>

"Can coconut cream be transformed into coconut milk, or vice versa?","77267","","<p>Can coconut cream be transformed into coconut milk, or the other way around? For example, will adding water or cow milk to coconut cream make a usable coconut milk? Or by reducing coconut milk, can I get coconut cream?</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer: you can let coconut milk separate and skim it to get a little coconut cream, but can't convert coconut cream back to coconut milk.</strong>  Diluting the cream just produces something runny and disgusting. </p>

<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> Coconut milk is made by grating coconut and running very hot water through it to extract oils and flavor, then straining out the coconut pieces.  It is a mix of water soluble parts and fats, and can emulsify just like normal milk or thicken sauces similarly to milk cream.</p>

<p>If you allow coconut milk to sit, the fatty part will rise to the top.  This part is skimmed off to make coconut cream, which is much richer in fats.  It cooks very differently because of the higher fat content, and does not emulsify or thicken well; however it is quite delicious!</p>

<p><strong>If you're looking to substitute for coconut milk, but only have coconut cream, the best substitution will probably be a little coconut cream + a lot of heavy (milk) cream.</strong>  </p>

","<p>I can give you the Italian answer - first of all, normally we don't use tomato paste to make sauce, but rather to add a tomato ""kick"" to recipes. Tomato paste is simply tomato puree that has been cooked down to a high degree of concentration. </p>

  and salt concentrates (mastitis) results in a positive test.</p>
  
  <h3>Procedure:</h3>
  
  <p>The test is done by mixing equal amounts of milk and 68% of ethanol solution in a small bottle or test tube. (68 % Ethanol
  solution is prepared from 68 mls 96%(absolute) alcohol and 23 mls
  distilled water). If the tested milk is of good quality, there will be
  no coagulation, clotting or precipitation, but it is necessary to look
  for small lumps. The first clotting due to acid development can first
  be seen at 0.21-0.23% Lactic acid. For routine testing 2 mls milk is
  mixed with 2 mls 68% alcohol.</p>

"What's the best way to season a cast iron skillet?","76466","","<p>I just purchased a new cast iron skillet. What's the best way to season it? </p>

<p>And if I need to re-season an old pan, is the process any different?</p>
","<p>First, there is no difference between seasoning and reseasoning, unless you need to do some extra work to remove <b>rust</b> (see instructions below). In fact, for new cast iron, scouring is also usually a good idea since you need to get off whatever wax or protective oil the manufacturer or seller may have put onto the cookware. (They don't use cooking oil for that sort of thing, believe me.)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you need to remove rust: use a mixture of salt and oil and scrub that hard into the rust, then rinse thoroughly in hot water. Use steel wool if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, scour the pan completely under hot water. Do this for several minutes or until the water runs clean. I've heard varying things about whether soap or an SOS pad is OK at this step. My personal opinion is that it's OK, but you <em>must</em> wash the soap completely off before continuing with the seasoning so that your seasoning doesn't taste like soap!</p></li>
<li><p>Coat the cookware with grease or oil. (I do this with the whole pan, not just the cooking surface, to reduce the possibility of external rust.) Crisco, vegetable oil, and lard all work well. Don't pick something with a low smoking point, or too strong a flavor. Make sure it's a light coating... you shouldn't have pools of oil anywhere on your cookware.</p></li>
<li><p>Bake your skillet in a 250-350°F oven for an hour. If you used liquid oil, you may want to put the cookware in upside down so excess oil drips off. But it's good to put a cookie sheet or something underneath the cookware to catch the drips if you do!</p></li>
<li><p>Let the cookware cool, and wipe off any excess oil.</p></li>
<li><p>For best results, do this two or three times, though a skillet can be satisfactory after a single treatment.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To keep the seasoning happy:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Don't let the cast iron sit too long without using it (you may notice a rancid smell or flavor if the seasoning turns bad; I'm not sure at what point this happens, but it's happened to me before).</p></li>
<li><p>Don't cook anything acidic (e.g. tomatoes) during the first or second use of your pan.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't use dishwashing liquid or soap on the pan (hot water and scrubbing only).</p></li>
<li><p>After cleaning the pan after each use, wipe it lightly with another bit of oil, using simple vegetable oil.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Another trick sometimes used to season Chinese woks: rub <b>Chinese chives</b> over the surface of the cookware when the oil is being heated (this works best on a stovetop, not in the oven). The juice of the chive has sulfur compounds that help remove remaining flavor from the previous coating of the cookware. Be aware that this technique really kicks up a <em>lot</em> of steam and smoke. I've never tried it on cast iron skillets, but I'd be curious if anyone out there has.</p>

"How do you reduce a cream sauce?","76411","","<p>My wife made a cream based sauce last night and the recipe said to ""reduce"" it.
The cream sauce was comprised of some white wine, couple cups of heavy cream and chicken broth (my wife substituted water for the broth)</p>

<p>I looked up how to reduce a sauce, and it basically said to heat it up til most of the liquid evaporates and the sauce gets thicker.  Makes sense, but the website I was on said that the liquid should simmer on low heat while reducing.  I was doing this but it was taking forever and was still very thin (~30 minutes).  I cranked up the heat to high and that sped things up, but I'm wondering what the proper way to do it is.</p>

<p>Should she not have added water?  Was there something else we missed? Or does it really take that long to reduce a cream sauce?</p>
","<p>The simple answer is: You reduce a cream sauce the same way you reduce any other sauce, by simmering it until a certain amount of liquid is gone, just like the instructions said.  You have to be careful about temperature though, because milk (or cream) can burn at high temperatures, and then your sauce is ruined.  You should keep it to a low or at most medium simmer.</p>

<p>Cream sauces normally tend to thicken extremely fast, so the long cooking time is almost certainly due to watering it down.  I don't think the water was necessary at all; the chicken broth was probably for flavouring, and although ""broth"" is a somewhat nebulous term, one would normally expect a broth to contain at least some amount of gelatin, which will cause the sauce to thicken substantially when it cools if you reduce it a lot.  Water doesn't, so you've added no flavour <em>and</em> thinned out the sauce.</p>

<p>Basically, you (or your wife) added water for no other purpose than to try to evaporate it later.  Water generally doesn't go in a cream sauce.  If you don't have chicken broth or can't use it, I would either substitute more wine or just leave it out completely.  Usually the only time you substitute water for broth is if it's actually the base of your sauce.</p>

","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.chestnutsforsale.com/information_chestnut.htm"">Chestnuts for Sale</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chestnut storage is not the same as most nuts. Fresh chestnuts should
  be stored like carrots. Chestnuts are comprised of about 40-50% water
  and thus if not stored properly, they will spoil. Therefore, chestnuts
  should be stored with great care and attention. The ideal storage
  conditions for chestnuts are 33-35 degrees Fahrenheit and 85-90%
  humidity. We recommend storing chestnuts in covered containers in the
  coldest part of the refrigerator. Stored properly in the refrigerator,
  chestnuts can have a shelf life of approximately 2-3 weeks.   If you
  plan to use the chestnuts soon after receiving them, simply place them
  in a covered container in the coldest part of the refrigerator. The
  colder, the better.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonchestnut.com/preparingchestnuts.html"">Washington Chestnut</a> offers the following information about storing chestnuts, to prevent molding to which they indicate the chestnuts are susceptible due to their high water content:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>

  <li>Never store chestnuts in a sealed plastic bag (except dried or frozen)</li>
  <li>Keep chestnuts refrigerated unless drying or sweetening the chestnuts</li>
  <li>If black molds have entered into the chestnut kernel, do not eat the chestnut</li>
  <li>Chestnuts can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 weeks</li>
  <li>Cooked chestnuts must also be refrigerated if not consumed right away</li>
  <li>Never bathe the chestnuts in plain water - this causes mold spores to be transferred to all the chestnuts passing though the bath water -

","<p>Looking at individual recipes, there is a great deal of overlap between Crêpes and Swedish pancakes. If, however, you compare hundreds of recipes, some clear differences emerge. There are also differences between the English interpretations of these recipes and those written in French or Swedish.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gh8m9.png"" alt=""Batter ingredient proportions""> </p>

<p>In the chart above, each cohort consists of at least 100 distinct recipe ratios, except for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ruhlman"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ruhlman's</a> Crêpes ratio which is provided for comparison.</p>

<p>A taste test of the Swedish recipe Pannkakor with French recipe Crêpes revealed the following differences:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Batter:</strong> The increased liquid content of the Swedish pancakes made the batter much thinner than the Crêpes batter. Swedish pancakes are made in a pan with a raised lip around the edge. This allows the thin batter to be sloshed around, evenly coating the pan surface without running over the edge.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/awC0m.jpg"" alt=""pancake pan""></p>

<p>Crêpes, on the other hand, are made on a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepe_maker"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Crêpe maker</a>. The batter must be thick enough that it will not run over the edge. A T-shaped spreader is used to evenly coat the crêpe maker surface in a perfect disk shape.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SNIQT.jpg"" alt=""crepe maker""></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Frying:</strong> Crêpes fried up extremely easily, unsticking themselves from the skillet (I had neither a pancake pan, nor a crêpe maker available at the time) making it possible to toss the Crêpes instead of flipping with a spatula. Swedish pancakes, on the other hand, require a bit of fiddling with a spatula to flip them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Crêpes had a slight tendency to curl up at the sides after flipping so they cooked less evenly than the pancakes which stayed perfectly flat after flipping.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9P1Zv.jpg"" alt=""Pannkaka""> Flip side of a Swedish pancake (Swedish recipe)</p>

<p>I also tested Michael Ruhlman's Crêpes ratio. These curled up to a much greater extent than French recipe Crêpes after flipping and were, consequently, quite unevenly browned on one side.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Hiwr.jpg"" alt=""Ruhlman&#39;s Crêpe""> Flip side of a Ruhlman's Crêpe</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Taste and consistency:</strong> Both French recipe Crêpes and Swedish recipe pancakes hit caramel and butterscotch notes. In short, they both tasted great. The Crêpe consistency was a little tough together with traditional Swedish accompaniments (Whipped cream and Strawberry jam) whereas the Swedish pancakes were light and fluffy; this worked perfectly with the filling. I tested again with lemon juice and sugar and this time the Crêpes won through, holding up well to the additional liquid while the Swedish pancakes became a bit soggy. Ruhlman's Crêpe recipe didn't perform nearly as well. The caramel flavour was much less pronounced, they had a dry mouth-feel and they were tougher than French recipe Crêpes.</li>

","<p>It is possible for mold to form on cashews - or any other nuts - but only if there has been moisture penetration into the container. If the moisture is at a safe (low) level, then mold won't grow.</p>

<p>See for example, <a href=""http://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajb/article/viewFile/14855/58603"">Mycology and spoilage of retail cashew nuts</a>, which refers to the maximum acceptable moisture content of 5.8% for retail storage/shipping, although if you look at their data table, it appears that you may still end up with non-trivial amounts of mold in the low 5% range (which is why you are supposed to store nuts sealed and in a cool, dry place).</p>

<p>Honestly, cashews are hard enough such that you would almost certainly see mold on the surface if it were present in harmful quantities. Most likely what you're smelling/tasting is simply oxidation of the fats (the process which causes rancidity) without actual full-blown rancidity. Mold requires moisture but all oxidation requires is light and maybe a little air exposure.</p>

<p>If you really want to be on the safe side - e.g. if your home is particularly hot or humid - then store your nuts in the refrigerator or freezer (sealed, to prevent contamination or off-odours).

<ul>
<li><p>Professional (also called commercial) machines can give much more pressure, but control automatically not to give more. They kind of pumps they use are called <em>rotary pump</em>, and due to their construction, the <em>flow rate</em> is independent of the pressure (which will remain quite constant).</p></li>
<li><p>Home machines employ the cheaper <em>vibratory pumps</em>. In them, the pressure is indirectly proportional to the flow. To try to have a more constant pressure, and to make it independent of the flow rate, they are added overpressure valves. But they need to have pumps that give more than 9 bar, to assure that those 9 bars will get to the basket in the portafilter.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can see <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&amp;v=HjdaqUso6wI"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">both rotary and vibratory pumps dismantled in this video</a>.</p>

<p>So, when manufacturers advertise their vibratory pump machines having 15 or more bars of pressure, they are just doing marketing using the <em>not always true</em> motto ""the more the better"".</p>

<h3>But why do I still see many machines high pressure?</h3>

<p>One of the signs of good quality espresso is the <em>crema</em>. If the coffee is good it will have a nice layer of crema on top. The marketing guys know you'll think <em>If my espresso has crema it will taste good</em> (which is not necessarily true). So they added a <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/20251/14096"">pressurized filter</a> to produce crema even with stale coffee that was grinded one month ago. As their name shows, pressurized filters need more pressure than a 9 bar standard one.</p>

"How can I pan fry zucchini without making it soggy?","75044","","<p>I really enjoy pan frying zucchini in a small amount of olive oil with some salt and pepper.</p>

<p>It always turns out tasting great, but it is often times really soggy.</p>

<p>Is there any way to pan fry the zucchini without making it soggy?</p>
","<p>The key to this is really high heat and pan-fry in a single layer, very quickly. The goal is to get that nice brown caramelized surface and barely cook the interior and then get it out of the pan before it starts to seep water. Also, wait to season with salt until it comes out of the pan so it doesn't draw out the water prematurely.</p>

"Adjusting baking time and temp for small cupcakes?","74817","","<p>Is there a good rule of thumb for adjusting temp and time when using batter from a cake recipe in cupcakes, especially very small bite size cupcakes?</p>

<p>I will be using a gingerbread cake batter that was meant for a bundt pan but will be using small cupcake cups to bake it in.</p>
","<p>The general rule of thumb with cakes and quick breads is that within certain limits:</p>

<ul>
<li>The larger the cake the lower the temperature</li>
<li>The smaller the cake, the higher the temperature</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason is that you want to get nice crust formation and browning in the time in takes the muffin or cupcake to cook through.  However, mini-muffins or cupcakes have so little mass that they will bake through quite quickly, and may be easy to over bake at higher temperatures.</p>

<p>This article at <a href=""http://bakingbites.com/2011/03/how-to-turn-cupcakes-into-mini-cupcakes/"" rel=""nofollow"">Baking Bites</a>, in regards to converting standard cupcakes to mini-cupcakes recommends:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While most cupcakes take about 15-20 minutes to bake, most mini
  cupcakes take from 9-14 minutes or so to reach donenss. Check your
  minis at 9 or 10 minutes with a toothpick and bake longer as needed.
  The only thing you really need to look out for is the fact that it is
  easy to overbake these miniature cakes, so keep a close eye on them
  while they’re baking and check them at very short intervals when
  they’re close to being done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This matches my experience for full sized muffins and cupcakes:  full sized muffins should bake in about 18-22 minutes&mdash;if they take longer, raise the oven temperature on the next batch slightly.</p>

<p>They do not suggest changing the temperature for minis.  The tips at <a href=""http://cupcakestakethecake.blogspot.com/2005/07/cupcake-tips.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Cupcakes Take the Cake</a> concur:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If recipes don't specify mini baking times, note that minis will take
  more than half of the baking time recommended for standard size
  cupcakes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My survey of a number of mini-cupcake recipes shows the general consensus is about 10 minutes, or half the time of a regular cupcake. </p>

<p>Remember, however, the smaller the cake, the more little factors like your actual oven temperature, how much batter you put in the tin (and how consistently you fill each cup), the moisture level of your batter, and so on affect the outcome.</p>

<p>All of my experience is with standard sized cupcakes and muffins, or muffin tops.  If I had a mini, pan, I would determine the best baking time by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Doing a half-tray, and checking it when they start to smell done (if you are an experienced baker, you will know what this means), or at about 8 minutes.</li>
<li>Continue checking every minute or so, until you find they are done with the toothpick test.</li>
<li>Bake a second half-tray to that time without all of the door opening, to confirm your findings.</li>
<li>Adjust as necessary, and you will then know the best time for your oven and that particular recipe&mdash;assuming you fill the tins consistently.  (I use a food disher&mdash;like an ice cream scoop&mdash;for this purpose.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note:  the purpose of the half tray is to have less cakes with a less than perfect bake.  Once you dial in the ideal baking time, go for full trays for less work.</p>

<p>I also suggest <em>not</em> doing multiple trays at the same time, as they will change the way the air circulates in the oven, and mask the radiant heat from each other.  This makes for less consistent results.</p>

"Solutions for when heating chocolate and butter doesn't mix well","74648","","<p>Yesterday I tried to make brownies that started out with me having to melt unsweetened chocolate with butter in a frying pan on the stove. This did not work well. The chocolate kindof mixed with the melted butter, but parts of it remained solid. I then had to let it cool before adding the rest of the ingredients; the butter and chocolate separated, and the chocolate formed small to medium solid globs in the butter.</p>

<p>What did I do wrong? If this were to happen again how would I go about fixing it? Should I add something to counteract this and if so what and how much?</p>

<p>NOTE: </p>

<ul>
<li>I didn't have unsweetened chocolate so I used Hershey's pure chocolate chipits. </li>
<li>I also used margarine instead of butter but have never had a problem with this substitution before.</li>
</ul>
","<p>I can think of at least three things that will cause chocolate to <strong>seize</strong> - which refers to when melted or melting chocolate suddenly becomes hard again:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Using too high a heat.  Double-boiler is the safest, but you can use a saucepan on <em>very</em> low heat.</p></li>
<li><p>Sugar bloom and other impurities.  You shouldn't get this with baker's chocolate, but if you use any lower-quality chocolate, this can seep into the melting chocolate and cause it to seize.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contact with moisture!</strong>  Even a tiny amount will cause it to immediately seize, and it's difficult to recover at that point.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds like you fell into traps #2 <em>and</em> #3 and possibly #1.  I would <em>not</em> melt chocolate in margarine; I'd even be wary of melting it in butter, and find it strange that a recipe would call for that, because both butter and margarine contain water!</p>

<p>Melting chocolate <em>in</em> a liquid can actually help <em>prevent</em> seizing, but you have to use a <em>lot</em> of liquid and the liquid has to be <em>completely</em> melted <em>before</em> you start trying to melt the chocolate.  It's better to use something like a vegetable oil which has no water content if this is what you're trying to do.</p>

<p>So, in summary:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Definitely stay away from the margarine.  Even if you need to use butter, make sure it's completely melted first and try to use only the fat (clarify it).</p></li>
<li><p>If you can, melt the chocolate and clarify the butter separately and then whisk them together gradually afterward; not only will this help to prevent seizing, but if commenter @roux is correct and the problem <em>isn't</em> one of seizing, this will still help to guarantee that the chocolate melts evenly.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the best quality chocolate you can find.  Chipits are generally OK to melt on their own, but if they've been sweetened then this may contribute to seizing if other factors are present.</p></li>
<li><p>Melt in a double-boiler or on very low heat.</p></li>

","<p>The salt treatment in sausage can cause it to retain a pinker color for a given temperature than would normal ground meat.   The fact that you used a trusted thermometer, and that the sausages were well in the safe zone (even conservatively 165 F is more than enough) indicates that the sausage was perfectly safe.</p>

","<p>There is no substitute for salt. Sorry. It has effects on the tastebuds and the body that cannot be replicated.</p>

<p>However! They can be <em>approached</em> to a degree that most people will find interchangeable. Acids can mimic the flavour-enhancing qualities of salt in a big way. The more acid you have in a dish, the less salt you will need. Beware of going too far, of course, as too much acid is just unpleasant and will need salt to counterbalance.</p>

"Why did my roast beef turn out chewy and not tender? Where did I go wrong?","74368","","<p>I recently made an <code>Oven Round Roast</code> in the oven and I followed directions quite well. I would really like to know where I went wrong.</p>

<p>The roast was 1.4kg and relatively round in shape, it was also quite nicely marbled with a big strip of fat on one side.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Out from the freezer and into the fridge overnight (to give it some time to cool down) and then left it out in room temperature for a
  couple of hours. Took out of package and put on a rub.</p></li>
  <li><p>I put the oven on 450 F and put the roast in (fat side up) for 10 minutes for the maillard reaction. Note that when I did this, I put it
  directly on the oven rack; I put a tray underneath to catch the
  drippings, but it was uncovered.</p></li>
  <li><p>Turned oven down to 225 for 2 hours and then 200 for 5 hours. </p></li>
  <li><p>Cut the roast into half inch slices and served.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The color was a nice pink on the inside and dark on the outside. It was still juicy and the taste was great. The roast's outside is absolutely delicious in fact, the rub turned out so well and the fat was amazingly tasty. </p>

<p>However, the roast was so chewy, I am very disappointed. I did a lot of research before I cooked it and found that slow cooking is a good way to tenderize meat. I also found out that certain cuts of meat need to be cooked differently. I.e. Steak should be hot and fast, and roast cuts should be long and slow (after searing it of course... yum yum yum). </p>

<p>In <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/4157/why-do-some-foods-taste-better-the-next-day/8760#8760"">this</a> post, 'Marti' answered by quoting a TV chef saying that when beef is being cooked it's collagen breaks down and liquifies and when it cools it turns to gelatine. Could that be what happened to my beef roast? If so, how can I avoid that?</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/3378/how-should-baking-soda-be-used-to-tenderize-meat"">this</a> post, 'Gilead' suggested a few solutions, beating the meat, cutting it against the grain, and choosing the right cooking method. Well, did I do the right cooking method? And do the other ones apply to a roast? I mean if you cut it up, it's basically cheap beef steak and I've never tried mechanically tenderizing the meat. </p>

<p>I really appreciate any help; I'm quite distraught over this chewy beef roast.</p>
","<p>The only mistake you made was the choice of cut, and maybe the quality of the beef itself. Round (in the UK/AU/NZ topside and silverside) is from the rear end of the animal, and is a working cut. Working cuts have to exert a force, so the muscle must have lots of collagen to distribute the force from the tendon throughout the muscle. Collagen is a tough material which breaks down in the presence of heat <strong>and</strong> moisture, not just heat, so working cuts make poor roasts or steaks and are better braised or stewed. </p>

<p>The upside to working cuts is that they have a stronger flavor, and the collagen when broken down by moisture turns to gelatin which adds to the flavor and mouth feel. A well-prepared braised piece of beef is as good as a roast any day in my opinion. It's also better value, round and other working cuts are much cheaper than tender cuts. </p>

<p>Your technique as described is perfect, and if you'd chosen a rib, short loin, or sirloin roast (US cuts) it would have come out beautifully. Where you erred was at the store when you chose a working cut for roasting. </p>

<p>Now some people on the forum are probably preparing a rebuttal at this point saying ""you can roast round and have it be tender"", and they'd be right up to a point. The best quality beef is reared and slaughtered better, so if you bought US Prime round it has a good chance of coming out relatively tender, however it's hard to find. My assessment would be for what you'd find in the average store in the US, which is Choice grade. Choice encompasses something like 75% of beef produced, so has a huge range of quality. </p>

<p>You can tell a lot about meat by touching it. Stick your fingers in it, if they go in easy and the meat springs back then you have a tender cut, if you can't get your fingers in it it's a braising cut. If you stick your fingers in and the meat doesn't spring back its old, so don't buy it.  </p>

<p>Is it for taste or is it supposed to react in some way with the albumen?</p>
","<p>Egg whites need to be heated up to a certain temperature in order to coagulate (""set"").</p>

<p>Lowering the pH (increasing the acidity) of the cooking liquid is one way to <em>lower the temperature</em> required for coagulation of the egg whites.  So, in a way, this does prevent ""feathering"" of the eggs, but not because of any direct reaction; rather, the reason the eggs feather less is because they have less <em>time</em> to feather, because they <em>don't need to get as hot</em>.</p>

<p>Any acidic liquid will have a similar effect.  White vinegar is probably the most effective, but you could also add lemon juice or wine to the poaching liquid.  In fact, eggs poached in red wine sauce (""Oeufs en Meurette"") is quite a popular preparation method.</p>

<p>For reference, the coagulation temperature is also proportional to the salinity (add salt to lower the coagulation temperature, add sugar to raise it), and inversely proportional to the number of eggs used (more eggs = lower coagulation temperature).</p>

I found the meat particularly chewy/tough and rather unpleasant overall. What can we do to improve the experience?</p>
","<p><em>Genuine</em> fajitas are made with skirt steak. The most important thing you can do when making fajitas is marinate appropriately. That recipe calls for a dismally short marination time (30 mins to an hour). When I make fajitas I marinate them a <em>minimum</em> of 4 hours, though typically overnight. I usually use a combination of soy sauce, lime juice, garlic, olive oil and salt in a zip-loc bag.</p>

<p>Another thing to be aware of is how you slice the meat. If you bought your fajita meat presliced from a good butcher, then chances are he cut it properly - against the grain. If it's a random supermarket butcher you may or may not have had it cut properly. If you cut the meat yourself, make sure you slice it across the grain, otherwise you'll be chewing some very tough long proteins.</p>

<p>Also, as with any meat, don't overcook it. Medium rare is just fine for a skirt steak.</p>

<p>Some people will substitute a flank steak for a skirt steak when making fajitas. Flank tends to be a little less tough, but not as flavorful. The above marination and cutting guidelines apply to flank steak as well.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> - I also notice that the recipe suggests 3-4 minutes per side for medium rare. This doesn't sound right to me if the grill is on high heat. Skirt and flank steaks are rather thin and 2 minutes per side on a <em>hot</em> grill should be medium-rare.</p>

","<p><strong>The secrets:</strong> (some are old wives tales, but hey, it's an old recipe)</p>

<p>Eggs: Room temperature (you don't put eggs in the fridge do you?) and not fresh</p>

<p>Contamination: Make sure everything you use to prepare the base is perfectly clean, especially no grease. Use boiling water to rinse everything first. Metal or glass bowls are best, as plastic is harder to get 100% clean. Also make sure no yolk gets into the egg whites</p>

<p>Beating: When eggs whites have gone firm, add the sugar a little at a time using a powerful beater machine going flat out. NZ'ers use their trusty but ancient <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenwood_Chef"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kenwood Chef</a> with the glass bowl for ten minutes until the it looks like the Swiss Alps on a sunny day. You should not be able to feel the castor sugar when you squish some mix between your fingers. If they go dull you have over beaten. They will still work but will go extra soggy when cooked as the sugar runs out</p>

<pre><code>BTW: Use ear muffs when using your Kenwood Chef, I kid you not!
</code></pre>

<p>Size: Height = radius, or a little less. A radius of less than 10cm means you won't get Pav, just meringue.  You can experiment with baking paper rings to hold the mix into a perfect cake shape if fussy. I wouldn't bother though</p>

<p><strong>Problems:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Collapse: You opened the oven door ... <strong>DON'T</strong></li>
<li>Cracking: Normal, don't worry. This is a messy desert and you'll be covering it with whipped cream soon!</li>
<li>Crystallisation: over cooking</li>
<li>Marshmallow like in middle: Normal, that's what a Pav is meant to be like. If it's not like that you have over cooked it, or you didn't make it thick enough. Foamed egg white is a self-insulator, once the outside cooks it stops the heat getting into the middle</li>

"Does brewing tea for longer result in higher caffeine content?","72842","","<p>The ISO standard for brewing tea says ""6 minutes"".  Of course different teas have vastly different properties, but...</p>

<p>For ""average commodity black tea"" and ""average commodity green tea"", will leaving the tea bag in longer (say 1 hour or 1 day) result in higher caffeine content in the cup?  How much?</p>
","<p>First off, the ISO standard is not intended to produce a good cup of tea. It is designed to produce a consistent one for taste testing, so that no tea manufacturer can claim that his tea wasn't made ""properly"".
It's title is ""Tea -- Preparation of liquor for use in sensory tests""</p>

<p>As for the actual tea making, yes, leaving the bag in longer will make a stronger cup of tea. The concentration of caffeine (along with flavour molecules and everything else) will slowly trend towards an equal concentration in the leaf and in the water. The longer you leave the tea bag/leaves in the water, the closer to equilibrium you will get.</p>

<p>There are other factors that affect this, such as the temperature of the water, cut of the leaves, bag versus loose leaf and so on, but the trend is always towards equilibrium as time progresses.</p>

<p>I'm not sure where the upper limit of this lies, but I think that once the cup is cold there's no point in it anyway. Thus, leaving the bag in for an hour is a bit much. I usually steep my tea for 3-6 minutes, depending on how strong I want it to be.</p>

"What are the impacts of common pizza dough errors?","72678","","<p>I'm diving into the world of making pizzas from scratch, and I'd like to take a systematic approach to the possible mistakes I could make with regards to the dough.</p>

<p>What impact do each of the following errors have on the final taste/texture of the pizza crust?</p>

<ul>
<li>Using old yeast or too much/too little yeast (I assume that using old yeast is the same as using too little yeast?)</li>
<li>Too high or too low of a water to flour ratio</li>
<li>Overworking or underworking the dough</li>
<li>Too much or too little resting time of dough</li>
</ul>
","<p>I don't see anything in the question that is peculiar to pizza dough. Anything I answer will apply to any kind of yeast-risen, glutenous dough.</p>

<p>The goal with any such dough is a well hydrated protein matrix that has been arranged in sheets that will trap the gas produced by yeast.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the yeast is dead it won't be able to produce gas and your bread will be somewhere between a cracker and shoe leather- depending on how thick you roll it out.</li>
<li>Using too little yeast is not the same as dead yeast. If you use too little yeast (within reason) they will take a long time to reproduce, eat, and blow up your stretchy proteins. They will be producing a lot of flavor during this period. This will generally taste good.</li>
<li>If you use too much yeast (within reason) the yeast will act very quickly. This is nice for speed but it will result in a much less developed flavor. Neither is a problem so you can choose for yourself.</li>
<li>Using too little water will result in not enough gluten development and a dry, or crumbly dough. The dough won't hold gases and there will also not be enough steam when baking so the dough will be more dense.</li>
<li>Too much water and you have a batter that can't be worked with.</li>
<li>Over working a dough isn't so much of a concern. It is possible to over knead but it is hard to do. See: <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/18114/possible-to-over-knead-dough"">Possible to over-knead dough?</a>.</li>
<li>Under working the dough will result in less gluten development and very similar results as using too little water- basically you will have unleavened biscuit dough. The exception is if you are following a ""no-knead"" recipe. In this case the dough is allowed to rest for days which lets the protein sheets form on their own.</li>
<li>Resting the dough is necessary both to relax the protein mesh that you created as well as to allow the yeast a chance to blow it up with some CO2. Not long enough and you won't be able to roll out the dough because it will be too tight and it won't be risen because the yeast haven't eaten. Too long and the bubbles will coalesce into large open cavities. A good rule of thumb is ""doubled in volume"". Usually about an hour but this is highly dependent on how much yeast you use, how much water, and the ambient temperature.</li>
</ul>

<p>The end result is that you don't need to worry about most of these things.
The biggest mistakes I see people make is making a dough too dry or simply not kneading enough. It is easier to add flour than water so put in less than the full amount of flour, knead for a while, if the dough stays too sticky then add a bit more flour and knead in.</p>

<p>As answers to other questions have said- you want a dough that is ""smooth and elastic"" it isn't sticky and looks homogeneous. After just a couple tries you will get a feel for how wet that means and you'll be an expert.</p>

<p>For pizza dough in particular- almost as important as the dough construction is the baking temperature. You want to cook it as hot as you can. 500F in an oven or on a grill. It will only take 5-10 minutes. The fast hot cooking will do a lot for your crust texture. It makes the difference between a crispy, chewy pizza crust and a soft, bready (and soggy under the toppings) crust.</p>

","<p>I have a whole freezer full of jalapenos - so yes, you definitely can.</p>

<p>They definitely retain their heat just fine. </p>

<p>They keep their texture better if you do 2 things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use a vacuum sealer and take out all the air - to reduce freezer burn.  Because of this, I recommend you freeze them in batches.</p></li>
<li><p>Blanche them for 2-3 minutes in boiling water and then drop them in freezing water.  From what I've read, this destroys a particular enzyme that helps <em>not</em> break the pepper down further.  I've done this and not done this - and doing it <em>definitely</em> helps on the texture.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>They should be good for a little over a year in a vacuum sealed bag - as far as the texture goes.  They should never <em>go bad</em> otherwise.</p>

<p>Cos and Sobachatina - bring up another good point: freezing fast and effectively.  You can try AB's method that Cos points out, but I do what Sobachatina does.  Freeze on a single layer on a tray in the freezer.  They freeze quicker and better than dumping them in a bag.</p>

"How can I prepare bread dough to be cooked the next day?","72466","","<p>I'd like to make some fresh bread for breakfast tomorrow, but don't particularly want to wake up at 5am to mix and prove the dough. How could I make the dough tonight so that I could just throw it in the oven tomorrow?</p>
","<p>Make the bread all the way through.  You can even let the first rise happen.  Drop your yeast to about half.  Oil a bowl, drop in the dough, spin once to get the ball of dough covered with the oil and then put plastic wrap over the bowl, or a damp cloth...and plastic wrap.  Put the bowl in the refrigerator.</p>

<p>The refrigerator slows down the yeast without killing it, which also increases the flavor of the bread (over night cool low yeast methods for bread are considered the ""right"" way to make bread).  </p>

<p>In the morning, pull out the bread, press out any large bubbles, roll it around and let it come to life again.  I usually punch it down one more time and then let it rise in the pan or on a sheet depending on what kind of bread I am making, then bake as normal.</p>

<p>In your case, because you're doing a stuffed loaf, assuming there is a rise before the stuffing, THAT is the point where you will start the morning.

"Whipping-cream will not stay hard or keep its peaks and gets runny","71811","","<p>My mother is confounded by whipping-cream. Some 20 years ago she started making cream-puffs which quickly became her pastry calling card. They always came out great and were always a hit. Some 15 years later, she cannot seem to make whipped-cream anymore.</p>

<p>She still uses the same bowl, same mixer, same whipping-cream (<em>Nutriwhip</em> whipping-cream) and does everything the same way as she used to, but no matter what, the cream stays soft and will not stiffen or form peaks. (The kitchen is <em>not</em> too hot.)</p>

<p>Some explanations that we have considered include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Changes to the quality/ingredients of the cream (despite the box being the same)</li>
<li>Adding powdered sugar to the liquid cream before whipping (like she always used to do)</li>
<li>Refrigerator not cold enough (but then, freezer not cold enough either?)</li>
<li>Whipping for too long causes heat build-up due to friction, which melts it (doesn’t excessive beating turn it into butter?)</li>
</ul>

<p>She tried using different bowl, a chilled bowl, a different mixer, (even made me try by hand once!) She has tried a different brands of cream (35% <em>Beatrice</em> and <em>Lactancia</em> whipping-creams), but gets the same results. One time, I tried adding the powdered sugar <em>after</em> whipping the cream, and it was much better than what she normally gets now, but still not as stiff as compared to the past. Using a whisk on the mixer in place of the normal beaters (which was what she always used before, as my and my sister’s tongues can attest to), seems to help, but even that is only temporary.</p>

<p>She has even tried putting the whipped cream in the freezer, and while it does harden, once it has thawed enough to pipe, it gets runny very quickly (in the past, she would be able to pipe the cream onto baked goods, leave them in the fridge for a day, then drive them to somewhere else without the cream’s edges softening).</p>

<p>She is baffled because she had made whipped-cream for various baked-goods countless times, but until a few years ago, she never had <em>any</em> problems, then suddenly, it <em>never</em> works anymore. I found a few related questions here, but they don’t quite apply (they talk about different bowls, different temperatures, etc., but like I said, it <em>used</em> to work).</p>

<p>What could be the problem? How can she get whipped-cream to stay hard like it used to?</p>

","<h1>Tests</h1>

<p>She has tried the frozen-bowl trick (which she never used to have to do), but the cream only stays whipped and forms peaks for a while, then starts to melt (far too) quickly.</p>

<h1>Theory</h1>

<p>One theory she had was that she was whipping it for too long, which caused heat build up due to friction which in turn melted the cream. This seems to be borne out by the fact that using a wire-whip tends to give desired results more often than using flat-beaters.</p>

<h1>Facts</h1>

<p>Of course this isn’t a 100% answer or solution because:</p>

<ul>
<li>She used to use flat-beaters exclusively in the past without issue</li>
<li>Even when using a whisk to whip it, it can still melt and fall flat quickly sometimes</li>
</ul>

<h1>Supplemental</h1>

<p>In addition, I noticed that she seems to be putting more icing sugar in her whipped-cream than in the past. This likely changes, and specifically <em>lowers</em>, the melting point of the cream just like adding salt to water. We have not done extensive, conclusive testing, but a couple times when she remembered to put in less sugar, it did seem to whip better. This may or may not have been due to the lower sugar content, but it certainly is worth trying if you are having trouble whipping cream.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>These observations and tests seem to indicate that the material contents of the cream have changed since the past, and even today, can vary from box to box.</p>

<p>Either way, a wire whisk and chilled bowl as well as reducing sugar (and possibly dyes, and other additives) are the best shot at getting cream to whip.</p>

<p>Thawing foods by leaving them out at room temperature&mdash;especially, for example, while you go to work&mdash;is not a good idea for a couple of reasons.  The food on the outside may be too warm before the center is thawed; and if not monitored, there is no way to know when it about to enter unsafe temperatures.</p>

","<p>Converting whole spices to ground spices is not as simple as matching up the weights. Ground spices have a distinctly different flavour from the whole. The freshness of the grind will also affect the taste quite considerably as well as how carefully they have been stored. When the spice is freshly ground it will have a very strong intense flavour, so you would reduce the amount you use slightly. However, ground spices rapidly loose parts of their flavour. The taste changes and you may find you will end up using more than the recipe states in order to get a similar taste. However, you'll never get exactly the same taste, grinding changes the spice.</p>

<p>The best solution is to try to get an supply of the whole spice from an online store. You can then use them whole or grind them yourself, fresh, as the need arises.</p>

"What is the best way to store chopped vegetables?","68832","","<p>To speed up our cooking during the week, I would like to chop up all the vegetables I will need for the week on a Sunday and then just use them throughout the week.</p>

<p>What would be the best way to store these vegetables?</p>

<p>Will this work with all vegetables or are there some vegetables that just can't be chopped until you are about to use them?</p>
","<p>I'm a fan of prepping some vegetables for the week on a day off. I'm much more likely to eat salad if I have the fixings ready in my fridge. I'm no expert, this is just what I've found works best for me.</p>

<p>Certainly some vegetables are more suited to cutting and storing than others. I find controlling humidity and condensation in storage to be the most important factor.  I store almost everything in covered pyrex, unless it needs to breath (and those go in the humid compartment).  Veggies with less water can be kept humid with a lightly moist paper towel on top.  Wetter veggies can cause condensation and lead to sliminess.  A dry paper towel and/or an open container can help with that.  A veggie should either be submerged in water, or not in water at all.  Sitting in condensation is that biggest problem in storage.</p>

<p>Cut carrots keep in water for a week with no change in quality.  Out of water, they can dry out a bit.  I don't find the dryness to be a problem.</p>

<p>Sliced bell peppers keep pretty well with a moist paper towel in the container.</p>

<p>I find onions to be pretty indestructible, though the flavor gets a bit milder over time.  </p>

<p>Broccoli and cauliflower are also pretty hardy.  A dry paper towel or two will deal with water from washing them, which is the biggest problem I've had.</p>

<p>Mushrooms and leafy greens need to breath.</p>

<p>Cucumbers and tomatoes don't store as well as others.</p>

"What's the best way to get a charcoal taste on a propane grill?","68704","","<p>I recently was given a propane grill that is a lot nicer than my charcoal grill, however my family really likes the cooking and taste of a charcoal grill. I hear the propane grill tastes a lot different. Is there something specific I can do to get a taste similar to a charcoal grill, while using the benefits of my newer, nicer, larger, propane grill?</p>
","<p>Whether or not charcoal tastes different/better is actually a bit of a debate.  I've been a propane griller for years and now I use charcoal not for the taste, but because frankly, I like to play with fire.  But lets assume that there is a taste difference, identify where the differences comes from, and how to address them:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The smoke from charcoal.  This is (if you've been using natural lump charcoal) pretty much just wood smoke.  If you've been using briquettes you'll also get the smoke of the filler and such, but generally this isn't desirable and we don't want to replicate it.  For smoke on a gas grill - you can use something like <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000FJG4R4"">this smoker box</a>. Fill it with wood chips and place it over a burner, it should start smoking.</p></li>
<li><p>Vapor from the food drippings hitting the coals, and rising back up to flavor the food.  This used to be a big advantage to charcoal, but its largely minimized by new gas grills with 'vapor bars'.  As long as your grill has one of these, you're in luck.  Otherwise, there's not a good, safe way to replicate it - but odds are you have it.  Its a long bar usually running the length of burners.</p></li>
<li><p>Lighter fluid taste.  Another undesirable flavor if you're doing a particular (and not good IMO) kind of charcoal grilling.  Frankly, its not one you're likely to miss.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Those are the main tastes and how to replicate them.  Nowadays the biggest is definitely #1, but it only matters if you doing foods that cook for a significant length of time or are especially 'porous'.  If you're doing hot dogs and chicken breasts, I wouldn't bother if smoke.  If you're doing burgers - maybe/probably.  If you're doing thick steaks, thick pork chops, a whole chicken, or anything that's going on awhile, then creating some smoke is definitely worth it.  (""Liquid smoke"" definitely doesn't taste like the real thing.)</p>

"Why are there no recipes combining both yeast and baking powder?","68693","","<p>I've never seen anything with both yeast and baking powder. What's the reason for that? Shouldn't e.g. muffins get even more fluffy by adding some yeast? Or bread by adding baking powder?
I know there are differences in flavor, but there are cakes with yeast as also non-sweet things with baking powder. So that shouldn't be the problem...</p>
","<p>The existing answers already explain why yeast and baking powder won't work together. But even if they did, you wouldn't have a reason to use them. </p>

<p>You seem to think that fluffiness depends on the amount of gas produced by the leaveners. In fact, it depends on both the gas and the ability of the dough to trap that gas. If you produce too much gas (no matter whether through yeast or through baking powder), then the fluffiness will be less than when using the optimal amount of leavener. This happens because your dough cannot hold the gas and the bubbles break, resulting in the dough deflating like a punctured tire. So even if combining two leaveners would have resulted in more ""blowing big"" action (which it doesn't, see the other answers), you would not end up with a fluffier end product. If you want fluffy muffins, you have to use a recipe and a technique which is best capable of retaining the gas produced by the baking powder. The amount of gas production is not a bottleneck. </p>

"How can I attach printed rice paper decorations to cakes / cookies?","68666","","<p>I bought some printed rice paper decorations (flat circles of rice paper printed with edible ink) for my son's birthday party. I'm not sure what the best way is to attach them to cakes / cookies and I don't have a lot of spare time to experiement.</p>

<p>The options I can think of are:</p>

<ul>
<li>make my own cookies and press them in to the cookie - either before
baking or more likely after baking but while still warm and soft</li>
<li>place the rice paper circle on top of a pre-baked cookie or small flat-topped cake and pipe some form of icing or frosting around the
edge to hold it in place</li>
<li>pile butter cream icing on top of a small cake, press the rice paper circle onto the butter cream icing</li>
</ul>

<p>What I ideally want is to be able to do this the day before they are needed, so as well as being held properly in place, I also would like the rice paper not to go soggy / curl up and the ink not to run or leak out of the rice paper. </p>
","<p>If you use the buttercream option, let the icing dry a bit before putting the rice paper on, as too much moisture will cause it to collapse and the ink to run.  Also, I wouldn't recommend pressing the rice paper down, but just patting it onto slightly tacky buttercream.  White icing is best as the rice paper is quite translucent.</p>

<p>The other alternative you suggest will work fine - place it on the cake and pipe around the edge to hold in place.  I have seen this done many times.  Best not to use a vivid colour for the piping as it could leech into the rice paper a bit.</p>

When drunk, they top up the water again with hot (but not boiling) water. This will go on all day.</p>

<p>The next day, however, they will not reuse the tea. My Chinese wife always tells me off if I reuse the previous days tea leaves. She says they are bad for you, though I have never had any problem myself.</p>

"How do I tone down the intensity of raw onion?","68309","","<p>How can I tone down the intensity of raw onion?<br>
Some onions have a more acute taste and smell than others of the same type, and I would like to avoid them in salad dish, or making dips with raw onion. If effectively none, an alternative solution that can also be helpful is to find out what condiments can I add/mix with raw onion to cancel out the intensity of the the acute taste.</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong><br/>
There is a uniquely (IMHO) sweet taste to onion that I like. But accompany with that is the acute scene and flavor to it that I wanted to get ride of. I do not want to waste away the taste of onion, but remove the acuteness and remain the sweetness. </p>
","<p>Two things control the ""sharpness"" of onions: variety and age.  While certain varieties of onions are sharper than others (i.e. Reds, walla-walls and vidalias are sweeter), any onion which has been in storage too long is going to be sulphurous and sharp-tasting.  Since it's January now, that's going to be pretty much all onions.</p>

<p>Since onion sharpness comes from sulphur compounds (as I understand it), the best way to sweeten onions is to release some of them ahead of using the onion.  The best way to do that is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Slice the onion thinly, crossways (parallel to its equator rather than pole-to-pole).</p></li>
<li><p>Place the sliced onion in a wide bowl, uncovered or very loosely covered, in the fridge or other cold place for at least an hour and up to a day.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, either vinegar or salt -- or both -- will help accelerate removing sharpness from onion.  For example, for a New Year's Eve appetizer this year I sliced a red onion in to rings, tossed it with 1/2 tsp salt and 2 tsp red wine vinegar, and left it in an open bowl on the 45F porch for 5 hours.  The result was intensely sweet red onion which could then be used as a canape topping.</p>

<p>If you're in a hurry, though, the only way to make the onion less sharp is to cook it.</p>

My homemade chips soaked up too much oil, making them slightly too 'wet', for the lack of a better word. Commercial chips in general are much drier than my homemade chips, and I presume less oil per chip correlates to less calories per chip.</p>

<p>So how can I make potato chips that are more like the commercial kind?</p>
","<p>I am going to get ""unsciency"" as I used to make fries for hours on end at a local mom and pop shop.</p>

<p>How thin / thick doesn't really matter, you'll just have to adjust your frying time accordingly.</p>

<p>1) Use a starchy potato</p>

<p>2) slice your potato evenly, with a peeler if you don't have a slicer or mandolin</p>

<p>3) soak them in water for 30 mins with a pinch of salt</p>

<p>4) let them dry a bit</p>

<p>5) blanch them with vegetable oil until they are limpy but has no visible color change (Oil 
should be hot enough that when you put them in, 5 seconds later there are bubbles)</p>

<p>6) cool them completely, I throw them into a container into the fridge</p>

<p>7) refried them by putting in enough pieces in such that it will still bubble immediately (oil should be hot enough when you drop a spot of water or chop sticks in that it bubble immediately, but you wouldn't hear like a crackling or have oil splashing at you)</p>

<p>8) Take them out one piece at a time as they change color.</p>

<p>The key is vegetable that's pretty much the only oil that makes things cripsy at lower frying temperature, other than bacon fat, this makes a much more golden chip, and generally a easier time to control, so you can make more at the same time. Shortening, olive oil, peanut oil, butter, lard has been tested and isn't really good. Sesame oil is good too if you like the taste of it.

<p>Can anyone explain the factors that affect how tough the meat becomes? Am I not searing properly? Is the meat prone to being tough because it's not fresh (reduced stuff)? Is it not defrosting for long enough?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
","<p>Meat is tough for two reasons:<br>
1- An abundance of connective tissue.<br>
2- When over cooked. </p>

<p>In your case I'd say you probably have both problems. Cheap meat is tough meat. It is from older animals or well worked muscle groups. This means that it has been fortified with a lot of extra connective tissue. It also means it has a lot of flavor.</p>

<p>The solution to #1 is slow, wet cooking that will melt that connective tissue into delicious gelatin. Braising is the normal way to do this. When meat is heated too far, even if the connective tissue has been carefully melted out, the meat proteins bunch up and stiffen- resulting in #2, a dry, unpleasant meal.</p>

<p>You are buying tough meat and cooking it relatively quickly with no thermometer. You don't have enough time or moisture to melt the collagen and you can't be sure you haven't over cooked the meat because you don't know the temperature. Using time doesn't work because chunks of meat are irregularly shaped so you can't know how long it will take for the heat to penetrate.</p>

<p>Buy yourself a probe thermometer to prevent #2. For #1 look for pot roast recipes. Some are easily done in slow cookers- others use a tent of sealed foil over the meat to seal in moisture. Plan on it taking much longer than your 1.5 hours. 3-6 hours are typical to produce a really succulent pot roast.</p>

<p>The searing is just for flavor and will not play a role in either melting collagen or cooking the interior of the meat.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[T]here are really two distinct cuts from the diaphragm of the steer.</p>
  
  <p>The outside skirt steak is from the plate section, below the rib and
  between the brisket and flank, and usually comes with the membrane
  still attached, which needs to be trimmed before cooking.</p>
  
  <p>Inside skirt comes from the flank—it's narrower and thinner than the
  outside skirt, and comes with the membrane removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://www.houstonpress.com/2009-06-18/restaurants/not-so-clear-cut/2/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Houston Press</a>, outside skirt stake is extremely rare in the US, as much of it gets exported to Japan due to a quick in the tariffs.  The outside cut is tougher, but extremely flavorful.  Both are used in similar applications, if you can get them.</p>

<p>Given that any skirt you buy is probably inside skirt, the difference is likely to be moot.  In making fajitas, Kenji Alt recommends grilling it over extremely high heat, to get browning flavors on the outside, and not overcook the center.  He recommends not cooking it over medium rare.</p>

"Cooking multiple dishes at once in the oven","67268","","<p>What is the rule of thumb for adjusting temperature and cooking time when cooking multiple dishes in the oven at the same time? In particular, if the dishes have different required temperatures and/or cooking times, when and how is it feasible to cook both at the same time?</p>
","<p>There aren't any very good ""rules of thumb"" for specific temperatures or cooking times.  I'll take a stab at the question in general terms, but it really will vary depending on the specific dishes.  There are other questions which have been asked here that ask about specific cases.</p>

<p>First, timing and temperature are separate issues.  </p>

<p><strong>The general answer about timing is to bake until done.</strong>  Most recipes that require a very particular doneness have some sort of test to determine it (e.g., final internal temperature, texture, brownness level, solidity, etc.).  Pull the food from the oven when it satisfies the doneness condition.  Most foods will eventually get done at lower temperatures; they may just take longer.  Other foods are often not as picky about doneness levels, e.g., stews, casseroles, braises.  Longer cooking will often just make the texture more tender, which is often a benefit.</p>

<p>If your goal is to try to <em>have multiple things done at the same time</em>, timing can be more tricky.  In that case, you'll just have to take a guess, put foods that need longer cooking in first, and keep an eye on everything.  If one particular dish is getting done too quickly, you can often remove it, cover with a lid or foil, and return to the oven when the remaining dish(es) are approaching doneness.  For baked goods, they should probably be nearly done before removing and resting.  (The gluten structure needs to be stable, usually with interior temp of at least 180-190F.)  For other dishes, you may be able to remove from the oven in mid-bake and return after other dishes have ""caught up"" in doneness level.  For food safety reasons, you don't want to ""rest"" the food too long before returning to the oven, but it can help to balance timing as you're approaching doneness for everything.</p>

<p>There are various charts and tables available for determining how timing will be affected by temperature changes, but frankly they're rarely accurate.  Only experience and trial-and-error can tell you how a particular dish or recipe will be affected.  This is even more true for full ovens, where temperature fluctuations, steam from other dishes, variations in radiant heat and air circulation produced by other baking vessels, etc. will really create differences in baking times.  The only general advice here is to monitor the cooking frequently and use whatever doneness criteria you have.</p>

<p>For <strong>temperature</strong>, things get a little complicated, but here are some general thoughts for different food types.</p>

<p><strong>Baked Goods</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Temperature has to be determined by the foods that are most sensitive to temperature.  These are usually baked goods, which depend on a particular balance of high heat (to rise or create oven spring, and to ""set"" the dough/batter after expansion) and lower heat (to avoid overbrowning or burning before the center is cooked through).  <strong>If you have baked goods involved, you may need your oven set at the temperature required by the baked goods.</strong>  </li>
<li>If you have multiple types of baked goods to bake at the same time, it may or may not be possible to get good results: the best you can do is take something close to an average temperature and pull them out when done.  When in doubt, I'd err on the side of a slightly lower temperature.  Some types of baked goods won't rise as high, but that's often a lesser quality problem to deal with than baked goods that are burned on the outside but raw or dried out on the inside (which can happen with a high temperature).  In fact, despite warnings about the necessity of pre-heating, a surprising number of baked goods can even be successfully baked starting from a cold oven and will still achieve perfectly sufficient rising/oven spring.  However, you will generally need to get up to something close to the recipe temperature to achieve sufficient setting of the batter/dough (before collapse) and then browning.</li>
<li>Any sensitive pastries (and related complex desserts, e.g., souffles) are generally best baked by themselves.  Aside from balancing temperature and timing, the moisture introduced into the oven by other dishes can significantly affect the baking process of pastry.  So, I'd recommend against trying to combine pastry baking with other things unless you really know what you're doing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Roasted Meats/Large Pieces of Roasted Food</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>These are generally quite flexible.  The primary reasons to roast at a high temperature are (1) to achieve adequate browning (with its flavor elements), and (2) to cook at a fast pace.  </li>
<li>If you're flexible, there's no reason to worry about (2).  Roasting at a lower temperature will still get things done, and even doing a ""low and slow"" roast will improve the quality of just about any meat.  There are charts and rules of thumb to estimate different roasting times for meats at various temperatures, but these really can't substitute for a good probe thermometer.  If you're on a schedule, you can make adjustments to the oven temperature to ensure the meat finishes on time.  </li>
<li>As for browning, you can either sear the meat first on the stovetop or in a high oven (probably best for poultry) or do a ""reverse sear"" where you turn the oven up right before serving and blast it with high heat for 5-10 minutes (works well for beef, pork, lamb, etc.).  Also, the reverse sear can give you time to get your other food into serving dishes, make gravy, etc. before serving.</li>
<li>If you're roasting at a higher temperature in order to accommodate baked goods or other foods, the outer layer of meat may get done too quickly.  Covering part or all of the roasting meat with foil may help.  If this is insufficient, cover completely and remove from the oven for a few minutes for the meat to rest and ""even out"" a bit in temperature, then return.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Roasted Vegetables/Small Pieces of Roasted Food</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Again, these are fairly flexible, but if cooked too long they can dry out and shrivel, and if cooked at too low of a temperature, it can take a long time for dense vegetables to soften (e.g., potatoes, carrots, etc.).  </li>
<li>They also often release a lot of moisture into the oven, which can affect other dishes, particularly those where browning is desired.  This latter point applies to most roasted items cut into small pieces.  It is often helpful to temporarily remove any items that release a lot of steam during the browning phase of other foods.  (Cover with foil and return to oven to warm before serving.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Covered Dishes/Casseroles</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The above dishes are often primarily baked uncovered in the oven.  Dishes baked inside of pots or in other covered vessels are usually less sensitive to temperature changes, unless the temperature is really high which can cause some foods to stick and burn to the cooking vessel.  Again, most foods will eventually cook at lower temperatures, though the total time can be hard to predict until you experiment.</li>
<li>Using a cover over some of your dishes will also prevent excess moisture in the oven.  Excess moisture is usually undesirable in most circumstances, since it can interfere with browning.  However, it can be used to your advantage in limited circumstances, such as during the first 10-15 minutes of baking for bread and similar baked goods, when oven spring is required before the crust dries out and sets.</li>
<li>Consider making adjustments as necessary to dishes that request a phase baked covered and another uncovered.  Often continuing the covered bake for a longer time will only result in more tenderness in the dish, and it may be an effective way to allow the oven to be used at a lower temperature with a longer bake.  Just like the ""reverse sear"" for meat, a dish that needs to be uncovered for a final portion of the bake can often be finished with a final high-heat blast or a few minutes under the broiler.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>General Tips and Summary</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Most foods need to achieve a certain doneness level throughout; aside from some baked goods, this can almost always be achieved with a lower oven temperature (to a point -- going below about 250F will introduce complications in some dishes).  Some foods need a specific outside texture, flavor, browning level, etc. which is best achieved at higher heat.  If you need that latter effect, either choose an intermediate temperature, or do a phase at the beginning or ending of baking at higher heat for those items specifically.  Convection oven features can often also be employed for this, if they're available.  </li>
<li>For baked goods, the production/expansion of gas in leavening needs to be balanced with the time that the dough/batter sets, making baked goods more sensitive to temperature.  Unless you know what you're doing (which might involve making adjustments to leavening agents or choosing a different stage of proofing for yeast-based products before baking), baked goods often need to be baked close to their normal recommended temperature.</li>
<li>Overloading: too much food can introduce complications.  Always ensure adequate air circulation is possible around all dishes, but particularly around uncovered ones.  As mentioned above, excess moisture can also be a problem when too many dishes are in the oven, which will influence the speed at which food cooks and browns.</li>
<li>Consider placement of dishes within the oven.  Placement of heating elements will affect this greatly.  But generally speaking -- with ovens that have a heating element on the bottom or bottom and top -- dishes on the bottom of the oven will brown faster on the bottom, while those on the top of the oven will brown faster on the top.  Don't put things that will burn quickly on either surface in the wrong place.  Heat rises, so with a lot of food in the oven, the top of the oven will be hotter (and the temperature difference will be greater when the crowded), so place things that need a higher temperature farther up.</li>

"How do I keep soup from being bland?","67126","","<p>I've been experimenting with soups recently and trying different recipes, and I've found that I often come out with a good soup that's a bit too bland in taste. And yes, salt and pepper makes a huge difference... but it needs something else. Beyond finding the right spice for the right soup, what are some general things that I can do that won't greatly change the flavor but will add some fullness to the flavor?</p>
","<p>This doesn't answer your question directly, but spices are only a small part of the picture. Below are some techniques to get more flavor in your soup.</p>

<h2>Longer Cooking</h2>

<p>Depending on the type of soup you're making, you may just need more time. Some flavors just need more time to get out. This is especially true of meat and bones. It's possible to make a ham and pea soup in an hour, but simmer that ham for 3 hours and it's night and day.</p>

<h2>Rest overnight</h2>

<p>Many stews, chili, etc. seem taste ""better"" the next day. Give an overnight rest in the fridge a shot and see if the flavor improves.</p>

<h2>Add volatile flavors later</h2>

<p>There is a caveat to go along with longer cooking. Some items work over long cooking times, while others lose flavor. In addition to meat/bones, garlic, onion, bay leaves (and others) benefit. Many fresh herbs, pepper, vanilla, saffron (and others) lose their flavor from the heat. If you are cooking for a while, you might try adding some more volatile flavors later in the process.</p>

<h2>Add salt early</h2>

<p>Salt helps to extract flavors, so add it early on in the process. Do be judicious with it, however. Long cooking tends to concentrate flavors, so you can easily make it too salty.</p>

<h2>Sweat vegetables / brown meat</h2>

<p>Before getting any water involved, sweat your onions, celery, peppers, mushrooms, or whatever vegetables or playing in this game.</p>

<p>Likewise, brown your meat. The maillard reaction is necessary for developing great flavor from the meat.</p>

"Can I test my oven temperature without an oven thermometer?","66933","","<p>I've got a new oven, I haven't baked in it enough to really gauge its accuracy. Is there a way to test it without an oven thermometer? </p>
","<p>First, buy a thermometer, they're cheap. This one topped America's Test Kitchen testing: <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00125TABM"" rel=""noreferrer"">Thermometer</a></p>

<p>Barring taking the plunge and spending $6 on an oven thermometer, this method comes straight from an online class I'm taking from Harvard through edX.org. <a href=""https://www.edx.org/course/harvard-university/spu27x/science-cooking-haute-cuisine/639"" rel=""noreferrer"">Course Description</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To test the oven, you can either use an oven thermometer, or you can find a material that has a transition at some critical temperature, and then tune your oven near the critical temperature where the transition occurs -- to find out if it actually happens.</p>
  
  <p>Jeff Potters has suggested a wonderful idea in his excellent book <em>Cooking for Geeks</em>.  Namely, he suggests that oven testing can be done with melting sugar.  His protocol is here.   </p>
  
  <p>The calibration is based on the idea that the melting point of table sugar (sucrose) is 366 F (186˚C), [google ""melting point sucrose""] and so if you put the temperature just above 366, the sugar should melt. And if you put it just below 366 F it should not melt.  It is important when doing this procedure to not use a lot of sugar, as otherwise the heating time for the sugar could be too long. </p>
  
  <p>Materials:</p>
  
  <p>~ 1/2 tablespoon granulated sugar</p>
  
  <p>Procedure:</p>
  
  <p>1) Preheat your oven to 350F (177˚C).</p>
  
  <p>(2) Place the granulated sugar in an oven proof dish or on aluminum foil</p>
  
  <p>(3) Place in oven for 15 minutes</p>
  
  <p>(4) If the sugar doesn't melt, raise the temperature of the oven by 10F (5˚C) and repeat the experiment.</p>
  
  <p>(5) Continue raising the temperature until you find the temperature setting where your sugar melts.  Let's call this temperature <strong>Tmelt</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>(6)  You have thus found that the sugar melts somewhere in the interval <strong>Tmelt-10, Tmelt</strong>. (i.e., if you found that the sugar melted at 400F, but not 390F, the melting temperature is between 390 and 400.)</p>
  
  <p>(7) Your measurement suggests that your oven has the approximate calibration curve</p>
  
  <p><strong>T</strong> = <strong>Tdial</strong> + 366 - <strong>Tmelt</strong>     (if you use degrees Fahrenheit)</p>
  
  <p><strong>T</strong> = <strong>Tdial</strong>+ 186 - <strong>Tmelt</strong>   (if you use degrees Celsius)</p>
  
  <p>where <strong>Tdial</strong> is the temperature of the dial. Note that if your dial says that sugar melts at 400, this formula states that the actual temperature in the oven is the temperature that the sugar melts (366F).""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is another method, this one is from Cook's Illustrated, AKA America's Test Kitchen. I copied and pasted the technique from <a href=""http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071123202445AASqqyv"" rel=""noreferrer"">Water Temp Test</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Preheat oven to 350F. Start with 1 cup of room temperature water and check its temperature with an immersion thermometer. Adjust the temperature with either warm or cold water to make it 70F. place in oven for 15 minutes. Check temperature again and it should read 150F. Adjust oven temperature accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another way to check oven temp is to simply boil water. Put a couple of cups of water in an oven proof pan and set the oven temp to 200F or 90C, the water shouldn't boil no matter how long you leave it in the oven. Set the temp to 225F or 110C. Eventually, the water should boil.</p>

<p>All that said, buy a thermometer.</p>

"How to make thick and fluffy pancakes?","66635","","<p>I recently had thick and fluffy pancakes at a restaurant and I am eager to figure out how to make them.  </p>

<p>Anyone know the secret behind getting thick and fluffy pancakes? Is it adding baking soda? Using carbonated water (does this even work?)? </p>
","<p>Separating the eggs and whipping the egg whites before folding into the batter could assist in this.  At home it's not a problem, but if it's a very busy that you had them in they're not likely to be doing this due to the fact that this will need to be done in batches. </p>

<p>Adding a bit of baking soda in addition to the baking powder could assist as well, but only if you're using buttermilk.  If you're using regular milk the baking soda is going to create a soapy taste. In the case of buttermilk and baking soda, the primary leavening would be coming from the baking powder and then the acidity of the buttermilk would provide the reaction for the soda to give that extra ""oomph"".  If you're using baking soda then you'll have to use the batter right away otherwise those bubble will rise to the surface and pop, releasing their CO2 to the air. Same goes with adding seltzer water...add just before cooking the pancakes.</p>

<p>As for replacing milk with seltzer water...this will add bubbles to the batter but having less fat in the batter (presuming you're using whole milk) will increase the gluten development.  If you're using low-fat or nonfat buttermilk or regular milk it may not be as much of a difference.  The benefit of buttermilk (besides flavor) is the acidity that it provides.  Acidic doughs don't allow gluten to develop as easily and therefore create a more tender texture.</p>

<p>Overmixing pancake batter is a MAJOR issue with most people.  Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, add the liquid ingredients which have already been beaten together and then carefuly fold just until combined so there aren't major pockets of dry ingredients but by no means should the batter be smooth.  Mixing to a smooth consistency will develop gluten and create tough pancakes.  A few lumps are fine as they will hydrate upon sitting.</p>

<p>If you're not using baking soda and seltzer water you can improve tenderness by letting your pancake batter sit after mixing for 30-60 minutes.  This is the idea behind chilling pastry crusts.  It not only allows gluten to relax but mainly it allows the starch granules of the flour to absorb moisture, hydrate, and expand (bloom).  This is could likely be part of what contributed to the pancakes you enjoyed at the restaurant.  If it's a very busy place, most likely they produce their pancake batter in large batches a day ahead for the next day's service.  This extended resting time would allow for maximum hydration of the starch which will make a thicker batter.  The thicker the batter the less spread you'll have on the griddle.  Obviously this provides limitations if you wake up with an appetite for pancakes!</p>

","<p>Professionals ice on a turntable. Turntables for home use are <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0016BPTSU"">affordable</a>, and make icing much easier. </p>

<p>Your spatula should reach to about the centre of the cake when held steady and comfortable. As @rfusca suggests, heating it for buttercream is a good idea. You can also wet it for other icings, to make it glide smoothly. </p>

<p>For the icing process itself, start with the top of the cake. Apply a generous amount of icing; you will be thinning it out with the spatula, not smearing it right and left to get an even thickness. Hold the spatula to an angle to the cake, tip at the centre, and rotate the turntable. Let excess icing drop to the side of the cake. When you have done the top, smear icing thick on the side, hold the spatula vertically, the edge at 45° to the cake side surface, and again turn the turntable. When you have finished, you will have raised icing on the edge of the cake. To finish the cake, smooth these edges. </p>

<p>To do this, you need enough icing. ""The professional chef"" recommends 340 g (12 oz) for a 20 cm (8 in) cake and 454 g (1 lb) for a 25 cm (10 in) cake. </p>

","<p>reference: <a href=""http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/conductive-heat-transfer-d_428.html"">http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/conductive-heat-transfer-d_428.html</a></p>

<p>Let's take a moment to look at the heat transfer equation. Looking at it, we can see the ways to get more efficient heat transfer</p>

<pre><code>q / A = k dT / s 

q / A = heat transfer per unit area (W/m2)
k = thermal conductivity  (W/mK)
dT = temperature difference (oC)
s = wall thickness (m)
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>use a material with a high thermal conductivity constant (like copper)</li>
<li>thinner (!) material</li>
<li>maintain a higher difference in temperature</li>
</ol>

<p>The way these thawers work should now be easy to understand. (1) They are made of a material that has a very high thermal conductivity constant, like copper. The higher a material's thermal conductivity, the faster it can equalize it's temperature with that of the surrounding material.</p>

<p>Things that touch each other <em>want</em> to be the same temperature. When you put an ice cube on a sheet of room temperature copper, they are very different temperatures. But as soon as they touch, they <em>want</em> to be the same temperature, so heat transfer begins. Heat ""flows"" from the copper to the ice, increasing the temperature of the ice (melting it), and decreasing the temperature of the copper. Heat also flows throughout the copper itself, meaning that even the parts of the copper that are far away from the ice are losing heat.</p>

<p>With the copper losing heat, it quickly falls out of temperature equilibrium with the surrounding air. But the air and copper also <em>want</em> to be the same temperature, and so heat from the air ""flows"" into the copper, bringing it back closer to room temperature, which in turn allows the copper to heat up the ice some more.... But of course there aren't distinct steps to this process: all of these heat transfers happen simultaneously and continuously. And as long as the air has some circulation, you can consider it to be an unlimited supply of room temperature heat.</p>

<p>The top of the copper plate is probably flat, to increase the amount of surface area in contact with the ice. The bottom of the copper plate, however, is probably ribbed or finned, to increase the surface area with the surrounding air, but without (2) creating more thickness!</p>

<p>We could also address (3) and heat the copper electrically, above room temperature, but then we run the risk of heating part of the food to that temperature as well. The benefit of using a passive copper heatsink is that the temperature will never rise above room temperature!</p>

<p>I am familiar with the genetic similarities between onions and shallots. I have not personally cooked with shallots because they cost an order of magnitude more than onions.</p>

<p>If it is not just my misperception that shallots are preferred- what qualities do shallots have that make them more popular than onions?<br>
Should I expect shallots to be much more expensive than onions or am I shopping at the wrong places?<br>
In short- are they worth paying more for?</p>
","<p>Shallots certainly aren't more <em>popular</em> than onions, otherwise they'd be far more abundant and less expensive.</p>

<p>I do cook with shallots from time to time and would describe them as most people describe them - as somewhere between the flavour of garlic and onion, but also a good deal milder/sweeter.</p>

<p>I prefer to use them simply when I do not want the strong taste of onions.  In fact, many of us are so accustomed to the harsh taste of onions that it's actually quite a surprise to find out how much better a certain dish might taste by substituting shallots.</p>

<p>They're especially common in Asian cooking, I find.  Very often you're providing a lot of spice or heat from other ingredients - chilies, five spice, curry powder, etc. - and don't want the overwhelming pungency of onions mixed in.  Shallots give just a <em>little bit</em> of ""sharpness"" without much of the sulfur taste.</p>

<p>Would I substitute them <em>everywhere?</em>  Absolutely not.  Some recipes really do call for the pungency of onions, for example almost anything involving ground beef.  But try it at least once - get yourself a bag of shallots and try substituting them for onions in a few recipes.  You may be pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p>I would say that ideal recipes to try this on, if you're unfamiliar with shallots, are stovetop recipes calling for a relatively small amount of chopped or sliced (not minced) onion; stir fries are ideal, which perhaps is why they seem to be so common in Asian cuisine. </p>

If you meant that literally and are finding them close to 10x more expensive than onions, then you are either shopping at the wrong stores or living in an area where they are hard to find.

"How much is a bunch of spinach?","64660","","<p>I have some recipies for green smoothies, where some of the ingredients are for example ""1 bunch of spinach"" or ""1/2 bunch of spinach"".</p>

<p>The spinach I've found in the store are usually fresh leaves packed in a plastic bag of for example roughly 250 grams... But, how much is a bunch?</p>
","<p>A bunch of spinach usually weighs something like 250-500 grams. My best guess is that something like half that is the stems, which can easily be as long as the leaves. So very roughly, I'd say a bunch is 125-250 grams. Alternately, if you want to go by volume (e.g. if your store has bulk loose baby spinach), think of a bunch as something like a head of lettuce, except with the bottom third to half mostly stems.</p>

<p>Full-size spinach also definitely gets a lot better than 4x6 cm leaves, so you may still be using somewhat more tender baby spinach, but that of course won't cause you any problems. (The stems on baby spinach are tender enough to eat, especially when blending, so you can use everything in your bags.)</p>

"What causes tea to be bitter, and how can I avoid that bitterness?","64579","","<p>How does tea become bitter between the moment it is packaged and the moment I drink it? Are there any chemical processes that take place when tea is stored or brewed that I can control to prevent making a cup of bitter tea?</p>

<p>If the causes of bitterness vary between different types of tea, I'd like to know that as well.</p>
","<h1>Storing Tea</h1>

<p>You tea should never become bitter due to your storage methods. The only thing that should happen to tea as a result of how you store it is general loss of flavor or loss of the <em>complexity</em> of flavor (in a green tea, you might lose any honey or fruit notes of a tea that has been improperly stored, but it'll still taste like green tea). </p>

<p>There are a couple of factors at play when storing tea. The first is <strong>light</strong>. Exposure to light will degrade the quality of tea, stripping it of both color and flavor. Light also sets off <a href=""http://www.maunakeatea.com/tea-talk/tea-storage/145-keeping-your-tea-fresh-part-2-light"">a chain of reactions that destroys the antioxidants found in tea</a>. So, you should store your tea in a light-blocking container (like a typical metal tea tin).</p>

<p>The next factor is <strong>air</strong>. Tea needs to be stored in a place that does not have any strong-smelling other foods or chemicals because it absorbs other odors very easily. In addition, tea absorbs moisture from the air, so it needs to be stored in a dry place. <strong>Moisture</strong> can cause several different problems with your tea: it could start binding to the tannins and make your tea taste bitter when you eventually brew it, and excess moisture could provide breeding grounds for bacteria or fungus, which would make your tea unfit for brewing at all. So, store your tea in an airtight container that blocks moisture and any other nearby odors. Vacuum sealing is not necessary, unless you want to keep a batch of tea for a long time without using it at all.</p>

<p>I haven't found any evidence supports claims of oxidation affecting taste more than moisture or light. Different types of tea are created by oxidizing tea leaves (white teas are the least oxidized, black teas the most, and greens and oolongs are somewhere in between), so oxidation is not inherently bad for tea.</p>

<p><strong>To sum it up: Protect your tea from the harmful effects of light, moisture, ambient odors, and air by storing it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.</strong> If stored properly, most kinds of tea leaves should retain most of their flavor for about two years, though fresher is always better. (Some teas, like Japanese green teas, are traditionally only stored for about 3 months.)</p>

<h1>Brewing Tea</h1>

<p>In order to achieve the best taste, brew tea according to the processor's instructions (at least to start with - once you become more familiar with tea and what you like, you can adjust according to taste). The tea manufacturer's want their tea to taste good, and they are experts, so you can rely on them to provide decent instructions. I've never bought tea that didn't have instructions for brewing right on the package, but in case you find some that don't have instructions, here are some general guidelines. I've taken this from Upton Tea's <a href=""http://www.uptontea.com/shopcart/information/INFObriefguide.pdf"">Brief Guide to Tea</a>, and it corresponds to my own experience with making tea and chatting with tea importers / shop owners, too.</p>

<h2>Whole Leaf Teas</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>black teas</strong>: boiling (212 F) water, steep for 3-4 minutes; if serving with milk or lemon, steep 4-5 minutes</li>
<li><strong>green teas</strong>: slightly less than boiling (180 F), steep 2-3 minutes</li>
<li><strong>oolong teas</strong>: lighter oolongs use warm (180 F) water, steep for 2-3 minutes</li>
<li><strong>white teas</strong>: less than boiling (180 F) water, steep for 2-3 minutes</li>
<li><strong>herbal tisanes</strong>: boiling (212 F) water, steep for 5-8 minutes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fanning, Crushed Leaves, or Powder</h2>

<ul>
<li>This is what most pre-bagged teas are, and since they have been processed to be finer, they require a shorter brewing time. (Finer leaves means more surface area, so you get more tannins per second when brewing, compared to tea leaves in larger pieces.)</li>
<li>Use guidelines above, but brew for 1-1.5 minutes <em>less</em> than whole leaf teas</li>
</ul>

<p>The bitter taste comes from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannin"">tannins</a>. There are two ways for tea to become unpleasantly bitter: steeping at too high a temperature, or steeping for too long. (It's also possible that if your water is heavily chlorinated or otherwise impure that it could be making your tea taste bad, but that's far less likely than improper brewing.) If you're making tea from loose tea leaves, using too many leaves could also make your tea bitter; a good rule of thumb is 1 teaspoon of tea per 8 oz of water, though this can vary depending on the type of tea you're making.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the longer you brew tea, the more tannins will be released and the bitterer the tea will be. If you use the times above as a starting point, you shouldn't get any overly bitter tea, but remember: each batch of tea is unique, and each tea drinker's taste is different. Experiment until you find what <em>you</em> consider to be the perfect cup of tea.</p>

<p>Lastly, start with good quality tea. Some tea is poorly processed and the flavor is ruined before you've even opened the package. If you start with a high-quality tea, you're much more likely to get good results. :)</p>

<p>Is this safe or is there a better way without putting it in the fridge right away and subjecting my already cold foods to heat/steam?</p>
","<p>I tend to agree that you're probably not going to kill someone, trying to apply restaurant standards to domestic environments is pretty difficult because they are very different in scale but obviously the fundamentals apply.</p>

<p>Putting food in a different container and then in an ice bath is reasonable if you're worried about condensation or heating up your fridge.

<p>How can I tell whether it's still safe to eat?</p>
","<p>Generally, raw beetroot shouldn't become soft. The thing is that there are differing definitions of soft. If it is soft like a tomato is, then it has probably spoiled. If, on the other hand, it is still firm but has little ""give"" to it, then it's probably alright to eat.</p>

<p>It is the cooking that softens it up, though it can be eaten raw. I grate some raw beetroot into salads and stuff occasionaly, just for fun.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what to say about the smell thing. I think that raw beetroot generally smells a little earthy, especially if you haven't peeled it yet. The very distinct beetroot smell is usually released by cooking.</p>

<p>Obviously this is all a bit vague, as we can't send smells over the net yet.</p>

"How to make puffed/popped rice?","63626","","<p>Is it possible to make puffed rice at home like the rice used in breakfast cereals? I have a hot air popcorn maker and have experimented with that with little success. </p>

<p>I imagine the problem is to do with the moisture content of the rice, so far I've only tried with dried Basmati. Does it need moisture to expand to create the puffed effect? If so does par boiling the rice work? If so how long would I need to do it to get the ideal moisture content.</p>
","<p>Interesting question.  Did search 'how do I make puffed rice'.  Came up with some interesting information.</p>

<p>There are some writings that suggest that puffed rice can be made like popcorn; get the moisture in the grains of rice to the correct level (no idea what the level should be, experimentation should guide you I suppose) and then (depending on what source you read) put in a popcorn popper, put it on sheets in the oven or fry it in oil.</p>

<p>The history indicates that the first puffed rice made in the U.S. was actually shot from a cannon, after, I presume, being thoroughly soaked to some level of softness; there was a cereal advert in the '60s that bragged ""this is the cereal that's shot from guns"".  Am thinking that the softening of the rice, probably by cooking, and then putting it into a pressure vessel in which the pressure is allowed to rise to a certain PSI (pounds per square inch) and explosively releasing the pressure, causes the grains to boil or fizz or effervesce, gives them the light puffiness we see at the market.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sous Vide</strong>: 10 minutes or more at 56°C, followed by a quick broiling/grilling/blow torch.</li>

<li><strong>Poaching</strong>: I like to add the fish to the cooking liquid while the liquid is room temperature.  I bring it to a simmer, and then turn the heat to low, cover, and cook for about 15 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Pan Frying</strong>: This isn't quite as popular a method as the above for cooking cod, however, if you want to do it, I would recommend cooking it on high heat, flipping once the opaqueness has reached about halfway up the side of the fillet.</li>

This way the outermost layer will start to undergo the maillard reaction long before the inside of the steak reaches a medium-rare temp and will give you a better chance of preventing it from overcooking. </p>

<p>This link provides an overview of the process for a much larger piece of meat then your using but the searing process is what your concerned most with since your steaks are so thin.

"Boiling Chicken Breast (or any meat) before cooking to cook evenly","61999","","<p>Good day. I've had another disagreement with my mother on how to cook Chicken Breast. I know it seems like a small topic and it is situational, but do consider it.</p>

<p>The scenario is this, let's say you forget to take the Chicken Breast (whole, not chopped or butterfly cut) out the freezer and you need to cook it as soon as possible, OR you want to make sure you don't over cook the chicken as you fry it since they can get thick sometimes and you don't know if you cooked it all throughout. </p>

<p>In that scenario, my mother believes that it is okay to boil the chicken meat first in water before frying it. Her logic is that boiling actually cooks the inside evenly without burning the outside and frying gives it color. </p>

<p>However, I think that boiling the chicken takes the flavor away, just like how chicken bones are boiled to make stocks. Also, I think that boiling the chicken for too long causes the chicken to dry out (just like overcooking it). </p>

<p>I tried to tell her that butterflying it would be the best solution to cooking the chicken breast evenly, next to cooking it in the right temperature to not boil it (which seals the flavor inside) and then putting it in the oven (optional). </p>

<p>What do you guys think? Is boiling meat that detrimental to the flavor and overall quality of the dish?</p>
","<p>Short answer - you are right on all counts and she's wrong. Tell her that, she'll love it. ;) </p>

<p>The longer answer is that boiling a frozen piece of meat, especially one that is thick in the middle  like chicken breast is exactly the opposite of what you want to do as you'll cook the outside but the inside will still be frozen, and boiling (as you rightly point out) will remove flavor from what is already IMO flavorless to begin with. Any cooking method will dry the chicken out whether boiling, baking, or frying, so by cooking twice you are liable to end up with food that is overcooked on the outside and undercooked on the inside. </p>

<p>Cooking frozen chicken isn't a great idea from a safety and quality perspective but it can be done if the meat is cut thin, so your point about butterflying it is very valid. What I do personally is I thaw chicken meat (thighs in my case) partially in the microwave, then I slice it into 1/2"" (about 1.3cm) pieces across the grain before cooking in a saute/stir fry of some sort. I like partially rather than fully thawing in the microwave because it gives a better taste/texture than a full thaw in the microwave, and it is very easy to slice when partially frozen. </p>

","<p>The spark was a voltage jumping over a gap somewhere. This may occur again, but so long as the magnetron survives, you should be okay.  The problem with sparks is they can leave a carbon trail deep inside which is conductive and may actually make the next spark occur at a slightly lower voltage. If this happens enough, you will eventually (or shortly) damage the unit and make it unusable.  </p>

"What should I do if power goes out while I am baking cake/cookies?","61681","","<p>If I am baking cake or cookies in the oven and I lose power, what should I do?</p>

<p>Does it make to sense to leave the cake/cookies in the oven until the power comes back on, or should I take them out?</p>

<p>When/why would I need to leave them in the oven vs. take them out?</p>
","<p>Removing things from the oven halfway through is not very friendly to baked goods. In general, they'll collapse as they cool off since the structure isn't cooked and set, and the leavening (baking soda/powder in these cases) will be spent, so there's no way to get what you originally wanted. It might be something like what'd happen if you forgot the leavening in the first place.</p>

<p>In general: if there's only 5-15 minutes left, just leave it in, and the heat retained by the oven will take care of things. If it's barely started - just beginning to get warm, not bubbling/rising much - probably best to take it out and wait to bake later, especially if it's something that can survive waiting at room temperature. Anything else, leave it in and hope the power comes back; it's going to be ruined if you take it out and ruined if the power doesn't come back on so you might as well go for it.</p>

<p>So for example, cookies could probably survive this by leaving them in. They don't have very long baking times - somewhere in the 5-15 minute range. Your oven won't cool off all that much in that time without power. So if you leave them in for a little bit longer than the original baking time, they'll probably be fine. If your oven has a window, look in with a flashlight to check on them - you don't want to open it to check them.</p>

<p>A cake is iffier. If it's 15 minutes into a 45 minute baking time, you may just be out of luck. I think I'd still leave it in, hoping that the power comes back within 5-10 minutes, in which case it'd probably make it. As I mentioned earlier, if you lose power early and for long enough, the cake will have spent its leavening and collapsed. You could finish baking it, but it'll still be collapsed - it probably won't have a terribly palatable texture (definitely dense, maybe chewy).</p>

<p>The only time this has actually happened to me was with some cornbread muffins, around 2/3 of the way through their baking time, and the oven didn't have a window. I wildly guessed how much extra time to add, pulled them out then, and they were great. So there is hope!</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me how to make the perfect light and airy cake?</p>
","<p>What you are making is a pound cake. Or maybe a sponge cake, depends on the order of mixing the ingredients. Of the two, the sponge cake is somewhat lighter, so if you have been making pound cake (cream butter and sugar, add eggs, then flour), you can switch to sponge (foam eggs and sugar, add flour and fat). But both are hearty homemade cakes, they are supposed to be dense. </p>

<p>The iced cakes you get in a bakery are much lighter, because they use a different type of layer. Most types of cake are lighter than pound and sponge cakes. Try making genoise, chiffon, or angel food cake layers, they are all light. And yes, using cake flour will help too, or replacing part of the flour in the recipe with pure starch (usually cornstarch or potato starch, you can also use wheat starch if you can get it. Tapioca or arrowroot aren't that well suited). For a real ""pro"" taste, also throw in some lecithine, it makes the mouthfeel softer and smoother - but if you don't feel like hunting around for lecithine, don't bother, a good homemade cake doesn't really need it, I only mentioned it because you asked about ""cake made by a pro"". </p>

"How to measure 7g yeast and 10g salt without a proper scale?","60981","","<p>I have a 10g precision kitchen scale and I need to measure 7g yeast and 10g salt. So I need to use teaspoon here, the following is the teaspoon I usually use and I wonder if it's the correct one. Is there any other method I could use to measure the yeast and salt that recipe calls for? </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/t1PHs.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://www.traditionaloven.com/culinary-arts/cooking/table-salt/convert-gram-g-to-tea-spoon-tsp.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this site</a> to convert grams to teaspoons, it says </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2.5 tsp of yeast equals 7 g yeast </p>
  
  <p>1.75 tsp of table salt equals 10 g table salt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that correct? </p>
","<p>(1)  <strong>A packet of yeast is typically 7g exactly</strong>.  So if you're buying yeast by the packet, use one packet.  But assuming you will be measuring from bulk yeast, the correct measure by volume would be <strong>2 1/4 tsp</strong> instead of 2 1/2 tsp.</p>

<p>(2)  The weight of salt relative to its volume varies considerably depending on what salt you are using - the best way to work out the appropriate conversion for the salt you have on hand is to consult the Nutrition Facts on the back of the container.  Most salt gives the nutritional information based on 1/4 tsp. - but the weight of this amount of salt depends on the type of salt and size of grain.</p>

<p>Here's how you do the math.  </p>

<p>Start with the information on the back of your package - for example, let's use my Fine Mediterranean Sea Salt - <strong>1/4 tsp. = 1.2 g</strong>.</p>

<p>Multiply both sides by 4 to get the weight of 1 tsp. - <strong>1 tsp. = 4.8 g</strong> - i.e. 4.8 g. per tsp.</p>

<p>You need 10 g - so divide 10 g by 4.8 to get the number of tsp. you should use - <strong>10 / 4.8 = a little more than 2 tsp.</strong></p>

<p>You really should get your measurement this way instead of relying on a generic conversion formula.  There is significant variability from salt-to-salt.  Another salt I use has a label that states <strong>1/4 tsp. = .7 g</strong> (the crystals are larger so the same 1/4 tsp. now weighs much less than the sea salt).</p>

<p><strong>1/4 tsp. = .7 g</strong>.  (multiply both sides by 4)</p>

<p><strong>1 tsp. = 2.8 g</strong>.</p>

<p>So this salt is <strong>2.8 g. per tsp</strong>.</p>

<p>You need 10 g - <strong>10 / 2.8 = a little more than 3.5 tsp.</strong></p>

<p>This method works because spoilage is halted by freezing... but not reversed.  Once you thaw, the process picks back up where it left off.  A few days in the fridge after thawing should be fine, assuming you don't wait until right before expiration to freeze the chicken.</p>

"Is it okay to keep flour in the freezer?","60196","","<p>Years ago I noticed I was getting little bugs in the flour that I kept in the pantry.  To prevent this, I started keeping my flour in the freezer.  I don't do a lot of baking, but I was wondering what effects this might have on anything I do bake.</p>

<p>Do baked goods turn out any differently when flour is kept in the freezer vs flour kept at room temperature?  Also, if it's okay to freeze flour, how long will it last this way?</p>
","<p>Yes, of course you can keep flour in the freezer.  For whole wheat flour, which is susceptible to rancidity due to the fat from the whole grain being included, it is even recommended.</p>

<p>For white flour, according to the <a href=""http://lancaster.unl.edu/food/ftfeb03.htm#flour"">University of Nebraska Extension in Lancaster County</a> (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For longer storage, keep white flours in the refrigerator in an
  airtight container. All-purpose and bread flour will keep up to two
  years at 40 F in your refrigerator, according to the Wheat Foods
  Council. <strong>They can be stored indefinitely in the
  freezer.</strong></p>

"How to avoid getting the pizza all watery?","59974","","<p>When I cook pizza it gets all watery. There's literarily water formed on top of the dough. I believe it's released by the mozzarella, but I'm not totally sure.<br>
Any ideas how to avoid this?</p>

<p>Some more information: I'm cooking at around 230C (according to the oven, who knows!) with an electric oven. No stone, just the metal tray. The pizza has exactly the same shape as the metal tray (which is a rectangle, just as the oven).</p>

<p>According to my last experiments, the source of the water is definitely the cheese. I'm cooking the dough, then adding the tomato sauce, then adding the cheese and the water doesn't appear until the cheese-phase. I tried all the possible mozzarellas that I can get at the supermarket with the same result.</p>
","<p>There are a number of factors that can contribute to a watery pizza:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cheese</strong> If you think the cheese is the culprit, you can try using a ""low moisture"" mozzarella (these are dry to the touch on the outside).  If you are using a ""fresh"" mozzarella (these usually are sold in a brine), <em>e.g.</em>, classic <em>mozzarella di bufala</em> or <em>mozzarella fior di latte</em>, I recommend slicing the cheese as opposed to grating the cheese.  The idea is that slicing the cheese will produce less surface area, and thereby reduce the amount of water that leeches out.  Also, I recommend dabbing the cheese slices with a kitchen towel to remove any surface moisture.  If you use this method, it will also help to cut the cheese in very thin slices, since that will release more moisture before it touches the pizza and it will also reduce the amount of cooking time.</li>
<li><strong>Tomato Sauce</strong> I recommend making the sauce yourself.  As opposed to simmering the tomatoes/sauce on the stove for a long time, I prefer making a light tomato sauce that actually cooks on the pizza itself.  I quickly purée the tomatoes (canned are fine) in a food processor and then let them strain in a fine mesh colander for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.  That gets rid of a lot of water (the tomatoes lose about half of their volume).  Throw in some minced garlic, chopped basil, and season and it is ready to go on the pizza.</li>
<li><strong>The Cooking Method</strong> Since my home oven doesn't get as hot as a traditional pizza oven, I always ""blind"" cook my pizza without the cheese.  In other words, I throw the dough, add the sauce, and then cook it with just the sauce for 4 or 5 minutes.  This allows any extra moisture in the sauce to cook off.  I then remove the pizza, add the cheese, and then broil it until the cheese is melted and browned.</li>
<li><strong>The Dough</strong> If the dough ends up becoming soggy, you can always compensate by making it a bit thicker.</li>

","<p>Although ours rarely lasts for more than a week, we typically just store it in an airtight container with the rest of the cereal.

"When I'm separating egg whites, how much does it matter if a little yolk gets in?","59528","","<p>I was separating egg whites today and one of the yolks broke and contaminated my bowl of whites. I started from scratch, but I'm wondering if I really needed to; would a tiny bit of yolk (say, 1/8 tspn in 4 egg whites) mixed in with the whites make a big difference?</p>

<p>To provide some context, I was about to whip the whites with castor sugar to make almond macaroons.</p>
","<p>Yes, it matters a lot. When you are separating egg whites, it is for whipping them into a foam. This foam is a protein-based foam, relying on protein ends hooking into each other. Even small traces of fat will prevent the foam from forming. Egg yolks contain high amounts of fat. Once an egg yolk breaks in your whites, you have to start the separation anew, because it can prevent your foam from forming. Also, don't use plastic bowls for whipping egg whites (their surface retains some fat molecules even after washing, giving you a less stable foam) and only whip with a cleanly washed whisk or mixer attachment (not one you have just used for something else, not even if you wiped it clean). </p>

<p>To prevent big mishaps, just separate each new egg in a teacup and only add the new white to the old whites after it has separated cleanly. Else you are in big trouble if you are separating a lot and the last egg contaminates the whole whites with yolk. And a single contaminated egg is easily reused for a quick egg-and-feta sandwich or something else. </p>

<p>Contamination the other way round isn't so worrisome. You still want to work as precisely as possible, as yolk-only recipes will often have somewhat worse texture if eggwhite is included, but small contaminating amounts are usually not noticeable in the finished product, even in foams (zabaglione, mayonnaise). This is because yolk foams are fat-based, and small amounts of protein don't prevent a fat foam from forming. </p>

"What are the acceptable methods to thaw food items?","59206","","<p>What are the proper ways to thaw foods?   Are there any advantages or disadvantages to them?</p>
","<p>There are four methods for thawing frozen foods which are recognized as safe:</p>

<ul>
<li>In a refrigerator</li>
<li>In the microwave</li>
<li>Under cool running water</li>
<li>As part of the cooking process</li>
</ul>

<p>These four methods all meet the criteria that they minimize the amount of time the food spends in the danger zone (40-140 F, 4-60 C) where bacteria can grow.</p>

<p>The pros and cons of the following often-recommended methods are also reviewed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Leaving food on the counter overnight</li>
<li>Thawing in a bowl (or sink) of water</li>
<li>On a metal pan or with a ""miracle thaw"" device</li>
</ul>

<h3>In the refrigerator</h3>

<p>Thawing food in the refrigerator is slow; it can take a day to thaw several pounds (a kilogram or two), and even more time for larger foods like a whole frozen turkey.</p>

<p>The advantage is that the refrigerator is at a safe temperature, and bacterial growth is already inhibited, so there is little risk.</p>

<p>This is probably the preferred method for many foods, if you have the time.</p>

<h3>In the microwave</h3>

<p>Thawing in the microwave is fast, but it has several disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It requires a lot of attention, turning or rotating the food to get even coverage from the microwaves; for items like ground beef, you might even need to scrape off the thawed portions and continue defrosting the frozen portion.</p></li>
<li><p>It is easy to accidently go to far and start cooking the food, especially if it has an odd shape or small pointier parts sticking out (like wings on a chicken).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For this reason, microwave thawing is best done only for foods like soup or stew, where you can stir them and if one part boils a small amount while another part is frozen, no harm is done.</p>

<h3>Under cool running water</h3>

<p>This one is most surprising, but it is true:  the fastest way to thaw food safely is under cool <em>running</em> water (at or below 70 F / 21 C), like the cold water from your tap.</p>

<p>The reason is that that water has an extremely high capacity for carrying heat, and the forced convection from running water ensures that it transfers heat from the food item as rapidly as possible.  In the Good Eats episode <em><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO5s6mEU08A"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">What's Up Duck</a></em>, Alton Brown thawed several frozen ice duck sculptures by various methods.   The one under cool running water was almost completely melted, even when the one in the oven at 200 F was still fairly recognizably bird shaped.</p>

<p>It is important that the water be running, to ensure strong convection.  You can do this by setting the food in the sink under a very small stream of water.</p>

<p>If the food should not get wet, you can put it in a zip-type bag or similar to keep it dry.  Try to remove as much air as possible, to get the best contact between the water and the food (through the bag).</p>

<p>This is the best method for forced, rapid thawing (at least when microwaving is not appropriate or inconvenient), but it is probably less convenient that the refrigerator method.   You also have to monitor the food, and remove it when it is thawed, or it will come to the ambient temperature of the water, which is probably in the danger zone.</p>

<h3>As part of the cooking process</h3>

<p>Some foods can be cooked starting from the frozen state, thawing and then cooking in one operation.</p>

<p>Among the ones most suitable for this are are smaller or thinner items, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cookie dough lumps</li>
<li>Hamburgers</li>
<li>Chicken parts</li>
<li>Pizza</li>
<li>Stew meat</li>
<li>Frozen, chopped vegetables</li>
<li>Frozen stock (at least in smaller quantities)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Bad idea: on the Counter overnight</h3>

<p>This is a <em>bad</em> idea, especially for meats and other highly perishable items.   You have no control over the temperature the surface of the food will reach, and it may begin to spoil at the surface before the center is thawed.</p>

<h3>Bad idea: In a bowl (or sink) of cold water</h3>

<p>Again, a bad idea.  Without the convection, the thawing speed is reduced.  There is also no source of newer, cooler water, so the temperature of the water itself will rise.</p>

<p>Some parts of the food may reach dangerous temperatures before it is fully thawed.  Also, if you don't check the food frequently, the temperature can get into dangerous territories, facilitating spoilage.</p>

<h3>Risky: On a cast iron, stainless steel or other metal pan, or a ""miracle thaw"" device</h3>

<p>This method is most often used with thin foods like steaks or frozen hamburgers.  </p>

<p>Physics are with you, as the specific heat capacity and conductivity of the metal are very high (higher even than water).  The large surface area of the metal acts like a radiator or heat sink in reverse, conducting heat away from the food more rapidly than air alone would.</p>

<p>This method <em>is not approved by health codes for commercial use</em>, and carries some risks.  You need to monitor the food closely, and cook it or move it into the refrigerator as soon as it is thawed.  Failure to do so will allow the food to spoil, and the conductivity of your metal will become your enemy, more quickly bringing the food to ambient temperature.</p>

<p>While this method is not officially sanctioned, you may choose to assess its risks for yourself.</p>

","<p>For different food types there is no single correct answer, as it is very dependent on the specific microwave energy absorption and reflectance characteristics of each item (food and container) in the microwave oven</p>

<p>It's possible to put one item in which has a high absorbency and one with a low absorbency, and to have one fully cooked and the other still cold</p>

<p>e.g. 250 g of potato takes 6 minutes in your microwave oven, then 500 g may take 9 minutes not 12 minutes, and 1 Kg may take only 12 minutes, until you reach the equilibrium point of no further improvement (about 1 Kg for my domestic microwave oven)</p>

"How long to cook pork ribs in the oven?","58568","","<p>tl;dr:  I've got 6 lb of super-thick pork shoulder country style ribs.  How long should I cook them in the oven if I want them to taste good? </p>

<p>I recently bought a 6 lb. package of delicious, super-thick pork shoulder country-style ribs.  But I bought them without any idea on how to cook them.  So I started looking online for recipes but the cooking times vary considerably.  My best assumption is that the cooking times vary due to the quantity of meat and temperature.  However, I've had trouble estimating exactly how much meat is present since some of the recipes list the rib ingredient as simply ""one rack"" or something ambiguous like that.  I don't really know how much ""one rack"" is.  ""One rack"" of baby back ribs is, I'm quite sure, much less mean than what I've got sitting in my refrigerator. </p>

<p>So, how long should I cook these babies for?</p>
","<p>Even given a standardized recipe and method, cooking times are always only a guideline.  Quality recipes always give you a <em>test</em> for knowing when the product is done.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that there are many uncontrolled (at least from the recipe author's point of view) such as, in the case of ribs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exact dimensions of the ribs</li>
<li>Natural variation in the composition of the ribs</li>
<li>Starting temperature</li>
<li>Variation in your particular oven</li>
</ul>

<p>That said, the variable most controlling over the time it takes to cook ribs, given a standard recipe and method, is the <em>thickness</em> of the set of ribs.   A longer strip of ribs (btw, the full set of ribs on one side is called a <em>slab</em> of ribs&mdash;country ribs are not normally sold this way) doesn't make much difference, as the heat will penetrate through the thinnest dimension.</p>

<p>Ribs are a complex food to cook as they benefit from low-and-slow cooking methods, which allow the touch connective tissue of the ribs (collagen) to slowly convert to unctuous gelatin.  This conversion is temperature dependent, taking many, many many hours at around 140 F, but happening in an hour or two at 180 F.</p>

<p>Note also that <em><a href=""http://www.porkbeinspired.com/Cut_Country-StyleRibs.aspx"">country style ribs</a></em> are a different cut than <em><a href=""http://www.porkbeinspired.com/Cut_BackRibs.aspx"">back ribs</a></em> (the baby variety come from a younger, smaller animal).  Country style ribs are cut with a lot of meat on the bone.</p>

<p>In practical recipes, the amount of time this takes will depend on the exact cooking method such as braising, roasting, or barbequing.</p>

<p>Recipe request themselves are off-topic here at Seasoned Advise, but you can find many recipes easily by googling ""<a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=country%20rib%20recipe&amp;rlz=1C1CHKZ_enUS438US438&amp;oq=country%20rib%20recipe"">country rib recipe</a>"".  Indivdual recipes will give you a guideline for a basic cooking time related to the method used in that recipe, and a test or condition for knowing when they are done.</p>

<p>For example, this recipe for <a href=""http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/melissa-darabian/braised-country-style-pork-ribs-recipe/index.html"">braised rib</a>s from the Food Network suggests an estimated cooking time of 1 1/2 hour braising, and tells you that they are done when when the meat is tender (which you would test by poking with a fork, or just trying some).</p>

<p>An alternate method, as suggested in <a href=""http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,1827,151178-240204,00.html"">this recipe</a> from Cooks.com is to roast the ribs in the oven.  They use three-stage method where the ribs are covered in foil in the middle stage, but the total cooking time is about 3 1/4 hours.  They carefully describe how you know when the ribs are done: ""the meat should just about fall off the bone."".</p>

<p>Note:  I haven't tried these particular recipes; they only serve as examples.</p>

<p>The bottom line is, ribs are generally done when they are quite tender, which you can easily tell by poking them with a fork or trying them.  How long this takes will depend on what method you used, the size of your ribs, and a myriad other factors, but will be on the order usually of 2-3 hours.</p>

"Why is it necessary to preheat an oven?","58012","","<p>Just about every recipe advises to preheat the oven before using it. I often forget this, but luckily this doesn't seem to matter all that much. Hence my question: why would it be necessary to preheat the oven?    </p>
","<p>When you don't preheat, you cook your food at a lower temperature as your oven heats up for the first 5-15 minutes, depending on the target temperature and your oven's strength.</p>

<p>For forgiving foods, like a casserole, this may not affect you much - you'll just have to bake longer than the recipe says to. As long as you're careful, you'll be fine.</p>

<p>But if you're baking something that should be baked for a short time at a relatively high temperature, your results are going to be very different. For example, take traditional Southern biscuits: they're baked very hot for less than ten minutes. This cooks them all the way through, and browns the top and bottom. If your oven starts out cold, they're going to be done in the middle before they're brown! Beyond under-browning, you'll also run into problems like lack of rising in steam-leavened foods. Pastries, in particular, could probably be disastrous.</p>

"How to make baking soda","57855","","<p>I'm in a place where buying baking soda is proving to be quite difficult<sup>*</sup>, so I was looking for substitutions, and it seems there <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/7821/substitution-for-baking-soda"">really aren't any</a>.  So this got me thinking:  Baking soda is made (or otherwise harvested from nature) in <em>some</em> way.</p>

<p>How can I do this?</p>

<p>I realize the answer is likely to be so involved or expensive that I won't want to undertake the project, but for the determined baker, how would it be done?</p>

<p><sup>*I eventually found some.</sup></p>

<h2>NOTE: The question is about <em>making</em>, not sourcing or substituting, baking soda.</h2>

<ol>
<li>What can you get? </li>
<li>Do you know how to handle these safely?</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have a solution of carbonic acid (H2CO3) you can slowly mix in sodium hydroxide (NaOH - in a solution, not a powder!) until the pH is around 10.3, then you'll have a solution of NaHCO3. Or you could do the same thing by bubbling CO2 through a solution of NaOH.</p>

<p>You'll then need to dry or concentrate it without heating, or the NaHCO3 will break down (just like it would when baking).</p>

<p>Or you could start with sodium carbonate and add hydrochloric acid, but that would give you equal parts of baking soda and table salt in water, not sure how easy they would be to separate.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that sodium hydroxide will dissolve any flesh that it touches, and hydrochloric acid will do the same, plus it evaporates.</p>

"Why did my grandfather-in-law salt his beer?","57444","","<p>My grandfather-in-law was born in England in the 1920s and fought in World War II. Somewhere along the line he acquired the habit of salting his beer before drinking it, which persisted for the rest of his life. I'm as curious about the cultural genesis of the practice as the food science of it – was there perhaps something about wartime beer that made it unpalatable without salt? I know there were other wartime food customs like <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bread_and_scrape"">bread and scrape</a> so it doesn't seem implausible, but the ""why"" of this one isn't so obvious.</p>
","<p>I can think of several reasons why you might salt beer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Salt is a natural flavor enhancer, so you'd be able to taste the hops and malt more</li>
<li>Salt reduces perceived bitterness, so overly hopped beer would taste less bitter</li>
<li>The salt crystals may nucleate bubble formation, giving the beer more head (briefly)</li>
</ul>

<p>I've heard of it being done before, but never with good beer, only low quality swill.  But then, since there were more quality problems with cheap brews at the time, this was probably a lot more common.</p>

"Removing that eggy smell from cakes","57409","","<p>I've been baking for not that long now and I usually peruse the web and the hundreds of books I have at home before I attempt a recipe. However there is one thing I am just not able to get down right. </p>

<p>Whenever a cake or something involving eggs is baked, I get a really strong eggy smell that puts me off. Even after it has cooled down, the egg smell and taste remains. But I don't notice this in cakes from stores or bakeries. I don't know what to do to neutralize this, or is it completely normal?</p>

<p>I use brown farm fresh eggs that aren't pumped full of stuff (at least that's what they say on the packaging).</p>

<p>Update: I will try to figure out what the cheap eggs taste like in the next cake that i bake. Furthermore, i will also compare with results i obtain from a new professional line oven that i am purchasing soon. One of these is the culprit, since whenever i eat baked goods elsewhere this issue is rarely experienced.</p>
","<p>It is normal that eggs smell of eggs, yes. Some people are just more sensitive to certain smells than others and detect them in smaller amounts, and sometimes all people perceive a smell with equal strength, but a few will have a negative reaction to a smell commonly regarded as pleasant. </p>

<p>If you react with unusual aversion to the smell of baked eggs, there is nothing you can do about it. If you are indeed using standard recipes from widespread books, they probably smell OK to the general public. </p>

<p>There is no way to remove the smell of eggs. But you can do two things: </p>

<ul>
<li>avoid overcooking the eggs. When somebody finds the eggs smell unpleasant, they are usually reacting to the sulfur compounds egg proteins form under high temperatures. This is not a universal solution, because a properly baked cake has been exposed to temperatures high enough to form lots of these compounds. But in dishes which can be overcooked, such as custards or boiled eggs, less cooking is usually much better smellwise. </li>
<li>choose recipes with less eggs. This will mean that you will have to restrict your cake eating habits a lot. Genoise is probably completely out of the question, but if your sensitivity also shows at pound cake and similar, then there aren't many traditional types you can bake. It is possible that whites-only or yolks-only cake types won't trigger your problem, but if both do, you will possibly have to start replacing some egg in normal recipes. Sadly, eggs are very important for the texture of a cake, which means that substitutes only work in certain types of cake (pound cake, sponge cake) and even then, the larger the proportion of substitute to egg, the worse the final texture. But it may be worth it, if it lets you enjoy cakes you wouldn't eat when made with eggs. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update after comment</strong> </p>

<p>If you don't smell this in bakery cakes, there are still a few possible explanations: </p>

<ul>
<li>the sensitivity theory is right, and the bakeries in your area rely on some kind of product different than fresh eggs, such as powdered eggs. The processing used in industry ingredients could change eggs in some way which removes the components which cause your sensitivity. This should be easy to test: if you can eat homemade cake with fresh eggs, it is not the cause. </li>
<li>the smell compound to which you react could be something entirely different from the sulfur compounds always present in eggs. You said that you are buying fresh farm eggs. But the point is that fresh heirloom products are normally much more chemically diverse than mass-produced food. It is especially noticeable in fruit and vegetables, but I guess that chickens held under less-than-optimal conditions and fed standardized food mix will produce eggs which have much less exotic trace compounds than those of chickens raised on small farms under sunlight. You could try baking with the cheapest supermarket eggs and see if this solves the problem for you. </li>
<li>maybe my sensitivity theory is completely wrong, and you are indeed doing something unusual to the cake. As mentioned above, overcooking is a suspect. If your oven is hotter than the dial shows (very common), you may be consistently overcooking every single cake. Try inserting a roasting thermometer into your cake and yanking it out as soon as it reaches 90 Celsius. It might have a slightly floury taste, but at least you will know if it is the smell of overcooked egg or something else which bothers you. </li>

"How to make my chicken noodle soup thicker?","57356","","<p>Online chicken noodle soup recipes contain mostly the same things - chicken, noodles, stock, vegetables - and for the most part taste the same.  However, they taste <em>completely</em> different from the soup in many restaurants <em>(such as Old Country Buffet or my favorite, Perkins')</em>.  I can't figure out how to make my soup taste like that.</p>

<p>It seems like the main difference is how thick the soup is... but simply adding less water doesn't do the trick.  How do restaurants make their broth so thick? (should I be making my own broth?)</p>
","<p>None of the answers so far mention collagen -- specifically, using a stock made from roasted and cracked poultry bones.</p>

<p>You don't have to roast the bones, but you do need to crack them -- use a large, heavy knife or cleaver (not a chinese vegetable cleaver, you'll screw up the edge) to chop the bones up into about 2"" to 3"" pieces (5 to 7cm).  Put them in cold water, and slowly bring it up to a simmer, and just leave it simmering for a few hours.  You can add vegetables, too, but you'll want to pitch them, as they'll have been overcooked by the time the simmering's done.</p>

<p>Then strain everything, and use that as the base of your soup.</p>

<p>If your refrigerate stock that has enough collagen in it, it'll set up like jello, and hold its own shape.  Starches can work, but they're not ideal for soup -- flour (unless cooked as a roux) leaves a raw flour taste and cloudy soup; tapioca leaves little granules in there; corn starch will break down if you cook it too long.</p>

"What are the differences between an induction stove and a regular electric stove?","57278","","<p>What are the differences between an induction stove and a regular electric stove?  They are both electrically powered, and don't look all that different, but the induction cooktops I have seen are a lot more expensive.  </p>

<p>What difference does the type of stove - induction vs electric - make to the actual cooking process? </p>
","<p>A regular electric oven uses a large coiled resistor as a heating element. A large electric current is passed through this element which generates heat, similar to the tungsten filament of an incandescent light bulb.</p>

<p>An induction stove doesn't actually generate heat itself, but rather <em>induces</em> it the pot or pan. It does this using a rapidly oscillating magnetic field. This field induces an electric current in a ferromagnetic pan which generates heat, thus heating the food.</p>

<p>Induction stoves are faster, safer, and more energy efficient than traditional electric stoves. It requires significantly less electricity to create the magnetic field than it does to drive enough current through a resistor to make it heat up. They are safer because they don't actually generate heat themselves. After taking a pot off the ""burner"" (glass surface) it quickly begins to cool.</p>

<p>With regards to differences in the cooking process, there's not much. You just need to be aware that it heats up much more quickly and cools down much more quickly than a traditional electric stove. It does affect your choice of pans however. All aluminum pans will not work, nor will some lower quality stainless steel ones. If a magnet sticks to the pan then it will work just fine. The pan must also have a flat bottom to make full contact with the surface.</p>

"Cast iron pan has black residue on it","57129","","<p>I have a small cast iron pan which I am working with, trying to make sure I understand seasoning/cleaning before moving on to a larger one. I seasoned with flaxseed oil (4 light coats, hour in the oven), and have cooked a few things - I made some Ghee, fried some onions, stuff like that. After each I washed with hot water (no soap), heated until dry on the stove and coated with a thin layer of canola oil.</p>

<p>Now, when I take a dry paper towel and rub it on the pan, a black residue shows up on the paper towel. I can't feel anything with my fingers and I haven't noticed anything cooking with it. I'm fairly confident this occurred <em>after</em> the initial seasoning - although I'm not sure I did this exact test with the paper towel.</p>

<p>Is this a) normal, or b) what is wrong and c) how can I fix it?</p>

<p>There are quite a few questions (and good answers!) regarding cast iron cookware on this site but I haven't been able to find one that deals with this specific issue.</p>
","<p>You may notice the black residue if you fry eggs in the pan as well.  </p>

<p>Most likely, the black residue is charred (greasy) food sticking to the seasoned oil.  Since Flaxseed oil has low heat tolerance, it could be that disintegrating, too.  Otherwise it could be related to the iron in the cast iron which isn't bad for you (some say even good).</p>

<p><strong>a) Is it normal</strong>: Yes if you keep with the same regiment (recommend you don't).</p>

<p><strong>b) What is Wrong</strong>:  Water won't perfectly wash non-polar chemicals such as burnt solids in grease (milk solids while making ghee), so the hot water no-soap routine leaves the stuff in pan.</p>

<p><strong>c) How can I fix it</strong>: Try the following going forward:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>After you finished cooking and while the pan is somewhat hot, put a heap of salt in the middle and with a paper-towel spread and lightly scrub the pan.  The salt will pick up the would-be black stuff, largely disinfect the pan, and the abrasive properties of the salt helps with the cleaning.</p></li>
<li><p>Wipe off the now brown salt from the pan and rub-in the coat of oil as you normally do. The new coat will stick better to through the salt's abrasive effect.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This routine won't eliminate residue altogether.  But it seems to work great long term.</p>

<p><strong>Note on oils:</strong>
Flaxseed oil is best consumed cold and within three weeks.  I haven't heard of a credible source promoting seasoning the pan with flaxseed oil as it has one of the lowest <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_point"" rel=""nofollow"">smoke points</a> in the oils.  Use a more heat tolerant oil like light (not extra-virgin) olive oil or canola.</p>

"Difference between boiling and steaming vegetables?","57056","","<p>I have eaten both boiled vegetables and steamed vegetables (e.g. broccoli, carrot, zucchini etc.), and I cannot tell the vegetables are cooked in one way or the other, whether by texture or by taste (unless they are boiled in broth; here, I refer to boiling in water).</p>

<p>Is there a reason why vegetables are preferred boiled to steamed, or vice versa? </p>
","<p>To boil vegetables, you add the vegetables to a pot of water, and boil the water for a short duration until the vegetables are sufficiently cooked.  One may add salt or other flavorings (such as broth, as you mentioned) to the water prior to boiling.</p>

<p>Steamed vegetables are cooked in a steamer basket, where the vegetables are not in the water, but are instead sitting above the water, and are thus cooked by <em>steam</em>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SCeB8.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Salt must be added to steamed vegetables after they are cooked rather than to the water prior to cooking, since salt does not evaporate.</p>

<p>Steamed vegetables can retain more of their original flavor and nutrients, since they do not leech out into the water during boiling.  On the other hand, you cannot add additional flavors to your vegetables during steaming--since flavors cannot soak into the vegetables from the water, either.</p>

<p>Which taste/texture you prefer, of course, can be a matter of personal opinion.</p>

<p>In my experience, boiled vegetables are often mistakenly referred to as steamed vegetables.  And often, many restaurants will sell ""steamed vegetables"" which are really just microwaved frozen vegetables, which may strictly be steamed (it certainly isn't boiled!), but really bears little resemblance to the true steaming process (and has relatively poor flavor, as well).</p>

"Can I cook hamburgers in the microwave oven?","55977","","<p>What would be the main differences between frying hamburgers and cooking them in the microwave oven?</p>

<p>I'm stuck in a hostel with only a microwave oven and a water cooker.</p>
","<p>In short, kind of, but only with the proper accessories/equipment.  You'll never match a grill or griddle but you can get surprisingly close.</p>

<p>As was mentioned in other answers, what you're going to lose most is the sear.</p>

<p>I was given a Corningware Microwave Browning Dish a while back and found that it actually works pretty well when you're stuck with only a microwave.  They were apparently popular when microwaves were new and exciting, but people didn't know how to use them well and they faded into oblivion.  I've seen them on sale on eBay so you might be able to find a good price there if you're going to be stuck in the hostel for a while.</p>

<p>The basic idea is, there's a special kind of microwave-safe metal inside the base of the casserole.  You heat this with nothing on it for 3 minutes to get it nice and hot.  When you drop the patty on, it immediately sizzles.  You use the microwave function to heat the inside, while the hot surface sears the outside.  Although you're likely not going to get a perfect burger, you do get a real nice Maillard reaction on the outside of both sides (assuming you flip halfway) and if you play with the cooking time and power (to reduce that rubbery texture from overcooking), you can get something that's (in my opinion) a good 75%-quality burger compared to a griddle or grill.  I actually burned pork chops on it once, that's how hot the surface gets.</p>

<p>As a bonus, similar to a nice Boos block, there is a gutter around the outside and the plate is slightly concave, so the juices run off into the reservoir and the burger won't sit in fat during the cooking.</p>

<p>After reading the other answers (ElendilTheTall's specifically), I would think if you combined the steaming method to cook the burgers, with the microwave browning dish to sear, you could probably get a really good result.  If the burgers were fully cooked via steaming you could probably heat the dish and sear the burgers without even turning the microwave on (except to heat the casserole initially).</p>

<p>I believe Alton Brown did an episode where he talked about a specific type of brick that you can find at most hardware stores which is microwave-safe for the same searing purpose, but I can't find that info right now.</p>

","<p>One simple change you could make is to simply not mix the squash with the sauce, instead, plate the squash and then pour sauce over the top, the sauce will cool quicker which will reduce the amount that the squash cooks past the point you decided that it was ready.</p>

<p>If the squash still cooks too much on the plate, try starting your sauce earlier and letting it cool so it's warm but not scalding when served.</p>

<p>Also, meat thermometers are often labelled ""medium well"" etc., rather than ""soft ball"". Since I have access to the temps required, that's not an issue. </p>

<p>I'm definitely a noob to candy, so is there some magical reason I can't use a meat thermometer for my candy? Is it a huge no-no? Does it contain leprechauns that will destroy my caramels? </p>
","<p>I think Doug and yossarian both touched on the main points, but to summarize, there are four reasons why you might not want to use a meat thermometer for candy:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Range</strong> A meat thermometer might go from 140 F to 220 F or something like that, which is plenty for meat. Candy often requires a range from about 75 degrees (chocolate) up to 400+ degrees (hard candy). The range on most thermometers is simply not sufficient for most candies.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong> When you temper chocolate, 88 F degrees is an ideal working temperature (for dark chocolate). Some people would consider 91 so high you might want to think about starting over. When you make caramels, the difference between 235 F and 240 F can be the difference between wonderfully chewy caramels and a sugar-flavored rock. <em>If you can't read one degree increments at a glance, you need a real candy thermometer.</em></li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong> Meat thermometers often take 30 seconds to a minute to get an accurate result. When you are making candies, you have to be able to tell what the temperature is <em>right now</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Contamination</strong> I don't want the thermometer that goes in semi-raw meat anywhere near my chocolate.</li>

"How should chicken breasts for a chicken salad be cooked?","55718","","<p>Most of the recipes I've seen for Chicken Salad simply call for ""cooked chicken"".  ...okay, but how?  Should I bake it?  Blanch it? Sautee it?  Grill it?  </p>

<p>What is the preferred way to cook Chicken Breasts prior to use in Chicken Salad?</p>
","<p>It really depends on the texture you are looking for in your finished product. If you want a chunky chicken salad then bake your chicken breasts seasoned or not, I season mine, and then cube them. If you want something a little more exciting pan grill the breasts to the point of a little char and then dice. If you want your chicken to be flavorless and get all of your flavor from the mix you are tossing your chicken into, boil it or put it in a slow cooker if you are cooking up a big batch. </p>

<p>It all really comes down to how you like to eat your chicken salad, and more importantly how pretty you want it to look in your serving method, because a cajun blackened chicken salad sandwich can look down right homely. I say try them all until you fall in love with one temporarily and when that has lost its passion try a different version. </p>

<p>Also as a side note if I am preparing it for me and not for someone else, so it doesn't have to be all white and pretty, I use thighs instead of breasts since they are more forgiving and generally cheaper. If I am not just breaking down a whole chicken and using the <em>leftovers</em>.</p>

"What is the basic technique for cooking amaranth?","55538","","<p>I wanted to cook some amaranth grains. The back of the package said to cook 1 part amaranth and 3 parts water until soft, then let them soak for another 30 minutes. I ended up with amaranth soup. </p>

<p>Let's say that I want a very basic preparation of amaranth. What is the correct way to cook it? </p>

<ul>
<li>what is a good ratio of amaranth to water? </li>
<li>should I cook it with the lid on or without (don't laugh, I have found often enough that it affects both the water ratio and cooking time)? </li>
<li>should I salt before or after cooking, and why? </li>
<li>should I add fat before or after cooking, and why? </li>
<li>is there a better way to recognize that it is done that ""it is soft""? </li>
<li>should I soak before cooking, after cooking, or not at all? </li>
<li>is there something important about cooking amaranth I forgot to mention in the list? </li>
</ul>

<p>I don't want a specific recipe, just a basic preparation which can be later extended to fit different recipes (savory or sweet). If you have specific recommendations for doing X, I'd love to hear why doing X is better than doing Y. </p>
","<p>The basic cooking technique is the same for whole amaranth as for many other whole grains (e.g., barley) and grain-like seeds (e.g., quinoa): bring water to a boil, add the grain, simmer uncovered on low until the grain has reached the consistency you desire (that is the only true definition of ""done"" -- never be afraid to taste your food as you go!), then let cool.  Even when packaging suggest soaking, I do not soak my grains and I have never had any problems.  OF course, others will insist soaking is necessary.  My advice, if you are concerned: try it both ways and see which you prefer. </p>

<p>For each part of whole amaranth, here is the proportion of water:
-- porridge consistency, 3 parts water (some liquid will remain)
-- soft texture but with distinct grains, 2 parts water 
-- firm texture (pilaf), 1 part water</p>

<p>If the water has nearly all cooked off but you want a softer texture, add extra water and keep cooking.  If you are not sure what consistency you want, err on the firmer side, and taste as you go.  Note that larger batches (say, over 1/2-kilo of grain) need less water than smaller batches, so plan accordingly.</p>

<p>Adding salt to the water at the start is optional but I encourage it.  The point of adding it early is to incorporate the salt into the grains evenly.  Under-salting will mute the flavors substantially.  Adding salt at the last minute will provide a burst of salt on the tongue that is not always pleasant or desired, especially if you serve the grain with some other moderately salty food.</p>

<p>As for fat, I don't add any because I usually serve the amaranth with something that is already fatty (like an enriched sauce).  If you want to add a fat, then I would do so before the water has completely cooked off to ensure the fat coats the grains more or less evenly.</p>

<p>Oh, and I love using an automatic rice-cooker for my grains, as it automatically turns off when the temperature of the food rises substantially above 100 C (meaning all the water has cooked off).</p>

"Why do chefs traditionally wear a high white hat?","55369","","<p>The stereotypical chef beloved of TV, cartoons, and elsewhere is always pictured wearing a high white hat. </p>

<p>A hat I can understand. But why so high?</p>
","<p>Reaching back to my time in culinary school at Johnson &amp; Wales University in Providence, RI:</p>

<p>The style of hat originated in the Greek orthodox monastaries during the middle ages where chefs (often taking refuge with other educated members of society) would distinguish themselves from the monks by wearing a white hat (<a href=""http://www.kurskroot.com/orthodox_monks.html"">monks wearing black</a>).  The early chef hats were slightly elevated but not as tall as they eventually became.</p>

<p>Marie Antoine Careme (commonly called ""Chef of Kings and King of Chefs"") is credited as the father of classical french cuisine for the development of mother sauces and standard garniture and classification of terminology used in kitchens.  He's also credited with much of the organization and division of labor in kitchens still used today.  To designate role and stature in the kitchen he had his cooks wear hats of various height.  His being the tallest designated him as the Head or Executive Chef. </p>

<p>Traditionally it is said that the now traditional pleats indicate the number of ways that the chef wearing the hat can prepare an egg (of course this predates the disposable paper hats we now use).  100 pleats is considered to be the ""ultimate"" number to be desired.  However as a chef with 25 years experience in commercial kitchens, I'd be hard pressed to name 100 ways (without including eggs as an ingredient in recipes) to prepare an egg.</p>

"How do I pound chicken (or other meat) without making a mess?","55357","","<p>Despite my best efforts, my kitchen (and sometimes the chicken) always looks like a war zone after pounding 8 or 10 breasts.  Maybe this is just a messy job, but I think there must be something I'm missing.</p>

<p>I've tried using mallets, both metal and wooden  The meat always gets stuck to the pounding surface and the mallet.  I've tried putting the meat inside a plastic sandwich bag or freezer bag; the bag is always ripping and falling apart before the meat is flat.  Wax paper is about the same.</p>

<p>I've also tried rolling pins.  Even got a ""non-stick"" one.  This way is even more hopeless for me, because the meat either slides around on the surface or sticks to the pin (doesn't matter if I use flour).</p>

<p>Surely there must be a combination of tools and techniques that would allow me to complete this task without requiring 20 minutes of constant cursing and an extra hour of cleanup.</p>

<p>Can anyone point me in the right direction?</p>
","<p>Clingwrap works fine for me -- but I don't use a meat tenderizer -- I just use a small but fairly heavy pan (but not my cast iron, as it's not smooth on the bottom).</p>

<p>When I was in college, I tried a few things.  I can get pretty decent results just hitting it with my cutting board.  (with it between saran wrap).</p>

<p>Part of it might be technique -- if I'm doing chicken breast I first slice is sort of following the taper of the breast, so it's neither with or across the grain, but kinda of diagonal.  You also don't want to hit straight down -- you want to angle the blows, so you're actually pushing the meat out, and not just trying to force it through the counter.</p>

<p>And I should mention that I've only ever pounded out poultry and pork -- I assume beef would be the same, but I have no experience to confirm or deny it.</p>

"Can I freeze marinated chicken breasts?","55121","","<p>I bought marinated chicken breasts from the butcher and didn't realize I bought twice as many as I really wanted! Is it ok to freeze half of them?</p>

<p>The marinade is a garlic butter, so not acidic like a teriyaki. If the type of marinade affects the answer please let me know.</p>

<p>The breasts are still wrapped in plastic and then butcher paper, unopened since getting them home from the butcher, and have been kept in the fridge the entire time.</p>
","<p>You can absolutely freeze marinated meat - defrost in the refrigerator, and it will continue to marinate as it defrosts. I find that it usually takes about a day to defrost chicken breasts in the fridge.</p>

<p>The meat is more of a concern than the type of marinade when it comes to freezing. Most marinades should be fine to freeze. However, if you're starting off with meat that was frozen, you may not want to refreeze it. There are a couple reasons for this:</p>

<p>1) If the meat was frozen and NOT kept refrigerated (i.e., defrosted on the countertop or in the microwave), there's a chance that bacteria could start to grow in the meat, and freezing it again won't kill the bacteria. This isn't a problem if your meat is refrigerated and kept in an airtight container. The USDA has a quick guide on freezing, defrosting and refreezing <a href=""http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/focus_on_freezing/index.asp#14"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>2) Texture may be affected if you refreeze meat. Most meat dries out a little in the process of freezing and defrosting, so doing this multiple times will probably affect the texture. When the ice crystals form in the meat, they  burst cells, which then lose juice when the meat is defrosted. The result is often mushier, less juicy meat.</p>

<p>As a less scientific reason, the Food Network has recipes where they say you can <a href=""http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/marinated-chicken-breasts-recipe-1951801"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">freeze marinated chicken</a>.

  <p>Masa is dried corn that has been cooked in limewater (cal), soaked overnight, and then ground up while still wet. Sold in this form, it's called fresh masa, and it makes the lightest, fluffiest tamales. In Mexico, it can be purchased at tortilla factories in two ways: with smooth consistency for making tortillas and, upon request (if you are lucky), with a coarser consistency for making tamales. (Be careful to differentiate between masa para tamales and masa preparada para tamales; the latter, available at some tortilla factories and large Mexican groceries, is the coarse-textured masa mixed with lard and flavorings.</p>

","<p>Assuming you aren't very unlucky and happen to download a series of bad recipes I think it's one of a few things.</p>

<p>It's possible you could be undercooking your goods. Fully cooked baked goods should not taste like flour.</p>

<p>It's also possible that you could be mixing insufficiently. If this were the case though you'd  likely have some cookies that weren't floury.</p>

<p>The most likely culprit though is packed flour. If you are using volume measurements (most likely given the source) for flour, it's quite possible to use nearly twice as much flour as the recipe intends simply because your flour is packed down more than the author's was.</p>

<p>I recommend using either a food processor or a sifter to sift your flour adequately before measuring. Don't undo your sifting by rapping your measuring cup on the counter either! Simply scoop, scrape to level and dump it in the mixing bowl.</p>

"How should I prepare dried chickpeas?","53977","","<p>I've never used dried chickpeas before, but I'm not wanting for chickpea recipes. The bag of dried chickpeas I got contains no instructions for cooking. I know that I need to soak them in water for a period X and then cook them for a period Y. I could not find conclusive answers for what X (varies from 4 to 24 hours) and Y (varies from 40m to 2h) should be.</p>

<p>So what I need to know is:</p>

<ul>
<li>how long should I soak them before cooking?</li>
<li>how long should I cook them?</li>
<li>are there other things to take into account (like adding salt when soaking, but not when cooking, or the other way around)?</li>
</ul>
","<p>The answer depends on where you live, and what type you have brought.</p>

<p>In many countries that import chickpeas they <strong>heat treat</strong> them to kill seed-borne diseases and insects. The heat treatment process makes them more difficult to cook, and <strong>soaking times double or triple</strong>.</p>

<p>Beans from exporters with phytosanitary certificates can be imported without heat treatment; these are the ones you want to get.</p>

<p>I don't think you can tell which is which by looking at them. At the moment we have some particularly dark, dry, and dead looking beans that soak up beautifully in 8 hours!</p>

<p>Soak non-heat treated beans for 8 to 12 hours, <strong>heat treated beans for 24 to 36 hours</strong>. Some overly heat treated beans will never fully revive, and you are best to return these to the shop as ""faulty"".</p>

<p>Soak and cook <strong>without salt</strong>, unless you are going to mash them. They fall apart more readily if salted.</p>

<p>If you are not mashing them, the secret to great chickpea taste is after soaking and cooking in water, is to lightly fry them with a little olive oil until dark spot appear, keep them or the pan moving so none burn. Then add the sauce, or add them to whatever dish you are preparing.</p>

"The secret to hash browns / home fries / breakfast potatoes","53822","","<p>I have never been successful in making pan-fried potatoes àla the American diner.
It seems like such a simple concept, but they never turn out right! Usually undercooked &amp; oily, with some parts getting burned...</p>

<p>Ideally, I'd like to produce potatoes that are crispy and golden brown on the outside, fully cooked and soft on the inside, and not excessively oily. What are the important factors to ensure this?</p>

<p>Some variables I've considered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Type of Potato</li>
<li>Shape of cut (grated, thinly sliced, cubed, etc.)</li>
<li>Cooking technique (parboil first, or straight in the pan? How much oil, what temp, etc.)</li>
<li>Type of oil</li>
</ul>

<p>I have yet to find a combination of values for these variables that produces proper hash browns... What are your guidelines for making breakfast potatoes? Which of the above variables are important? Are there any other keys that I am missing?
It seems so simple when diners do it; I can't figure out where I am going wrong...</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I was afraid this would happen... terminology clarification: apparently I'm looking more for ""home fries"" or something to that effect. I do not want a solid potato pancake àla McDonald's hash brown; I am looking for pan fried potatoes; the pieces should be seperate (although they may stick together a bit in places).

","<p>It sounds to me like the issue may be that you're crowding the pan.</p>

<p>Basically, to get everything nice and brown and crispy, you need enough space for all of the steam to escape.  That picture you showed has potatoes stacked on top of each other -- that means as the bottom items cook, they're going to end up steaming the items above them.</p>

<p>At a diner, they have a large griddle to work with -- they can really spread things out.  You're not typically that lucky in a regular kitchen, as you don't have as much space, and you have a lip on the pans that'll hold the steam in.</p>

<p>So, either work in smaller batches, or consider recipes that use an oven -- using sheet pans instead of a pan on the stove solves much of the problem.</p>

<p>One other trick is that most diners don't start from raw potatoes -- maybe with hash browns, but not for home fries, you're not going to get the nice soft interior in a reasonable amount of time unless you start with a potato that's already been baked or boiled.  (If you're doing things in the oven, you might be able to, but not in a pan)</p>

<p>Just for reference ... I have a 14"" cast iron skillet that I use for home fries ... and it's about the right size for cooking a single large potato, which might be two servings, maybe three for kids.  (I tend to cook carb-heavy meals).</p>

<p><strong>update</strong> : I probably should've stated this directly -- you want the chunks of potato to form a single layer in the pan, with space in between them.</p>

","<p>In order to develop browning for a good, deep flavor on the meat, you need a high temperature and a long enough time that having the onions in the pan the entire time would leave them  overcooked.  Also, the onions would express water, which would lower the temperature to simmer or steam, preventing the beef from browning.</p>

"Why is my green tea brown?","53546","","<p>As Crystal Gale once wrote, ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0aT0GXW8jw"" rel=""nofollow"">You're gonna make my green tea, brown.</a>""  Or something like that.</p>

<p>When I typically order (the free or close-to-free) green tea at Japanese restaurants, it's usually noticeably green.  At home, regardless of brand and time on the shelf, it's typically brownish.  I follow good guidelines for making green tea: 170 degrees for about 90 seconds.</p>

<p>Am I buying the wrong kind of tea; or are restaurants using food coloring?</p>

<p>UPDATE: I'm pretty sure the Japanese or sushi restaurant green tea I'm used to is either partially or fully matcha, giving it the distinctive green color.  After trying out many different green teas, some Japanese, some not, it seems that Japanese green teas are generally greener in color than non-japanese, and the matcha powder provides the greenest color by far.  Some green tea bags come with matcha powder mixed into the tea bags, including Costco's green tea.  I found it to be better than any of the many bagged green teas I bought at the asian grocer.</p>
","<p>Hojicha is a green tea which is made from bancha, a low grade green tea, and cooked slightly; this very inexpensive green tea often comes out brown because it is discolored by oxidation. Other than this variety, and some very stale bancha, I can't think of a Japanese green tea that comes out brown. Some stale kukicha might come out brown, and low quality genmaicha made with poor quality kukicha could be brownish from the combination of excess oxidation and the toasted rice.</p>

<p>Most of the non-Japanese green teas I've seen sold as ""green tea"" and some lower quality teabags marked as ""sencha"" are broken down tea leaves that can easily oxidize in the packaging to the point where they are, at best, yellowish.</p>

<p>However, if you use even a moderate quality sencha, and it isn't stale, it should come out green. Most good quality kukicha and genmaicha will at least come out greenish-yellow. Since most Japanese restaurants use a fairly inexpensive second-harvest sencha, I imagine you're either buying hojicha or simply using a very stale, low-quality sencha.</p>

<p>Chinese green teas are sometimes slightly yellow, but if they're actually yielding a brown brew, they, too are either stale or are simply mislabeled oolong.</p>

<p>I used to sell a fair amount of green tea when I ran a small scale import business. I do recall even matcha products turning brown after being exposed to excessive sunlight; one of the bakeries I know was constantly running into issues with their matcha pound cake slices on sunny days, especially those pieces in the front of their pastry case. So it's reasonably possible you simply have tea which has been stored improperly; you're best off with a nitrogen flushed tea and it should be used within about 6 months of opening the sealed package. If your tea comes unsealed, it probably isn't in very good shape to begin with.</p>

<p>In any event, my recommendation is to try a first-harvest high-mountain grown sencha that is sold in nitrogen-flushed aluminum packages. Depending on the style, the brewed color will be either very green or slightly yellowish if brewed in the typical way. You can either do a very brief, several second infusion at near-boiling, or a longer infusion at around 80 celsius. I like it both ways.</p>

<p>Gyokuro, if you can afford it, is extraordinarily green, but is unlikely to be served at a restaurant without an additional charge (it's essentially the same leaves used to make matcha, except rolled instead of being milled).</p>

<li>The top isn't a mess of food. This is largely dependent on what you cook. Fish skin sometimes gets cooked on, glaze bubbles and chars, oil lights on fire and the top surface chars. Something like shrimp, tomato, or sausage will be fairly clean though, and nothing will cook on to the top. </li>

","<p>Describing the only method I know, and hoping that somebody will come up with an improvement, because this one is quite time-consuming. </p>

<p>First, clean your pumpkin seeds and toast them. They cling to the hull when they are raw. When toasting, it is preferable to use lowish temperature for a long time, so you can prevent strong taste changes and burning. If I remember correctly, it is also a good idea to let them cool them first, because they are more likely to break when hot, but </p>

<p>When the seeds are ready, you want to pop them out of the shell. For this, hold a seed between your thumb and index finger. Apply pressure to the most prominent parts of the edge. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QpeDi.png"" alt=""seed drawing""></p>

<p>Ideally, the pointed part of the hull will split along the edge, and the seed will fall out, or you will be able to squeeze it out. Even if it goes like that seed after, it is a slow, monotonous work. Often, the hull will refuse to split, or the seed will break within the hull, or it will cling to the hull and refuse to come out after it has split. And then there is no guarantee that you'll get the beautiful plump seeds you see in the supermarket, because carving pumpkins aren't bred for nice seeds, it can happen that yours are very small and thin and not a particularly good decoration. </p>

<p>Conclusion: it is possible, but even if I had the seeds sitting around, I'd throw them out (or feed them to birds outside) and get hulled seeds for cooking, instead of spending half a day to get a handful of seeds out of their hulls. If it doesn't bother you, or if you can find a more efficient method, feel free to do it and share your process improvements here. </p>

And apparently slow-cooking, even for eight hours, is not sufficient to deactivate it.</p>

<p>I'm confused as to whether this applies to just dried kidney beans, or if it is also true for canned beans one gets from a store (i.e. in water). Will these have been pre-cooked to remove this toxin?</p>
","<p>If <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaseolus_vulgaris#Toxicity"">Wikipedia</a> is to be trusted (and in this case, their source is the <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm071092.htm"">FDA</a>), there is in fact a toxin in some raw beans, such as kidney beans.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The toxic compound phytohaemagglutinin, a lectin, is present in many
  common bean varieties, but is especially concentrated in red kidney
  beans. White kidney beans contain about a third as much toxin as the
  red variety; broad beans (Vicia faba) contain 5 to 10% as much as red
  kidney beans.<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm071092.htm"">3</a></p>
  
  <p>Phytohaemagglutinin can be deactivated by boiling beans for ten
  minutes; the ten minutes at boiling point (100 °C (212 °F)) are
  sufficient to degrade the toxin, but not to cook the beans. For dry
  beans, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also recommends an
  initial soak of at least 5 hours in water, which should then be
  discarded.<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm071092.htm"">3</a></p>

(Don't steal my techniques please.)</p>

<p>The problem is that this [highly scientific] method is sometimes inaccurate in the amount of water that remains in the dish after half an hour.  If the water is running low, I can just add more, problem solved.  But what can I do if there is too much water?</p>

<p>Is there anything I can add that absorbs the water?  Kind of like rice, but maybe faster?</p>
","<p>This sounds just like my cooking technique, and I have come up with a few ways to recover from overwatering.</p>

<p><strong>Always lowball the amount of water</strong></p>

<p>Like you said, you can always add water later. But if you're not watching the dish, you don't want the water to run out and burn.</p>

<p><strong>Corn starch</strong></p>

<p>Corn starch is a good way to thicken up the water into something more saucy. This is my preferred method if the extra water actually has flavor, because it adds a nice sauciness to the dish. Make a corn starch 'slurry' by mixing  cold water and some corn starch, then add that to the hot dish that still cooking. You want to cook the dish for a few minutes after adding corn starch to let it thicken and cook out the raw flour flavor. You'll have to adjust the amount of corn starch depending on how much water there is, but a little goes a long way, its WAY more absorbent than flour.</p>

<p><strong>Remove the lid and stir occasionally</strong></p>

<p>This is the easy way, but it takes a while and sometime you can cook your dish in to mush. This lets excess water evaporate, and stirring just helps that a little.</p>

"Difference between soup and stew","52060","","<p>What are the technical differences between a soup and a stew.</p>

<p>Specifically, I've always had some confusion on the differentation of stew and soup. For the most part, you can tell the difference by visual cues but sometimes some soup or stew looks ambigously in between and i can't tell the difference.  For example, wikipedia shows a picture of this as soup:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oRqsx.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Yet it looks more like a stew to me. And then it shows this as a stew:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2GD6v.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Yet that looks like a soup to me. So my main question is: What are the technical differences that determine whether it is a soup or a stew.</p>
","<p>There really is no <em>practical</em> difference; the dictionary definition of a <em>soup</em> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a liquid food made by boiling or simmering meat, fish, or vegetables with various added ingredients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which also applies to any stew you can conceive of.</p>

<p>The technical, highly-nuanced difference is that of emphasis and intent. Stewing is a method of cooking the solids (specifically, a slow, moist-heat method). When you make a beef stew, you are stewing the <em>beef</em>, which says nothing about what you're stewing it <em>in</em>. On the other hand, when you make a chicken soup (or a chicken stock or broth which is the base of a chicken soup) then your objective is essentially to make chicken-flavoured liquid - to extract the flavour of the solids <em>into</em> the liquid. If some flavourful solids remain, then that is incidental as opposed to intentional.</p>

<p>In practice, some flavour extraction is going to happen with a stew as well, it just so happens that the principal aim is to cook the meat/veggies. A soup is more likely to contain raw or barely-cooked ingredients, and a stew is more likely to preserve the original flavour of the solids and/or liquids, but that's a very broad generalization and what it boils down to (ha ha) in practice seems to be largely dependent on the culture and the dish itself.</p>

<p>A stew is <em>not</em> simply a thick or chunky soup, despite the fact that a lot of people think of it that way. As above, that seems to be <em>more common</em> with stews, but it's not part of the definition, and the French have half a dozen categories for thickened soups that could easily be described as having the overall consistency of a ""stew"".</p>

Always cool your nuts before chopping them.

I worry that omitting them would defeat most of the purpose of the dish. Is there anything that could be used in their place to give a similar flavor?</p>
","<p>Two years later, the chestnut idea worked swimmingly :D </p>

<p>I followed the recipe I linked in the question, with the following changes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Obviously, I replaced one pound of mushrooms with one pound of chestnuts. In hindsight, that was probably a bit too much, as a pound of mushrooms would have cooked down significantly more, but we didn't mind. </li>
<li>In step 3, I omitted the horseradish, as I don't like it. I'm only reporting that for accuracy :) </li>
<li>I replaced step 4 entirely with the following: Chop all chestnuts in half, being careful as they have a tendency to fly apart. Boil the halves in a saucepan of water for 7 minutes. Drain and let cool, then peel -- this should now be a much easier task. Chop chestnut meats finely.
<ul>
<li>I should note that I accidentally boiled them too long, and they got a bit crumbly while I was peeling them. That didn't matter, because I was going to chop them. However, in the future I might try using a food processor to chop them, because I ended up with an uneven chop and the larger pieces stood out from the eventual mixture, making it harder to eat.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In step 5, I had to add more butter, as the chestnuts basically absorbed the entire amount of butter called for without actually sauteeing in it. Not that I minded :) I sauteed the chestnuts until soft, then added the shallots and thyme and proceeded as usual. </li>
<li>I omitted the foie gras, again, added only for accuracy. Kenji mentioned in the comments that it's not needed if you don't like it or can't find it, so I omitted to make the whole thing simpler.</li>
</ol>

<p>The dish turned out utterly delicious :D I don't usually buy beef tenderloin, finding it usually lacking in flavor; since the goal of the dish was to add more interesting flavor and texture back, I definitely feel this was a success.

"What type of yoghurt should I use for making curry?","51691","","<p>I've seen a lot of recipes specifying ""yoghurt"" when making an indian-style curry, but very rarely do they specify what type. </p>

<p>The problem is compounded for me in that I live in a country where I don't speak the native language, and their concept of what may or may not be yoghurt is possibly different from mine.</p>

<p>Is turkish yoghurt okay? Or should I look for something else? Or does it not even matter?</p>

<p>For reference, I'm intending to make a chicken korma or something along those lines.</p>

<p>Edit: I live in Sweden.</p>
","<p>I think for Indian recipes you should in general look for an unstrained, set yoghurt. There are other factors that determine the final taste and texture of the yoghurt (the bacteria, the type of milk, length of fermentation, …) but you may not have much choice w.r.t. other factors than these two:</p>

<p><strong>Production process</strong>: Set yoghurt is yoghurt that's made the traditional way, it's fermented in the pot that it's sold in. Stirred yoghurt on the other hand is fermented before being packaged; it's a more industrialized production process which is cheaper, but results in a more sour, thinner yoghurt. Stirred yoghurt has a smooth, pourable consistency; whereas set yoghurt is firmer. I got a bit confused when I was using stirred yoghurt the first time I tried making <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raita"">raita</a> and the recipe told me to whisk the yoghurt till it was smooth. The pretty sour taste of the yoghurt also didn't go well with the spices, and the juice from the cucumbers made the already-thin yoghurt too watery. You could try fixing both problems by straining the yoghurt a bit and adding sugar, but it's better and easier to just buy set yoghurt. The yoghurt's packaging might say explicitly what type of yoghurt it is, but if it doesn't or you don't understand the language: avoid yoghurt that comes in “milk carton”-like containers, that most definitely means it's stirred yoghurt. A plastic pot doesn't mean it's set yoghurt though, but it's a better bet.</p>

<p><strong>Thickness:</strong> Strained yoghurt (like “Greek-style yoghurt” in Europe and the USA) is yoghurt from which the whey has been removed. It's pretty thick and sometimes also referred to as “yoghurt cheese.” In India it's used for example in the dessert <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrikhand"">Shrikhand</a>, but if a recipe doesn't specify that you should strain the yoghurt, you should assume it's unstrained or briefly strained. Wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strained_yoghurt#India_and_Pakistan"">says</a>: “In south Asia, regular unstrained yoghurt (<em>dahi</em>), made from cow or water buffalo milk, is often sold in disposable clay pots. Kept for a couple of hours in its clay pot, some of the water evaporates through the clay's pores. But true strained yoghurt (<em>chakka</em>) is made by draining dahi in a cloth.” Should you really only find strained yoghurt, you can probably just thin it back with water or milk.</p>

<p>I should maybe add I don't have first-hand experience with what yoghurt from India tastes like, but I've observed that the ethnic shops in my area and one Indian take-away where I could peer into the kitchen all sell/use the exact same brand of yoghurt, which is an unstrained, set yoghurt with a mild (not too sour) taste.</p>

olive oil, butter, Dijon mustard, white wine vinegar, and black pepper.</p>

<p>I only have garlic-flavored red wine vinegar (no lemon either).  Can I use that or would it be better to skip the vinegar altogether?</p>
","<p>Vinegar, in general, has distinct acidic characteristics that will affect a recipe; it's often used for this reason. For instance, in marinades, the acid is used to break down muscle fiber and help flavor penetrate. In Cevice, the acid component is used to ""cook"" the fish.  </p>

<p>Additionally, the different types of vinegar have different flavor characteristics. I, personally, don't much like red wine vinegar as I find it kind of bland. I much prefer balsamic or champagne. So the question you really need to ask yourself is, ""will the flavor of the red wine over the white wine adversely affect my dish?"" You might ask the same question about the garlic. </p>

<p>So subbing one type of vinegar for another is fine if you're looking to replace the role of the acid in a recipe (also why you can sub lemon juice). Whether or not you feel the flavor can be substituted is really just a matter of personal preference. If you don't know ahead of time about the flavor, try it and find out for sure. </p>

<p>To specifically answer the flavor characteristic for your question, I'd say yes. Red wine is OK. As pointed out, swordfish is a hearty fish and should hold up fine. I probably wouldn't sub balsamic, would use champagne as a priority, would think long and hard about apple cider. If it was a lighter fish, I'd be much more wary about red wine. </p>

The soup will get piping hot. </p>

<p>Why would you do it? It's easy. It takes about 2 mins to get the soup really smooth, so it's 3 more minutes to get it hot. That's faster than you would be able to do with a stove, although maybe slower than a microwave. Is it more efficient? I don't know, but I doubt the difference in electrical efficiency is really sufficient to drive a choice one way or the other. </p>

<p>In terms of cleaning, you already need to clean the blender because you pureed the soup. There's no additional cleaning to do if you cook it there too, versus additional cleaning for stove or microwave. And the blender is easy to clean as it's one piece; you just add soap and water and turn it on for 30 seconds, then rinse. </p>

<p>Personally, I do not think this is ""one of the main selling points"". It's a neat trick, and it's useful. However, I think that it's more interesting as an indication of the blenders power. You can use these blenders to make exceptionally smooth soup, make peanut butter, properly crush ice for frozen drinks, etc. They do this much better than a 'normal' home blender, but just saying 'better' probably wouldn't sell a lot of these things at 4x the price, so they focus on something that the standard home blender most certainly cannot do. </p>

"What is each side of a 4-sided grater for?","51535","","<p>We own a standard 4-sided grater, but only ever use the side with large holes.</p>

<p>What do the other sides do, and what kind of recipes are they for?</p>

<p>We have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Medium holes with a cutting edge on bottom (look like large raindrops)</li>
<li>Small holes with cutting edge on bottom</li>
<li>Outward protruding holes with spiky edges on all sides</li>
<li>Wide holes that look like a smiley.</li>
</ul>
","<p>To answer in the language of the question asked:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Medium holes with a cutting edge on bottom (look like large raindrops)</strong> : used for shredding.</li>
<li><strong>Small holes with cutting edge on bottom</strong> : used for shredding when you want it finer than the larger size.</li>
<li><strong>Outward protruding holes with spiky edges on all sides</strong> : used for grating.</li>
<li><strong>Wide holes that look like a smiley</strong> : used to slice things to an even thickness.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for recipes ... I generally don't use the slicing portion too often, as I can get fairly consistent slices with a knife, but if you're not so skilled, it could be used to slice potatoes for an au gratin (might need to slice them in half first, is the slots aren't wide enough to fit the whole potato), or to slice firmer cheeses.  It can also be used for slicing cabbage for coleslaw (again, once cut down to fit), cucumbers or carrots for salads, etc.  As the blades aren't razor sharp, there are some softer items (eg, tomatoes) that it just won't work for, that you'd have to do by hand or get a much more expensive mandoline.</p>

<p>The grating side I only generally use for hard cheeses, when I need a more powdery texture than I can get with the shredding sides.  I've also used it for zesting citrus (although it only works in large quantities, as you end up losing about 1/2 a lemon to the groves and it doesn't release without a brush**), and I've used it for pulping carrots (was mixing them into a sauce, and I didn't want identifiable bits)</p>

<p>The shredding sides are the ones I use the most, with the choice of side dependent upon what size I want the resultant shreds.  I use it for firmer vegetables and fruits that I'm baking into breads (zucchini, carrots, apples), potatoes for hash browns, medium cheeses for firmer cheeses (when I want this texture), etc.</p>

<p>Although a food processor <em>can</em> be used for this task, you have to consider a couple things (besides initial cost &amp; space it takes up) : it's really easy to go and shred lots of cheddar cheese in a food processor, but it cramming all in there and fusing back together from the force and heat, defeating the purpose.  Chilling the cheese helps, but you also need to keep dumping the work bowl out.  If you have a strong arm and a small food processor, a hand shredder might actually be faster and give better results.</p>

<p>When using a shredding disk for firmer things, you do more damage than by hand, resulting in lots of liquid being given off.  Sometimes, this is better ... I have a potato kugel recipe that comes out very light as I can get more of the liquid out after having gone through the food processor ... so you may want to try both tools (if you already own them both) to see which one gives you better results.</p>

<p>** ... I've heard you can wrap it in plastic wrap, use the grater, and then pull the wrap off to get it to release; I've never tried it, in part because I now have a microplane grater, but also because I'd be afraid of getting bits of plastic in the food.  I also want to say that I saw the trick the context of pulping ginger or garlic, but it's been long enough ago that I don't know that I can trust my memory</p>

"Which torch to buy for finishing sous vide meat? Butane or propane?","51400","","<p>I have started cooking sous vide and am thinking of buying a torch to finish off the meat. I have seen stores selling little butane torches for creme brulees, but some have claimed they are not hot enough and I should use propane.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some have claimed that propane leaves a flavour in the meat that should be avoided.</p>

<p>Anyone tried both? Anyone uses the little butane torches? What kind of flavour does the propane impart?</p>
","<p>I use Propane all the time.  There are several factors as to why:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is cheap, about 1/4 the price of butane.  </li>
<li>It’s more readily available.  You can buy a propane torch at many different stores for very cheap.  </li>
<li>The torches typically put out a lot more heat.  I’ve used both propane and butane, mostly for crème brulee, but other food as well.  The butane torches put out such a focused small area of heat, that it would get uneven burning.  Whereas with Propane, they often put out a much larger area of heat, making it easier to caramelize across the surface evenly.</li>
</ol>

<p>As for the concern of it imparting propane flavor, I have had that happen, once, but I’ve also had that happen with butane.  It’s all about flow control.  If you have the dial turned up too high and it’s spewing out massive amounts of propane, plus hold the flame too close to the food, you MIGHT get then hint of propane.  But if you have the torched dialed in to the proper settings, you really can’t beat the ease and convenience of “energy-efficient clean-burning propane gas”</p>

<p>So I am looking for some cooking instructions for cooking a roast pork in the oven. A time/temperature table should be fine.</p>

<p>I ask this as from the information I see around, temperature varies from 160ºC to 210ºC. But from experience 200ºC makes the meat much too dry.</p>
","<p>The USDA recommends an internal temperature of 160ºF (about 71ºC) for pork to be considered safe to eat. The exact time and temperature for your oven will depend on many factors, so always use a probe thermometer to check. If you're worried about it getting overdone, start checking the temperature a while before you expect it to be done (based on your previous experiences). There are also thermometers which you can leave in the oven, and have a remote part that can sound an alarm when a certain temperature is reached. Also note that the internal temperature will continue to rise a bit after you remove the roast from the oven, so you may want to aim for a few degrees below your target temperature.</p>

<p>210ºC (410ºF) does seem too hot to cook a roast, so I'd aim for something on the lower end. Whatever time/temperature combo you use, it's always the internal temperature of the roast that matters, both for safety and for taste.</p>

","<p><em>moved here from a comment:</em></p>

<li>Put it into muffin pans or similar for baking, so you don't have to worry about it holding up on its own or even attempting to shape it.

<p>In general, I find that kneading dough in a mixer (unless specifically called for in a recipes) always needs more flour.

"Is there any advantage of applying dry rub overnight for baby back ribs for smoking?","50232","","<p>Is there any advantage of adding dry rubs to ribs overnight? I'm looking to improve the texture and moistness of the ribs.</p>

<p>Some forums are saying that applying a rub overnight may risk removing moisture from the baby back ribs. Is this true?</p>

<p>I plan on smoking these ribs in an electric smoker.</p>
","<p>Many people have strong opinions on when to apply a rub -- some say to allow at least a few hours and preferably overnight.  Others literally apply it as they are putting them in the smoker/oven.  Since people do it both ways and both claim to end up with terrific, moist ribs, whatever effect this <em>might</em> have is probably small.</p>

<p>It may change aspects of the ""glazing"" effect that a rub might give, depending on what is in the rub.  A rub left on for a longer period will become more mushy and more like a paste or a glaze/sauce, while a rub put on fresh before cooking won't have time to become as moist.  You will get slightly more flavor penetration with a longer rest, but there are diminishing returns there too after the first hour or two.</p>

<p>I don't have experimental evidence to back this up, but I think the ""early rub will dry things out"" argument is pretty flimsy from a food science perspective.  It is true that rubs which contain significant amounts of salt, sugar, or other hydrophilic substances will cause some moisture to come out of the meat.  On the other hand, most people tend to cook ribs for quite a few hours anyway (and some smoke them for <em>many</em> hours), so the rub will have plenty of time to draw out that moisture regardless of whether you put it on ahead or time or right before cooking.  </p>

<p>It's not like you're salt-curing the meat and leaving the salt on it for months.  Once the salt (and/or sugar) draws out the moisture from the outermost thin layer of meat, it generally takes much longer for moisture to migrate from inner parts of the meat.  That surface layer of meat will release most of its moisture within an hour or so after you put salt or sugar or whatever on.  So, even if you put your rub on immediately before putting it in the smoker, that moisture will tend to be drawn out in the first part of the cooking time.  Adding a few more hours or even overnight to the rub shouldn't result in significantly more moisture loss from the meat's interior -- and the exterior will always dry out a bit as it cooks anyway.</p>

<p>Moreover, you aren't generally draining away moisture from the surface.  With ribs, you often have them wrapped up to rest, which means the meat sits in that moisture.  And guess what?  About 10-15 minutes in, the brine produced by the moisture combined with the salt in the rub will begin to break down the outer muscle structure of the meat and cause it to <em>absorb more moisture</em> than usual, so much of that liquid lost will be <em>reabsorbed back into the meat</em> within an hour or so.  (Note that the <a href=""http://amazingribs.com/recipes/rubs_pastes_marinades_and_brines/dry_brining.html"">salt and water are carried back into the meat</a> with some of the other spice compounds which are in the rub, so there is perhaps some flavor advantage to applying the rub at least a little in advance.  On the other hand, again this mostly affects only the outermost layer of meat, so more than an hour or two probably won't make more significant changes in the flavor.)</p>

<p>If you're talking about searing a steak, when you salt it might have some impact, since you generally <a href=""http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/the-food-lab-more-tips-for-perfect-steaks.html"">don't want to time your sear</a> at the point at which moisture is being released at the maximum rate.  But for ribs or anything with a long slow cooking time?  It's really not a big issue.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the larger effect will generally be what happens to the <em>rub</em> as it sits on the meat for many hours.  You may find that the change in texture there may change the final appearance or texture of the outer surface.  But the idea that the interior will dry out significantly?  It doesn't seem likely.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that I was adding a little bit of butter and salt to everything that I cooked. I know if I bake something I could add rosemary etc, but how can I season / flavour food different steaming / boiling? Adding herbs to the water??</p>
","<p>Adding flavors to the water will not transfer to the vegetables. Steam is a poor medium for flavor as water carries almost nothing with it when it becomes gas. There are a few very good methods to add some flavor to steamed veggies, so you can just use one of those!</p>

<p><strong>You can add herbs and other aromatics to the veggies</strong> This works best with fresh herbs, but a few sprigs of rosemary or a few leaves of basil in contact with your steamed veggies will get some good flavor action. Alternately, mixing them in right after you take the veggies off the steam will let the residual heat of the veg to bring out the flavors in the herbs. Other things that work well is cooking your veggies on a bed of orange peels or lemon peels to add some citrus flavor.</p>

<p><strong>Add oil, plus any flavors you want to infuse into the oil</strong> Once you have steamed your veggies, hit them with a light drizzle of oil. I make a chili-infused olive oil that I toss my steamed carrots in that is always a huge hit. There are wide array of lipid soluble flavors that you can infuse your oil with.</p>

<p><strong>Compound butters are great, but so is just butter</strong> Animal fats added after cooking almost always turn ho-hum into yum-yum. Butter has long been the french way to add a bunch of subtle flavor to a side dish. You don't have to use a ton, normally a light toss is enough to make a difference. Compound butter is just butter with herbs chopped in and it gives you the double whammy when you use it.</p>

<p><strong>Any ground spice</strong> You can also just shake some ground spices on. Pepper, curry powder, cinnamon, pretty much anything that sprinkles and fits the profile you are looking for will work. If your spices are fresh ground, you will get even more taste for your buck.</p>

<p>If you are boiling your veggies, your options open up. Most root veggies will take on the flavor of whatever you cook them in, so using stock or vegetable broth can add some flavor. Vegetables that you cook with each other in a pot of boiling water will also get some transference among themselves. That's the basis for a large number folk dishes like New England Boil and the reason Cajuns always throw some taters and corn in with the crawfish.  </p>

"No oil on non-stick pans?","50147","","<p>My boyfriend is convinced that a non-stick coating on a pan (Teflon, seasoned cast iron, eco-ceramic, what have you) is equivalent to eliminating the need for using any cooking oil whatsoever. </p>

<p>Is this in fact the case? I'm fairly sure that it only <em>reduces</em> the amount of oil necessary to keep things from sticking, but I'm having a hard time proving this (other than the empirical tests that keep failing). Essentially, he is a huge fan of fried eggs, but is trying to avoid the eventual heart attacks.</p>
","<p>There are two parts to this question, the stated part, and the unstated ""are you really frying an egg if there is no oil?""</p>

<p>For the first part, most manufacturers of non-stick pans claim that their product makes oil unnecessary, and generally I've found that to be true. A little oil helps, but ""necessary"" might be a stretch.</p>

<p>To maximize your non-stickyness of a non-stick pan, you should always preheat the pan before adding the food, at least to 250F or so. Preheating causes the teflon to expand a bit, closing up pores and micro-scratches in the surface.</p>

<p>It is also common for oils from the past to form a polymerized layer on top of the teflon, making the pan more sticky. This is actually worse when you use aerosol spray oils, because the tiny droplets hit the pan and very quickly polymerize to form a slightly sticky layer. This layer is similar to the one you intentionally create when seasoning a cast iron pan, but in this case it is not helpful. All-Clad recommends periodically cleaning teflon pans with a light scrub of baking soda and water to remove that coating of oil. It should bring back the maximum slippery of your teflon.</p>

<p>When cooking protein-rich foods, you can also minimize sticking by letting the food cook a bit before attempting to move it. The loose, floppy denatured proteins in an egg are extremely sticky, but when they coagulate (set) from cooking, they become less sticky. It may seem impossibly sticky at first, but may release on it's own after a minute of cooking.</p>

<p>As to the second, unstated part, oil provides flavor, and is also a heat-transfer vehicle. When the food is on the pan, if you looked at it with a microscope only a small portion of the food is actually in contact with the pan. Those areas will get heated more, and other areas will get heated less. A little oil fills those gaps, causing more even thermal contact, which allows fried food to fry, rather than just get burned in some areas.</p>

<p>It is really a matter of taste whether the flavor of the oil and the way that it changes the texture of the food is appealing to your boyfriend. I wouldn't like it without any oil, but if he does, well, so be it. If he doesn't really like the taste, but is concerned about health, I'd suggest using a little olive oil - it has no cholesterol, is low in saturated fats, and has a good flavor. Different than butter, but still very enjoyable.</p>

"Why doesn't chocolate go bad?","49999","","<p>After all it has oil and sugar in it. Why doesn't bacteria love it? Thanks!</p>
","<p>Simple: it has no water. </p>

<p>Chocolate is a suspension of cocoa solids and sugar in cocoa butter. It is made from fat and carbohydrates only. Bacteria, as everything else, need water to live. They can't survive in something hygroscopic (like jam or honey) or something with no water at all (flour, chocolate, pure fat). Similar for molds. So, independent of temperature, chocolate won't go bad in the sense that it will never grow colonies of bacteria. </p>

<p>As Hobodave mentioned, it can ""grow bad"" in another sense. If held at high temperatures (somewhat above 30°C), the chocolate butter will separate from the mix and form a dull yellow-grayish crust on the chocolate surface. Also, if you leave it in contact with oxygen for long enough (many months), the cocoa fat will go rancid. In both cases, it is perfectly safe to eat the chocolate without risking food poisoning. However, the taste is much worse than in normal chocolate. </p>

"Why should I boil pretzels in baking soda water before baking?","49808","","<p>This weekend I made pretzels from <a href=""http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/homemade-soft-pretzels-recipe/index.html"">Alton Brown's recipe</a>.</p>

<p>This recipe, and others I've seen, call for dipping the pretzels one by one in boiling water with baking soda for 30 to 60 seconds.</p>

<p>I assume the boiling water will help the pretzels come up to temperature more quickly so they cook thoroughly, is this correct?</p>

<p>What benefit does the baking soda bring - is it important in forming a crust?  If so, why?</p>
","<p>The pretzel originates in Germany, where it is called Laugenbrezel. It was originally prepared in a alkali solution, which is where the ""Laugen"" part of the word comes from; typically, lye was used, but baking soda gets you most of the way there without a trip to the pharmacy (a Mexican or Asian market may do the trick if you want culinary lye).</p>

<p>The alkali solution is what causes the crust to brown so deeply, and it's most of the difference between a pretzel and a bagel. A bagel would typically be boiled in a malted sugar solution instead. The flavor is also affected, but I don't know how to describe the difference; there's a very pronounced aroma difference if you skip this step. To me, you end up with nothing more than a pretty breadstick unless the dough gets that alkali bath.</p>

<p>If you do use culinary lye, use gloves and don't rush anything. Traditional Laugen aren't boiled, so you just need a cool 3% lye solution; no boiling step. </p>

<p>In Germany, the pretzel shape isn't the only option for Laugen. Little rolls calls Laugenbrötchen and longer, roughly baguette-width sticks called Laugenstangen are also popular. On my most recent trip last year, the Laugenstangen were frequently sold in the form of sandwiches, though I don't remember seeing many of those when I was first living there in the mid-90s.</p>

<p>ETA: Having done this a few more times since originally posting, I'd also add that the utensils you use in lye-based pretzels need to be wood, glass or plastic. Eye protection is important too. Metal will likely corrode or oxidize when it contacts food put in contact with lye, even if it's after the wash. I'd recommend setting the washed pretzels on a wooden surface after dipping if you want to minimize damage/discoloration on your baking sheet.</p>

"How does adding baking soda to soaking beans/lentils reduce the gas they make you have?","49773","","<p>I've heard a few times that adding a pinch of baking soda to the water you use to soak beans/lentils in, reduces the gas it makes you have. I've not do any measured experiments myself, but I have anecdotal evidence it does help. But what's the science behind it?</p>
","<p>The actual action of soaking is what does most of the work.</p>

<p>Most legumes have complex oligosaccharides, a type of complex sugar. Digestion of this complex sugar is what causes flatulence. By soaking your beans will help remove some of this excess sugar. Be sure you discard the soaking water. </p>

<p>Though it is often said that adding baking soda helps I've yet to see any verifiable evidence that it would help. Also, don't forget that baking soda isn't tasteless, it could easily add a salty or soapy flavor to your once pristine beans.</p>

","<h1>General comments on the shelf-, fridge-, and freezer-life of foods</h1>

<p>The shelf-life is the amount of time a food can be stored before it is considered unsuitable for use. It may be unsuitable due to quality degradation (no longer tasty) or food safety (risk of food poisoning). [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelf_life"" rel=""noreferrer"">1</a>] </p>

<p>As far as food safety goes, food stored frozen at 0°F (-18°C) or below is remains safe forever; only quality degrades over time. [<a href=""http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/freezing-and-food-safety/CT_Index"" rel=""noreferrer"">2</a>]. Thus the freezer-storage times below are entirely about quality.</p>

<p><strong>If your freezer is set at a temperature higher than -18°C (three-star setting), these times may not apply. Especially the safe storage time in one-star freezers (-6°C) is much reduced.</strong></p>

<p>The times all assume proper storage. Freezers 0°F or below, refrigerators 40°F (4°C) or below. [<a href=""http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/keep-food-safe-food-safety-basics/CT_Index"" rel=""noreferrer"">3</a>] Cans should be stored in a cool, dry place, below 85°F (30°C) [<a href=""http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/shelf-stable-food-safety/CT_Index"" rel=""noreferrer"">4</a>].</p>

<p>The tables given here assume proper storage. <strong>Food which requires refrigeration is considered unsafe if left for over two hours at temperatures between 41–135°F (5–57°C)</strong> [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_zone_%28food_safety%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">5</a>]. </p>

<h1>The Tables</h1>

<p>Regardless of the table below, if a food shows signs of spoilage (including mold, with some exceptions described below), its past its shelf-life. Note that the <em>lack</em> of spoilage does <em>not</em> imply safety.</p>

<h1>General tips for storing foods</h1>

<h2>How do I freeze fruits and vegetables?</h2>

<p><strong>Fruit.</strong> Ripe (but not overripe) fruit should be used. Wash them, and sort according to size. Working in small batches, remove pits, seeds, and blemishes. For fruits that turn brown, apply ascorbic acid or sugar and citric acid. Most fruits benefit from packing in dry sugar or a sugar syrup. Small, whole fruits (e.g., berries) can be spread on a tray and individually frozen, then packed in a freezer bag or other airtight container.</p>

<p><strong>Vegetables.</strong> Most vegetables need blanching. To blanch, immerse in boiling water over high heat or steam over rapidly boiling water (steam). After blanching, transfer to ice bath for the same amount of time as blanched. Drain and dry. Freeze either by packing in a freezer bag with as much air as possible removed, or by allowing to freeze on a tray, then putting in a bag or other container.</p>

<p>General guideline is 8–12 months for best quality.</p>

<p>The above is a very quick summary of Iowa State University's <a href=""http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/PM1045.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Preserve the
Taste of Summer: Freezing: Fruits and
Vegetables</a>. The
five-page document includes full details on over forty fruits and vegetables.
Feel free to ask here on Seasoned Advice if that guide doesn't answer your
question.</p>

<h2>What about mold?</h2>

<p>Some foods are expected to have mold in them (e.g., <em>P. roqueforti</em> in
Roquefort cheese). Unexpected mold, however, is something to be concerned
about. Mold can grow even on refrigerated foods, and even those high enough in
salt or sugar to deter bacteria. Some molds produce mycotoxins. Mold growth can
be minimized by cleaning the refrigerator every few months (use a mixture of 1
tablespoon of baking soda per quart of water, then rinse with plain water, then
dry), by keeping dishcloths, sponges, mops, etc. clean and fresh-smelling; and
keeping indoor humidity levels under 40%.</p>

<p>In general, the visible surface mold on a food is only a small part of the
actual mold growth. For most foods, any visible unexpected mold growth means
you should discard the entire item. There are several exceptions:</p>

<pre><code>Hard salami, dry-cured     Scrub mold off surface.
country hams

Hard cheese                Cut at least 1 inch around and below mold spot,
                           do not cut through mold.

Cabbage, bell peppers,     Cut at least 1 inch around and below mold spot,
carrots                    do not cut through mold.
</code></pre>

<p>Everything else, including soft or shredded cheese, soft fruits and vegetables,
bread, peanut butter, jams and jellies, sour cream, yogurt, luncheon meats,
casseroles, and cooked pasta should be discarded.</p>

<p>All this information comes from the USDA FS&amp;IS's <a href=""http://www.fsis.usda.gov/fact_sheets/Molds_On_Food/index.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">Molds on Food: Are They
Dangerous?</a> fact
sheet.</p>

<h1>Where can I go for details on a specific food?</h1>

<p>The web site <a href=""http://stilltasty.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">StillTasty</a> maintains a comprehensive list
of food storage times, notes, and procedures for a wide variety of food items.
They draw information from <a href=""http://stilltasty.com/fooditems/food_storage_info"" rel=""noreferrer"">a variety of reputable
sources</a> and should probably
be the first place you check.</p>

<p>Another good source of information is the Food Marketing Institute's <a href=""http://www.fmi.org/consumer/foodkeeper/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Food

"At what point is water considered ""at a boil?""","49719","","<p>Lots of recipes call for waiting for the water to come ""to a boil."" However I have never been sure when that is. From my viewpoint it could be at three different points:</p>

<ol>
<li>First start to see small air bubbles coming up from the bottom of the pan </li>
<li>When the surface of the water is noticeably disturbed by the bubbles </li>
<li>When it is a full on raging torrent of activity</li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on the amount of water used, these three points could be several minutes apart from each other, which will affect the cooking time. </p>
","<p>By definition, 1 is a simmer (once the bubbles form a steady stream), 2 is a boil, and 3 is a ""roiling boil.""</p>

"Can I use Cheddar cheese for pizza?","49716","","<p>I know that most of the time Mozzarella cheese is used for pizza and often in combinations with other cheeses including cheddar. </p>

<p>I have noticed in quite a few things I cook like sandwiches, quesadillas and such that both mozzarella and cheddar are very stringy when melted which is perfect for a pizza.</p>

<p>So is it possible to use cheddar as the main cheese in pizza instead of mozzarella?  </p>
","<p>You can use small amounts of cheddar mixed with the other cheeses. But you'd be disappointed in the results if you tried to use it as the main or only cheese on the pizza.</p>

<p>Cheddar cheese doesn't tolerate sustained, high heat as well as some other cheeses. It can scorch, which tastes and smells bad, and/or the fats can separate from the solids as a yellowish oil. The sharper the cheese is, the less well it will tolerate heat.</p>

My plan is to make the meatballs (around 30 - 40) the night before, cook them fully in the oven, and refrigerate them overnight in the crock pot without the sauce.  </p>

<p>My question, to have everything properly heated before lunch time, how early should I start the crock pot?  I don't want to start too early and turn everything to mush, but I also don't want to serve cold meatballs.</p>
","<p>Thank you to everyone for your great advice.  I ended up using a combination of everyone's answers.</p>

<p>I prepared the meatballs the night before and cooked them in the oven as per usual.  I stored them overnight in the fridge in a large ice cream tub, rather than refrigerating the crock.  (Thanks for that tip Joe and MargeGunderson.)</p>

<p>In the morning, I combined everything in the crock pot and brought it to work.  I started the crock pot on low at 8am.  Everything was already cooked, so no need to worry there.

"Are Green Potatoes OK?","49646","","<p>Sometimes when peeling a potato, I find that areas of it are a bright shade of green. Does this mean that:<br>
A) The potato is OK to eat?</p>

<p>B) The potato is OK to eat, as long as the green parts are removed and discarded?  </p>

<p>C) The potato is not OK to eat (and if so, why not)?  </p>
","<p>This just means the potato has been exposed to light and has produced chlorophyll (the green color). It is most likely safe to eat, minus the green areas.</p>

"Lunch meat is slimy on outside?","49595","","<p>Sometimes when I buy lunch meat cuts, from the supermarket, they quickly get slimy on the outside. Regardless of the date which is indicated by the sticker.</p>

<p>I perform taste, smell, and visual checks for discoloration, but the cuts of meat seem to pass all those criteria.</p>

<p>Is this a sign that it's about to expire? Also, why does it get slimy?</p>

<p>FYI: This happens on Dietz BBQ chicken, and this other chicken cut I get from Costco.</p>
","<p>The rate of slime of a piece of food has to do with amount of surface area it has. At each point a food's surface is an entry point for bacteria. Since there is always bacteria on any cutting utensil or machine every cut piece of meat has been seeded with a bacteria culture. Although it might not kill you or make you visibly sick, the slime is coming from microbes which will stress your immune system that might be fighting other things instead. Unless it's Nato beans or oysters slime on food is no good. If the cold cuts are sliming quickly it might be because the grocer is not cleaning the machine properly or somebody's refrigeration is not cold enough, 5 to 10 degree f too warm.</p>

"Can I freeze Parmesan?","49533","","<p>I am thinking about buying a larger amount of Parmesan and freeze it for later use. Is this possible? How long can I keep it for? How is the taste/texture affected?</p>
","<p>Yes, you can freeze parmesan cheese. Even without freezing, Parmesan is very durable since the low water and high salt content prevents mould from growing. The younger varieties may be more prone to mould growth (having a higher water content), but I've kept ripe Parmesan (30-36 months) for at least a year in the fridge without problems (and it would probably have stayed good much longer). Just remember to keep it wrapped in paper, not in a sealed plastic container to prevent a buildup of condensation.</p>
","23948"
"Why wait for water to boil?","49532","","<p>I've always heard that you should wait for water to boil before adding pasta/perogies/vegetables/etc.  What is the reason for this? Is it because it reaches boiling point faster?  If so, why?</p>
","<p>The primary reason is for accuracy and reliability in cooking times. Boiling water is guaranteed (not accounting for altitude) to be at 212 F (100 C). With a set temperature you can then say things like ""boil X for 9 minutes"" with a very high measure of confidence.</p>

<p>You certainly <em>can</em> cook things in the water as you go, but it's going to be a lot more hit-and-miss. Pasta, for example, will begin to cook <em>before</em> it reaches the boiling point. You would need to measure the temperature, and check the pasta regularly to determine when it was done. You can't give someone an accurate cooking time with this method either. The time it takes for water to boil will vary greatly with stove heat output, pot size &amp; shape, and the amount of water.</p>

"How to store Parmesan cheese?","49486","","<p>I recently lucked into about 4 lbs of a delicious Parmesan. Sadly it's already in 4 pieces, and so I'm pretty sure its going to be more prone to spoilage than a single large chunk. How does one go about setting up a block of dry, hard cheese for long term storage? </p>

<p>Also how long can I expect my cheese to retain its flavor?</p>
","<p>If it's high quality, store it in the refrigerator in an air-tight container and try to use it as quickly as possible so you can enjoy it while it's fresh. There are always excuses to use loads of parmesan: cheese plates, pasta dinners, fondue, scones, grilled cheese sandwiches, etc. It should last for 3-4 months in a sealed container in the fridge. As time goes on it will get drier, but that's to be expected. </p>

<p>If you can't eat it in time, consider giving some away to a friend. If you wanted, you could freeze it as well, but I would only use it for baking or melting once thawed as some flavor and a lot of texture will be lost.</p>

"Can you make orange juice with a blender?","49402","","<p>I have a box full of clementines. Can I make orange juice in a blender?</p>
","<p>Sure, you can juice with a blender, as long as (a) the blender is of reasonably good quality and (b) you're not expecting the same kind of yield or quality you'd get with a juicer (electric or manual).  You'll also need a very fine strainer, or cheesecloth if you're like me and hate any amount of pulp.</p>

<p>You'll have to peel them first, and try to remove the pips as well (clementines shouldn't have very many, and might even be totally seedless).  The pith is less of an issue - some people remove it, some people don't, it's a matter of personal preference.  Once the oranges have been ""cleaned"", start blending them on the lowest speed and gradually bring it up to high.  Oranges should have enough juice to blend on their own, but regardless of what fruit you use, be prepared to add water if the blender doesn't seem to be doing much.</p>

<p>Once you've got a fairly consistent purée, pass it through the strainer and mash the pulp against it with the back of a spoon or the bottom of a glass jar.  There's your juice.  You can throw some pulp (purée) back in if you like that texture.</p>

<p>Fruit purée from a blender doesn't really have the best flavour - it tends to turn out somewhat bitter - so you'll probably want to add a <em>small</em> amount of sugar and/or citric acid to compensate.</p>

It says Lasagna Pan on the label, as in you're meant to bake a lasagna in it. No reason why a cake would be dangerous. I imagine you'd be baking the cake at a lower temp than a lasagna.</p>

<p>You'd want to worry about the cake sticking to the sides maybe. You'd also want to account for the fact that the pan is thinner and heat transfer would be different (cooking times and temperatures might need to be adjusted).</p>

","<p>I would strongly suggest not pouring cold or any other kind of water on pasta; it will rinse the delicious starches off its surface, which would otherwise help your sauce cling to it.</p>

<p>To counteract the negative consequences of overcooking due to remaining heat (which, as belisarius suggests in his answer, is the reason other stuff is often rinsed with cold water), just serve it immediately. You want to have the sauce (hot and) ready just before your pasta is, so you can drain the pasta, mix with the sauce, and put it on the table.</p>

"How is boiled rice different from steamed?","48811","","<p>I recently got into a friendly argument with a coworker about how rice should be prepared.</p>

<p>I insisted that the goal was to steam the rice- too much water and it would boil into a soupy pudding.</p>

<p>She claimed that her uncle's family in a little village in India boils their rice with a lot of water and pours off the excess. She says that the rice is ""fine"". I don't believe her.</p>

<p>Is it possible to make rice that isn't a sodden mess by boiling it? If so, how does it differ from steamed rice?</p>
","<p>It depends a great deal on the kind of rice you use. My father always steamed rice in a closed pot with a measured amount of water using American long grain rice. The ratio was one cup rice to two cups of water. </p>

<p>When I got my own place I used the boiling method but chose Basmati rice, as is commonly used in india. This rice has a longer grain and holds its shape after cooking. I tried the boiling method with American long grain rice and found it also worked well. There is no need to measure the water as you cook by timer and taste the rice before draining. It's something similar to how you might cook pasta.</p>

<p>Contrary to what ElendilTheTall said in his answer, when boiling rice you do not have to make careful measurements of rice an water. You put in enough rice for how ever many people and an <em>excess</em> of water. Too much water. You cook the rice in an open pan, so you can see it. When the rice has cooked long enough, you pick out a few grains on your fork and taste them. If they are just soft enough, not too soft, then you quickly drain the water in a sieve or colander and serve. Timing is crucial.</p>

<p>Now, when I move to China, I found a very different kind on rice. It was shorter grained and required several washes before could be cooked. This rice didn't boil well. The unless really well washed, the rice powder in the water turns in into something reassembling wall paper paste. Instead the steaming method must be used. To steam you need to carefully measure the rice and water to get the correct ration. You put on the heat and cover. When the rice has boiled almost dry, you take it off the heat and serve.</p>

"When is a Utility Knife to be preferred over a Chef's or a Paring knife?","48724","","<p>A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_knife#Utility"">Utility knife</a> is a kitchen knife that is midway in size between a Chef's knife and a Paring knife. </p>

<p>Although I own a Utility knife, I don't believe that I have ever used it except when my Chef's knife was unavailable. I took a look around to see what uses I might have missed. Wikipedia says (without citation) that this knife is ""derided as filler for knife sets"" which squares with my experience. A <a href=""http://busycooks.about.com/od/howtocook/a/kitchenknife.htm"">few links</a> call this type of knife a <em>Sandwich knife</em> because it is, ostensibly, good for cutting sandwich cheese and meat. Here's what <a href=""http://www.kniveskitchen.com/blades.html"">one source</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The utility knife is good for cutting larger vegetables and sandwich
  meats that are not large enough for a chef's knife</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a hard time swallowing this because, whether I'm chopping very small items, say Kaffir lime leaves, or large vegetables, say an aubergine, the Chef's knife still feels most comfortable in my hand.</p>

<p>Can someone help me picture a legitimate use for this knife where a Chef's knife or Paring knife wouldn't do better?</p>
","<p>There's no question that a 4 or 5 inch utility knife is going to see a lot less use than your chef's knife or your paring knife, both of which have innumerable uses.  The utility knife is a lot more specific, really being for cases where the paring knife is too short and the chef's knife is too heavy or thick.  I have a 4"" utility knife, which (of course) I got for free with a 6"" Sabatier chef's knife.  It gets used a couple times a week, for:</p>

<ul>
<li>scoring onions in order to mince them</li>
<li>cutting limes in half (a chef's knife seems like overkill here)</li>
<li>splitting small peppers</li>
<li>slicing large California shallots</li>
<li>cutting cheese</li>
</ul>

<p>... and similar occasional, accessory uses.  </p>

<p>Part of the problem with the 4"" utility knife is that it's really a dwarf 6""-8"" utility knife.  The 6"" or 8"" utility knife, now commonly called a ""vegetable knife"", is far more useful; the long, thin blade is excellent for making paper-thin vegetable and fruit slices, and can be used as a fileting knife if you don't have one.  At the 4"" size, though, the utility knife is useful only for cutting things which happen to be small, and only if you don't already have a more general knife dirty.</p>

<p>If what you're really asking is ""can I get rid of this knife?"", the answer is ""yes"".</p>

<p>I have read some fairly official looking reports and articles that say there's not danger, but there is some anecdotal evidence that they can melt, which while apparently harmless, is not ideal.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Can you put polystyrene in the microwave oven</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, when done under correct instruction. The answer to this question is more complicated than just putting a piece of chicken on a block of packing foams. </p>

<p>Polystyrene does not contain water molecules, so it does not heat up when microwaved. Any heating of polystyrene in a microwave is due to indirect heating from the food itself (<a href=""http://www.dartcontainer.com/web/environ.nsf/pages/health-safety.html#microwaving"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>).</p>

<p>Polystyrene is a plastic which have melting point of 240°C, however the melting point of polystyrene is largely irrelevant because polystyrene starts to soften around 80-100°C (<a href=""http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/chem03/chem03714.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>). Since most food is composed primarily of water which evaporates at 100°C, and since a microwave oven heats the food directly rather than through ambient temperature, food heated in microwave rarely go above 100°C under normal operating condition. For comparison purpose, the melting point of common plastic categories used in household products: Polyethylene terephthalate/PET 260°C (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>), Polyethylene/PE 115-135°C (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>), Polypropylene/PP 130–171°C (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>), Tupperwa/r/e is made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) is not rated for microwave, but Tupperwa/v/e that is <a href=""http://www.asianproducts.com/product/A12883440403585372_P12892916873103725/tupperwave-microwave-b3-series.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">rated for microwave and is made of polypropylene</a> can be used up to 180°C (<a href=""http://www.tupperware.com.au/product-gallery/product-guarantee/use-and-care-for-your-tupperware"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>). Note that there are a wide variability in the melting point of each plastic categories because many plastics are manufactured with additives to alter their properties to suit their intended usage; when not designed for contact with food, some of these additives may be toxic, so only use food-grade plastics for dealing with food.</p>

<p>As with any usage plastics there are concerns regarding migration of chemicals in the polystyrene to food. The primary one that is often quoted is styrene. One concern is that heated polystyrene may break down to styrene in very high temperature, but this is generally considered a non-issue at the temperature of a microwave. At normal usage temperature, polystyrene do contain a trace amount of styrene due to imperfection in manufacturing processes. However, the level of styrene in polystyrene is comparable to the level of naturally-occurring styrene in many common food items (<a href=""http://www.dartcontainer.com/web/environ.nsf/files/M-345.pdf/$FILE/M-345.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>). Polystyrene is a polymer of styrene, but they have totally different properties. Polystyrene itself is generally considered to be safe as it is very inert; however, while styrene is not yet classified as carcinogen, it is suspected to be one (<a href=""http://www.epa.gov/chemfact/styre-sd.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>). ""Epidemiology studies to date do not provide clear evidence that styrene causes cancer"" (<a href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1273/2013/06/RISK_IN_PERSP_MAY2002.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>). At very high level styrene is a neurotoxin (<a href=""http://www.ejnet.org/plastics/polystyrene/health.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>), but this is non-issue at the levels found in food containers.</p>

<p>However, polystyrene may not necessarily be the best container to heat up your food for other reasons. While the melting point of polystyrene is only slightly lower than other common plastics, polystyrene starts to soften at around 80-100°C, and handling a floppy cup filled with near-boiling water can be very dangerous. Also since foamed polystyrene is a very poor conductor of heat, you cannot rely on the temperature of the exterior of the cup to sense the temperature of its content.</p>

<p>Microwave-safe polystyrene can be safely used to reheat food in microwave when used according to instructions. Never use polystyrene in conventional oven, and do not use polystyrene to cooking, only reheating. Defrosting meat from polystyrene is most likely of negligible risk, cooking the meat till it's well done is not. Always read the label before using any plastic in microwave. Only use polystyrene plastic that are labelled as microwave safe and never exceed the prescribed operating temperature. Do not reuse single-use containers. If a single-use polystyrene container is rated for microwave use, only use the container for reheating once only. Transfer food to glass or ceramic when you are heating food to the point where a soft polystyrene container can pose burning hazard.</p>

<p>Note, as this is cooking.SE rather than greenpeace.SE, I am excluding discussions that are not directly related to microwave and food, such as environmental/recycling concerns. If you are considering commercial usage of polystyrene materials, you should evaluate these aspect of the issue yourself. There are many cities that ban the use of polystyrene due to primarily environmental concerns rather than safety issues.</p>

"Why should (or shouldn't) we wash rice before cooking?","48368","","<p>There are pretty confusing articles on this topic on the internet.
Some suggest that we should wash them to remove starch, talc, etc. Some suggest that we should not wash them because they are fortified with minerals.</p>

<p>This also varies according to the type of rice - short grain, Jasmine, Basmati, etc. It would be great to have logical reasons instead of just instructions.</p>
","<p>Reasons to wash your rice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Reduce/Control Starch levels</p>

<ul>
<li>Often when you're cooking rice you want distinct grains of rice and for your rice to have texture. In the case of Chinese fried rice for example, you specifically want your rice grains to not stick to one another. If you're talking white rice especially, there will be a lot more loose starch that will form a thickish paste if if you don't rinse it away.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To clean out impurities</p>

<ul>
<li>I imagine there was a time when there were a lot more impurities (dirt, dust, bugs, etc...). I don't know if that's necessarily the case these days with modern manufacturing. If you're concerned about your source, then this may be a factor for you. There's also the <a href=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-10-03/features/ct-food-1003-rice-arsenic-cooking-tips-20121003_1_arsenic-rice-consumption-cooked-rice"">occasional random article</a> that suggest rinsing to reduce levels of something like arsenic (see <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/Metals/ucm319870.htm"">FDA warning</a> on arsenic in rice)... I think 1. is your bigger factor here though.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Reasons to not wash your rice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It removes nutrients.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is true for fortified rice. See <a href=""http://www.ffinetwork.org/about/faq/faq_rice_industry.html"">here for more information</a> on the fortification process. Note, whole grain/brown rices are less often fortified (I want to say they're not fortified, but I actually don't know for sure). So it would depend on what kind of product you're buying and where it came from.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You actually want to keep the extra starch.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is the case for things like risotto where the starch is what gives the dish it's creaminess. <a href=""http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/10/the-food-lab-the-science-of-risotto.html?ref=obinsite"">Serious Eats has a great article</a> that talks about the process.</li>

"How can I keep chopped fruit fresh for 2-3 hours?","48299","","<p>I need to cut up a large amount of fruit for use in a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlova_%28food%29"">pavlova</a> dessert tomorrow night - although the same question would no doubt apply to a fruit salad or other fresh fruit item.</p>

<p>Anyway, I won't have time to do this between dinner and dessert, so I'll need to prepare the fruit a few hours in advance, and I'd like to keep it looking and tasting super-fresh.</p>

<p>What can I do to preserve the appearance, texture, and flavour of the fruit for as long as possible <em>after</em> it's been cut up?</p>

<p>The fruits in question are apples, kiwis, and possibly a few bananas.  I'd also be interested in knowing how to preserve strawberries, raspberries, and similar items.</p>

<p>I'd especially appreciate a complete breakdown of the process, i.e. is the freshness after a few hours going to be affected by how it's cut, storage vessels, air flow, temperatures, etc.?</p>
","<p>I've preserved cut fruit for at least 6 hours before using just lemon juice. Lemon juice inhibits the oxidation of the fruit which prevents browning as well of a loss of crispness.</p>

<p>One lemon should be enough juice for a 1.5 quart bowl of cut fruit. Simply squeeze it over the fruit and toss gently to prevent bruising. </p>

<p>Since you'll be working with apples, kiwis, and bananas I think your best bet will be to keep them separate. The lemon juice will benefit both the apples and bananas, but might only be marginally effective if unnecessary for kiwi -- since kiwi brings plenty of its own citric acid to the table.</p>

<p>The fruit should be stored in the refrigerator to additionally inhibit oxidation. In my experience covering it with plastic wrap with a few holes poked in it works great. Aluminum foil should be fine as well. I find that the covering is primarily to protect your fruit from picking up other odors from within your fridge, and the holes permit the fruit to ""breathe"" releasing the buildup of ethylene gas that will occur if it is completely sealed.</p>

<p>If lemon juice is undesired you can use other citrus juices including: lime juice, orange juice, and pineapple juice. Obviously they will all bring their own flavors. If this flavoring is altogether undesired, then you should consider getting a commercial product called <a href=""http://www.freshpreserving.com/products/fruit-fresh.aspx"">Fruit-Fresh</a>. It's basically a powdered citric-acid, and kosher to boot.</p>

"How long can I store cooked lentils?","48233","","<p>I love lentils mixed with onions, spinach and tuna in the morning, unfortunately I am having a really hard time finding cheap canned lentils in my area. So I wonder, if I cook a big batch of dried red or green lentils how long can I then store them?</p>

<p>Also any tips on how best to store cooked lentils will be much appreciated.</p>
","<p>Depending on the temperature in your fridge, cooked lentils will be safe to eat for 2 to 5 days when using a sealed container, filled with the cooking water. By immersing them, your lentils won't dry out and they'll be ready to use whenever you need them - just drain the amount you need. </p>

<p>If you've got sufficient freezer space you could also freeze the cooked lentils. Just prepare a whole lot of lentils and divide them in individual portions to put in small freezer bags. Make sure you push out any air before sealing the bag. Freezed lentils will be fine anywhere from 4 up to 6 months. </p>

<p>However, I would strongly recommend using dried lentils, which I'm sure you'll be able to find in Copenhagen. Just make a habit of soaking the amount of lentils you need for your breakfast and you'll never have to worry about storing leftovers. It's a lot cheaper too! But above that, dried lentils tend to taste <strong>much</strong> better than canned lentils. :)</p>

"How can I keep ingredients cold while camping?","48007","","<p>I am going camping tomorrow and I was looking for campfire recipes. People use hot dogs, bacon, cheese and other stuff regularly for campfire cooking. But these ingredients must be kept cold.</p>

<p>How do you carry these kinds of items with you? I thought about one of those coolers where you put a block of ice and it keeps cool, but those things are only for a few hours. How do you keep stuff cool on a multi day trip?</p>

<p>EDIT: Just got back from the trip. I used a cooler. It was wonderful. Tilapia, chicken breasts and eggs stayed nicely in the cooler for 2 days.</p>
","<p>Here is my camping strategy. If I'm going for more than a few days, here's what I do.</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with a good air tight cooler. (Big enough to hold everything perishable). Forget those ""gel packs"". Definitely don't get a bag of ice from the convenience store. They melt and mess stuff up. Get a 2 litre bottle, rinse it out, fill it with water and freeze it. (Do this a couple days in advance, if possible). The less air in the better. This won't leak and will stay cold a good time as long as you don't open it.</li>
<li>Take any raw meat that you're NOT planning on eating on the first day and freeze that too. Put the meat and all the frozen stuff at the bottom and to one side. My bottle of ice goes either directly on top of the meat or right beside it. This way, my meat has at least an extra day or two of grace and I don't need to waste extra space with an ice pack.</li>
<li>Then layer stuff that isn't frozen, but can handle a little freezing on the next layer. Then work your way up, to any produce being on the top layer. Plan for the coldest stuff to be at the bottom and/or near the ice packs. Depending on what's in there, sometimes I put a towel between the frozen stuff and the non frozen stuff to insulate it a bit better. And prevent produce that shouldn't be frozen from freezing.</li>
<li>Then on each day, I move the frozen meat for the next day meat away from the ice packs and upward to allow it to defrost (making sure, it's sealed, so I don't get any raw meat juice leaking out).</li>
<li>On the last day, the water in the bottle can be drank, but once you start emptying it, it'll start melting. </li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, minimize the time you keep it open if possible. I realize you said you're going camping tomorrow, so freezing a 2 litre bottle might not happen in time. In this case, I'd switch to multiple smaller bottles and failing that those gel packs. I hate bags of ice, as they melt and make a mess. Finding cheese in a pool of water is never fun. The rest of the stuff would still apply. This usually lasts me quite a few days.</p>

<p>Will adding the ingredients at different times make a difference?<br>

","<p>I always go in this order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Garlic/ginger/chili/spring onion whites</li>

</ul>

<p>If I'm using bigger veg like broccoli/cauliflower then I do them separately to the other veg.  I use a little of the chili/garlic/ginger and fry that for 30 secs, add the broccoli fry for another minute or so just to brown the florets, then add some water, turn down the heat and put on a lid, to steam the broccoli.  Once its done I remove to a separate plate the add back in at the end.</p>

<p>It basically depends on how much you like each veg cooked.  If you prefer your peppers crunchy, put them in nearer the end.</p>

"Should maple syrup be stored in the refrigerator?","47834","","<p>Is there any reason to store maple syrup in the refrigerator? It tastes better when it's a little warmer. </p>
","<p>I'll assume that you're talking about pure maple syrup in a glass container; if it's that adulterated pancake syrup then it's probably riddled with preservatives, so any advice here doesn't apply.</p>

<p>Pure maple syrup can and will grow mold on the surface if left in a cupboard.  There are <a href=""http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/575573"">several reports</a> of this happening, and although several of those people say that it's OK to simply strain the mold and re-boil the maple syrup, (a) I wouldn't chance it, and (b) that process is hardly any more convenient than simply taking it out of the refrigerator a half-hour earlier and letting it come up to room temperature.</p>

<p>Maple syrup <em>should</em> be stored in the refrigerator.  It doesn't <em>have</em> to be, and it will probably take at least a year for it to grow any mold if left in the pantry.  But it will last longer in the refrigerator; I've seen refrigerated jars 3+ years old without any mold.</p>

"How do I sweat onions?","47769","","<p>A recipe calls for me to sweat finely chopped onions.  What do I do, and why?</p>
","<p>First, finely chop the onions.  This makes them smaller, faster-cooking, and less of a textural presence in the dish.  Do it by cutting straight through the poles of the onion, resulting in two halves.  Then chop off the knobs and peel off the outer layer.  Run the knife 8 or 9 times along the vertical (from pole to pole), but <em>don't</em> sever one end completely.  Cut finely across these verticals to make a fine dice.  Run the knife over the pile a few times if your cut isn't small enough.</p>

<p>Second, cook the onions. The purpose of sweating is to draw moisture out, concentrating the flavor and enhancing conversion from starch to sugar. Heating the onions releases their aroma and reduces the chemical bitterness they exhibit when raw.  Heat up some oil in a pan to medium-low heat.  Add the onions.  Add salt.  I wouldn't cover the pan, since the lid will prevent steam from escaping.  Stir/shake to prevent sticking or burning.  The onions will get soft and then translucent. (Eventually, if you kept going they would get limp and browned; this is referred to as caramelized and considered a different thing than sweated, so although it's just further along the same spectrum, you shouldn't go that far for this recipe).</p>

<p>That's how I'd do it and why.  I don't know if it's a textbook answer.</p>

"What is the difference between coffee grinds/beans labeled as ""espresso coffee"" and ordinary coffee?","47694","","<p>I was reminded of this curiosity just moments ago when I got a craving for coffee and couldn't find any normal coffee beans/grounds (owing to the fact that I don't normally drink coffee at home anymore).</p>

<p>I unwittingly purchased this so-called espresso coffee at a supermarket in the heart of the Italian district here, and most of the writing on it is Italian; I didn't even realize my mistake until after I had used it three or four times to brew normal coffee and saw, in very tiny letters, the words ""espresso coffee"" written on one of the sides.</p>

<p>So I shelved that coffee until today; even though it seemed fine, I figured I might have been using it inappropriately.  After my act of desperation today I decided to look this up.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">According to Wikipedia:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Espresso is not a specific bean or roast level; it is a coffee brewing method. Any bean or roasting level can be used to produce authentic espresso and different beans have unique flavor profiles lending themselves to different roasting levels and styles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what I had always believed.  The answer to <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/5900/41"">What factors lead to rich crema on espresso?</a> does hint at a possible difference, though: It says that darker roasts are better for producing crema.  However, the coffee I have does not seem to be <em>particularly</em> dark a roast; it's dark, but I've had ""normal"" coffee that was darker.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I'm a little confused, and the internet is helping me a whole lot.  Maybe it's because the caffeine hasn't kicked in yet.</p>

<p>Is there an appreciable difference between coffee beans or coffee grounds labeled as ""espresso coffee"" and plain, ordinary coffee?  If so, what is it?</p>

<p>Perhaps more importantly, is espresso coffee suitable for use in a normal coffee maker or press?</p>
","<p>It IS the roast that is the difference.  The only real difference in the beans is that some beans taste better at a higher roast than others, so they are more appropriate for espresso.  Your Italian grocery coffee company may be using the espresso label for marketing purposes, but in general, espresso coffee beans can be the same beans that are used for ""regular"" coffee, but roasted to a French or Italian roast level, which is darker than City or Full City.</p>

<p>Since the advent of Starbucks, many roasts are much darker than they used to be.  Dunkin' Donuts coffee, which is a Full City roast, used to be the norm, but now a French seems to be what you can buy.  </p>

<p>I roast my own coffee and take it to just into the second crack which is, generally, a Full City roast...a point where the character of the coffee predominates rather than the flavor of the roast.  There is more information about roasts at <a href=""http://www.sweetmarias.com/roasting-VisualGuideV2.php"">Sweet Marias where I buy my green beans</a>, and reading through the site will give you way more of a coffee education than you probably ever wanted. </p>

<p>So, yes, you can use the coffee you have to make brewed coffee.  It will probably be roastier than you would normally have, unless it is just a marketing ploy, in which case it will taste normal.  Consider how long you have had this coffee; if it has been shelved for a while ""normal"" probably won't be all that great, since freshly roasted coffee is, generally, way better than old coffee.  But as long as the oils aren't rancid, it is more likely just going to be bland.</p>

"Cooking pasta in the microwave","47593","","<p>I have a microwave ""pot"" that I use for steaming vegetables. The instructions say it can also be used for cooking pasta, which seems sacrilege to me.<br>
Does anybody know if the result would be a good <em>al dente</em> pasta if cooked in the microwave?  I'd hate to waste a batch of my home made pasta just to try it.</p>
","<p>You know, I'm right there with you on the sacrilege part, but nowadays I microwave pasta all the time. <strong>You need to use a non-starchy pasta for this to work.</strong> I use plain store-bought Barilla Plus because I love it anyway.  For fresh pasta, you could try a small experiment; I've never tried with freshly-made pasta.</p>

<p>It takes less time than boiling on the stove for me because I do this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fill up the electric kettle with water and turn it on.</li>
<li>I use a 1/2 gallon Pyrex measuring cup as my ""pot"", and I put an inch or so of water in that and pop it in the microwave for four minutes to warm it up.</li>
<li>When the water's boiling in the kettle and the oven timer expires, I take out the Pyrex container, add the pasta and a little oil and some salt (optionally a little vinegar), and then pour in the boiling water to cover by an inch or so.</li>
<li>Dumpling-like pasta (rotini or penne) take about 8:30 to cook on high (I've got I <em>think</em> an 1100 watt oven; experiment); spaghetti 5:30, thin spaghetti 4:30.</li>
</ol>

<p>I know it sounds like a horrible sin, but I started doing it when I needed to cook small portions of pasta for my kids.  I tried it myself, and realized that I could tell absolutely no difference from the results I got in my big pasta pot. When I need to boil a lot of pasta (like 2 14oz boxes) I still use the big pot of course, but a pound or less actually cooks up perfectly fine. My pasta cooker is enormous and takes a long time to come up to the boil.</p>

<p>Now once I tried this (not thinking clearly, obviously) with some very starchy, fancy pasta, and it did  not work <strong>at all</strong>. But maybe because it's got so much extra protein, Barilla Plus comes out absolutely fine. (It's good for you too.)</p>

<p><em>edit</em> &mdash; Here's an update: I still do this, but recently one of the seemingly endless succession of microwave ovens I've had recently died, and I'm pretty sure it's because it somewhat frequently overheated while doing this very thing (cooking pasta). Now I don't blame the technique, really, since an oven should probably be designed with the possibility of hot stuff being inside of them for some periods of time, but be warned. (It overheated probably 10 times or so over the course of a couple years before dying, so it was right about at what I find to be typical end-of-life anyway.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SUITABLE FOR CONVENTIONAL OVEN<br>
  SUITABLE FOR USE OVER FLAME<br>
  SUITABLE FOR MICROWAVE OVEN</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can it be considered safe (as it says)?</p>
","<p>Sometimes. Basically, this is the same as asking if glass is oven safe:</p>

<p>Generally, glass is oven-safe if taken from room temperature and put in a moderate-temperature, preheated oven. The key thing is to avoid temperature shocks (which will cause the glass to shatter). Some glass is specifically designed for oven use (either by being tempered or made of borosilicate glass). Often glassware will say if it is safe for oven use or not, and under what conditions—check the packaging or instructions it came with.</p>

<p>You also need to take precautions when removing glass from the oven. Do not set it on something that'll conduct heat away rapidly, such as a wet countertop.</p>

<p>Before heating glassware, inspect it for damage. Scratches, chips, etc. make failure much more likely. This applies to the microwave as well.</p>

<p>Note that non-glass parts of microwave-safe glassware may not be oven safe. For example, if it has a plastic lid, that should generally not be used in the oven (even though its OK in the microwave).</p>

<h2>edit:</h2>

<p>In response to your update, that oven is what would often be called a toaster or countertop oven. Those change temperature much more rapidly than a larger oven (which can be electric as well). So, generally, you'd avoid glass in them.</p>

<p>But, your glass says it can be used over a flame, from the freezer. So it's clearly one of the very shock-resistant ones, possibly borosilicate. I wouldn't expect it to be a problem. Just make sure to preheat the oven.</p>

<p>Also, since you know who made it, you can of course contact the manufacturer to confirm.</p>

"How can I keep a cheesecake from cracking?","47451","","<p>I've been making cheesecakes for a while and they always end up cracking on the top.  I was told to try putting a pan of water in the oven with it to keep the humidity up, which might help a little, but then it tends to crack when it's cooling.  Am I overcooking?  Or baking at the wrong temperature?  Whipped cream can only cover up so much.</p>
","<p>To make a good baked cheesecake, I was taught the following, and it has ALWAYS worked:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with room temperature ingredients.</li>
<li>DO NOT over-mix. This is a significant cause of cracking, as the incorporated air tends to souffle.</li>
<li>When baking, always bake in a bain-marie (put your cake into a water bath for insulation).</li>
<li>Bake half an hour at 300° F / 150° C.  Then, turn off the oven, open the oven door, and rest for 30 minutes.  Then, close the oven and bake 30 to 40 minutes more at 300° F / 150° C.</li>
</ul>

<p>My first pastry chef taught me this, and it always works.</p>

"How long can fresh yeast be frozen?","47343","","<p>I've heard that I can actually buy a large box of fresh yeast cubes, freeze it, and take one out of the freezer twelve hours before using it, to let it slowly get to room temperature again.</p>

<p>How long can I freeze the yeast for? Will it slowly degrade, or will it just be suddenly unusable after a certain length of time?</p>
","<p>The reason dry yeast is so popular is that it is easier to store, and is less persnickety about it than fresh yeast. Treat dry yeast right and it can last for a couple of years or more. Fresh yeast is highly perishable, and it <em>should</em> be frozen if you're not going to use it within a couple of days. If you're lucky, you can get significantly more time from fresh yeast by freezing it within just a day or two of getting it home.</p>

<p>The thing is, yeast is a living thing and you just can't know what experiences it has had before arriving in your kitchen. As such, it's impossible to predict just how much extra (past the expiration date) time you are going to get from freezing it. A month? Probably. Two months? I wouldn't count on it, but maybe. 6 months? Highly unlikely, but stranger things have happened.</p>

<p>If you do freeze fresh yeast, wrap it very well. Moisture and air are your enemies. Do put it in the refrigerator at least 12 hours prior to use, then let it spend the last hour on the counter. As a last step before putting together your dough, proof it. Proof the yeast by mixing it with the warm (100Fish) water called for in the recipe and, if applicable, the sugar. If there is no sugar in the recipe, give it a 1/2 tsp of flour (per loaf). Within 5-10 minutes it should be quite bubbly and growing. If it doesn't look like it's doing much, throw it away. You might as well throw away all of the yeast you have from that batch. Go to the store and get more yeast before proceeding with the recipe.</p>

<p>Properly stored, yeast usually dies at least somewhat gradually. You may see a slight progressive decrease in the vigor of your yeast as it gets older. Personally, once I see that I'll use it <em>that</em> time, but I'll get more for next time.</p>

<p>Anymore, fresh yeast is hardly seen except in professional bakeries. It's easy to see why. If you're going to make multiple loaves in a week, then maybe fresh yeast is worth it. Now that I have found <strong>2 pound</strong> packages of Fleischmann's instant dry yeast (expiration almost 2 years out) at Sam's Club for $6, I think my days of messing with fresh yeast are over. (BTW 2lbs of dry yeast = about 130 loaves)</p>

<p>EDIT: Interestingly, Red Star disagrees and doesn't recommend freezing fresh yeast. This goes against my experience and the cynic in me wonders of their recommendation has more to do with selling yeast than anything else.</p>

","<p>I just happened across this older question and found the answers provided, including the information in the link to wikipedia to be incorrect.</p>

<h2>All Prime Ribs are Standing Rib Roasts, <em>not</em> all Standing Rib Roasts are Prime Rib.</h2>

<ul>
<li>[see edit below] A ""<em>Prime Rib</em>"" is a <em>standing rib roast</em>, from a beef that has
achieved a USDA Grade of ""Prime"".</li>
<li>Bone-In or Bone-out are separate distinctions the can be applied to
any standing rib roast, regardless of grade.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>U.S. Prime – This is the highest grade of beef with the most fat
  marbling. This meat is very tender and only accounts for about 2.9% of
  all graded beef. U.S. Prime is usually reserved for high end dining
  establishments. Because this beef has such a high level of fat
  marbling, it is excellent for dry heat cooking methods. <a href=""http://foodreference.about.com/od/Meat/a/Usda-Beef-Grades.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">from: http://foodreference.about.com/od/Meat/a/Usda-Beef-Grades.htm</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, technically a Prime Rib is not a 'steak' but rather a 'slice of roast'. If one takes a slice from a raw rib primal and grills or broils it as a steak it is a <strong><em>""Rib Eye""</em></strong>, and can also be either <em>""bone-in""</em> or <em>""bone-out""</em>. (the use of the word 'primal' refers to a primary cut of beef, the first cuts a butcher will use to section a beef beyond quartering, it is utterly unrelated to the word ""prime"" in ""Prime Rib"" )</p>

<hr>

<p>[Edit 12-21-17: Additional research indicates I had causality inverted. The USDA choose the term ""Prime"" because of the popularity of ""Prime Rib"", a term that apparently existed before the USDA grading system. More importantly the 'Prime Rib' is cut from between the #6 and #12 ribs, but may be of a grade other than 'Prime'. However, the initial point remains true that ""All Prime Ribs are standing Rib Roasts, but not all Standing Rib Roasts are Prime Ribs"". The 'Standing Rib Roast' may include (or be exclusively) from outside the 6-12 range. The potential difference being from where within the rib primal the roast is cut.]</p>

"How to clean cauliflower?","47110","","<p>I have asked many people about ""best to way to clean cauliflower"" before cooking. I got several answers, like keeping in salt water or add soak in turmeric mixed water.
And also how do you remove worms from cauliflower?</p>
","<p>A bucket of salty water is the best way to get rid of bugs. That said, I've never had a problem with bugs in store-bought cauliflower.</p>

<p>You need to completely submerge the head in water, so a bucket that can fit the whole head is best. Add about 2 Tbsp salt per quart warm water to get it nice and salty. Submerge the head, florets down (they float, so a weight to keep it submerged will help). Let sit 5-10 minutes, remove, rinse, and eat as you please.</p>

<p>The salt in the water helps to kill the bugs and encourage them to let go. It also might kill some surface contamination if it exists, but this isn't really the point. You should see bugs either floating or at the bottom when you remove the cauliflower.</p>

"Can you freeze apples?","46818","","<p>What is the best way to freeze apples? I am planning on cooking with them when they defrost. </p>
","<p>Depending on what you're going to cook, there are a few ways you can freeze them.</p>

<p>For most uses, I find the simplest method is just to peel, core, and slice them.  First, you want to keep the slices from browning using one of the following methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dip them in lemon juice.  </li>
<li>Dip in a salt water dip (2 tbsp salt to 1 gallon water)</li>
<li>Quickly steam/blanch (1-2 minutes) to stop the enzymes that cause browning,</li>
<li>Pack them in a sugar syrup (usually used when you plan to serve the apples as-is after defrosting, see link referenced below).  A good ratio is 2 cups sugar to 3 cups of water, plus 1/2 tsp of ascorbic acid to prevent browning.  You'll want to make about 1 cup syrup per quart of apples.</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally, I prefer the lemon juice method, it's proven to be quite effective for me and I always have lemons in hand in the house.</p>

<p>Freeze apple slices on a single layer on a cookie sheet (in the bottom of the freezer) then transfer to a Ziploc bag when solid.  The sheet method allows them to freeze as fast as possible in the typical home freezer, and prevents them from sticking together so you can portion them as you need them.  If you're going to be storing for a <em>long</em> time, wrap them in plastic wrap and then foil before putting in the bag.</p>

<p>Some people just wash and freeze them whole, though I prefer do to the prep before freezing so I can just pull them out of the freezer and use them.  They will freeze well whole, however I find that the ruptured cell walls cause them to be harder to peel/core after defrosting using this method.</p>

<p>If you're going to make a pie, you can also freeze them with sugars and spices etc (prepared just as you would make a pie filling) in a pie pan.  You can then take them out of the freezer like that, drop the prepared, shaped mixture right into a pie crust, and bake your pie with a slight increase in baking time.</p>

<p>As far as how long they'll last, they'll be safe indefinitely, but will lose flavor after a few months, I wouldn't recommend going past 6.  <a href=""http://www.stilltasty.com/fooditems/index/16377"">Stilltasty</a> says 2-4 but I've pushed it further than that and there wasn't a ton of flavor loss.

"What ingredients make powdered sugar not gluten-free?","46416","","<p>I am looking to start cooking more things gluten free for my girlfriend, and have heard that powdered sugar may or may not be considered gluten free. What do I need to look for in the ingredients to keep powdered sugar gluten-free?</p>
","<p>The simple answer to your question is the kind of starch they use. Most use cornstarch or tapioca starch, neither of which contain gluten, so most powdered sugar shouldn't contain gluten. If the type of starch isn't listed, don't buy that product.</p>

<p>For <em>absolutely</em> no gluten, it gets a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>A Google search for ""Gluten Free Powdered Sugar"" only yielded a few brands that make a ""gluten-free"" claim. Since most brands of powdered sugar don't contain any ingredients that would normally contain gluten, look for the line ""This product is processed in a facility that also processes wheat"". Choose a powdered sugar that lists the starch used as cornstarch, tapioca starch or other non-gluten starch and that doesn't have that line on the label. Of course I can only speak to US labeling, other countries may be different.</p>

<p>One brand, Domino Sugar, stood out to really stand by their claim of gluten free.  <a href=""http://www.gfoverflow.com/product.php?id=003907"" rel=""nofollow"">Domino's Gluten Free Claim</a>  (C&amp;H is Domino, BTW). I happen to have some C&amp;H powdered sugar, so I looked at the label. There is no ""Gluten-Free"" claim on the label, but the ingredients listed are only sugar and corntarch, and there is no ""this product is processed in a facility..."" warning. Walmart brand also pops up on the ""Gluten Free Powdered Sugar"" search, they say ""Naturally gluten-free food"". The FDA requires that claim not be misleading, so if they do use equipment to process the sugar that also processes gluten-containing ingredients, the sugar cannot contain more that 20 ppm gluten.</p>

<p>There is one way to know for sure about any ingredient you use, or to even to check your final dish. Elisa Technologies, a very well respected name in medical laboratory testing, has put out home test strips sensitive to 10 ppm, that's half the concentration of gluten the FDA allows for a product to be certified ""gluten-free"".  If a product tested contains less than 20 ppm gluten the US, Canada and the European Union allow that product to use ""Gluten Free"" on the label. <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/Allergens/ucm362880.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">FDA Announcement</a> At over $10 a strip, you'd want to use them judiciously, but if I or someone I loved had serious health issues that did not allow gluten, I'd get these strips. <a href=""http://www.ezgluten.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Test Strips</a></p>

"How does the order of mixing ingredients affect the resulting cake?","46416","","<p>I wanted to bake a Devil's cake yesterday. I got my recipe from a trusted book and I was surprised to see that the order of mixing was as follows: sift together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt, then mix eggs one by one. Then butter, then other ingredients.</p>

<p>This is contrary to the process I was used to i.e. butter &amp; sugar, then eggs etc.</p>

<p>I was suprised to see that the eggs mixed very good and that, in the end, there was no sugar granules had remained. I was not suprised to see that the resulting cake was dense.</p>

<p>But it still baffles me. I guess there are different ways to mix a cake, depending on how you want your cake to be. Like, flour first -> dense cake, eggs first -> light cake, butter first -> standard cake.</p>

<p>While I can understand that beating the eggs first traps air, what the other methods do is not clear to me.</p>

<p>So, what result do the different mixing strategies give?</p>
","<p>I'll try to break this down into components to make it simpler.</p>

<p>If a <a href=""http://www.joepastry.com/2014/making-lemon-tea-bread/"" rel=""nofollow"">recipe</a> starts by combining sugar and a solid fat (creaming), this incorporates small air bubbles into the batter which will be seed bubbles for the carbon dioxide produced by chemical leavening. Occasionally, this creaming is used alone for leavening (as in traditional poundcakes).</p>

<p>If the flour is added straight to this, it can help prevent the batter from curdling later if a colder ingredient is added. This also coats the flour with fat, preventing gluten development and making a very fine, tender crumb since the flour is ""waterproofed"" before other liquids are added.</p>

<p>If eggs are added to the fat and sugar, you can make an emulsified cake but the presence of water when the flour is added can make it slightly tougher.</p>

<p>Some <a href=""http://www.theppk.com/2008/08/just-chocolate-cake/"" rel=""nofollow"">recipes</a> (usually with oil) require all the liquids to be mixed together, and then added to all the dry ingredients which have already been mixed. Again, this can sometimes lead to a tougher cake since the flour is exposed to water. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.joepastry.com/2014/making-white-cake-layers/"" rel=""nofollow"">Another method</a> is to mix all the dry ingredients, then incorporate the solid fat into that, then add liquids. This will usually lead to tender cakes as the flour has been coated with fat before liquids are added.</p>

<p>If a <a href=""http://www.joepastry.com/2014/making-chocolate-genoise/"" rel=""nofollow"">cake</a> is leavened with whipped egg whites (or whole eggs), those will be added last to prevent the bubbles from being knocked out by excess stirring.</p>

<p>You pretty much always want the fat to be present when the flour is added though. As you saw in your recipe, adding liquid to the flour without the fat will allow too much gluten development and make your cake tough and dense.</p>

sauce for 24 hours</li>
<li>I used a deep fryer and canola oil. 175C.</li>
<li>Prior to ""dressing"" the chicken, I let the excess buttermilk brine drip off the chicken. I then seasoned it with Cajun seasoning</li>
<li>I made a batter using an egg, self rising flour, milk, baking powder</li>
<li>I also tried using just plain flour for breading</li>
</ol>

<p>Results:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using the batter, the chicken came out looking burned and too smooth (didn't have that crunchy look). It burned too much that I couldn't finish cooking the chicken.</li>
<li>Using the flour, the chicken came out with a thin crust, somewhat crispy, but also too burnt.</li>
<li>Dipping the chicken in the batter AND then flour gave a bulky &amp; crunchy look. However, again, the result looked too burnt.</li>

<p>Modifications:</p>

<p>Results:</p>

<p>Burnt chicken whose crust wasn't really sticking to the skin/meat.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<p>Any suggestions on what I can do to improve? I'm guessing something in the batter is causing the burnt coat. What flour should I use? What can I do to make the coat stick to the skin/meat? Any other suggestions on what to do?</p>
","<p>160C sounds about right for cooking oil temp. I typically shallow fry on the stovetop for about 10-12 minutes for the thighs and then transfer them to a 175C oven to finish cooking (if needed) and then repeat with the breasts. I would stay away from ""battering"" if you are looking to replicate something like popeye's.</p>

<p>A few things I do to ensure a nice thick crunchy crust:</p>

<ol>
<li>Put your flour (seasoning or not thats up to you) in a very large zip top bag or paper bag will work too so that when you put the chicken in you can ""tumble"" it around to be coated like in a dryer. I find that this is cleaner and more effective in creating a crust.</li>
<li>pull out the dredged chicken, redip it in the buttermilk and then throw it back in the bag to tumble.</li>
<li>let the chicken rest on an elevated rack for 15-20 minutes (up to an hour ideally) to allow the dredge to set and adhere to the chicken well. This helps prevent the dreaded ""skin falling off the meat"" phenomenon. </li>

If it is hard white wheat this might explain the color, as ground white wheat doesn't look that much darker than all-purpose flour.  </p>

<p>Like typical grocery store whole wheat flour, atta flour is <strong>coarsely ground</strong>.  This may give your bread a more grainy texture (not a bad thing), and makes atta unideal for cakes, biscuits, and quick breads unless you like them with a coarse texture in the crumb.  If you would like to use whole wheat for baking other than bread, whole wheat pastry flour is the usual suggestion (or grind wheat yourself to a very find grind).</p>

"Fixing Sticky Seasoning on Cast-Iron Pan","45817","","<p>I screwed up the seasoning on my cast-iron pan. I forgot to flip it upside-down, so instead of that hard, smooth surface, it became sticky and gummy.</p>

<p>Is it possible to repair by reheating it again, upside-down, at the proper temperature?</p>

<p>Or do I need to strip it and reseason from scratch?</p>
","<p>You don't have to re-season from scratch, just get rid of the sticky residue and make sure that the next layer of seasoning is very fully cooked on.  The easiest way to remove the sticky residue is to scrape off what you can with a spatula, scrub off the rest with kosher salt and baking soda, and clean that up. Then give it a couple more passes of seasoning to even out the layer, making sure to leave it in the oven extra-long for the next seasoning.  The extra cook time helps avoid having a sticky spot reappear.</p>

<p><strong>What causes this?</strong>
This happens when the oil pools in one spot, and doesn't get heated long/hot enough to form the seasoning layer.  If you resume seasoning without removing the sticky residue, it will form a bubble of uneven seasoning that flakes off, exposing the less seasoned stuff below. I learned that the <em>hard way.</em></p>

"Why is it important to add salt during cooking?","45338","","<p>This may seem like a silly question, but given that each persons' tastes are different why is it that salt is added during cooking?  It seems better to just allow the person eating the food to add their own salt to taste as opposed to forcing the same amount of saltiness on everyone equally. </p>
","<p>A few general reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>As soegaard says, the salt is often better distributed through the food if it's added during cooking. This is especially true for foods which have been carefully assembled; you can't always just stir things up! Some foods also take a while for flavors to soak through; think about potatoes in a chunky soup. If you add salt only at the table, the liquid will benefit, but the potatoes will generally taste bland, like they were unsalted. Then there are things where it <em>really</em> needs to be cooked in - I doubt many people want to sprinkle salt on a chocolate chip cookie.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes the quantities need to be pretty small, so mixing a small amount into the whole recipe is doable, while if you tried to add it at the table, even a little sprinkle would be too much. Baked goods are a good example here too.</p></li>
<li><p>Virtually everyone likes at least a little salt, so it's usually quite safe to add at least a little. The food will end up tasting good to many people, and then some can add more. Often the groups of people that we eat with have similar enough tastes that it's a non-issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes salt actually affects the cooking process, not just the flavor. It can help draw moisture out of sweating vegetables, softening them faster. It's abrasive (before dissolving, of course), and can help denature proteins.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But of course, if you're eating with people who don't like much salt at all, and salt can easily be added at the table (a pureed soup, for example), then there's nothing wrong with waiting until then.</p>

"Why and when does a skin form on heated milk and how can I prevent it?","45180","","<p>When I heat milk, sometimes a skin forms on it, which I'd like to avoid. I originally thought that this happens above some specific temperature, but after paying attention more closely, it seems to me that the skin forms while the milk is already cooling down again. Also, it does not happen every time, though I don't know what I do differently.</p>
","<p>I think I found the exact answer somewhere on the net. From my experience, I know frequent stirring and also adding cold milk when it cools down will prevent it. </p>

<p>Also, I notice this also happens for soy milk and the layer from soy milk is used to create lots of different soy products</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.wisegeek.com/why-does-milk-form-a-skin-when-it-is-heated.htm"">http://www.wisegeek.com/why-does-milk-form-a-skin-when-it-is-heated.htm</a></p>

<p><em>After you’ve heated a glass of milk or hot chocolate, sometimes the milk forms a skin on top of the liquid. The skin is comprised of solid proteins that combine with the milk’s fat molecules, which begin to evaporate as the milk is heated. These proteins, casein and beta, clump together when the liquid reaches a temperature of around 113 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit (45 to 50 Celsius). As the heating continues, the soft protein layer begins to dry out, which is why the milk forms a skin on the liquid’s surface. This layer of skin forms a hard barrier, causing steam to build up beneath it and increase the liquid’s temperature. When left alone, this often causes the milk to boil over.
Though milk forms a skin when heated in most cases, there are several ways to prevent this skin from forming. If you plan to heat the milk over the stovetop, frequent stirring will break up the protein and fat molecules, so that the membrane will not develop. If you are heating milk in a microwave, you can place a wax paper lid known as a “cartouche” on top of the container, which will slow the evaporation process and maintain the milk’s liquid form.
The milk forms a skin only on heated milk that contains fat. If you are heating skim milk, there is no danger of a skin forming on top. Because skim milk contains no fat, the protein molecules have nothing to bond with, and are unable to coagulate.
When made with full-fat, unpasteurized milk, the milk forms a skin that is thicker than the skin on top of low fat milk. The layer of film that develops after heating whole milk can result in a traditional English delicacy called “clotted cream,” which is spread on scones for afternoon tea. To make your own version of clotted cream at home, you can combine two parts whole milk with one part heavy cream, warming the mixture on low heat until the milk forms a skin. Leave the mixture alone overnight, and in the morning, the milk combination will be covered with a rich, creamy layer that can be spooned onto scones or muffins.</em></p>

"How do I prevent burned chicken breasts when cooking on the stovetop?","45112","","<p>Ok I'm going crazy with this. I've tried everything, but no matter what I do, it always results in my chicken breast burning and becoming black. Here is what I usually do:</p>

<p>Grab a chicken breast, wash it with water.</p>

<p>Next, I season it. I usually add salt, pepper, curry, and lemon pepper.</p>

<p>Then I grab a pan and I've tried these things to cook the chicken with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Olive Oil</li>
<li>Vegetable Oil</li>
<li>Butter</li>
</ul>

","<p>I suspect the blackness comes from the spices you put on the chicken burning.</p>

<p>Try this technique I learnt from Jamie Oliver: Season your chicken as normal. Put the pan on a high heat until it's hot (not stupid-hot, just hot). Add olive oil and the chicken skin-side down. Cook for about 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, take a square of baking parchment or greaseproof paper big enough to cover the pan. Fold it in half until you have a 'folded fan' shape. Hold the point so it's roughly over the middle of the pan, and tear off any excess that goes over the side of the pan. Unfold and you should have a circle of paper. Scrunch it up, then run it under a cold tap and give it a shake.</p>

<p>Turn the chicken over, turn the heat to medium low, then place the wet paper (a 'cartouche') on to the chicken. Finally put a heavy pan lid (the lid from a casserole is ideal) on top. Cook for another 20 minutes.</p>

<p>The moisture in the cartouche helps keep the chicken moist and prevents it from burning. Cooking time will depend on the thickness of the breast, so do check it's cooked through before eating (cut it open and check it's not pink).</p>

"Can/should I use baking soda when cooking beans?","44917","","<p>My recipe for hummus says to cook the garbanzo beans with a little baking soda to soften them. Does this work with other legumes? </p>

<p>I've often seen the advice against salting the cooking water for beans, as it supposedly toughens them. Will a different sodium compound, bicarbonate, have the opposite effect? </p>

<p>Would love to know the science of this issue. </p>
","<p>Chick Peas (aka Garbanzo or Gram) are slightly different to other <strong>dried pulses</strong>, but the cooking is affected by whether they are to be cooked straight or whether they were soaked (from an hour or two to overnight) first. </p>

<p>In the UK a variety of dried peas known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrowfat_peas"" rel=""nofollow"">marrowfat peas</a> are sold with a tablet containing bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) to add to the soaking water to ""soften"" it. They are then cooked to destruction as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushy_peas"" rel=""nofollow"">mushy peas</a>. That is the cooking method of that dish which requires that outcome -- a sort of green soup with lumps in it! But cooking with baking/bicarbonate of soda destroys the thiamin and also makes them too soft for what is usually needed. </p>

<p>The various <strong>dried</strong> lentil, pea and bean varieties are all going to need different cooking times no matter how they are cooked, but the traditional the way each was treated and cooked represents the smallest energy consumption or fuel cost to time ratio.</p>

<p>In the example of chick peas, soaking in fresh water for an hour or two will usually be sufficient to reduce cooking time by up to 50%. Kidney beans will need an overnight soak and are the only example of a bean I have personally encountered which will never become tender enough to eat if soaking is omitted. (True story, but then I stopped trying after they had been on the stove all day and most of a night!)</p>

<p>The addition of bicarbonate of soda in <strong>fresh green beans</strong> (also other ""greens"" such as cabbage and sprouts) was specifically to enhance the colour, or rather to stop the beans turning a grey colour -- usually only a problem if they are being cooked too long. If so much was added to taste of soap, then obviously far too much was added and the beans cooked far too long. If ever using soda for greens, always use a tiny pinch added when the water has returned to the boil. Discard all the water and drain well to serve or add to another dish.</p>

<p>Cooking habits have changed over recent years, as have our tastes. It would no longer be appropriate to serve fresh beans or cabbage which have been boiled hard for half an hour. Which is why some older recipes need editing and ""taking with a pinch of salt"" (if you will excuse the pun). Salt I will not even mention because of the Seasoned Advice nutrition police who cut any reference to health and nutrition from posts.</p>

"Are nectarine seeds edible?","44899","","<p>Eating a nectarine this afternoon, I found the pit was cracked open. Curious, I broke it apart and found an almond-like seed (or nut?) inside. </p>

<p>I remember hearing that some almonds, or perhaps their relatives (stone fruit?), may be poisonous in their natural form. Do nectarines fall into that category? If so, is there some treatment I can give it to destroy the poison (and yet keep it good for food, and a delight to the eyes, and to be desired to make one wise)? Will I surely die?</p>
","<p><strong>Don't eat it as-is. It contains cyanide.</strong></p>

<p>Bitter almonds are the definitely poisonous thing you've probably heard of; they contain enough cyanide that just a few could kill a small child (according to On Food and Cooking). The poison is released when the kernels are broken, as defensive mechanism. The variety we eat is a ""sweet"" safe version which doesn't have cyanide. Other stone fruit kernels are essentially like bitter almonds; the plants are closely related.</p>

<p>Fortunately it's pretty hard to accidentally eat bigger kernels (apricots, peaches, and nectarines) that could carry enough to really be harmful. Smaller things like cherries of course don't contain as much, so it's no big deal if you accidentally swallow some, but you still shouldn't go out of your way to eat them.</p>

<p>The key almond flavor you're familiar with from almond extract is benzaldehyde, a byproduct of the cyanide production - unfortunately the poison and the delicious flavor come together. (The plants actually produce amygdalin, which is then broken down into sugar, benzaldehyde, and hydrogen cyanide.) The extraction of the benzaldehyde is a chemical process that you can't really do at home, so you can't just make almond extract/oil directly from them.</p>

<p>The best general reading article about bitter almonds I found was <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2002/feb/20/food/fo-almond20"">The Case of the Tasty But Poisonous Nut</a>, from the LA Times in 2002. A few notable parts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lethal dose of raw bitter almonds depends on the size of the nuts, their concentration of amygdalin and the consumer's sensitivity. But scientists estimate that a 150-pound adult might die from eating between 10 and 70 raw nuts, and a child from ingesting just a few.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Schrade, who studied organic chemistry at Yale, learned that because hydrocyanic acid vanishes into the air when heated, cooking destroys the poison in bitter almonds and allows them to lend their flavor to a wide range of dishes, both traditional and modern.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The FDA clarified the agency's position recently, saying that it would allow bitter almonds to be shipped interstate to professional chefs and bakers, as long as their dishes were cooked to be nontoxic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In any case, although it may be safe for most adults to nibble a raw bitter almond to experience its intense flavor, that would be unpleasant to most people. The nuts are not meant to be eaten as a snack food like regular almonds: They're used as a spice, like nutmeg or cinnamon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in summary: it sounds like fully roasting the kernel would make it safe, but since it should be something like a bitter almond, you probably don't want to just eat it like that, but rather incorporate it into something. And of course, I'm still unsure of the exact definition of ""fully roasting"" for complete safety. Dharini's comment below links to a suggestion that you need 10-15 minutes at 350°F, or possibly less if you've already removed the kernel from the pit, but other (also unreputable) sources I found recommended as much as 20 minutes in a ""warm oven"" for bitter almonds. Finally, the recipes at the end of the LA Times article are presumably safe, if you want to use them as starting points. (Obviously the risk is lower if you're just trying to eat a single kernel, but I don't want to make any unfounded recommendations.)</p>

After removing the solids, and separating the fat, we placed it in the fridge to be frozen the next day.  When we pulled it out, the entire bowl - not just the top - was completely gelatinous.  It is truly like Jello.  </p>

<p>Is this OK?  Why did this happen? </p>

<p>We plan to vacuum seal and freeze it if safe.</p>
","<p>If your stock turns to jelly in the fridge, it means you did it right!</p>

<p>Simmering the bones breaks down the collagen and turns it into gelatin; that's the very essence of stock-making.  The gelatin is exactly what you want from the stock; at low temperatures it has a very jelly-like consistency, but at higher temperatures it melts and provides a very rich texture.</p>

<p>The more you reduce the stock, the more gelatinous it will become, so if it turned out stiffer than you expected, it's probably because you let a lot of water evaporate.  Typically, when making stock, you use a very low simmer; just a few bubbles per minute.  Any more than that and your stock will reduce.</p>

<p>But reducing is perfectly OK, and many cooks will reduce an entire pot of stock down to a few <em>tablespoons</em>; it's like bullion, only without all the salt and preservatives.  Heavily-reduced stock is called <em>glace de viande</em> and is often used to give a sauce or dish a little bit of extra kick, imparting a powerful meat flavour.  But you probably didn't reduce it that much.</p>

<p>If you're finding it to be too concentrated or gelatinous, even at higher temperatures, you can feel free to dilute it.  For soups or sauces you can probably dilute it 1 for 1, but taste as you go along just to make sure you're not watering it down too much.</p>

<p>When only the top layer of a stock solidifies in the refrigerator, it is probably fat, which you should skim off and discard (or reserve).  The rest is your actual stock, and in your case it sounds delicious.</p>

<p>You have probably seen it more clearly in starch-thickened puddings: they thicken a bit on stovetop, but are only ready to unmold after a few hours, else they wuoldn't keep their shape. In a bread, the starch granules are the same way: right after baking, they contain too much moisture. </p>

<p>Sure, if you eat the bread right away, the aroma is very good. But the texture is problematic. It gets doughy and dense at the smallest amount of pressure. Tearing instead of cutting helps a bit. And if you are at home, eating with your family, go for it and eat the tasty still-hot bread. It is especially good with soft, low-gluten breads made with AP flour with the least amount of bran (50% milling grade or even less), my grandma would say that they ""melt in the mouth"" when they are hot. But if you serve bread slices to guests, or want to spread something on the bread, wait for its starch to set. </p>

<p>On a side note, the second stage of starch retrogradation is the reason why you should use day-old bread for crumbs for thickening, and the third stage is the one which makes bread inedible. But this goes too far away from the original question. </p>

"Any way to soften gummy candy?","44429","","<p>Sometimes when I buy (cheap) gummy candy, it's a little too hard to enjoy. Is there a way to soften them? Preferably something that lasts, as opposed to perhaps heating them and eating them while they're warm.</p>
","<p>Gummy candy is essentially just water, sugar, gelatin, and a few other additives like food colouring.</p>

<p>Gelatin's gel strength<sup><a href=""http://www.gelatin.co.za/gltn1.html"">1</a></sup> is partially dependent on its concentration.  The more concentrated, the harder it gets.  Gummy candies left sitting around will lose water due to evaporation, which makes the gelatin more concentrated and thus harder, and if you watch carefully you'll notice that the moisture loss also makes the gummies shrink.</p>

<p>To soften them, you need to rehydrate them.  Toss them in a bowl of hot or warm water (don't use cold water - gelatin is only soluble in warmer water) until they reach the desired consistency - usually around 20 minutes or so.  The longer you leave them in the water, the more water they'll absorb, the more they'll grow and the softer they'll get.</p>

"Why can soda be used as a substitute for eggs when using a boxed cake mix?","44359","","<p>When making a cake from a box mix, I see that soda can be used instead of eggs and oil. What is the science behind this, and what are the properties of oil and eggs that the soda is replacing? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reduce the fat in a cake by using soda to replace the oil and eggs, as

","<p>There are lots of people who have a rather simplistic approach to nutrition and think that removing fat and calories makes you healthy. Then they go through recipes for things they want to eat, replace the sources of fat with something which doesn't have fat and doesn't make the result outright inedible, and declare their recipe a success. I think this is what happened here. </p>

<p>In a cake, eggs provide leavening, moisture, smoothness, own flavor, and enhancement of other flavors. Oil provides smoothness and enhancement of other flavors (and possibly its own flavor, if not netural). And while it is not water based, it keeps the moisture in the cake from evaporating, so it makes the cake less dry. </p>

<p>If you are a ""simplistic nutritionist"" without all this information, you can approximate some of the effects with soda. It will provide moisture, and it will also provide some leavening because it is fizzy. It will provide some flavor of its own too, but frankly, I find the rather chemical flavor of soda to be unpleasant. And it won't have any fat. In the eyes of the simplistic nutritionist, it has successfully replaced the oil and eggs while reducing fat and calories. </p>

<p>From the point of view of a baker, the cake will be a disaster, and won't even deserve the label cake. It will dry out quickly because it has no fat. It will have a bland flavor. Its texture will be terrible. They say ""more chewy?"" It will miss both the protein structure and the emulsifying agents provided by the eggs. It will be essentially an overwhelmingly sweet quickbread with no redeeming qualities. From a culinary point of view, it will be terrible. </p>

<p>From the point of view of somebody who understands nutrition, it can't be declared a success either. The matter is just too complex to be covered by blanket statements like ""All fat is always bad for you"". So while fat reduction may be advisable for some people, it is not clear whether eating such a product (which is still laden with questionable ingredients) is more or less healthy than eating normal cake, even if you don't include behavioral issues (eating more of a fatless cake because it is considered not dangerous). Neither me, nor the person eating the cake, nor even a nutrition specialist has a way to tell for sure whether the person's diet was made better or worse by the substitution. So, it is not like you are sacrificing taste for healthiness. </p>

<p>Bottom line: under some assumptions, it is a good substitution. For me, these assumptions are so far from reality as to be useless. It is a terrible substitution. </p>

<p>Is there any good reason (Hershey trying to protect themselves from lawsuits doesn't count) why chocolate syrup needs to be refrigerated after opening?</p>
","<p>It is likely that prior to use there is minimal likelihood of the ingredients separating as the transport and shelf storage of the item is likely considered controlled.

","<p>I did this in my restaurant for years, it really does work great. Make your rice in a huge batch, cook it as if you're planning to eat it then, but then let it cool until handlable. Once it is cool enough, bag it in individual servings and <em>freeze it</em>. Refrigerating cooked rice quickly ruins it, freezing it, however, works great. If your servings are fairly small, snack sized ziplocks work great for this, otherwise use sandwich sized. Make sure you press the air of the bags, I take all of the small bags and seal them together in gallon sized ziplocks to give them one more layer of protection in the freezer. Either with the rice solidly frozen, or at lunchtime (defrosted, cool rice), throw the baggie in the microwave. You don't even have to open the baggie, when it pops open that's a sign to check it. It may need a bit of a mix and a few more seconds in the microwave, or it may be done, it just needs to be heated through. The hot rice will be almost indistinguishable from freshly cooked. If you don't have a microwave, you can drop the sealed baggie into simmering water, or take the frozen or cool rice out of the bag and steam it to heat.</p>

","<p>Normally, people associate slime with ""inedible"" because some bacterial colonies can build up slime on spoiled food.

But if you mash a ""dry"" scallion or the greens of a typical yellow onion, they still feel slimy, while other alliums become slimy on cooking, for example leeks. </p>

<p>Physically, slime is just a special kind of gel. As long as it is not of bacterial origin, it is not a sign of spoilage, and it is highly improbable that a living green plant without signs of sickness will be full of colonies of spoilage bacteria. So, I would declare it good to eat. </p>

"How do you cook a steak like those found in fine steakhouses?","43509","","<p>I went to a 5* restaurant once, the steak was unbelievable.  You could cut it with a butter knife, it was fat and juicy, pink in the middle, great stuff.</p>

<p>When I cook it at home, I seem to just slice the beef thick, shallow fry it in olive oil with some garlic and  that is all.  It tastes pretty good, but is so far off what I had in that restaurant.</p>

<p>Anyone know how to cook the best steak?  Better cuts of meat?  Fry in butter?</p>

<p>Also any tips in general on how to cook good steak.  All appreciated!</p>
","<p>The most important thing you can do is buy quality beef. You can throw a USDA Select steak on a 700 degree charcoal grill, cook it perfectly, and it'll still be tough and not at all what you'd get at a fine steakhouse.</p>

<p>In the USA there are three grades of beef available to a consumer: Select, Choice, and Prime. There are lesser grades but they go to fast food joints, prisons, military personnel, and miscellaneous other weird uses.</p>

<p>In most american supermarkets you will find only select, period. This is an ""average"" steak. It's typically devoid of marbling, and results in a rather flavorless tough steak. </p>

<p>To find choice steaks you have to go to a higher end supermarket, e.g. Whole Foods You will pay significantly more for a choice steak, but the difference is marked. The marbling will result in a tenderer steak due to the internal fat melting and tenderizing the steak.</p>

<p>Finally, prime cuts. These are <em>very</em> hard to come by in any supermarket unless you live in a bigger city. You typically have to go to a specialty shop or butcher for these. Less than 2% of all beef is classified as prime. On top of this, restaurants get first pick. So even if you do buy a great prime steak, you are likely getting the lower end of the prime spectrum. However, the difference is amazing. The marbling is more intense, more evenly distributed and when cooked properly results in a steak that melts under your knife.</p>

<p>Another one-up a fine steakhouse has on you is they age their beef. Any steak you buy in the grocery store is minimally wet aged. The finest steakhouses dry age their beef. The difference? Wet aging consists of simply vacuum packing the meat (as in a whole side of cow) and refrigerating it for about a week. After that, it's cut smaller and sold to stores. Dry aging is a more complicated and expensive process. Dry aged beef is hung for at least two weeks in a refrigerator. Moisture in the meat is allowed to escape and evaporate, which concentrates the beef flavor of the beef. The beef also grows a moldy rind which is cut off and thrown away. After the aging is complete you're left with 75-80% of the meat you started with. This commands a premium price.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you can't dry age a steak in your home. There are some refrigerator aging processes that you'll find on this site and others, but they aren't a true comparison.</p>

<p>Another variation that has become more popular is grass-fed beef. This has become a recent fad, at least in the USA. Cattle are traditionally fed corn which makes them fatter and ""juicier"", but it also leaves the meat tasting very bland. Likely, if you live in the USA, every steak you've ever had was corn-fed. Grass-fed beef on the other hand is fed <em>predominantly</em> grass, they're allowed to graze as cows should. This is good for the cows, because they don't actually eat corn. A cow is made to eat grass. Corn is rather harsh on their digestive system, but they are given no other choice. In the wild a cow would never eat corn. The end result is a very different flavored steak. Grass-fed beef has a much richer, meatier flavor. However, it's also tougher than corn-fed beef. For this reason a steak you will be served in a fine steakhouse is likely <em>not</em> to be grass-fed unless it is specifically designated as such.</p>

<p>With all that out of the way I suggest doing what I do. When I feel like an amazing home cooked steak, I'll splurge on a nice choice ribeye, dip it in a mixture of melted clarified butter and oil, season <em>liberally</em> with salt and pepper, and pan fry it. </p>

"Ceramic vs Stainless Steel in coffee mugs","43509","","<p>My travel mug broke :(  Looking at replacements, I find that most travel mugs with designs tend to be stainless steel, whereas my prior mug was ceramic. Is there a difference in heat retention between the two materials in this day and age? Are there other considerations I should take into account when choosing between materials?</p>

<p>(Note: I put tea in it)</p>
","<p><strong>Stainless Steel</strong></p>

<p>Most stainless steel travel mugs are double walled, but are NOT vacuum flasks</p>

<p>They usually have a screw on stainless steel base, or just a plain plastic base. Both of these stop thermal air losses, but are in no way as efficient as a true vacuum flask. It can't be anyway, due to the lid having a drinking hole in it</p>

<p>Lids with sliding covers are impossible to clean, and should be avoided. Just a simple double wall stainless steel mug, with a ""reduced spill"" style plastic lid and silicone gasket will last many years, be cleanable, and provide reasonable heat retention</p>

<p><strong>Double Walled Ceramic</strong></p>

<p>Double walled ceramic mugs are heavy, and while reasonable strong, generally have two fundamental flaws:</p>

<ul>
<li>They are very heavy due to having two ceramic layers, even though both layers are quite thin</li>
<li>Because the layers are thin, most mugs do not have a handle, as they cannot support one without breaking</li>
</ul>

<p>Their insulation qualities are fine and they can be-reheated in situ. The typical silicone lids they ship with are easy to wash which is a bonus</p>

<p>If you don't mind not having a handle they are fine, but heavy</p>

<p>I don't like drinking from silicone, it feels weird, and the hole is usually too small. Cutting a bigger hole always ends in disaster (maybe a hole punch would do it?). They also break much more easily than a normal ceramic mug if used while travelling</p>

<p>How do I properly adjust the cooking time so that my microwave will properly cook the product?  Is it simple math (such as <code>4*{1100/800}=5.5</code>, or 5 minutes, 30 seconds), or are there more factors involved?</p>

<p>For the purposes of my application, presume altitude is at or near sea level.</p>
","<p>1100 Watt means 1100 Joules per second (energy over time). 1100 Watt over a period of 240 seconds therefore is 264000 Joules. To deliver 264000 Joules of energy with only 800 Watt takes 330 seconds (5.5 minutes), as you expected.</p>

<p>As KatieK noticed, there are some additional concerns. A good recipe will tell you to let the cooked product stand for a while. This allows heat diffusion, so all those Joules of heat will be distributed well. But if you cook at lower power, then the heat will already be diffused more. I.e. at lower power, you don't need to rest the product as long.</p>

<p>Another difference might be that you're not just heating the product, but you're relying on a secondary effect such as killing germs. For that, you'll need to have the entire product above a critical temperature for a certain time. This in general means that you don't need to adjust the times as much as you'd expect by the simple formula.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a warm product will lose heat to the environment over time. I.e. not all of those 264000 Joules will stay in the product you're heating. And with more time spent at medium temperatures, there's more heat loss in a low-powered microwave. </p>

<li>You'll need some sort of flavorful liquid (or a combination of them).  Chicken stock or beef stock would work.  I'd normally also recommend using something acidic like red wine or tomatoes, however, using this method (which is based on tinfoil), acids can react with the aluminum to produce off flavors.  If you want to cook with wine or tomatoes, you can transfer the meat to your casserole after you brown it. (More on this below.) </li>
<li>You'll also need some type of mild tasting oil.  Vegetable, corn, canola/rapeseed, peanut, light olive oil, will all work.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it in terms of software.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Paper towels.</li>
<li>Tinfoil (preferably the big, wide kind, and heavy duty).</li>
<li>An oven.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it.</p>

<p><strong>Algorithm:</strong></p>

<p>This is basically the same technique that <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/6279/cos-callis"">Cos Callis</a> proposed, just using different tools.</p>

<p>Adjust your oven's rack to about 6 inches from the broiler.  Turn on your oven's broiler on its highest setting.</p>

<p>Lay out two layers of tinfoil on your counter.  Make sure the tinfoil is big enough such that if you were to place the roast in the middle of it there would be a border of tinfoil around the roast that is at least as wide as the roast itself.</p>

<p><em>Optional:</em> Put the tinfoil on a large sheetpan or cookie sheet.  This will help you in transporting the device to/from the oven, and it will also ensure against spillage in your oven.  If you do things right you won't have to wash the sheet.</p>

<p>Pat the meat as dry as you can get it and put it in the center of the tinfoil.</p>

<p>Pour a bit of oil on top of the roast and rub it all over.  You only need enough to barely coat the entire roast.</p>

<p>Generously salt both sides of the roast.  I prefer using kosher salt, because it is less saline by volume, so you can more evenly distribute it without over-salting.  You'll probably use a good tablespoon or so.</p>

<p>Put the roast under the broiler.  Wait about 5 minutes, but that number isn't exact.  Use your eyes.  Just wait until it looks good and brown and crusty and delicious.  Just don't blacken the entire thing.</p>

<p>When the top side is browned, flip it over to the other side.  The best tool for the job here is a pair of tongs, but a fork will do.</p>

<p>Brown the second side.</p>

<p>Remove the roast (which is hopefully on top of some type of pan for your convenience).</p>

<p>Turn off your broiler and reset your oven to 275 degrees F.</p>

<p>Fold up the sides of the tinfoil around the roast to make a sort of pan around it.  Try to leave as little room around the roast as possible.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you want to use acidic ingredients, you can transfer the roast to the casserole at this point.  The reason why you couldn't use your casserole from scratch is that it is probably not broiler-safe.</p>

<p>Pour in enough of the beef/chicken stock to just barely cover the roast.  It shouldn't require very much liquid.</p>

<p>Once the liquid is in, fold the tinfoil on itself to seal the top, such that you end up with a tinfoil package containing the browned meat and the stock.  Try and make it airtight.</p>

<p>Stick that in the 275 F oven.</p>

<p>Just let it sit in there for ~3 hours.  You don't need to touch it.</p>

<p>After ~3 hours, take it out.  Hopefully the tinfoil didn't leak.</p>

<p>If you did this correctly, all the cleanup you need to do is crumple
up the foil and throw it out.</p>

<p>You can also experiment with adding other vegetables (<em>e.g.</em>, thinly sliced onions or whole garlic cloves).  You can even add them from the very beginning.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in a comment on <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/6279/cos-callis"">Cos Callis's</a> answer, bottom round roasts have a lot of tough connective tissue which needs to be cooked low and slow (&lt;300F) in the oven in order to become soft and tender. However, if you were to cook the beef the entire way at that temperature the meat would end up being gray and tasteless. The reason is that the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maillard reactions</a> (which are what turn the meat golden brown and make it taste more meaty and delicious) don't really occur below ~300F, which is the purpose of the initial sear.</p>

"Stew in the oven or on the stove, does it make a difference?","43126","","<p>What is the advantage (if any) of finalizing a stew or other slow-cooked meals in the oven instead of on a hob?</p>

<p>A lot of recipes tells you to set the pot in the oven to cook for <em>x</em> hours after the initial frying has been done on the stove. Why is that, couldn't you just as easily cook it at a low temperature on a hob for the same period of time? </p>

<p>The only advantage I can see is that the dish maybe doesn't burn as easily when cooked in the oven.</p>
","<p>In the oven, that heat is coming from all directions more or less equally. On the stovetop, the heat is coming only from the bottom. This can potentially cause convection, and almost certainly requires occasional stirring (especially for larger batches), meaning that the ingredients are being moved around. The combination of the ingredients being heated more when they're at the bottom and the movement can cause them to start breaking apart, and generally cook unevenly.</p>

<p>Personally, I only find this to be an issue with beans and meat (and it's not something that's going to cause failure; it's really just a refinement) but if you are making an especially large batch of stew, you may want to try the oven.</p>

<p>I expect it's mostly guesswork (and borderline 'cooking'), but do you have any tips or tricks for getting this right (or nearly so) first time?</p>
","<p>It's actually pretty straight forward and fairly easy to do.</p>

<ol>
<li>Build a fire. You are building a cooking fire, not a warm hands and look pretty fire. I use a <a href=""http://www.wellpreserved.ca/campfire-cooking-how-to-vuild-a-cooking-fire/"" rel=""nofollow"">log cabin style fire for this</a>.</li>
<li>Wait for it to burn down so there are plenty of white coals. You don't want lots of ""fire"". Fire is pretty to look at, but more unpredictable to cook in then hot white coals.</li>
<li>While the fire is burning down, wash and prep your potatoes to bake as you would normally.</li>
<li>Wrap them tightly in tin foil.</li>
<li>Once the fire is burned down to hot, white coals, toss the potatoes directly onto the coals.</li>
<li>Wait until cooked (roughly 40 minutes for an average sized potato, on an average fire, adjust accordingly).</li>
<li>If you have a shovel or something, put some coals on to the actual potato as well, so you're completely surrounding it. It'll speed it up. If you don't have anything handy to handle coals, make sure you flip them half way.</li>
<li>Remove carefully and enjoy.</li>
</ol>

<p>The moisture of a potato, will allow it to cook without burning. Just make sure you wrap them with no exposed areas, in order to trap the steam.</p>

<li>As Ocaasi suggests, you can cover the open lid with a kitchen towel as you start to insure there's no spray. </li>
<li>Start the blender slow and then speed it up. This may not work depending on how fast your slowest setting is. But once the vortex gets going, the liquid won't splash. It's only when the blades start that you have that issue. Slower start speed means less splash (a vita-mix can start very slowly and have no splash at all, great for hot liquids but the price tag is a bit high). </li>

"Is mixing coffee with milk directly unhealthy?","42839","","<p>Scientifically speaking, is there a reason not to mix coffee with milk directly? </p>

<p>I remember reading once, that milk is like the anti-dode to coffee and there is a bio-chemical reason why this makes an unhealthy mixture.</p>

<p>Reference would be appreciated.</p>
","<p>Not really, but there haven't been that many studies in to the issue. An abstract of the most significant one can be found <a href=""http://jn.nutrition.org/content/140/2/259.abstract"">here</a>.</p>

<p>To summarise, the study tested people who had drunk black coffee, coffee with milk, and coffee with non-dairy creamer to see how much of the phenolic acid (one constituent of coffee that is supposed to have health benefits) entered the bloodstream in each case.</p>

<p>The study found that adding milk had no effect, but adding creamer affected the maximum concentration of the phenols in blood plasma, and the time it took to achieve that concentration.</p>

<p>This kind of toing and froing over the health of certain foods is rife today. One minute coffee is bad for you, the next it's good for you, and so on. For example, the study above assumes that the phenolic acids involved, being antioxidants, are good for you because they reduce free radicals in the body. </p>

<p>Free radicals in too high a concentration can indeed be harmful. However, they are also an essential part of the immune system - when a harmful bacteria is found in the body, phagocyte cells will surround it and destroy it with free radicals, for example. Things like this mean that there is rarely a simple answer to questions of food health.</p>

<p>Likewise, it has been suggested that people with a certain set of genes may be adversely affected by drinking too much caffeine, which may cause bone loss, <em>unless</em> they also have a source of calcium, like milk, in their diet as well, which would rather suggest that milk is definitely a good thing to have with your coffee!</p>

","<p>In the world of high-end chocolate, Valrhona isn't even the most expensive - in fact, it's practically entry level.  Amedei Signature retails at a whopping $40/lb in ""bulk"" (1 kg) quantities.</p>

<p>I don't think I've ever seen Valhrona in bulk quantities and/or at a significantly discounted price.  On the other hand, there are similar-quality brands that are way more affordably-priced.  On <a href=""http://www.chocosphere.com"">chocosphere</a> you can buy 22 lbs of Callebaut callets for just over $6 per pound.  Or you can get one of Felchlin's Grand Cru chocolates for about $10 per pound.  You can even buy Guittard there for what appears to be $6.60/lb.  But you'll notice that they even though they also carry Valrhona, they don't have it in bulk.</p>

<p>I also see <a href=""http://www.candywarehouse.com/guittardapeels.html"">Candy Warehouse</a> selling the Guittard wafers for, apparently, $3.10/lb if you buy the 25 lb bag.  <a href=""http://www.chocolateman.com"">Chocolate Man</a> sells the Felchlin Maracaibo chocolate (not Grand Cru) for a measly $7.80/lb.  They've got a variety of other well-known brands as well, although their selection is limited, they don't have a lot of the crazy high-end stuff.</p>

<p>Chocovic chocolate also sells at around the $10 range at most stores.  If you can find it, they distribute 10 kg and 25 kg bags (that's 22 lbs and <strong>55 lbs</strong>).  I'm not sure where, but if you go to their official site they explicitly mention that they make that size.</p>

<p>You should consider that the exorbitant prices may not be a result of where you're buying from, but of what you're buying.  Valrhona is just expensive.  You may say that is because it's better than all the others, and you may be right (although some would disagree - it's more than a little subjective) - but that is the price you pay for ""premium"" products.  They can get away with charging $13-$15/lb, so they do.</p>

"Tips for reheating food in the microwave","42301","","<p>I often want to buy more than a meals-worth of fast-food (or other food you buy hot) to save multiple trips, but the reduction in taste that comes from reheating it makes me not want to.</p>

<p>What can I do to reheat food in the microwave and have it taste more like it did originally?</p>
","<p>The best advice I can give is that you're not going to want to use full power very often.  I find that food tastes much better if you cook it for longer at 60 or 70% power then if you blast it quickly at 100%.  This is especially true for proteins like chicken.  I guess this allows for slightly slower, more even heating without destroying <em>all</em> the water in the food.  The extra minute or two of time is worth the huge difference in the final texture.</p>

<p>I find that pretty much any vegetable or rice-based dish will reheat ""ok"" in the microwave, because of the nature of the microwave itself, which works very well for steaming.  When reheating stuff like this, throw a tsp or Tbsp of water in the container, and place a lid on it (but do not seal the lid, you want it vented slightly).  Again, stick with less than full-power.</p>

<p>I know someone who swears by boiling a glass of water in the microwave first to fill it with moist, warm air.  Supposedly it helps with evenness and faster cooking, and reduces drying out the food; I don't know if I buy it but thought I'd mention it so you and the community can comment/decide.  I understand the idea, but feel like you'd lose so much of that just opening the door to swap the water for your food.  If you do go this route, it's very important that you understand <a href=""http://www.snopes.com/science/microwave.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">superheating water</a>, which is dangerous.  Don't try to boil water in the microwave without reading that link.</p>

<p>If you're adventurous, there's a line of <a href=""http://www.microwavecookingforone.com/Equipment.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Corningware Microwave Browning</a> products (scroll about halfway down the page where it mentions browning) - I was given one a half a year ago and was surprised at how well it works.  There's a lining of microwave-safe metal (I believe tin oxide) inside the bottom of the casserole/skillet, and you heat the casserole by itself for a minute or two first which gets that blazing hot.  When you drop food on it, it actually sizzles, so now you're using a combination of normal microwave cooking and direct, skillet-like heat.  I've had a lot of good luck reheating things like pork chops and keeping/adding a crust to them.</p>

<p>Also, there's a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1565546660"" rel=""nofollow"">book</a>, <em>Microwave Cooking For One</em>, and an accompanying <a href=""http://www.microwavecookingforone.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a>, that are both supposed to be really useful.  I don't own the book but have heard from friends who do own it that you can learn a lot about general microwave use from it - even if you don't plan on cooking from ""scratch"" and are just reheating leftovers.  </p>

<p>All that said, I completely agree with Jefromi's comment.  90% of the food I reheat is reheated in the <strong>toaster oven</strong>, either preheated like a regular oven, or under the broiler depending on what the food is.  You might take an extra 5 or even 15 minutes to reheat this way, but the difference is unbelievable, and the convenience is still the same - I just put whatever I want to reheat into a casserole dish and throw it in, sometimes covered, sometimes not.  So, cleanup still only involves one dish, and you can eat directly out of it (though it will be very hot, so be careful!) Once you get into the habit of using the toaster oven, you'll find a way to make up for the small amount of extra time - for example I often I empty the drainboard while it preheats, and wash dishes or something similar while the food heats up.</p>

"Rinse the salt off a steak before cooking?","42183","","<p>I've been trying to perfect my technique for cooking a steak indoors.</p>

<p>It was recommended to salt the steak about 30 minutes before cooking. I used kosher salt, and cooked the steak on cast iron. Everything came out spectacularly, in fact it was the best steak I've ever made myself. However, the outer layer of the steak was significantly saltier than I think is normal. It didn't ruin the steak, but it was more than I would have liked. I would simply assume that I over-salted, but given the language people use when they recommend the technique, and the amount I actually applied, I am unsure. I fear that if I use less salt next time I will lose the perfect sear/crust and the incredible flavor of the interior meat that I achieved.</p>

<p>So, given the similarity to brining poultry (in which case the meat is rinsed before cooking), I wonder if the salt should be rinsed off before cooking? I didn't get this impression from any of the recommendations, but now I am not so sure.</p>
","<p>Definitely don't rinse the salt off. One of the nice things the salt does is pull juices to the surface of the meat--not enough to dry things out, but enough so that when the steak hits the hot pan you have a nice protein-laden coating (it's called a pellicle when talking about smoked fish--not sure about steaks) on the outside to caramelize. If you rinse it, you're rinsing that right off.</p>

<p>If your steak was too salty, then just salt more lightly. You don't need a ton, as what you get on there will melt some and mix with the juices and spread out. I think I probably use 1/4 tsp or less per side, and some of that bounces off/misses. And you won't lose the crust with less salt--you won't even lose it with NO salt. It's just easier to get if you use the salt to pull some juices to the surface.</p>

<p>If you have trouble getting good salt distribution, use your fingers and sprinkle it from a little farther up--like 8 inches from the steak. That'll make it easier to get an even sprinkle without dousing it. </p>

","<h2>Eggs in their shell, uncracked</h2>

<p>One day on the counter at room temperature is approximately equivalent to a week in the refrigerator.  When I used eggs at a rapid rate, baking every day, I always kept them on the counter, since they would not have to be brought to room temperature to beat easily to the ribbon or whatever.</p>

","<p>As a general principle, any ingredients which do not require refrigeration on their own will not require refrigeration when mixed. A notable exception is raw garlic in olive oil; raw garlic carries botulinum spores, which propagate in anaerobic environments. Cold <em>helps</em> to prevent the spores from multiplying and producing toxin, but doesn't prevent it entirely. In addition, you will find texture effects; olive oil is fairly unique among unprocessed (as in, unhydrogenated) vegetable fats in that it solidifies at refrigeration temperatures.</p>

"What is the purpose of oil or butter in bread?","41837","","<p>Specifically in wheat and potato breads, what is the purpose of adding oil or butter to the dough? </p>

<p>I have always assumed it was just for flavor, but I suspect there is some background chemical reasons for adding it.</p>
","<p>Breads get their structure from glutens--a type of protein formed by the combination of glutenin with gliaten.  Kneading and resting the dough helps the formation of glutens--I assume by shifting glutenin and gliatin molecules around, this increases the odds of bindings occurring.</p>

<p>Oils can bind to glutenin and gliatin and inhibit these reactions, so fats--oils and butter--definitely play a role in the texture control.</p>

<p>It prevents the dough from getting too elastic, which controls texture.  This elasticity change would also change the maximum air bubble size.  Altering resting times and yeast quantity also change these, but trading off for a different flavor.  Oil may play other roles, but these are what I recall reading about off the top of my head.  Yes, it does contribute to flavor as well.</p>

"Is it possible to have a good crust without prebaking a quiche?","41759","","<p>I'm planning on making a quiche (Lorraine with leek to be exact) and I was looking up recipes for quiches. Most recipes call for blind-baking the crust in advance (or at least partly), but some skip this step and pour the filling in the raw dough and bake it like that.</p>

<p>I think blind-baking would prevent the dough from getting soggy since the filling is quite liquid. The other recipes look nice (judging on the picture), but won't the dough be soggy?
Or should you put the temperature lower and the time higher so the liquid can evaporate?</p>

<p>Does it matter whether you blind-bake your crust for a quiche? Or does it mainly depend on the type of dough (puff, shortcrust...)? Or on the amount of liquid or type of veggie/meat (precooked)? Any other factors that I don't think of?</p>
","<p>In the normal cooking time of a quiche (20 to 30 minutes), the crust doesn't really get soggy from the filling, even if it is quite liquid, as is expected for quiche Lorraine. So, you can without problem cook your quiche without first blind-baking the crust. The difference will be in the crispness of the crust: if you try to get it crispy, you should prebake, if you don't mind it being rather, well, “plain”, you don't.</p>

<p>The only real reason for me to blind-bake a crust is when you put something on it that won't be cooked (tartelettes), that will only get grilled or that will be baked less that it would require to bake the crust (meringue tart). Most of these examples are fruit tarts, however.</p>

"Are limes and lime juice more acidic than lemons and lemon juice?","41588","","<p>I attended a business meeting in the Midwest and one of our clients took our management team and a few other business partners to dinner at an awesome Mexican restaurant. When the appetizers were served I commented that it was a wonderful presentation and that everything looked very fresh, including the avocado slices. </p>

<p>Speaking to the woman seated across from me I said that even though I use a good amount of lemon juice, whenever I prepare avocados they still turned dark pretty quickly. This happens whether they are sliced, used in guacamole, etc. She responded that the secret is to use lime juice. She proceeded to tell me that she was born and raised in Central America and that it is customary there to use fresh limes or juice rather than lemon.</p>

<p>I have tried it and lime seems to work much better than lemon, so it would stand to reason that they are more acidic. However, I never thought there was that much difference. So, on to the questions.</p>

<p>Are limes more acidic than lemons? Are there any other differences in their properties that could make a difference?</p>
","<p>I'm culling a lot of information from one of my <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=OOsX44gYoo8C&amp;dq=craft%20cocktails%20at%20home&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">favorite cocktail books</a> for this one.</p>

<p>Yes, limes have a slightly higher acid content (on average) than lemons do - about 6% for limes, compared to 4.5% for lemons.  More importantly for their flavor, lemons have about 2% total sugar, while limes have somewhere between 0.5% and 0.75%.  Sugar/sweetness has quite a suppressive effect on the perception of sourness, so lemon juice will most likely taste a bit less sour than lime.</p>

<p>The composition of acids in the two also differ.  The acid in lemon juice is almost entirely <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">citric acid</a>, which also makes up most of the acid in limes.  However, limes include about 10% each of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinic_acid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">succinic acid</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malic_acid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">malic acid</a> which have an effect on their flavor.  Malic acid is most recognizable as the sour flavor from tart apples and rhubarb.  About succinic acid, Wikipedia states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It lends to fermented beverages such as wine and beer a common taste that is a combination of saltiness, bitterness and acidity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I think the difference is perceptible in beverages, but less so in cooking.</p>

<p>Culturally, lime would most certainly be the traditional choice for Latin American cuisine.  Lime is much more readily available in Central and South America (three of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lime_(fruit)#Production_trends"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">biggest producers in the world</a> are located there).  How the difference in acid content would contribute to the browning of avocados is more questionable.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Here's <a href=""http://www.avocadosource.com/Journals/FSHSP/FSHSP_VOL_81_PG_230-235_1968.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an interesting paper</a>, suggesting that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascorbic_acid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ascorbic acid</a> (vitamin C) is more effective at preventing avocado browning than citric acid.

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> And along comes Jolenealaska, with <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/46495/25059"">an experiment</a> that seems to undermine the entire assumption that acid reduces browning of avocado at all!

Off the top of my head, I can think of a number of factors such as the type of food, how well you want to cook it, the type of oil, the size of the pan and how much food you are trying to cook. Which of these factors should I worry about the most and does anyone have any general rules for figuring out how much oil to use?</p>
","<p>As you suggest, there are a number of factors, but the best rule of thumb I've found for pan-frying is to use just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan by swirling it around.  In general, you don't want puddles (you'll get splashed with hot oil), but if the pan isn't covered then your food might not get cooked evenly.</p>

<p>These days I mostly just eyeball it, and err on the generous side.  Using slightly too much isn't likely to hurt your dish - unused oil just won't get absorbed - but using too little will result in under-cooked or inconsistently-cooked food and probably a lot of gunk stuck to the bottom of your pan.  So if you're not sure, just add a little more than you think you absolutely need.</p>

"What is the proper amount of time to thaw + brine a turkey simultaneously?","41479","","<p>I recently saw a tip that you can thaw a frozen turkey in your brine, and I'd like to try that this year. I was planning to thaw my turkey for 3 days in a cooler of water.</p>

<p>I've actually never brined before, so I'm a little worried about over-brining and turning my turkey into mush. The bird we got this year is just under 15 pounds, and the package says to thaw for ""3-4 days"".</p>

<p>Everything I've found so far says to brine for 1-2 days. Should I plan to start using brine about half way through the thaw process (maybe even leave the wrapper on for that first half, too?), instead of the whole time, or will the bird being frozen initially prevent the brine from doing its magic early on, thus preventing mush?</p>
","<p>A few things aren't quite right here.</p>

<p>1- a cooler full of water for 3 days.<br>
A turkey will take 3-4 days to thaw in the fridge- between 35-40F. Quicker methods call for submerging in <em>running</em> water for some hours. Submerging the turkey in stagnant water- even if it started as ice water- will allow the turkey to rise well above 40F over the course of 3 days. You would have to add ice or have the turkey somewhere colder than 40F for this to be safe.</p>

<p>2- brining too long turning a turkey to mush.<br>
The salt in a brine denatures some proteins and supercharges the bird with water. These will make the meat more tender and seem more tender respectively. That said- the risk isn't that the meat will get mushy. Unless you are adding some other ingredient to the brine that is actually a proteinase like papain the risk is not mushiness but being too salty.</p>

<p>3- 1-2 days of brining.<br>
I have never seen a recipe that called for brining this long. The brine recipes I have seen are on the order of 4-10 hours. If your brine recipe calls for this length of time then it is probably more dilute than the ones I use. In such a case it would probably be fine to thaw it in the brine if you address the safety concern.</p>

<p>The turkey being frozen will prevent the brine from penetrating but as the bird thaws from the outside in the outside of the bird will have more alone time with the brine than the deeper meat. I can't say whether this would be a problem- especially as Harold McGee says that the salt from brining isn't able to penetrate very far into the meat anyway.</p>

<p>Unless it is cold enough outside (or you have enough fridge space) that you could brine the turkey at &lt;40F for 2 days while it thawed I would recommend at least mostly thawing it before introducing it to your brine.</p>

<p>I know that Romano is aged much less than Parmesan is and that accounts for the difference in cost. However, the flavors of the two are very similar to me.</p>

<p>In what situations would it be important to use only Parmesan instead of substituting cheaper Romano cheese?</p>
","<p>It's a different flavor. Romano is sharper, more grassy; parmesan is nuttier and sweeter. I actually prefer romano where I have a lot of other strong flavors. If there's other sharp flavors in a dish, such as olives, chili pepper, or capers (e.g., puttanesca), I'll go with romano which seems to stand up better to the robust flavors. For something with a more subtle flavor such as a ragu bolognese, butter or cream-based sauces, risotto, etc. I feel that a good parmeggiano reggiano can stand up to the other flavors in the dish without overwhelming them.</p>

<p>If cost is your main concern, I've had some parms from Argentina that are actually pretty good. Reggiano is definitely better, but depending on what you're using it for, it might be an option. I wouldn't use it in something like a risotto or fettuchine alfredo where it plays a key role in the dish, but if you're just grating it on top it will work fine. An in-between option is Grana Padano, which is advertised as a ""budget"" substitute for reggiano. In my experience, it's pretty good, but where I live it's only a little cheaper.</p>

","<p>Very easy. All you want to do is to remove the water through heating. As you are not going to can it, you don't have to sterilize it afterwards. </p>

<p>The only concern when evaporating milk is to not end with a layer of scorched milk solids on the bottom. First, start with homogenized milk (you don't want to risk undissolved fat swimming on top of it). If you want the pure milk flavor, heat it to 70°C and wait until you are left with half the initial volume. This takes several hours, depending on the quantity of the milk. My great-grandma usually did it overnight. </p>

<p>If you don't mind a ""scorched"" taste, you can do it much quicker. Take a very big pot. It should be at least 6-7 times higher than the milk depth, because the boiling milk will foam up a lot. The width is up to you, but the wider the pot, the quicker it will go. Bring the milk to a vigorous boil. Use a setting which is just hot enough to sustain boiling, too much heat will increase the scorching. Stir all the time. You need maybe 10 minutes of stirring, again depending on quantity of the milk and pot width. You are aiming for the same rate of evaporation - you should be left with half the original volume, or somewhat less. </p>

<p>You don't have to add sugar to evaporated milk, the sweet taste is caused by the heating. Especially the boiling-evaporated milk is quite sweet, because you get some caramelization. </p>

","<p>It may already be an implicit assumption, but I think that <strong>time</strong> to cook is probably not as important as <strong>how</strong> to cook.  While the power setting does affect the <strong>time</strong> to cook, the importance of <strong>time</strong> is to control how <strong>hot</strong> the parts of the food get.</p>

<p>As with all cooking, there is a need to control temperature.  Running the microwave at less than full power allows time for the heat to be conducted from the <strong>hot</strong> parts to the <strong>cool</strong> parts.  It is similar to searing vs. sauteeing.</p>

They were larger than what I am used to for sweet potatoes, but looked similar, although they had a purple skin on the outside and white flesh on the inside. I figured since they were  labelled as ""sweet potatoes"", I would prepare them the same way I like to prepare regular sweet potatoes, by boiling them first (for about 40 minutes), then removing the skin, slicing it into wedges and then pan frying them. I have done this many times with normal sweet potatoes, and it works quite well.</p>

","<p>I used to cook plenty of purple sweet potatoes when I was living in africa:) Sounds like you maybe cooked them too long... </p>

<p>They can be extremely tasty, sweet with a ""perfumy"" hint if you are lucky. They are best boiled with the skin on like you did and peeled afterwards (as the taste is preserved better that way). As for cooking time it really depends on the size (which means the potatoes are likely done at different times) but you can always feel when they are done by pressing on the potato with a fork - it should give slightly/be soft. I think it usually took me about 30min but I didn't use a clock. It may shorten the cooking time slightly to make holes in the potatoes with a fork (this also adds to the ""creaminess""). </p>

<p>I guess they do sometimes get a softer, more ""creamy"" consistency than your usual potato when well done. However the taste is richer and in my opinion far superior to orange sweet potato. If you prefer a firmer potato, just let your potatoes stay on the firm side (in my experience, though, the taste is enhanced by letting them go soft). But boiled ones would anyways mainly be for puddings as it gets rather sweet.</p>

","<p>Basically, you can refreeze the raspberries.<br>
When a fruit or veg. is frozen, the water inside the plant cell expands, and bursts the cell wall, which is why there is so much 'juice' when you thaw.  If you refreeze, you can be sure that the raspberries will freeze into a giant block. If you are using them to make a sauce or a jam, this is not significant. That being said, if you are using frozen raspberries in the first place, you are obviously not looking for a perfectly intact raspberry, you are using them for some other purpose. Therefor, refreezing is no big deal. I recently answered another question about freezing and refreezing, and how it is basically a myth that it renders the refrozen product inedible. Any time you freeze you know that you are not going to get 'exactly' the same product when you thaw it, and the same goes with refreezing, there is always a 'slight' degredation of the product with each successive freeze (do you like my liberal usage of quotes?)

I can go 30-50 degrees celsius, the question is what temperature is safe and at what temperature will I actually start baking the dough. Is 50 degrees celsius still ok or not?</p>
","<p>Let me suggest a totally different approach:</p>

<p>Why not work <strong>with</strong> the cool conditions instead of against? </p>

<ul>
<li>You could let the dough proof for a long time, e.g. overnight in the fridge. This allows for a lot less yeast and hence a less <em>yeasty</em> taste, which is usually desired. Also, more complex flavors develop during long proofing times. (There is a reason french baguette may wait for two days before baking.) For a start, aim for about 5% yeast<sup>1</sup> and use cool instead of lukewarm liquid. <br>
You might have to adjust your attitude, because this requires some planning ahead, but gives you more degrees of freedom on the other hand: Fresh bread / cake in the morning without having to get up before dawn and more tolerance with regard to proofing / timing - the dough can handle an extra hour or two in the fridge easily. (Especially nice if you have a baby or a crazy schedule...)</li>
<li>You could also dump the dough in cold water and proof it there. As crazy as it sounds, it works. See more <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/52124/what-are-the-advantages-of-bathed-bread/52138%2352138"">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you'd rather stick with warm conditions, I'd aim for <a href=""https://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/bread/yeast_temp.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">30°C</a> for optimum (=quickest) activity. Yeast starts to die at about 45°C, completely dead at 55°C. Also, warmer dough tends to proof unevenly and have a ""flat"" taste (can't find a better word).</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> fresh yeast, percentage based on flour weight.</p>

<p>Adjust dry yeast accordingly: fresh to dry conversion rate is 1:3, so use 2% dry yeast.</p>

"White chocolate ganache won't set","40781","","<p>The other day I attempted to make a white chocolate ganache, and while the flavor is perfect, it utterly refused to set.

Granted it wasn't horribly runny, but still enough not to be presentable.</p>

<p>I'm used to dark chocolate ganaches which will firm up into something not unlike a fudge, which is perfect for making tarts.</p>

","<p>White chocolate does not have starch, so it does not thicken the ganache, unlike dark chocolate. </p>

"Why do you need eggs when making icecream?","40742","","<p>I was looking for a good recipe to make pistachio almond ice cream, but all of them needed Eggs. </p>

<p>My uncle used to sell home ice cream in Mexico, and I'm 100% that he never used an egg to make pistachio almond ice cream, or any other ice cream.</p>

<p>However, it's not the first time I see eggs listed as an ingredient for homemade ice cream.</p>

<p>Is there any particular reason for that? Why do you need eggs? What other thing can I use instead of eggs? </p>
","<p>There are two main base recipes for ice cream. French style ice cream contains egg yolks, which help make it soft, rich, smooth, creamy, custardy. Philadelphia style ice cream (sometimes called American style) has no eggs, and relies on the fat in the cream to keep it soft, but will still never be as rich and smooth as French style, and will still tend to freeze harder.</p>

<p>You can make pretty much any ice cream in either style, including the pistachio-almond you want to make. You can look around for recipes without eggs; I wouldn't be surprised if you manage to find one one. Or you can simply use a Philadelphia style base, and look at one of the recipes you found to see how to add the pistachio and almond. Depending on how rich you want it, you'll want 2-3 cups of heavy cream for each 1 cup of milk; about 3/4 cup of sugar should work, depending on how sweet you want it. If that's not rich enough for you, you can even replace the milk with cream. (You could also just go find a recipe for Philadelphia style vanilla ice cream and use that as a base - it doesn't get much simpler than that.)</p>

<p>(P.S. You could also try gelato, something like <a href=""http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2007/09/pistachio-gelat/"">this recipe</a> - it uses corn starch as a stabilizer instead.)</p>

<p>Is it okay to refrigerate Cod (and other kinds of fish) once cooked and eat the next day? </p>

<p>If so, can you reheat it before eating? </p>
","<p>Yes, it's fine to refrigerate cooked fish. Many types of fish are excellent (better, even) served cold -- shrimp and salmon are good examples. If you can eat it cold, it's hard to see how reheating would pose any additional risk.</p>

<p>There are some other considerations, though. It's easy to overcook fish, which leaves it dry and less than tender, and that goes double if you're reheating. Use low heat (or low power in a microwave) and be careful not to cook too long. Some sauce will help keep the fish reheat, but avoid storing the fish in a strongly acidic sauce (like lemon juice) as acid will change the fish over time even in the fridge. And avoid reheating fishy things in the microwave at work if you value your relationship with your coworkers -- the smell often lingers.</p>

"Can you use just egg yolks when recipe asks for eggs?","40554","","<p>Having just made a batch of meringues,I am now left with lots of egg yolks, can I use them in recipes that ask for ""eggs"" i.e cakes and tray bakes. Is the white of the egg needed in the baking process ?</p>
","<p>It really does depend on the recipe. Egg yolks have some protein but a lot of fat which adds flavor and makes baked goods more tender and moist.  Whites are just protein which adds structure and has a drying effect.</p>

<p>If the particular recipe is depending on the eggs for the binding power of their protein you may not get enough by substituting just yolks. Remember that the volume of the yolks is less than whole eggs so you may see better success substituting two whole eggs with three yolks. </p>

<p>Some cakes will handle the reduced protein. White and yellow cakes will be ok. Pound cakes will also be fine and in fact some recipes call for only yolks. Expect your cake to be a little denser, softer, and tastier. Any kind of sponge or angel food cake won't work because they rely wholly on the protein from the whites.</p>

<p>Soft, rich breads will also benefit from the added fat. The breads will derive their structure from the gluten in their flour. Cinnamon rolls and rich doughnuts come to mind. A local doughnut shop is famous for the yellow color which comes from using fresh yolks.

<p>Yolks can be used in many recipes that call for whole eggs. Look for recipes that will benefit from all the added fat. Anything custard-like, where the eggs are mixed with milk, will work very well- even better than with whole eggs in fact. Examples are custard, flan, puddings, french toast, etc. Given the season you might consider a custard-based ice cream.</p>

<p>Can I get a better flavor if I let it simmer longer? Can I stick it in the crock pot all day?

<p>Chili needs a good amount of liquid both to keep heat circulating freely and to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Sticking is less of a problem in a crock pot than on a stove, but you still need to scrape the bottom of a crock pot periodically. Water will evaporate as chili cooks. If you added the water all at once, the chili would start out watery and end up dry. I add the water as it's needed, to maintain the consistency I want. </p>

Relatively clean (I filter it regularly), no off smell and it doesn't smoke (in my fryer, that is). I only fry potatoes in this batch of oil to avoid flavor transfer. These are cut into French fries, chips or straw potatoes. Specially the chips and straws retain a lot of water, and I guess that has something to do with it.</p>

<p>Also, I noticed the frying takes longer with the foaming oil.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I've tried poaching(?) the French fries, but they foam during poaching. Then when frying, they really foam. I have to keep an eye on it or the oil spills over the top. Anything I can do about it, or should I just go ahead and discard the oil altogether?</p>

<p>There are various ways to dry out your chips/straws, but one of the most effective ways to is to lay them out on a tray or plate and put them, uncovered, in the fridge for a couple of hours, making sure there are no strong odours in there first. Not only will this prevent too much foaming, it will result in really crisp chips!</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to rescue a loaf once this has happened? The objective is to let it rise overnight so that I can bake it first thing in the morning without having to knock it back and do a second rise. </p>
","<p>Normally, you would not be doing a final proof overnight&mdash;that is, the proof that you have done to form the loaf.  Instead, you would do the first ferment or proof overnight, then form the loaf, let it have its final proof, and then bake it.</p>

<p>The dough won't be wasted, but you don't want to bake a formed loaf that has over-proofed and fallen.  This is because the gluten network will have collapsed and you will have a very poor structure and strange texture.  You will need to reknead the dough, form the loaf, and reproof it:</p>

So anywho, I take a strong spatula from time to time and cut it of the hook, to give it a nice restart with hook on outside of dough ball. but your dough needs to be dry enough that it is cleaning itself off the bowl and it will the hook too. It's designed to find that perfect balance so that it starts wet and sticky and then as the gluten starts to web it becomes self cleaning, and the kneading is drying it a little or maybe the material is absorbing the liquid, either way it goes from dry to wet. Another thing I do if the hook is wrapped in dough instead of working against the sides, I briefly turn up the speed and that will throw the dough to the sides and sometimes clean it.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: To provide some more detail, in my head, there's a difference between ""fruit-flavored yogurt"" and ""yogurt with a piece of fruit in it"". This question is an attempt to figure out how to achieve the former and not the latter.</p>

<p>Regarding flavoring, I'm specifically interested in the following fruit: banana, strawberry, pineapple. I'm not sure how different the process would be to incorporate the different fruits in, but that's what I'm looking for.</p>
","<p>To sweeten it, add your favorite sweetener: sugar, honey, agave... whatever you prefer. This is important, because sweetness will help bring out the flavor of the fruit.</p>

<p><em>General advice:</em></p>

<p>If you have a fruit you want in your yogurt, pick the form (chunks, pureed, mashed, juice) that you want and mix it in. The Chobani yogurts appear have a variety of these forms, always along with some sugar. If you want banana flavor, sure, mash up a banana and mix it in. Or if you want chunks of fruit, chop it up. Assuming the fruit is soft enough, for this purpose, mashing with a fork  is probably a good substitute for pureeing; you'll get some small chunks and some juice.</p>

<p><em>In response to the updates:</em></p>

<p>if you want actually fruit-flavored yogurt, then you need juice and/or puree. If you don't have any other tools, mash it as best as you can. If you have a small food processor or blender that will work with small enough quantities (or are making big batches), blend things up and stir them in. Juice and puree will disperse quite well through the yogurt.</p>

<p>Bananas mash easily, especially ripe ones, so just do that with a fork. Strawberries aren't as soft, but you should get enough juice to flavor with if you mash them. Pineapple is tougher. If it's juicy enough, you can probably get some juice out by mashing it; otherwise you might be better off with a food processor or blender. (If it's from a can, you can use the liquid from the can, too - that might also have sugar in it.) Depending on how thorough you are, you may want to use the juice and discard the fibrous parts that are left over.</p>

<p>What causes sticking and what can I do to minimize the it?  </p>
","<p>The first rule to keeping food from sticking to cast-iron is to keep it well primed - it sounds like you're doing that already. Beyond that, read <a href=""http://www.edinformatics.com/math_science/science_of_cooking/why_food_sticks.htm"">these tips for cooking with stainless steel</a> - they'll also apply to cast iron.</p>

<p>To summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li>Food sticks when chemical bonds form between the food molecules and the metal.</li>
<li>Very hot oil helps to reduce sticking by instantly and continuously heating the food until it's surrounded by a layer of steam from its natural moisture content boiling. Let the oil get nice and hot before adding food.</li>
<li>Very hot oil also binds with the pan, so food can't. This is the principle behind priming the pan in the first place. </li>
</ul>

<p>I have some theories regarding particular problem foods:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most of the molecular bonding occurs from proteins. Egg whites are mostly protein.</li>
<li>Frying potatoes creates surfactants in the oil, which cause oil and water to mix. This reduces the effect of the protective layer of steam. (Some people save and re-use cooking oil -- though it can impart a delicious flavor to later meals, it will also build up surfactants if the same oil is used too many times.)</li>
<li>Also, keep in mind that acidic foods like tomatoes will break down the protective patina and may make foods stick more readily.</li>

However, we uncovered a problem the next morning where people had taken beer and thrown it in the freezer only to forget about it.</p>

<p>I will flip this question around now, what is the best way (is it possible) to take beer from your freezer and safely thaw it for drinking? Is it actually worth drinking if you freeze it solid, then thaw it then chill it again? will the glass be compromised? anyway, i guess this is some regular event at my parents and i would like for this to stop happening.</p>

<p>[as an aside: we wrapped up the two bottles in towels and put them in the basement (which was relatively cool. we came back awhile later and the one bottle had exploded, the other on had a crack around the neck. we had to throw both out. so either this method is fail, or needed augmented.]</p>
","<p>I would suggest the best way is slow cold running water over the bottle in a bowl that covers it. Reason being any rapid temperature increase is going to break the glass. You may lose carbonation but really that is how beers starts so I wouldn't worry to much. For taste, it might taste a little bit different. I have frozen wine on accident and it actually didn't turn out bad. When I bought the same wine and didn't freeze it I got the same flavors. I think it should be alright.</p>

"How to store homemade pasta without freezing","39670","","<p>I'm curious how to make pasta (and in this case I'm talking about say, spaghetti, angel hair, shells or lasagna noodles, no filling) and store it dry like I would find in a box at a store. I would try to take a day where I have not much to do and make ~25 pounds of pasta for the year (or every six months, happy to keep food fresh) Should there be adaptations of a recipe? Or would any do? </p>

<p>How would I go about storing pasta (without filling) without a freezer for long periods of time?</p>
","<p>Any standard pasta recipe (basically flour, salt, water or egg) should do. <br>Unless stated otherwise, fresh pasta can be cooked right away or dried and stored for months. Cooking time will vary, of course, with fresh pasta done in a few minutes, dried in roughly the same range as store bought.</p>

<p>When drying pasta, use the same aproach as for laundry: Separation, dry conditions, slight air flow if possible. For long pasta, it's usually hung to dry, e.g. on (clean) broomsticks or poles, smaller shapes can be put in a thin layer on dish towels or table cloths, pro's use wodden frames with thin mesh, like one would for drying fruit. Tagliatelle are sometimes gathered into little nests (= 1 serving), then dried. <br>For pictures, search for ""pasta drying rack"". Usually you'll need about 2-3 days for pasta to dry thoroughly.</p>

<p>Your estimated storage time of six months should be fine, even up to a year, but only for basic recipes with white flour. If you like to try whole grain, other grains (buckwheat, spelt) or more exotic flavours/colours (tomato, beets, spinach, curry...), I'd aim for three months just to be sure nothing goes rancid or looses colour. Paper bags (food grade) are ok, as is cellophane or plastic, but make sure the pasta is really, really  dry, when packing in plastic. Store in a cool, dry , possibly dark (for coloured pasta) place.</p>

<p>side note:<br>Have fun and remember to take pictures once you've flooded your house with drying pasta ;-)</p>

<p>Is there an alternative to cornstarch to thicken the pie filling or should I just use less and hope I still use enough?</p>
","<p>There are several alternatives, but the most common I know of are tapioca flour and arrowroot powder/flour.</p>

<p>That said, most cornstarch substitutes <em>aren't</em> appropriate for pies, because they break down under high heat.

"When to use chicken thigh versus breast?","39557","","<p>The America's Test Kitchen recipe for Chinese Orange Chicken calls for chicken thigh, explaining that it has a better taste and texture for the recipe. It does not explain why, however.</p>

<p>So that has me wondering: how do chicken thigh and breast differ in taste and texture and how do you decide which to use in a particular recipe?</p>
","<p>Well, as to the difference in taste, I suggest the best way to find out is to try both (cooked, of course). If you have access to Cooks Illustrated (as opposed to just watching the TV show on PBS), they have recipes for both roast chicken breast and roast thighs—make both, and the flavor differences should be readily apparent.</p>

<p>As far as cooking goes, chicken breast has very little fat and very little collagen. Typically, chicken breast is cooked to 165°F/74°C (USDA recommendation for food safety), which is actually a little on the overdone side taste-wise. So various tricks like brining are needed to keep it juicy.</p>

<p>Chicken thigh has more of both fat and collagen, which allows it to take a higher temperature without drying out. Cooking chicken thigh to 175°F/80°C is fairly common. It also is much more suited to slow cooking, which allows the collagen to convert to gelatin (which gives a moist feel to the meat and also a nice flavor).</p>

<p>In this particular case, checking two Cooks Illustrated recipes for orange-flavored chicken (one <a href=""http://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/detail.asp?docid=6621"">deep-fried</a>, one <a href=""http://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/detail.asp?docid=7809"">baked</a>) they both note boneless, skinless breast may be substituted, but they prefer the flavor of thigh.</p>

<p>So you can use either. Use whichever one you think tastes better.</p>

Each trip through the jar mixes the oil with the solids a little more, and it's fairly homogeneous after four turns.</p>

"What is the ideal hydration for bread dough?","39380","","<p>I made a bread that called for 1kg of flour and 700ml of water. That is a 70% hydration.</p>

<p>The problem was that the dough became absolutely soaked, so in the end I added more than 500g more flour. Which meant that my salt ratio was off...</p>

<p>The resulting bread was not too bad, but it wasn't great neither.</p>

<p>What is the 'proper' flour to water ratio? I've made bread with 55% water and that was OK. I know this depends on the flour, but some kind of rule of thumb must exist.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> I've made the same bread again. This time with 60% hydration as I'm using all purpose flour (11% proteins) and I don't have a mechanic mixer. It turned out alright, but a little bit low. I guess bread flour is really needed here.</p>
","<p>Bread hydration varies widely.  The ""standard"" bread using all-purpose (plain) flour has a ratio of water to flour weight (hydration) 60-65%.  Flour with a higher protein level, labelled as bread, strong, or high-gluten, tend to use 65% hydration.  Ciabatta and rustic breads generally use more water than normal.  The extra water gives them more large, uneven holes in the interior of the bread (called the crumb), and generally leads to a higher-rising bread. These wetter doughs are often referred to as ""slack"" doughs in baker's parlance.</p>

<p><strong>Here are a couple sample hydrations from Hammelman's bread baking:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Baguettes with poolish, 66% hydration, all bread flour</li>
<li>Ciabatta, 73% hydration, all bread flour</li>
<li>Pain Rustique (rustic bread), 69% hydration, all bread flour</li>
<li>Country Bread, 68% hydration, all bread flour</li>
<li>Roasted Potato bread, 61% hydration, 85% bread flour / 15% whole wheat flour / 25% roasted potatoes</li>
<li>Whole wheat bread, 68% hydration, 50/50 whole wheat and bread flour</li>
<li>Semolina (Durum) bread, 62% hydration, 50/50 durum and bread flours</li>
</ul>

<p>Mind you, it is quite possible to make a bread with even higher water content, if one is a skilled baker.  Wetter breads (70% hydration and up) generally cannot be hand-kneaded normally, and require a mechanical mixer, stretch-and-fold kneading with a spatula, or autolysis. Autolysis is when you mix water and flour before adding yeast, and then allow it to sit.  This allows enzymes in the flour to develop gluten before the rising begins, and can supplement or replace normal kneading.  </p>

<p>Another approach, called <em>double-hydration</em>, is to add only part of the water before kneading.  This allows you to knead the bread to develop gluten structure before it becomes too wet to knead.</p>

<p>For extremely wet breads, these methods may all be combined.  I'm looking right now at a double-hydration, mechanically mixed, autolyzed, poolish-using ciabatta recipe that sits at 76% hydration.</p>

"Does meat need to be washed before preparation?","39246","","<p>I don't even remember where I have learned that, but I've always thought it common knowledge: Before a piece of meat gets seasoned, or malleted for tenderizing (sorry, don't know the English word for that), or marinated, or thrown into the pan, or ground, it should be first washed under the faucet, and then patted dry. When I think of it, it also makes sense to me, because the bacteria are always on the meat surface, never inside. So I don't think it is a vestige of the time one got bloodied cuts from the village butcher, but that it applies to the modern meat pieces sold on absorbent pads too. </p>

<p>And then I read <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/14556/do-you-use-paper-or-cloth-towel-for-patting-a-meat-dry-before-frying"">this question</a>, which presumes patting (but doesn't mention washing). Most of the answers and comments seem to indicate that patting isn't always considered necessary, and there is no mention of washing the meat or of the dripping water from the washing. In fact, the answers and comments wouldn't make much sense if one assumes that the meat has been just washed. </p>

<p>So is washing compulsory, is it optional but a good idea, is it plain useless, or does it even have disadvantages for the meat? </p>
","<p>It's neither necessary nor a particularly good idea; it does little to remove bacteria from the surface of the meat (which you're about to cook, remember) and runs the risk of spraying/dripping bacteria all over the kitchen.</p>

<p>The FSIS has an article on it <a href=""http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Does_Washing_Food_Promote_Food_Safety/index.asp"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Washing raw poultry, beef, pork, lamb, or veal before cooking it is not recommended. Bacteria in raw meat and poultry juices can be spread to other foods, utensils, and surfaces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only exception would be something like vac-packed, wet-aged meat where you need to remove the salt, but that's a matter of preference.</p>

I already have a rice cooker - the Hamilton Beach Digital Simplicity Rice Cooker and Food Steamer (on <a href=""http://amzn.com/B002SB8LOQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Amazon</a>). I've cooked quite a few different long grain white rices and also brown rice, but have not yet tried sticky rice.</p>

<p>For standard long grain basmati rice I would just pop it into my cooker pot with the appropriate amount of water and press the white rice button. I have some concerns about the sticky rice as I have read that it requires a presoak upwards of 6 hours and I've also read that some rice cookers (Zojirushi) have a specific mode just for sticky rice. I've also read reviews on simple steamers for sticky rice, so that leads me to believe that I would actually have to use the steamer basket vs the regular rice cooker pot, but I'm just guessing.</p>

Note, she says in the comments that she uses 2 cups (or slightly less) water to 1 cup of rice (which makes sense) not 3 cups rice to 2 cups water like it sounds like she is saying in the video. She rinses the rice well, but does not soak it.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> With things like this there are often ""camps"" of differing opinion. I doubt that Michelin Starred restaurants that include sticky rice on their menu ever use rice makers to make said rice. I am reminded of this: <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/37575/turning-regular-noodles-into-no-boil-noodles/37578#37578"">Turning regular noodles into no-boil noodles</a>.

(Remember the Church Lady? ""Isn't that <em>special</em>?"" Think like that.)</p>

<p>I am less of a connoisseur of rice than of baked pasta. That being the case, I'm not sure that I would notice the deficiencies of sticky rice made in a rice cooker. With that in mind, and assuming that you are not on a different stratosphere of connoisseur than I am, I recommend that you give it a shot and let us know how it goes.</p>

<p><strong>Yet Another EDIT - I Tried  It</strong></p>

<p>I used this brand of sweet (glutinous) rice:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ShR0cm.jpg"" alt=""1""></p>

<p>I used 2 cups of rice, thoroughly rinsed, 1 tsp salt, 3 2/3 cups water, and the only setting my simple, old rice cooker has.</p>

<p>My lid is glass, and I could see that there was still quite a bit of water on the top of the rice after the cycle was complete (short, 30 minutes or less), so I waited 15 minutes before I lifted the lid.</p>

<p>Since you can't see the rice without opening the cooker, I recommend that you do the same, wait 15 minutes before opening.</p>

<p>After 15 minutes I checked it out:</p>

<p>It's absolutely fine. Is it as good as the the great Thai place down the street? No. But it's close. The only thing I would (and will) do differently next time is to only use 3 1/2 cups water to 2 cups rinsed rice and 1/2 TBS salt.</p>

<p>After it finished last night, I was suddenly too tired to mess with it anymore, so I just left the cooker on warm, and went to sleep. 5 hours later, if anything, it's improved.</p>

<p>It was fine without it, but I'm intrigued by @GdD's answer here. Later, I'm going to try making the rice again with the above measurements plus 1.5 TBS sugar, just to see (more just seems like too much). <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/40899/making-sticky-rice-without-rice-cooker?rq=1"">Making sticky rice without rice cooker</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Should I store it in an airtight container, or an open bag?</li>
<li>Should I wash and cut it first?</li>
<li>Should it be stored wet, or patted dry?</li>
</ul>
","<p>It depends on what type of lettuce it is -- part of the issue is that if the lettuce is touching plastic, it will rot quicker, so I wrap it in paper towels, then bag it (but <em>not</em> sealed), and keep it in my crisper.</p>

<p>For whole heads of lettuce (iceburg, butter, red leaf, etc), I just wrap the whole thing in dry paper towels, then shove it back into the bag from the grocery store or farmer's market.  I then pull off leaves as I need it, and re-wrap it.  It stores for well over a week this way.</p>

<p>For mescalin mixes, arugula, or other individual leaves, I'll wash them, dry them, then unroll enough paper towels to spread the leaves on, then roll up the whole thing, and bag the roll (again, <em>not</em> sealed), and keep it in my crisper.  I can probably get a week out of it this way.</p>

<p>(all times assume you're not buying from a store where it's been sitting on the shelf too long before you buy it; I get my lettuce when I can from the local farmer's market)</p>

<p>So, to answer the specific questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep the bag open; you don't want moisture to condense inside the bag, as it'll make the lettuce rot faster.</li>
<li>I get better storage time with heads of letuce keeping them whole.  If you're going to be eating it all within 2-3 days, it probably doesn't matter, and for loose lettuce, I find it more convenient to wash it as I re-pack it anyway.</li>
<li>You never want to store lettuce wet ... you might be able to store it completely submerged, but damp will lead to it rotting faster.</li>

<p>I'm going to attack it with gusto and will have lots of sage to do something with. Last year we made a sage jelly but this year i want to do something else. </p>

<p>What are my options? </p>
","<p>One of the most popular things I've seen sage used for is tea.  You just dry the leaves, steep as you would regular tea leaves (personally I like it with ginger root if I have some handy), and then maybe a little honey or lemon.  Sage is anti-bacterial, which is a nice bonus.</p>

<p>Meat-wise, I like to use sage with pork chops, either as part of a marinade or just chopped and rubbed onto the pork and then grilled.  Sage also goes great with chicken.  Roll the sage in your hands to release the oils, then either chop very finely or mash with a mortar and pestle.  Mix with a little salt and rub onto chicken breasts, and sautee in oil or butter (or grill it).</p>

<p>Veggie-wise, I think it pairs very well with sliced, sauteed carrots.  It goes very well with potatoes, try sweating some onion in a pan with a little oil or butter, adding some potato slices, and right before they're ready add fresh chopped sage.  It's also a great ingredient in stuffing, dried or fresh.</p>

<p>I had sage-laced cornbread once, it was pretty delicious.  Wasn't there for the making of, so not sure if there was any special preparation needed, but the end result was nice.  In fact, a friend of mine a while back who was a baker loved using sage in various breads, but baking is one of my weak spots so I can't really give you any specifics other than ""this combination works, check Google for recipes"" :)</p>

<p>At one point, I heard someone refer to what they called ""sage fritters"", which were basically sage dredged in seasoned flour and egg, then quickly fried in oil.  I did a quick search to find the source, and didn't see it, but did come across a very interesting idea: <a href=""http://biscuitsandsuch.com/2010/06/11/apple-sage-fritters/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sage and Apple Fritters</a> (these are much more of a true fritter than what I first mentioned).</p>

<p>If you get tired of it while it's fresh and you're running around like a lunatic trying to find uses for it, there's always freezing.

You can reference <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/469/fresh-basil-storage"">this question</a>, I feel like there's a better one about specifically freezing herbs on this site but I can't find it right now.  The short of it is, some people have good luck freezing whole leaves as they are, some people prefer to chop them or put them in the food processor with some oil or stock, and freeze into cubes.  Both methods have advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>Alton Brown has a great method for drying described in <a href=""http://www.goodeatsfanpage.com/Season7/Herbs/HerbalPreservation.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this episode (text transcript)</a>.  Essentially, you layer an air filter (like you'd use in your central air unit) with an herb.  Place another filter on top, layer it again.  Continue as much as you want, then strap them all to a box fan.  Instead of weeks to months, you should have dried herbs in a couple days, max.  You can <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5GkD2GQ3Tg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">watch the video here</a>, skip to about 2:30 in.

<p>Speaking of Alton Brown, he recommends herb vinegar - you'll find how he makes it on the (text transcript) link in this paragraph.</p>

<p>There are also a TON of medicinal uses and has been used for thousands of years for various remedies.

"How to keep fresh-made soft pretzels from getting soggy or stale?","39043","","<p>I've recently learned how to make fresh pretzels and they are quite good. However, they start to get hard and chewy after about four hours. If I store them in a plastic container before that then they get soggy.</p>

<p>If it matters, the recipe uses active yeast and a baking soda wash.</p>
","<p>Unfortunately you're fighting bread-physics... Bread with a high crust:crumb ratio become stale faster than those with low crust:crumb ratios like large boules or miches. Their large surface area allows moisture to evaporate quickly and the starches dry up and harden.  This is why thin breads like baguettes are traditionally ""daily"" breads, i.e. made/purchased to be consumed that day.  Soft pretzels have an even higher crust:crumb ratio than baguettes.  </p>

<p>Breads with extremely high crust:crumb ratios like hard pretzels, crackers, and hardtack are usually cooked to the point of being dry to prolong their storage capacity.  These bread actually ""stale"" in the opposite direction by becoming more moist.</p>

<p>There are a couple of things you could try that might help a little. It might take a lot of experimenting to get something that helps, and you will likely still need to reheat the pretzels just prior to serving them to have the soft texture you're looking for. Without re-baking or light toasting there really isn't a way to bring back the original crust texture.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use pre-ferments to increase the concentration of a-amylase in your pretzels.  Using a prolonged autolyse and/or sourdough starter can increase the amount of a-amylase in your bread which has been <a href=""http://www.icef11.org/content/papers/fms/FMS771.pdf"">shown</a> to slow staling.</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporate conditioning ingredients like fat, sugar, malt, or honey into your dough.  All of these slow staling.</p></li>
<li><p>Try baking the pretzels at a lower temperature.  The article linked above also mentioned that higher temperature baking leads to faster staling.</p></li>

<p>For storage, your best option is probably to allow them to cool completely (15-30 minutes) then place them in a sealed container at room temperature.  Placing them in a sealed container before they are cool fills the container with humidity, which then coalesces and makes the crust soggy.</p>

"How do I cook a frozen hamburger in the microwave?","38957","","<p>I bought some hamburgers (I mean the meat, not the full sandwich) in vacuum packing and I froze them in the freezer.</p>

<p>Can now I cook them in the microwave? If so, how and how long?</p>
","<p>I don't endorse beef in the microwave, but that said, the best possible way to cook it is going to be on one of the microwave plates that raise your food off the plate. (the ones that look like the inside of a george foreman grill)  You are going to have to play with your power settings a bit to achieve a optimium patty.  In mine, it's 2:30 at 40 percent power and 1:30 at full power but depending on wattage, your particular times are going to vary.</p>

<p>The trick to having an edible patty come out of the microwave is use low power to achieve the desired temp and then hit it at full power to get the outside done.  It will always produce a slimy-er patty than cooking it on a stovetop or in an oven.  Make sure that you cover the patty during cooking as it is going to spatter like crazy.  You don't want to clean that mess up.</p>

<p>If you have access to a toaster oven, you can cook a patty in that in about 15 minutes and you will have a much closer to delicious product.</p>

"What am I doing wrong with my pressure cooker?","38956","","<p>Every time I try to cook beef in my pressure cooker it gets dry and inedible.</p>

<p>Today I tried with 2 x 450 g (2 x 1 lb) beef, with .5 l (2 cups) water and 25 minutes.</p>

<p>The result was very dry and there were .7 l (3 cups) liquid.</p>

<p>I have seen charts like <a href=""http://www.fabulousfoods.com/articles/27943/how-to-cook-meat-in-a-pressure-cooker"">this</a> one, but that would cover the meat in water. Can that be right?</p>

<p>Should I have fried the beef on a pan before putting it in the pressure cooker?</p>
","<p>I use a pressure cooker quite often and its all about the cut of the meat.  Much like slow cooking, using a often cheaper, fatty cut with lots of connective tissue - a chuck roast for example, yields much, much better results.  Lean cuts of meat are make for fast searing and that's about it.  If you try to coax them to be fall apart fork tender, you'll fail - those are the cheap, fatty cuts that go that way.</p>

","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.thebrewingnetwork.com/BN-Army-Blog/C02-Myths-and-Rumors"">The Brewing Network</a>, industrial and food grade CO2 generally come from the same plants:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The slight difference between industrial-grade CO2 and food-grade CO2 is the type of tests that are done to qualify CO2 as beverage or beer gas-grade compared to industrial-grade. Currently, the FDA's requirement for food-grade CO2 a 99.90% purity rating. The other .09% is made up of impurities such as hydrocarbons or nitrogen. Industrial grade CO2 is 99% pure CO2, also containing impurities such as hydrocarbons or nitrogen.</p>

<p>However, the nature of those impurities extremely important.  They go on to suggest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One impurity that all homebrewers should be aware of is benzene. Benzene is a no-no for homebrewers. If the CO2 that you are purchasing has high benzene levels, it will leave you and fellow drinkers with terrible headaches. When I say high levels, we are not talking about much. Benzene is usually an impurity that is referred to in PPB. The benzene level should be around 20 PPB.</p>

"Substituting for Candlenuts in Indonesian Food","38916","","<p>Indonesian cuisine relies heavily on candlenuts as a base and thickener for spice pastes which are the foundation of the cuisine.  This includes many of the various rendangs and sambals, such as <a href=""http://indonesiaeats.com/sambal-kemiri-indonesian-candlenuts-sambal-version-1/"">Sambal Kemiri</a>.   Candlenuts are also used in Malaysian cuisine.</p>

<p>Can I do so here, or should I do as the package recommends and use butter?</p>
","<p>The cooking snobs will say that butter is better, and even my fading taste buds can sometimes detect the difference.  But much of the time you can make the substitute.  BTW the reason for the 7/8 figure is that butter runs about 1/8 water.  So you may have to use 7/8 cup of oil and 1-2 tablespoons of water.</p>

<p>However for bannock making in the bush, corn oil works fine as a substitute for lard. and it's a heck of a lot easier to keep.</p>

<p>A comment below mentions cookie recipes.  For this to be successful, the flour to fat ratio has to be fairly high.  Bannock is 1 cup of flour to 1-2 tbs of fat.  This is small enough that the flour absorbs all the oil.</p>

<p>Another signal:  If the directions call for chilling the dough then there is enough fat in the mix that using oil would make the recipe way too liquid.  I suspect this is the case with many cookies.  </p>

<p>Cake recipes usually don't have as high a fat:flour ratio as many cookies, but cakes are often very fussy about ingredient ratios.</p>

<p>So:  Test before counting on it.  It does work for bannock.</p>

<p>1 cup flour
1 to 3 tbs fat or oil
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
Tiny amount of water.</p>

<p>If you are going to fry the bannock, go light on the oil.</p>

<p>Mix flour and salt and baking powder.
Mix in fat.
Mix in just enough water to make a stiff dough that holds together.  It is very easy to overdo.  Knead only long enough to mix.  </p>

"Why would IQF shrimp say ""do not force thaw under running water""?","38879","","<p>I recently made a recipe that called for thawing frozen shrimp by running them under cold water.  However, I noticed that the IQF tail-on shrimp I buy from Costco state, ""DO NOT FORCE THAW UNDER RUNNING WATER"".</p>

<p>Why might they add this capitalized warning?  Would it be a safety issue or a texture issue?</p>
","<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Jeff Axelrod commented (much thanks) that the Costco IQF shrimp come with most of the shell removed.  In that case, ""DO NOT FORCE THAW UNDER RUNNING WATER"" most likely means if you do it, you'll end up with ""shrimp pulp"" with some of it even down the drain.  The shrimp can absorb the water and get mushy and disintegrate.  This, I have seen in our kitchen and tried to erase from memory.</p>

<p>This also means the trapped bacteria under the shell is less of a concern.</p>

<p><strong>the original answer/caution regarding safety</strong>:</p>

<p>Besides the fact that the shrimp can absorb the water, get mushy, and fall apart under running water, it <em>could</em> be a safety issue.</p>

<p>It may be possible that the pressure from running water will force or push some bacteria that would normally be on the on the outside of the shells (and destroyed) in and under the shell (e.g. between the belly and the shell) where it may be shielded from heat and not fully killed during cooking.  </p>

<p>Bacteria going from outside of the meat to inside has caused Costco <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2012/09/26/edmonton-beef-recall-costco.html"">a lot headache</a>.  In the meat case, it was forced in mechanically by the needles of the tenderizing machine.  They might also be hedging against a similar thing happing with the shrimps and running water.</p>

"What oven should I buy, which is appropriate for baking?","38634","","<p>Three months ago I moved to a new apartment. In my old apartment with my old oven, my baked goods turned out pretty well. However, since I moved, my baked goods vary from almost-good to throw-it-in-the-garbage instantly. First I thought I had to get used to the new oven, so I made adjustments to the temperature and so on. Still I just get very sad every time. The oven is over 30 years old, so I think I have to conclude; I need a new one. </p>

<p>I looked around on the internet for a while, and I did not really get an idea of how to choose one. A couple of things are important to me:</p>

<ul>
<li>It must be appropriate for making pastry</li>
<li>It will be used a lot (almost every day), so for home-use it will be used pretty intensely</li>
<li>I can not install a built-in oven; I rent this apartment and may not change anything</li>
<li>It must be big enough; I have no problem with taking a lot of my space</li>
<li>Here in the Netherlands combo-ovens, which are an oven and microwave in one, are very popular. I'm not interested in the microwave part, so the quality of the microwave is not essential assuming one is in the machine. </li>
</ul>

<p>I am willing to spend some money on it because I use the oven every day. (Note: The owner of the building is probably not going to help me pay for it) </p>

<p>When looking around for a new oven, a couple considerations were raised for me: </p>

<ul>
<li>The free-standing ovens have different powers. Which power must I have at least? (I have seen variations from 800W to 1500W)</li>
<li>Prices vary widely, while specifications do not. Are there some brands or types which can be recommended? </li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to show you the options that I've disregarded, yet I don't even have a clue where to start at all! I am hoping to hear some good advice on how to select an oven to fit this criteria.</p>

<p>-edit-
I start doing some more research. And this is one criteria that must be met for me:
I want top and bottem heat. However, this is not the case in most ovens I can find, and sometimes it is not specified. Maybe I should conclude that it is not the case then? 
Does anyone know the influence of only top heat?</p>

<p>Furthermore my research ended in some options. Prices and types vary, but I can not really tell the difference from the specifications. For example, what does the number of WATT says about the specification of the oven? </p>

<p>-They have top and bottom heat</p>

<p>-They have a volume of around 35 liter. I make pretty large plates, especially cakes. I want enough space in my oven, but maybe I am exaggerating and 24 liters really is enough for home use? </p>

"Spritz cookies not sticking to pan when pressed from cookie press","38566","","<p>We're having a good deal of trouble getting our spritz cookies from our cookie press to separate from the cookie press and stick to the cookie sheet. Is there something we can add to the cookie batter to make them separate from the cookie press and attach to the pan more easily?</p>
","<p>As I understand your question, the problem is really that you can't get it <em>out</em> of the cookie press, and not an issue of the dough ""flattening"" once it hits the baking sheet.  If that's correct, then there are a few different factors that could be contributing:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You might not be using a strong enough flour.  I've always used a 1:1 mix of bread flour and pastry flour.  All-purpose flour isn't great for spritz cookies and many home baking recipes do odd things to try to strengthen the dough to compensate, such as increasing the quantity of egg.  Not much more I can say without knowing the specific recipe, but try to find a recipe that doesn't use AP flour.</p></li>
<li><p>You might not be using <em>enough</em> flour, or you might have added too much water or milk.  The dough should feel relatively firm once it's well-blended, not soggy or watery.  The preparation I use also contains a good quantity of icing sugar, which has its own starch; if you're using regular granulated sugar instead then that will be a contributing factor to sogginess/stickiness.  Also don't forget to sift the flour.</p></li>
<li><p>Home baking recipes often make wild guesses as to the quantity of eggs, based on assumptions about the size and age of eggs you'll have.  The ratio I use is 20:13:8:6:3 (flour:fat:sugar:eggs:milk/water), by weight obviously.  If you use too much egg then you'll end up with a slimy texture that's hard to separate while raw.</p></li>
<li><p>You may have added the eggs all at once, which makes it difficult to incorporate without overmixing the dough (or not incorporating well enough, which again will give you that slimy texture).  Make sure you're only adding one at a time.</p></li>
<li><p>If your recipe calls for oil as a fat, or you're substituting oil for something else, that could be a problem.  Typically you'll want to use a mixture of about half shortening and half butter.  You don't necessarily <em>have</em> to use shortening, but butter has a low melting point and melting will, again, cause your dough to become too wet.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you cream the fat(s) together with the sugar?  That's another important step to getting the right consistency of dough.  You should have a mixture that's light and fluffy before you add the flour, eggs, or milk.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you're adding the flour last, otherwise you risk overmixing.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As far as sticking to the baking pan itself is concerned, just line it with parchment paper and don't grease it.  If you've made the dough properly then it will ""set"" and not sink.</p>

<p>FWIW, I also find it easier to pipe spritz cookies than to use a cookie press.</p>

"What to do with under ripe figs?","38516","","<p>It has been a cool summer and our tree has a large amount of under ripe figs. The frosts will be here in a couple of weeks so they need to be picked.</p>

<p>So what can be done with a large number of under ripe figs?</p>
","<p>Figs are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climacteric_fruits"" rel=""nofollow"">climateric fruits</a> that is, they will continue to ripen after being picked from the tree (because they will start releasing ehtylene). However, contrary to other climateric fruits (such as bananas) this only works if the fruit is picked in the later stage of its developement.</p>

<p>From: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16889975"" rel=""nofollow"">Regulatory mechanisms of ethylene biosynthesis in response to various stimuli during maturation and ripening in fig fruit (Ficus carica L.).</a> - Owino et al., Plant Physiol Biochem. - 2006</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fig is a climacteric fruit and treatment with ethylene in the later part of stage II stimulates growth, accelerates the onset of the rise in respiration, induces ethylene production and promotes ripening. A typical respiration climacteric is not displayed by fruit harvested before the natural initiation of ripening on the tree. However fruit in which ripening had been initiated on the tree gave a normal climacteric rise and ripened fully after detachment from the tree. Thus in many aspects the fig behaves as a typical climacteric fruit, but as a result of its growth pattern, the ethylene production preceding ripening occur during a phase of active cell expansion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What many people suggest, is to put some olive oil on the <em>eye</em> of the fig. I have never done it, but apparently you only need a very small amount around the eye to hasten ripening.</p>

<p>Here are two links to forums explaining this <em>fig-oiling</em> technique <a href=""http://forums.gardenweb.com/forums/load/fig/msg0919492330434.html"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a>, <a href=""http://figs4funforum.websitetoolbox.com/post/Fig-Oiling-4777876"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a></p>

<p>Apparently this will speed up a lot the ripening of the fruits (although some people seem to report they are less sweet).</p>

<p>This works because olive oil will increase the release of ethylene from figs. </p>

<p>From the same paper I cited above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has been known since the 3rd Century BC that a drop of olive oil applied to the ostiole (a process termed as Oleification) of the fig fruit stimulates growth and leads to uniform ripening of fruits. The application of several vegetable oils such as rape seed oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, camellia oil and linseed oil also had similar effects as the olive oil whereas animal oil stimulated fruit ripening but the effect was less than that of the vegetable oils. It was also observed that refined olive oil was more effective in accelerating maturation of the fig fruit as compared to unrefined olive oil or other vegetable oils.</p>
  
  <p>[...]  </p>
  
  <p>A transient induction of ethylene was observed in fruit treated with olive oil, with ethylene production increasing a day after treatment and later declining </p>

<p>The process is simply to start slow until you see bubbles form, then speed up until you see the whisk begin to leave trails in the cream, then go full speed ahead until just before it starts to look soft and billowy. At this point you can add your sugar and continue whipping until thickens and firms up to form soft peaks.</p>

<p>Advice: Buy a hand-mixer at least! :)</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> - Yes you can whip it with a stick blender. I would be careful to avoid over- whipping with this method though. It might be easy to over-do it, and you'll start to make butter.</p>

"Is it possible to oversoak wood chips for smoking?","38399","","<p>I wanted to prepare for a long day of cooking and get the wood chip soak out of the way.  My barbequed brisket recipe calls for soaking the (hickory) wood chips for 30 minutes.  </p>

<p>If I soak the wood chips longer, is it possible that they would become so saturated that they wouldn't smoke or would take so long to dry out as to become impractical?  Or should they already be fully saturated after 30 minutes?</p>

<p>My gut says that it shouldn't matter--given that one of the batches of chips actually sits in water on the grill.</p>
","<p>No, it isn't possible to over soak wood chips, chunks, planks, or any other size that you want to throw on the grill (within reason, I wouldn't soak them for weeks because the water would get scummy). In fact, the directions given often grossly underestimate optimal soaking time. I assume this is because the manufacturer doesn't want to scare people off by saying ""soak for 12-24 hours before use."" </p>

<p>Wood smokes better when it's wet. If it's dry, it catches on fire and produces less smoke for a shorter period of time. What you really want is for the wood to be thoroughly wet so that it smolders rather than flames and produces lots of smoke for a long time. </p>

<p>As you would expect, the larger the piece of wood, the longer it will smoke and the longer you need to soak it. My general soak times are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Small Chips - These are very small, coin sized. Generally get totally saturated in 2-3 hours.</li>
<li>Large Chips - Between Small Chips and Chunks. Soak for 12 - 24 hours.  </li>
<li>Chunks - These tend to be about 1/2 to a whole fist sized. These want to soak for at least 24 hours. </li>
<li>Planks - For plank smoking. Soak for 8 - 12 hours. </li>
</ul>

<p>You can always soak for less time, you just won't get quite as much smoke production. Judge the need based on what you're cooking. If you want a little smoke on a steak that you're only cooking for 5-8 mins, then you don't need to worry about it. If you're trying to smoke salmon, it matters more. If you want to smoke a butt for 12 hours, it matters a lot. </p>

"Help with ground beef seasoning: flavors are weak","38215","","<p>So I routinely serve up very simple style burritos in my apartment (beef, sour cream, cheese and white flour tortillas), and I've grown well past the days of using pre-mixed seasoning packets to flavor the ground beef.</p>

<p>However, after a particularly tired night where I reneged on that and used a packet that I had leftover sitting in the pantry, I realized just how much flavor it managed to impart into the beef comparative to what I normally get out of my manually done spice blends.</p>

<p>Typically speaking, I use a blend of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chili Powder</li>
<li>Chipotle Powder</li>
<li>Cumin</li>
<li>Mustard Powder</li>
<li>Freshly Cracked Black Pepper</li>
<li>Touch of Salt</li>
<li>Cinnamon (just a touch for some
sweetness)</li>
</ul>

<p>I brown the beef, drain off the fat, and then get it back in the pan to simmer in a mix of red wine vinegar and water for volume. When about half of the liquid is gone, I then add the spice mix.</p>

<p>Generally I get the heat just right with the chili/chipotle, but it's not quite salty enough and the cumin flavor doesn't seem to really impart itself enough to the point I'd like. Likewise, there's only a hint of the vinegar flavor, which isn't necessarily a bad thing when all of the other flavors are weak, but if the other flavors came more to life, I'd expect the vinegar flavor to be at least a bit bolder as well.</p>

<p>Is there an ingredient I'm missing for this type of cooking that aids in making those flavors really stick to the beef? Or is this possibly just a case of ""add more X""? Possibly a technique / timing issue? Alternatively, is there a spice out there that you could recommend as a stronger version of any of said ingredients? I'd really like to NOT overload the salt levels, and I'd also prefer to keep straining off the fat from the browning process.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>edit: Thank you all for the suggestions! I'm making them again tonight and will be trying a combination of Bob's and Mrs. Garden's answers. Going to be adding Worcestire Sauce, replacing water with Beef Stock, upping the amount of Cumin and using some fresh minced garlic towards the end of the simmer (and maybe some onion powder as well). I'll update when the verdict is out.</p>

<p>edit 2: The fresh garlic and extra cumin definitely brought out some more flavor, and the Worcestershire definitely gave a bit more punch than I would have thought it could possibly do. The flavor was fantastic, albeit a bit overpowering, but that I'll attribute that to having to readjust the amounts of everything with the new ingredients / ratios. Thank you all for your suggestions again.</p>
","<p>To get more flavor out of cumin, you can use whole seeds, and toast them briefly in a pan before grinding. If you don't want to put forth that extra effort, you'll just need to add more cumin. If it's not salty enough, the best solution is to just add more salt (sorry). Salt will enhance the other flavors as well. A bit of cornstarch would help make the spices stick, and dry out the mixture. I'm not sure how much water and vinegar you're adding, but you may just be watering down your beef too much. I usually add just enough to keep the spices from sticking to the pan, but not so much that there is a lot of extra liquid that needs to be reduced.</p>

<p>Your spice mixtures may also contain some form of MSG. You can get a similar umami ""punch"" by adding a dash of Worcestershire sauce.</p>

<p>Edit: I don't know how I missed this, but the other answers point out the lack of garlic and onion. Your store-bought spice mixtures definitely contain plenty of those in powdered form, which you can use, but fresh is tasty too. Don't add fresh garlic too early, as it can easily burn and turn bitter.</p>

"What makes a good vessel for storing sourdough starter?","38165","","<p>I was going to buy the King Arthur set of starter + crock, but the crock is on backorder, so I plan to instead locally source a vessel for the starter. What should I look for? Should I find a similar crock? A jar of some kind? </p>

<p>ETA: More specifically, what should I be looking for? Size? Materials? Lid type? I read elsewhere that I don't want an airtight seal; I'm looking for more advice like that. </p>
","<p>Admittedly I have only stored my starter in a glass jar, but I wouldn't want anything else.</p>

<p>You should look for a size that is neither too large, nor too small. It should comfortably hold your sourdough starter when you are simply feeding it - I usually store 200g of starter, at 100% hydration (100g flour, 100g water) or thereabouts. However, when actually making sourdough starter you make more - perhaps 400g or so, depending on how much bread you are making, plus you want to have something left to restart your bread. A typical recipe might call for 20% starter, so 200g for a kilo loaf. The other solution is to of course have two separate jars, and only use both when doubling for bread.</p>

<p>When I say it must be able to <em>hold</em> that much, I mean that it will have to hold it fully risen, which means around 2x to 2.5x of the original size. In addition, narrow and high is better than low and wide, since it makes it easier to tell how much it rises.</p>

<p>Also, you will want a wide opening, so that you can easily clean it.</p>

<p>As for covering it, I just use a sheet of plastic. Just take care not to get it gooey. It will hold in the moisture so the sourdough doesn't dry out, but won't trap the carbon dioxide.</p>

<p><strong>Good luck</strong></p>

"sauce pan vs. dutch oven vs. stock pot - any difference besides size?","38121","","<p>I have to admit, I've been pretty ignorant about cookware terminology for my whole life - I've had a set of pots and pans of various sizes, and I've used them.  Now I'm in the market for a nicer, new set, and am pretty confused.  My question here is if there's really any difference (aside from size) between sauce pans, dutch ovens, and stock pots.</p>

<p>I'm looking at a few sets:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001KS6N7U"" rel=""nofollow"">T-fal C798SC64</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B009JXPS6U"" rel=""nofollow"">Cuisinart MCP-12N</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0042H5OLW"" rel=""nofollow"">KitchenAid Stainless Steel 10-Piece</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The T-fal set has a ""5.5 Quart covered Dutch oven.""  The other two sets have 8 quart stockpots.  They all have sauce pots of various sizes (1 to 3 quarts).</p>

<p>Are these all just pots that happen to be different sizes, or is there something fundamentally different?  What advantage does the dutch oven have over the stock pot?  In other words, is there something else I need to consider other than just buying the sizes that make the most sense for me?</p>
","<p>While all of these are large pots (or may at least come in large sizes) they have different purposes, which lead to differences in typical construction.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Saucepans are intended for general purpose cookery, and usually have solid construction, and permit searing in the pot, reducing, and a variety of other tasks.</p>

<p>They are the most difficult to characterize as there is tremendous variation in quality levels and design among the products available.</p></li>
<li><p>Stock pots are purpose built to make large quantities of stock.  Since they are not used for searing typically, and liquids circulate via convection making hot spots not a priority, they are typically constructed from thinner metals (steal or aluminum) and don't have good general purpose cooking qualities.</p>

<p>The main virtues in a stock part are low cost, size, and light weight.</p></li>
<li><p>Dutch ovens (at least real Dutch ovens) are a legacy from the time when cooking was done in hearth or campfire.   They are designed to be nestled into the coals or embers, with more coals or embers placed on top of the lid, creating a hot oven like interior--thus the name.</p>

<p>True quality Dutch ovens will be fairly thick, usually cast iron, possibly enameled, and may have little legs to help nestle it into the fire above the coals; similarly, a the lid may actually fit into the pot, allowing coals to easily be piled on top.</p>

<p>Dutch overs are actually fairly versatile cooking implements, and can serve for searing, roasting, braising, stewing, biscuit making, soup making, and even some bread applications even in the modern kitchen.   Many are large enough to make stock in for home purposes, although they are not absolutely ideal for the task.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You will have to ask yourself, given your own cooking patterns, would the general versatility of a dutch oven, or the size of a stock pot serve you better.  None of the sets you linked to has a true dutch oven, however; the one that purports to be a dutch oven has a glass lid!   It might be an okay pot, it is not one I would ever choose.</p>

<p>For stainless steel products (without the specialized legs and concave lid to nest coals in), there is very little difference between a dutch oven and a very large sauce pan.</p>

"What is the correct flour, sugar, butter ratio for crumble?","38103","","<p>Looking through a number of fruit crumble recipes I see that there is a wide range of ratios used for crumble topping. Some use equal amounts of flour (or other dry ingredient), sugar and butter. Others use about half the weight of butter and sugar to flour. Others still use double the amount of sugar and butter to flour.</p>

<p>Is there a definitive ingredient ratio for crumble as there is for pastry (3:2:1)? If so, what is it?</p>
","<p>There is no single ideal. More sugar and butter will mean a more crunchy crumble top (and one that browns or burns more quickly), more flour will make it more sandy - they each have their place. The juicier the fruit, the sandier I like the topping to absorb some of the juice. The longer the fruit needs to cook, the more resilient to cooking the topping needs to be. And of course for a tart fruit like rhubarb, you might like more sugar in the topping to balance it - or you might just add sugar to the fruit and leave the topping alone.</p>

<p>My goto mix is 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup butter. But play with it a bit and vary it according to the fruit you are using - and I don't just mean ""rhubarb"" or ""apples"" but taste a bit of today's fruit to see how sweet it is, how soft it is, etc.</p>

"Anise Seed vs. Fennel Seed with Taste as No.1 factor","38102","","<p>I've noticed that in some recipes Anise seeds can be used interchangeably with Fennel seeds.

<p>For example, I've found a lasagne recipe which calls for fennel seeds.  I do not have any but I do have Anise seeds (not star anise).  Could I use the Anise seeds in the recipe without much noticeable difference?</p>
","<p>I thought this was an interesting question, so I went into the kitchen and had a comparative chew. Anise Seed (or aniseed where I come from) is smaller, darker and gives a more immediate anise hit, but it fades quickly. Fennel seed is two or three times larger and paler. When you chew it, there's little flavour at first, but then a wash of anise flavour comes in. I think fennel tastes a bit softer, smoother, ""greener"" and more rounded.</p>

<p>If I had to substitute anise for fennel, I'd probably use a third or even a quarter of the original quantity. Although you might just want to leave it out. I agree with bikeboy - the great joy of fennel in Italian food is biting on fennel seed and getting that green-spicy hit in a meat dish (oh! I have a pasta dish with sweet Italian sausage, tomato, cream and fennel that is <em>to die for</em>). I don't think you'd get the same effect with anise.</p>

<li>Is it something that I'm going to reheat, but not cook over high heat?</li>
</ul>

<p>So, part of it's the items themselves, but the other part is how I'm preparing them ... and stir-fry just isn't something that I think lends itself to frozen vegetables in my opinion, as you want to cook them quickly, and they're not going to cook quickly from frozen.

<p>I typically use frozen vegetables for things like pot pies, soups, and such, where the vegetables don't need to be at their absolute prime.  Frozen peas hold up amazingly well; I'll even sprinkle them into paella or other dishes to add texture and color.</p>

<p>My suggestion for your onion problem would be to get larger onions.  You'll spend less crying over 1-2 large onions than 7 or 8 small ones.  At the very least, peel 'em all, then start cutting, so you're not exposed to the fumes slowly over a longer time.</p>

","<p>Human skin contains oils which aid in blocking out the absorption of chemicals which would harm or irritate the skin. Those oils contain proteins. Pineapple contains a chemical compound called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromelain"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bromelain</a> which has the ability to break down these proteins. This is bad, because it can then act on the skin itself (which is also comprised of protein molecules).</p>

<p>On top of that, pineapple is high in citric acid. The tingling/itching/burning sensation you describe is no doubt the result of both of these things acting upon the skin at the same time. Understandably, eating pineapple with (or after) meat high in oil content (such as pork at a luau) will mitigate against these effects.</p>

<p>Since there's no escaping this problem through the use of cutlery, there must have been some other factor at play to which you didn't make attribution at the time.

","<p>Wetted starch is not the same thing as cooked starch. If you want to see the difference in a simple experiment, make two starch slurries, boil one into a pudding, and leave the other one cold. Starch only gelates at high temperatures (I think it starts around 70°C, but needs even more to complete the process). </p>

<p>When you have a grain of rice, you have the problem that the starch is very closely packed together, and water can't penetrate into the center of the grain too well - the outside layers soak all the water they come in contact with, and so water only seeps into the center of the rice after the outer part has been hydrated. It is similar for pasta. In the worst case, when you cook rice, the time needed for cooking will be enough to heat the whole grain to the gelating temperature, but not enough for the water to hydrate the innermost part of the corn. This is fine if you want hardish-cooked rice, but if you want soft, mushy rice, you should presoak it so the inside is already hydrated when you start cooking it. I suppose you can do the same with pasta. This is the reason why some sources will advice you to presoak. </p>

<p>But, as I said, this is not the same as cooking. Yes, the rice or pasta will get soft, so you won't break your teeth if you try to eat it. But it will still be raw starch. I don't know if it is unhealthy to eat raw starch (my mother certainly told me so, but it could have been a myth; I asked <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/16891/can-we-digest-raw-starch"">a question about that</a> and got no conclusive answers). But it will probably taste unpleasant, similar to raw potatoes or raw flour. I would try to get other sources of food for this time period. Or, as @justkt's comment suggests, it is easy to get an electric kettle in a brand new house before the kitchen is installed. You can use it to pour cooking water over ""instant"" versions of pasta and rice. These have been pregelated and then dehydrated, so don't need a prologned cooking. They are usually available as instant hot soup or rice meals in sachets and cardboard boxes, I haven't seen them as pure ingredients. </p>

"Why do yolks break so easily (sometimes)?","37581","","<p>Separating eggs without breaking the yolk isn't one of those problems that keeps me awake at night. Nevertheless, there are occasions where I can't get a single damn yolk to hold together and other times when I can do anything short of play a round of tennis with 'em.</p>

<p>Could the freshness of the egg determine how likely the yolk is to break? Or maybe the temperature of the egg?</p>

<p>Generally the problem comes not when I crack the egg, but when I start to transfer the yolk from shell to shell.</p>
","<p>Yes, the freshness is the factor. In the US eggs are sold in three grades: AA, A, and B (rare). The grading is based primarily on age. AA are the freshest, and B the oldest.</p>

<p>Here is a diagram depicting the internals of an egg:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cRux1.gif"" alt=""egg""></p>

<p>The characteristics of the freshest eggs are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A large thick albumen (white)</li>
<li>A small thin albumen</li>
<li>A sturdy thick chalaze</li>
<li>A small air space</li>
<li>A sturdy round yolk when lying flat</li>
</ul>

<p>As the egg ages the following things happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thick albumen breaks down, getting smaller</li>
<li>Thin albumen gets larger</li>
<li>Chalazae degrades getting thinner and weaker</li>
<li>Air space increases</li>
<li>Yolk membrane weakens, when cracked it lies flatter</li>
<li>Embryo may become visible as a red speck</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result of the weakening membrane the yolk is indeed easier to break. Michael's suggestion to use your fingers to separate the eggs is spot on. The edge of an egg shell is a little too risky for reliable separation of eggs.</p>

"What is liquid glucose?","37551","","<p>Two days ago, I was making ganache as a topping for cupcakes. I needed, as expected, cream and chocolate. But '1 teaspoon of liquid glucose' was also on the list of ingredients (for 12 cupcakes). I didn't think I had that, so I used 'fondant sugar' (powder sugar with a bit of water, described <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/7108/what-is-fondant"">here</a> as poured fondant).</p>

<p>And yet another question: if I would have added (powdered) sugar to my cream, would I have accomplished ganache as well (after being poured over chocolate), since I think the sugar would dissolve in the cream?</p>

<p>(Just to be complete: my ganache was fine.)</p>
","<p>First of all- glucose is a different sugar than table sugar. Corn syrup in the US is similar but has a few extra compounds. As far as I can tell it is used for similar reasons as liquid glucose in the EU.

","<p>While I agree that these types of warnings are conservative and partially CYA, I would suggest that they <em>not</em> be dismissed.</p>

<p>What needs to be understood is that there are other factors involved past the production method. Even if a mfr./producer observes and maintains the highest quality standards in their production facility, they have no control over how the food products are handled after leaving their facilities.</p>

<p>There are many transportation and storage steps between the time products leave a production facility and the time you pick it up from a grocer's shelf. If, in any one of these steps, the food has not been handled properly, the safety has been compromised.</p>

<p>While I would say that the risk may be minimal, it still exists. I am not overly conservative in my own kitchen, but one needs to know that the risk can be real. And just because something hasn't happened yet, it doesn't mean that it can't.</p>

Probably depends on the final alcohol percentage though, like if you add enough juice that the percentage goes less than 10 or so percent, you have to have more precautions in sanitizing everything.

"How do you properly cook a steak?","37261","","<p>I love steaks so much, that I would like to get a green card and live in the States just to enjoy good steaks whenever I want.</p>

<p>If I try to lower the temperature of the grill pan, I get an extremely dried meat that resembles cork.</p>

<p>So, which are the basics for properly cooking a steak (say, to a medium-well grade)?</p>
","<p>You should be able to get a reasonable steak stovetop using a cast iron grill pan, if you have a strong enough exhaust. Oil the cast iron pan (with canola or such), then heat it very hot, until it starts to smoke. Make sure the meat is completely dry on the outside (wipe with a paper towel, water will prevent browning) and gently place in the pan. Leave it there for a minute or two (it'll smoke quite a bit!), rotate 90° to get the nice grill marks. Leave for another minute or two. Flip, and repeat for the other side.</p>

<p>It may splatter, have a splatter screen handy. It will smoke, quite a bit, make sure the exhaust is on high.</p>

<p>You will probably have a medium-rare steak now. Using a thinner cut will make it more well done (you can cut a thick steak in half with your chef's knife, making two thin steaks); so will plopping it in the oven (not sure if you want the oven before or after searing, I like 'em medium rare...).</p>

<p>Remember to let the meat rest for 5 minutes or so before serving.</p>

<p>Also, if your steaks are coming out ridiculously tough, you're probably using the wrong cut of meat, or some terrible grade. What cut are you using?</p>

<p>[edit: I should note that, in case it wasn't obvious, the burner should be up pretty high]</p>

<p><strong>Edit by rumtscho</strong> There is a reason this answer specifies a cast iron pan. If you are limited in your cookware choice, pay attention to the maximum temperature your pan can tolerate. If you are using a non-stick pan, you have to go on medium heat and wait longer, else you'll damage the pan. (And sorry, but you can't get it as tasty as on high heat that way). </p>

So, what I get is hardened (but still grainy) brown sugar in a pool of melted butter.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>The recipe:</strong></p>

<p>1/4 cup unsalted butter,
1/4 cup butter compound (I think it's half butter half margarine),
1 cups dark brown sugar,
1 large egg,
1/2 tsp vanilla extract,
1/2 tsp baking powder ,
1 cup flour,
1/8 tsp salt</p>

<li><p>In a small pot, melt the butter and butter compound over low heat. Add the sugar
and stir until melted. Turn off the heat. Preheat the oven to 325°F and 
grease an 8"" baking pan. </p></li>

Please give me tips regarding boiling it. Thanks a lot for helping this newbie out. :)</p>
","<p>In the past I have had a similar issue with making a butterscotch drink recipe.  What I have found is that adding a bit of water to the melted butter (1-2 tsp/1/2 c, 5-10mL/120mL) helps dissolve the brown sugar and prevents graininess and seizing.  Sugar is not readily soluble in fat, so it needs water in order to dissolve.</p>

<p>I suspect one of three things happened:</p>

<ol>
<li>Different batches of butter may have different water contents.</li>
<li>The brown sugar may have lost some of its moisture as it sat around in the
pantry.</li>
<li>Some of the water may have evaporated off while melting the butter.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you heat brown sugar in butter without enough water some will dissolve in the water present from the butter and the brown sugar, but it will become grainy and seize as the water is evaporated and the undissolved sugar granules act as nucleation sites.  Meanwhile the undissolved sugars are being lightly fried in the fat from the butter. </p>

","<p>Per <a href=""http://pickyourown.org/howtomakepeanutbutter.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Pick your own</a> (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Store it in the refrigerator until you use it.  It should keep for a month or two. You can also freeze it.  It will keep indefinitely in the freezer. In both cases, you may need to stir the peanut butter to mix the oils back in (the oil tends to separate over time). <strong>And no, you cannot ""can"" the peanut butter - it is too low acid to safely can with home equipment.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could not find a single government or university sponsored publication that discussed how to can homemade peanut butter.  If you stumble upon a certain link that does not eschew this practice, and recommends boiling temperature canning, consider them fraudulent.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.doesitgobad.com/does-peanut-butter-go-bad/"" rel=""nofollow"">Does it go bad</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you make your own peanut butter and you don’t use any stabilizers, you should keep it in the fridge. .... Your homemade peanut butter should be of best quality for at least half a year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that all of the even semi-credible sources I could find indicate refrigeration is required.</p>

<p>At ambient temperature, especially in summer, it is going to have a much shorter shelf life, but I could not find any authoritative information.  You should probably prepare it in small batches that you can eat within a week, maybe two at the maximum  (in winter) if it will be stored without refrigeration. </p>

<p>You also want to store the peanut butter so that the oil (which will probably separate) on top will protect the peanut solids, since it is more difficult for microfauna to gain a foothold in the oil.  Keep an air tight lid on it whenever you are not using the contents of the jar, to oxygen contact, and thus hold of rancidity. </p>

<p>Homemade peanut butter will have mostly unsaturated fats (one reason the oil in your peanut butter is liquid at room premature), which are susceptible to rancidity.  You will want to discard the peanut butter if it develops rancid flavors as they are highly unpleasant.  If you see signs of mold or bubbles or sour or off smells, discard it immediately.</p>

<p>I suggest contacting your local universities, who may have programs or services to provide this type of information for your area and constraints (which I infer includes no refrigeration).</p>

<li>Sources seem to assume the basic peanut-only recipe.</li>
<li>There will be no significant difference for <em>small</em> amounts of additions of honey, sugar, or salt.  The amounts are too small.  Honey balances anti-bacterial effects, with adding moisture.  The amount of salt is just too small to matter.</li>

I have no grill so only a gas oven/halogen oven and a frying pan.</p>

<p>Am I able to cook it like Nando's Butterfly chicken using a frying pan and an oven?
Is this the best method to achieve this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pat the chicken dry with paper towels.</li>
<li>Put just enough oil in a heavy-bottomed pan to cover the bottom.</li>
<li>Put the pan over medium-high heat and get it good and hot - the oil may just start showing wisps of smoke.</li>
<li>Lay the chicken in the pan carefully, being sure to start at the edge closest to you and lay it down away from you. This will prevent you from getting splashed with hot oil.</li>
<li>Let it cook for 2-4 minutes until you get a nice sear on it.</li>
<li>Flip, (the chicken, not you) again being careful to flip away from you.</li>
<li>Now if the breast is thin enough (maybe you butterflied it beforehand), you can just let it finish in the pan. Often, though, after flipping I'll pop the whole pan into a 400F oven and finish it in there. Again, times will vary, but I would start checking it after 5 minutes.</li>

","<p>Yes, this technique will give you approximately the same results as Nando's. You want to use an oil with a relatively high burning point like sunflower, rapeseed or groundnut - olive oil may burn.</p>

<p>Another point to remember is that Nando's chicken breasts all have the skin on: this adds flavour and helps keep the meat moist. For the best results, both in terms of not giving yourself food poisoning and avoiding dry chicken, use a quick-read digital thermometer to ensure the breast is only cooked as much as it needs to be, but at a safe internal temperature. It should reach 75ºC in the thickest part.</p>

","<p>The smell is of rancid fats in the flour. It is a very distinct smell, but hard to describe. I would agree that ""sour"" is part of it. The best way to learn is by comparison. Smell some fresh, clean flour and remember what it is like. Any kind of unpleasant odor than that is rancidity. You may have smelled it also if you opened a box of cereal that has been around too long, or even poppy or sesame seeds - anything with fats that sits around at room temp will eventually go rancid.</p>

"How does a whipped cream charger work?","36867","","<p>I recently got an iSi whipped cream container that charges with nitrous cannisters. I don't really understand how the thing works, which I think would help my use of the system. How does this actually whip the cream upon dispensing? What does shaking do that will make a solid foam / mousse? Why does over shaking turn it in to a solid in the cannister? </p>
","<p>The cream whipper relies on gas expansion to work.</p>

<p>When you make whipped cream by beating, you beat fine air bubbles into the cream. The cream traps air and becomes essentially a matrix that holds those bubbles--a foam.</p>

<p>Your gas-charged whipper does the same thing in a totally different way.</p>

<p>When you charge the whipper with gas, there's high gas pressure inside with the cream. The cream will actually absorb the nitrous oxide you put in. Because of the pressure, the gas absorbed can be thought of as really really really small bubbles within the cream. So you have a matrix of gas and cream, but because the bubbles are so small, it's essentially just cream. </p>

<p>Chilled liquids more easily absorb gases at high pressure, which is why it's good to use cold cream and keep the whole unit in the fridge. A limited amount of agitation (shaking) exposes more cream to the gas, improving absorption.</p>

<p>When you release the cream from the device, the absorbed gas expands rapidly. The bubbles get bigger, and your cream to bubble ratio becomes more like the foam that we know as whipped cream. It's really exactly the same thing, only with nitrous oxide instead of plain ol' boring air inside the bubbles.</p>

<p>Why nitrous oxide? As I understand it, it's because it's the cheapest non-toxic, odorless and tasteless gas you can get. Carbon dioxide would almost be a good choice, but unfortunately it's bitter. Not a good match for cream.</p>

<p>Finally, why is shaking too much a bad thing? That one I don't know for sure, but I know what happens when you over-whip cream with the mixer. You make butter. Perhaps the gas or high pressure encourages this conversion, or maybe you're just churning it that much when you over-shake. Either way, I'm sure you've essentially made butter when you shook it too much.</p>

"Is it safe to cook wine or vinegar in cast iron?","36844","","<p>I want to cook a beef brisket, following a recipe that suggests baking it on a bed of onions and red wine, or red wine vinegar.  I'd like to use a cast iron dutch oven, but am concerned about the interaction between the wine and the iron.  I've read tomatoes and iron is not recommended, but what about wine or vinegar?</p>
","<p>I'd like to refer you to my answer to the question about <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/11547/would-a-cast-iron-pot-work-well-for-chili-if-so-why/11566#11566"">chili in cast iron</a>, from which I'll summarize the relevant parts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Typical cast iron <strong>corrodes</strong> at a pH lower than 4.3; pure white vinegar (5%) has a pH of 2.4 and wine is around 3.2 to 3.8.  If you plan to use either of these in cast iron, you'd better make sure they are <em>heavily</em> diluted, otherwise you may actually ruin your pot in addition to getting a pretty hefty iron supplement with your meal.</p></li>
<li><p>Cast iron is still somewhat reactive at borderline pH ranges, i.e. tomato juice or sauce.  It'll leach out about 5 mg of iron for every 3 oz / 88 mL of liquid for typical cooking times.  The typical human needs to ingest significantly more than 45 mg over a period of several days to become toxic, so it's generally considered OK and even healthy to cook dilute tomato solutions in cast iron, but wine and vinegar are another story.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Don't fill your cast-iron cookware with wine or vinegar.  A splash for sauce or deglazing is OK, but tossing a significant amount straight into the pan undiluted will ruin your cookware, and your health.</p>

<p>P.S. Note that enameled cast iron (Le Creuset, etc.) is <em>less</em> reactive; the specifics depend on the brand.  If you have this type of cast iron, I suggest doing your homework before taking the risk.</p>

"What does the refrigerator crisper compartment actually do?","36822","","<p>In most refrigerators you will be able to find a compartment for your vegetables and fruits. This compartment is called the crisper and it is supposedly able to keep your vegetables and fruits fresh longer.</p>

<p>How do these crispers keep the vegetables fresh longer? I personally don't really notice much of a different between storing the vegetables in the crisper compared to the rest of the refrigerator.</p>

<p>Does the crisper provide a better environment for your vegetables to last longer? And if so what qualities of this environment is doing this?</p>
","<p>The crisper provides a somewhat enclosed environment, which prevents moisture from escaping as rapidly. Vegetables keep best at a certain humidity, higher than that typically found in the rest of the fridge, but not so high that condensation starts accumulating on them. Vegetables kept in too-dry air in the rest of the fridge will tend to dry out and shrivel up faster; those kept in the crisper will retain their water and texture better, keeping them crisp.</p>

<p>Leafy vegetables are also much more prone to drying out, since they have much more surface area, while hardier vegetables with a decent skin on them (like bell peppers) don't dry out nearly as quickly. Fruits benefit somewhat from this as well, but don't generally need as high a humidity as vegetables.</p>

<p>Some crisper drawers have little sliders on them which vary the size of the opening to the rest of the fridge, letting you vary the amount of circulation and therefore the humidity; you can adjust this to suit what you tend to store in the drawer. If you have two crisper drawers, both adjustable, then it might be a good idea to put fruit and hardier vegetables in one, and more vulnerable vegetables in the other.</p>

<p>Does anyone know any tips or tricks to help minimise the tears when chopping <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion"">onions</a>?</p>
","<p>The tearing of the eyes is a result of enzymes that form a sulpherous gas when the onion is cut (concentrated inside the inner core or bulb of the onion) being released into the surrounding air. </p>

<p>You have a few options to avoid this - one would be to not cut through the center of the onion but to extract the ""core"". This is kind of a pain and means you are discarding a decent chunk of onion, so I don't like it too much. </p>

<p>Another option is to use a fan to blow the gases away from you. A small fan next to you blowing horizontally should do the trick.</p>

"What is bakery emulsion and how is it different from flavoring extract?","36814","","<p>I was in Ross for Less and saw (and bought) a bottle of lemon bakery emulsion because it just sounded good.

<p>I've added a bounty for this question, but I need an answer based on experience.  I know how to search the web.</p>
","<p>A flavoring extract is flavoring disolved in alcohol, while a flavoring emulsion is flavoring suspended in water with an emulsifier. Citrus oils like lemon have a stronger flavor when placed in an emulsion than an extract, and that is why they often come that way.

<p>If it were a lesser fruit (say, a nectarine), I might just toss it, but I'm trying to be resourceful, and mangoes are not inexpensive around here, so I'd like to make use of it. What uses are there for an underripe mango? I thought of simmering it with milk and a little sugar, but I can only guess as to how how things would turn out.</p>
","<p>If you simmer milk with acid, the milk will curdle. I wouldn't go this way. </p>

<p>If you insist on a sweet application, you have to add sugar (or another sweetener) to the mango. A sweet taste will cover acidity perfectly. You can either cook it with sugar syrup, or macerate it. After that, pureeing is probably best, because you want to avoid hard sour pieces in sweet sauce. From then on, your fantasy is the limit. Jam (maybe in combination with another fruit - how about that nectarine and some Grand Marnier?), sorbet, candy, yogurt-based smoothie, jello in molds or as a cake layer, mixing with cheese to create a spread or a mango cheesecake - everything is possible. The taste, however, will be less than optimal, because unripe fruit is not only sour, it doesn't have yet its full aroma. Still, it will work - not as well as a ripe mango, but it will be OK. </p>

<p>Sweet isn't the only option. The classic use for an unripe mango is to put its sourness to good use and prepare a mango chutney. Again, you can stay traditional and make it pure, or experiment with additional fruit and spice combinations. Then use the chutney as a dip or sauce in savory dishes. </p>

"Mold on Vinegar Batch?","36779","","<p>About 2-3 months ago I decided to start my own batch of vinegar.

A few layers of cheesecloth were placed on top to allow it to air, without letting anything else get into it.</p>

  <p>If you see a scum forming on top, don’t disturb it; this is the
  mother. Eventually the mother will sink toward the bottom and continue
  its work. However if you see mold forming on top, by all means skim

<p>Cook's Illustrated's recommended method for the fastest, best tasting brown rice (no link since it is probably on the pay site) is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Boiling the rice for our brown rice recipe until it is almost tender
  (about 30 minutes), draining it, then steaming it until done (another
  five to 10 minutes) is by far the best stovetop method for brown rice.</p>

<hr>

<p>You have actually asked two different questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the fastest way to cook rice (duration)?</li>
<li>What is the most energy efficient way to cook rice (least heating of your house)?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are not the same thing.</p>

<p>Something to consider:  of all liquid non-metals (and I don't think any of us are going to cook in molten iron), water has the the highest capacity to transfer heat.</p>

<p>It is going to be very difficult to find a way to cook rice that is <em>faster</em> (at least for actual time cooking the rice, when not counting bringing water to the boil) than the traditional pasta method, as often employed in some parts of India:  Bring water to a boil, add the rice, cook until done, and drain.  However, the energy required to bring all of the surplus water to the boil and the enthalpy of vaporization will make this fast, but not efficient.</p>

<p>Your most energy efficient rice production method (and this is by the very laws of physics which govern our universe is also the one that will add the least heat to your home) is almost certainly a rice cooker, which will heat only until it senses the rice is done.  (Of course, what the rice cookers are really measuring is the rise in temperature when the water is all absorbed or evaporated, and so the temperature can rise; therefore, starting with the correct ratio of rice to water is critical).</p>

<p>The bottom line:  brown rice takes time to cook.   Some rice cookers, however, let you set a timer so that the pot will have the rice ready when you come home.  This might be your best bet.</p>

"Is smell a bad way of determining whether meat is still good?","36737","","<p>I have always relied on my sense of smell to determine whether meat (most often chicken) is bad and I thought it was reliable. However, I have just heard that [1] smell is not always reliable, since some of the toxins produced by bacteria won't cause any smell whatsoever and you won't be able to notice that the meat is off until after you've eaten it. </p>

<p>Is this true? If yes, is this true for all meat or only for some? Is there a more reliable way of determining whether meat is still good.</p>

<p>[1] ""Heard that"" isn't very reliable; so that's why I'm asking the question here. :)</p>
","<p>It is absolutely untrue and very dangerous to think that ""if it looks OK, and smells OK, it must be OK."" If that were the case, food poisoning would be very rare. Food that we can sense is <em>spoiled</em> rarely causes illness. For one thing what you don't eat can't hurt you, and people generally won't eat food that looks or smells spoiled. But less obviously, much of what causes spoilage that we <strong>can</strong> taste, see or smell is actually fairly harmless to humans. Spoilage and rancidity are terms that are often used interchangeably, but rancidity is actually a specific kind of spoilage, caused by the relatively harmless oxidation of fats which is unrelated to any kind of bacteria or other microorganism. It's just a function of time, temperature, oxygen, and light. Fancy dried cured meats get a fair amount of their special flavor from controlled rancidity. Molds and yeasts cause food to spoil, but are also used in controlled ways to create flavor. Dairy cultures are bacteria, and bacteria plays a major role in fermentation. </p>

<p>What causes illness and death are often things that we <em>can't</em> taste, see, or smell. Salmonella, E. coli and C. botulinum are usually undetectable by our senses. Mishandled food that has been heated to temperatures far hotter than is necessary to kill any and all dangerous organisms can still kill if those organisms have produced chemical toxins or deadly spores. We usually can't sense those either. </p>

<p>That's why the ""rules"" exist. You need to take care to keep food out of the dreaded ""danger zone"". Foods that are considered unsafe unless cooked to a specific temperature <em>ARE</em> unsafe unless cooked to that temperature (although government recommendations in that matter are often overly conservative, there is room there for assessing your own risk). Preserved foods must have appropriate acid, salinity, sugar or other tested preservatives. Stored foods must be kept at the proper temperature. Dried foods must be dried correctly. Canning procedures rules seem overly strict. They are not. Learn the rules, disobey them at your peril. </p>

<p>Have I fallen victim to a weak product sold on marketing hype?  Or am I simply too novice to properly utilize this pan?  What cooking skills might I be missing to properly utilize this tool?  What tools should I be using instead?</p>

<p>What reasons might there be for me sucking at using this pan?</p>
","<p>You've got a great pan and in a short time I'm sure you'll come to love it.</p>

<p>When using a standard pan (one without non-stick coating), heat your pan dry over high heat until you can hold your hand about 6-inches above the cooking surface and feel the heat radiating upward.  This allows the tiny cracks and crevices that are imperceptible to the bare hand to expand and when the oil is added, it will coat and create a more even cooking surface.  </p>

<p>Add just enough oil to lightly coat the surface.  Adding to much oil leads to pan-frying which is fine if you're frying chicken but not what you want when searing and sauteing meat.  There should just be a thin film across the bottom of the pan.  An additional benefit to first heating the pan is the fact that it will actually take less oil to coat the pan due to the decreased viscosity.  When the oil hits the hot pan it will instantly heat and should shimmer across the bottom like water on a freshly cleaned windshield.</p>

<p>You don't put the oil in the pan first because the longer oils and fats heat the quicker they break down and smoke.  If you were to add cold oil and cold food to a cold pan and then start heating, you just end up with a big sticky mess.</p>

<p>Make sure you're prepared to add the food to the pan once the oil goes in otherwise the oil will start to burn.  </p>

<p>The issue with burning and overcooking is going to be a matter of controlling the heat.  Start searing and sauteeing over high heat because as food is added it will suck a good deal of heat from the pan.  If it isn't extremely hot to begin with you'll end up with a steaming mess of gray colored meat or vegetables that aren't doing much cooking.  Once the meat is browned but needs further cooking you can always turn down the heat to prevent excessive browning and crusting before the interior is done.  </p>

<p>Even if you aren't planning to do a pan sauce, or if you've burnt what was cooking in the pan, you'll still want to deglaze with some water while the pan is hot (you can reheat it if it has already cooled down) so that you can scraped up the cooked on bits more easily and have less scrubbing to do when cleaning the pan.</p>

<p>I'm looking to make my own 拉面-style noodles. I've read up a lot about kansui and making your own kansui with a powder mix of sodium and potassium carbonates. I've also seen some recipes that substitute kansui powder with baking soda.</p>

<p>Can I use baking soda to substitute for kansui? If so, in what proportions? If not, what other common ingredients can I use to substitute?</p>
","<p>Harold McGee tackled alkaline noodles a while back. He found that baking baking soda actually changes it from sodium bicarbonate to sodium carbonate. This is a reasonable substitute for the kansui called for in alkaline noodles and can be substituted 1:1 in recipes. The noodles may not get AS yellow as they would with both alkalines present in kansui but it's a small price to pay for not having to hunt down that ingredient. </p>

<p>The key part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just spread a layer of soda on a foil-covered baking sheet and bake it at 250 to 300 degrees for an hour. You’ll lose about a third of the soda’s weight in water and carbon dioxide, but you gain a stronger alkali. Keep baked soda in a tightly sealed jar to prevent it from absorbing moisture from the air. And avoid touching or spilling it. It’s not lye, but it’s strong enough to irritate.</p>

"How do you coat perfectly round truffles with melted chocolate?","36484","","<p>How do you coat perfectly round truffles with melted chocolate. Preferably with the least amount of mess. Normally, I just dip the truffle into a bowl of melted chocolate and remove the truffle with a spoon. I then will place them on a sheet of wax paper.</p>

<p>However, this leaves my truffles looking ...well not so round. The chocolate drips down causing the truffle to have a flat surface. And the ball is not smooth.</p>

<p>The recipe I am following can be found <a href=""http://icookandcode.com/2014/07/20/recipe-mint-oreo-chocolate-truffle/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and an example is shown below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/v7ygL.jpg"" alt=""Example""></p>
","<p>I don't know about <em>perfectly</em> round, but you can do better.</p>

<p>Stick toothpicks in the truffles before dipping. Dip them using the toothpick, let it drip enough to make sure there's not a ton of excess, probably while spinning it a bit to let it cool slightly and make sure it doesn't all accumulate in one place. Then stab the other end of the toothpick into something to hold it with the truffle at the top. (A block of foam works, as does cardboard, though you might need to pre-poke holes.) </p>

<p>This avoids having a lot of excess coating chocolate, which it looks like you're getting a lot of when scooping out with a spoon. There can still be a little excess, but it'll drip down the toothpick, not get smeared all over. It also avoids having to mess up any of the surface by touching it with the spoon.</p>

<p>Beyond that, they'll be as perfectly round as you managed to roll the centers, which is mostly just a matter of a bit of practice and obsessiveness. So they won't be <em>perfectly</em> round, but they'll be a lot smoother and rounder, definitely enough to impress people. You do get a small hole on one side of the truffle, possibly with a tiny bit of excess chocolate around it where it collected against the toothpick, but I don't think that's terribly ugly. Plus as long as a decent fraction are pretty, you can just eat your mistakes.</p>

<p>Here's what a friend and I managed on our first try:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OyTIY.jpg"" alt=""truffles""></p>

<p>As you can see, they're definitely not perfect. But we got better at it as we went along. A lot of the irregularities are from initial inexperience, variation in chocolate temperature (we didn't have a great water bath or hot plate setup), and simply not having terribly round centers.</p>

<p>Finally, you might want to practice tempering the chocolate a bit better. Having nice glossy smooth surface makes them look a lot cleaner even if they aren't perfect.</p>

<p>If you are worried that heating your water in a microwave might not be sufficient to kill all ""nasties"", remember that killing bacteria is a function of time and temperature, so you might feel safer if you not only bring your water to a boil, but continue boiling it for another minute or so. I would assume that this is mostly for your psychological benefit, but it certainly won't hurt. The temperature reached is identical for different heating devices as physics dictates the boiling point of water and it can't exceed that as long as it's liquid.</p>

","<p><strong>Oats</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oats are among the many cereal grains consumed. Oats are very popular in the health food movement because of their high nutritional value, and they have been used in breakfast porridge for centuries for much the same reason. Oats have a nutty flavour that is an excellent supplement to bread and other foods. Oats are high in protein, calcium, fiber, and vitamin E, among many other nutritional needs, and are an excellent dietary supplement for this reason. Today, oats are eaten in the form of oatmeal and granola bars. </p>

<p><strong>Barley</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Part of the grass family, barley grows in over 100 countries and is
  one of the most popular cereal crops, surpassed only by wheat, corn
  and rice. Because barley is a whole-grain food, consumption provides
  several health benefits. It is high is soluble fiber and can reduce
  blood cholesterol and blood glucose levels. Barley is also low in fat.
  Pearled barley is widely available in supermarkets near the rice, dry
  beans and pulses. Barley flour is available in health food markets. It
  is used as a thickener for soups and stews, and also in baked goods.
  In some recipes, you can combine barley flour with wheat flour. Barley
  flakes are used in baked goods. Barley is also used in the malted
  form. To form barley malt, the barley kernels are soaked and dried.
  The kernels sprout in a controlled environment. Along with beer, uses
  for barley malt include extracts, syrups and flavourings. Cooked
  pearled barley added to a salad provides extra fiber. Main dishes,
  soups and stews, baked goods and breakfast foods also include barley
  as an ingredient.</p>

<p>You can absolutely prepare Cottage Pie to the pre-baking stage and fridge (or freezer) it until the next day. You need to cool it relatively quickly though - hot food shouldn't sit around for more than a couple of hours.

<p>Should it be about the temperature where you can stand leaving your hand in the water ... but any degree hotter and it wouldn't be tolerable? Or is that way too hot?</p>

<p>For example in a bread recipe which calls for hand hot water.</p>

<p>I don't think I'm asking for a specific C or F, more a rule of thumb.</p>
","<p>I don't know the term either. I don't think it is established baking slang, so it is bound to vary between recipes, should you find it in another one at all. But if you got it from a bread recipe, it must be because you need optimal conditions for your yeast. The optimal temperature for yeast rising is 35°C, with rising being too slow below that (but it will still happen, even at 4°C in the fridge!) and not possible at 40°C and above, where leavening action gets too low for practical purposes (and at some point, the yeast dies). </p>

<p>This is a nice representation of the amount of CO2 produced by yeast (which correlates well with leavening) at different temperatures. The difference between the low effective temperature (25°C), the optimal temperature (35°C) and the upper limit of the effective temperature (40°C) is not big, so I don't rely on my imperfect senses and always use a thermometer when making yeast dough. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qr5KK.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>But you are writing that you want a ""rule of thumb"", so you probably don't have (or don't want to bother with) a thermometer in your kitchen. In this case, you can still have your bread rise well. The literal thumb is a bad choice, as it is quite insensitive, but the trick our grandmas used to gauge the temperature of infant food is still valid: use your elbow. </p>

<p>The skin of the elbow is very thin, and it will very well notice the difference between a 35°C liquid (which feels roughly the same temperature as the elbow, remember that 37°C are normal inside the body, not on the skin outside) and a 40°C liquid (which feels too warm). If you were to use your fingers or the back of your hand, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference well enough, and will risk overshooting and killing the yeast. There are possibly other body parts which can feel the difference (I'd guess the tongue, if you don't scald it daily with hot drinks), but hygienewise, the elbow is probably better. </p>

Adding salt helps a bit, but I don't want to add too much for obvious reasons. Ideas how to prevent the sauce from getting too thin in the first place are also welcome.</p>
","<p>If your sauce is too thin, the problem is that your initial roux was either too thin (not enough flour) or you added too much liquid for the amount of roux that you made.

","<p>Yes, you can.</p>

<p>The problem is that the potatoes start absorbing water, and you end up with a really runny mash that's difficult to flavor (as most people flavor their mash by the addition of flavorful liquids).</p>

<p><strong>update</strong> : There's a few things that you can do to hold them.  The first is to drain the water, and leave the potato bits (unmashed) in the pot.  If you leave them uncovered, they'll cool off, but it'll also let moisture evaporate, which can help to fix some of the problems I mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>You don't want to let them cool off too far, or they'll not mash up smoothly; if you're going to need to hold them for more than 5-10 minutes, put a lid on them.  Once it comes time to mash, refresh them with whatever liquid you're going to add to the mash, warmed.</p>

<p>If you're going to need to hold them a really long time, you have two options ... one is to mash them but intentionally reduce the liquid, and then refresh them with more hot liquid a few minutes before serving.  The other is to transfer them to a baking dish after mashing, and put it in a low oven.

If you use a minimum amount of fat, or even none, the ""check and jiggle"" step becomes even more important. Make sure you can slide the eggs around in the pan.

"Why did butternut squash make my fingers dry and yellow?","36057","","<p>Last weekend I made butternut squash soup. In an experiment to get more of the squash browned I peeled two medium squash and cut them into 2 inch chunks, rather than just halving it, before roasting in the oven. (Result of the experiment was OK, but the extra exposed area also allows more moisture to escape, so I wouldn't recommend this method.)</p>

<p>Halfway through peeling the 2nd squash I noticed that the fingers on my left hand (I'm right-handed) were getting yellow and that the skin was drying, cracking, and tightening up. The yellow I can understand as transfer since I was using that hand to hold the squash while peeling. But I've peeled butternut plenty of times for various recipes and this hasn't happened before. Washing my hands didn't help. The problem went away after a couple of days.</p>

<p>Does anyone want to venture an explanation? Did my fingers O.D. on carotene or potassium?</p>
","<p>It's definitely a very real reaction. I'm not sure exactly what in the squash it is that causes it, but since different people react differently - some people have strong reactions like you, some people have mild ones, and some have no problem at all - it seems to be some sort of mild allergic reaction. It's often called contact dermatitis, but that's a very generic term and doesn't really mean anything you don't already know. I'm not sure exactly what component of the squash it is that causes it, but I don't think it's carotene or potassium. It's likely some more complex molecule that tends to be present in various winter squashes.</p>

<p>You can avoid it by completely wearing gloves while working with the squash, or if you're lucky, you have someone else with you who can handle the squash without problems. For many purposes, like soup, you can also simply cut the squash in half, roast it, then scoop out the good stuff. But if you do really need to peel it and cut into chunks, your best hope is just to try to avoid touching it too much. You'll also want to wash your hands immediately after, or even a few times while you're cutting if it takes a while.</p>

<p>If you do end up with this despite your best efforts, cortisone cream can help relieve the reaction afterward.</p>

<p>(And as for your soup, there's nothing wrong with letting more moisture escape in exchange for browning. You can always just add more water or stock back into the soup. This can even be a good thing, since it lets you replace water with a more flavorful liquid.)</p>

Any insights?</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, the simple answer you are looking for does not exist.  There are <em>books</em> written about this subject, for example, the <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0813819814"">Handbook of Fruits and Fruit Processing</a> or <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/084931478X"">Processing Fruits: Science &amp; Technology</a>.  Where I live, there are <a href=""http://ifpt.ca/"">entire academic programs</a> dedicated to commercial food processing, and fruit processing is no small part of that.</p>

<p>It's a little like asking how a car is made.  There are different classes, different engines, different companies, different features... there's no single answer.  Likewise, if you're processing fruit juice, there are different classifications (juice, nectar, or ""drink""), different fruits with different properties, seasonal variations, pulp or no pulp, different degrees of sweetening and concentration and the incorporation of other additives, and so on.  It's a veritable jungle of proprietary processes, patents, and trade secrets.</p>

<p>Let's take oranges and citruses as an example.  A little digging around on Google Books through the Handbook indicates that they have to go through all of these processes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Washing</strong>.  Food processing plants don't just rinse the fruits in a little water like you or I would juicing an orange at home; they need to wash them with detergent and scrubbers to prevent any contamination.  Of course, it goes without saying that this is only possible with the thick insulating peels of citrus fruits.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extraction</strong>.  In order to concentrate the juice, they have to get it out of the fruit first.  There all sorts of machines and patents dedicated to maximizing the yield from every single piece of fruit.  Of course in some cases they also have to de-seed, or preserve the pulp, or both.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blending</strong> accounts for seasonal changes in the appearance and flavour of seasonal fruits.  Many if not most plants will retain and freeze some amount of juice or concentrate from earlier seasons and mix it with late-season or off-season juices to get more consistent output.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>De-oiling</strong>.  Yes, citrus peels have oil.  From what I understand, removing it involves either a centrifuge or a hermetic separator (also common in dairy products).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>De-aeration</strong> removes oxygen (air), which improves both the total output and the shelf life.  Notice how homemade orange juice is often kind of frothy and bubbly but store-bought juice isn't?  That's why.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pasteurization</strong> is a whole area of study in and of itself, and needless to say almost <em>every</em> commercial food needs to be pasteurized before going out the door.  This can do all sorts of interesting things to the flavour and nutrition of the juice - some good, some bad, depending entirely on the method of pasteurization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Debittering</strong> seems to be done in several different ways, and understand that this is <strong>not</strong> sweetening.  It refers to the actual <em>removal</em> of bitter compounds (such as limonin) via various chemical, physical, and even biological processes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acid Reduction</strong> requires the pulp to be separated first and (sometimes) re-incorporated later, so that the pure juice can be treated to remove some of the citric acid.  Again, this is <em>not</em> the <em>addition</em> of a buffer, it is the <em>removal</em> of the acid ions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cloud stabilization</strong> I can barely even understand myself, except to say that the opaqueness (or ""cloudiness"") of orange juice is due to specific kinds of particles and that the process of stabilizing them prevents the juice from turning clear and usually seems to involve pectin (a naturally-occurring gelling agent found in many fruits).  I guess consumers would think they were getting ripped off if their orange juice was clear.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evaporators</strong> do exactly what the name implies, evaporate water out of the juice, which is where the <em>concentration</em> actually comes from.  Again, industrial evaporators are far more complex than the basic principle of simply applying heat, and I'm not going to try to get into that here.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Essence recovery</strong> deals with the part that's actually evaporated, which is more than just pure water.  Processing plants have ways to separate at least some of the characteristic orange aroma from the water vapour and later re-incorporate it back into the concentrate.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally the concentrate has to go through <strong>freezing</strong> and <strong>storage</strong> and you can rest assured that they don't just throw it in a freezer.  The book above makes reference to a ""slush freezer"" which is similar in principle to the ones you see at the 7-11 but obviously much larger.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Every single one of these steps varies from producer to producer, plant to plant, juice to juice.  Sometimes steps can be omitted, sometimes new ones are added.  To know exactly what a particular company does with a particular concentrate, you'd have to ask them or visit their plant.</p>

<p>The one assumption you <em>have</em> made - that concentrate contains preservatives - is actually wrong.  In fact, kind of the whole point of concentration (aside from making it easier to trade in high volumes) is that it doesn't <em>need</em> preservatives like fresh juice does.  Many if not most ""from concentrate"" drinks will even say ""no preservatives"" on the label.</p>

<p>If I were to try to sum this up as best I can into a bite-size answer, it would probably be this:</p>

<p><strong>Very little is actually <em>added</em> to juice concentrate.  The concentration process is mostly about the <em>removal</em> of undesirable substances.</strong></p>

"What's the difference between green, white, and red onions?","35873","","<p>Being a north Indian, the only onions that I have used and seen others using are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_onion"">red onions</a>. These are used in all Indian traditional dishes.</p>

<p>I have seen <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scallion"">green onions</a> and white onions in the market sometimes (haven't noticed anyone purchasing them though).</p>

<p>How are the green and white ones different from the red onions I'm used to? Are there specific times I should use them instead of red onions, or things I should try them in to be able to tell the difference?</p>
","<p>The difference for green onions will be most noticable if you don't cook them.  Instead, slice them up and use them for a garnish over the dish.</p>

<p>The white portion of the green onion will still be oniony, but not quite as strong as a raw red onion.  Slice them thinly and use for garnish if you really want to bring out the onion qualities of them.  If you don't want it too strong, then add them when you're cooking.  (and you might not want to slice them as thin).</p>

<p>The green portion gives a more mild onion taste but also some of the grassy quality that you might get from chives.  I treat them like a fresh herb, chop them up, and add in them in the last minute of cooking or I don't cook them at all.</p>

<p>As for substitution ... I'd only plan to do it if you were cooking for someone who didn't like onions, as they're milder and come in smaller portions than bulb onions, so it's easier to control amounts without any waste.  ... and I'd do it if I had them on hand but didn't have bulb onions around.</p>

<p>If you're just looking for a good way to feature the green onions -- grill them.  Trim the ends off, clean off any dirt, give them a coat of oil, then toss them on a hot pan or grill.  They make a great side dish.</p>

<p>Other good uses are to add them into scrambled eggs, green onion pancakes, or press them into naan before cooking it.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>For the white onions, the opposite is true -- they're generally stronger than red onions.  Most people don't serve it as a raw garnish unless it's very thinly sliced and used in small amounts.  It's still used raw, but it tends to be blended into other things such as pico de gallo, or guacamole, where the pungency of the onion helps to balance out the sweetness of the tomatoes or richness of the avocado.</p>

<p>I'm having difficulty thinking of a dish where the qualities of the white onion would stand out, though.  My only idea is french onion soup, because it just comes out lacking if you make it with sweeter red or yellow onions ... but unless you made them side by side and compared them, I don't know that you'd see the difference.</p>

<p>You might try cooking them slowly over medium heat until they caramelize ... it'd let you feature the onions without them being overwhelming, and it brings out some of their more interesting qualities.</p>

"How would changing the amount of egg affect a pancake recipe?","35619","","<p>When I make pancakes, the recipe I use calls for 1 egg and 1c of flour. However, usually I increase the flour (up to 50%) to make a bit more. I've tried both keeping 1 egg, or adding a second one, but it doesn't seem to make any difference...in other words, it seems like there's an awful lot of room to maneuver when it comes to how much egg to add. If so, I could add 3 or 4 eggs to get more protein into the pancakes. How would adding lots of extra eggs affect the end result?</p>
","<p><em>This answer assumes the US-type of pancake.</em></p>

<p>There are some pancake recipes with no egg at all.  So the question is, what does the egg do in a pancake recipe?</p>

<p>It contributes soem fat and emulsifiers from the yolk, some water, and a bunch of protein (mostly from the whites).</p>

<p>This will add structure to the pancake, some eggy flavor and richness, and perhaps somewhat mitigate the danger of toughening the pancake through over mixing, by inhibiting gluten formation (mostly due to the fat and lecithin from the yolk).</p>

<p>However, as you have already discovered, the egg is not completely essential to the pancake, which basically a griddled quick bread, and can easily get all of the structure it needs from the gelatinization of the starch from the flour.</p>

<p>Adding lots more eggs would start to move you into custard or quiche-like territory, where the product would have a lot more egg flavor, and start to take on a more scrambled-egg type texture depending on how far you go.  You will get less flavor but more textural change from using just whites.</p>

<p>If you love pancakes, I would make them with any pancake recipe you like, and enhance your protein intake from other food items.   Personally, I love a scrambled egg, and they go great with pancakes.</p>

<p>Edit:
I see in your profile that you are in France.  Since we also call French style crepes the same thing in English, I am thinking you probably do mean US style pancakes, so the above would apply.</p>

<p>If you are thinking of crepes, they tend to be a touch eggier than pancakes to start with, which helps give them the structure to role or fold easily while still being so thin.   </p>

<p>I imagine that they could take a bit more egg still, with some change in texture and more egg flavor, but might start to stick to the pan more, as egg really likes to stick.  At the extreme end, you would essentially have thin fried scrambled egg, which you can roll up with fillings, as some other cuisines do.</p>

<p>Still, I am not an expert on crepes; I have never made them myself.  If that is what you are asking about, hopefully someone else can give you a more knowledgable answer.</p>

"Does microwaving eggs kill salmonella?","35589","","<p>If eggs are thoroughly washed and of course beaten before microwaving, and after the process I can find no liquid, is there a possibility that salmonella is still there, or does it die from high temperatures?</p>
","<p><em>Microwaves</em> do not kill bacteria, <em>heat</em> kills bacteria. The higher the temperature, the faster those bacteria will die off.</p>

<p>""Instant death"" for most bacteria (including salmonella) is about 160° F (71° C). You only need a few seconds at this temperature. The notoriously strict USDA <a href=""http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Factsheets/Use_a_Food_Thermometer/index.asp#4"">recommends</a> 160° F for egg <em>dishes</em> but is considerably more lax about whole eggs and just says to cook until firm. Very few eggs are contaminated in the whites or yolks, so the risk is very low.</p>

<p>Pasteurization begins around 57° C (135° F), so many bacteria are killed <em>before</em> the egg coagulates (at 63° C / 145° F), which is why the USDA is not very strict about it; if an egg by itself is ""firm"" then it's generally already been hot enough for long enough to ensure safety.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, microwaves tend to heat (a) quickly and (b) unevenly, so if you are concerned about food safety and insist on making eggs in the microwave (not recommended), be sure to use short bursts and stir several times, otherwise you might end up with a combination of uncooked and overcooked parts, which is bad for food safety <em>and</em> for general taste and texture.</p>

<p>Note that there is not only a possibility but actually a certainty that <em>some</em> salmonella is still there, assuming that there was any to begin with. Cooking is equivalent to pasteurization and that does not kill every single bacterium, nor is it meant to; it just kills about 99.9999% of them which makes the cooked item safe enough to consume.</p>

"What types of alcohol will make meat tender when marinating?","35581","","<p>When marinating meat for Russian ""Shashlik""(BBQ) some people marinate meat in alcohol. My uncle prefers to use beer when preparing pork. My Georgian(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)"" rel=""nofollow"">this Georgia</a>) friend uses red wine, which was the only ingridient I was able to get out of him. His BBQ is always very juicy and tender.</p>

<p>My questions: What types of alcohols should be used to help bring out meat flavor and making it tender without messing with the taste? Is there one type of alcohol that works great with all meats or should different types be used for different meats?</p>

<p>Bonus: What properties does alcohol possess that it makes meat tender?</p>
","<p><strong>Alcohol does not make the meat tender</strong>.  It even prevents the outside surface of the meat to fully absorb the flavours.  Then again, most marinades don't penetrate into the meat anyway.</p>

<p>When it comes to Shashlik, I think what <em>is</em> working for your uncle, is the time the meat spends in the fridge getting aged (they probably marinate for a day or more) and the enzymes break down the meat.</p>

<p>It is a myth that Alcohol or Acid make the meat tender.  In fact, they have the opposite effect.  Per food author <a href=""http://www.cheftalk.com/t/15717/marinades"">Harold McGee's quote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alcohol does denature and dehydrate meat and fish tissue, and the
  stronger the alcohol, the stronger this effect.</p>

<p>What you should do instead, is to cook off the alcohol from your marinade first. The ingredient that keeps the meat juicy is <strong>salt</strong> which most marinades have.</p>

","<p>Popcorn does not soften.</p>

<p>There are <a href=""http://www.versagrain.com/types-of-corn.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">five main types of corn</a>: dent, sweet, flour, and popcorn. These types vary slightly in their composition but they share a similar basic structure:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QLUrm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Dent corn is used almost exclusively as animal feed. Incidentally- it is the only type that I ever saw for sale in Germany which might explain why all the Germans I met thought we were crazy for eating corn on the cob.</p>

<p>Sweet corn has a soft hull and much more sugar in the endosperm- It is eaten as whole kernels.</p>

<p>Flour corn has a couple delicious starches in the endosperm and a manageable hull. Manageable in the sense that it can be ground to release the starches. </p>

<p>Popcorn is unique in that the hull is freakishly thick and not porous. When the popcorn is heated the steam inside the kernel forces the hull to shatter- releasing the steamed starches which instantly solidify in the air.</p>

<p>The hull is made out of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cellulose</a> and is indigestible to humans and insoluble in water unless treated with inedible amounts of acid (or acetone). Boiling popcorn might partially rehydrate the interior starches but it won't soften or remove the hull.</p>

<p>If you're looking to produce a dense fudgy brownie and wondered if, while you were at it, you might cut back on the oil...NO, but here are some suggestions for making a cakey brownie more dense and ""fudgey"":</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Follow Tim's advice above on using butter instead of oil.  It's not doing anything as far as calories but it will produce better flavor vs. a neutral oil.  However, particularly if you're planning to put nuts in them, you could replace a portion of the vegetable oil with walnut or hazelnut oil for enhanced nutty flavor.</p></li>
<li><p>Replace half of the whole eggs with egg yolks.  Cakiness in brownies is partly due to the use of whole eggs.  Egg whites have a drying effect on baked goods.  In converting a brownie recipe I did, I used 2 egg yolks for each whole egg.  </p></li>
<li><p>Replace part of the granulated sugar with corn syrup. They hygroscopic nature(ability to absorb moisture and retain it) of the corn syrup will create a more dense moist result.  I think I replaced about half the sugar with corn syrup.  The added moisture of the corn syrup will help to off-set the loss of moisture from removing the egg whites.</p></li>

<p>Heat chocolate, butter, cocoa powder over a hot water bath until chocolate is melted.  Stir to blend to a smooth consistency.  Set aside to cool slightly.</p>

<p>Beat egg yolks/whole egg with sugar and corn syrup until thick, light in color, and mixture forms a ""ribbon"".  </p>

"Instant espresso powder substitutions?","35288","","<p>Many recipes for chocolate baked goods call for instant espresso powder. I rarely bake, but I always have coffee in the house. What might I use as a rule of thumb for substituting for instant espresso powder? </p>

<p>I know I could substitute regular coffee for any liquids, but that could add too much liquid to some recipes. Would double or triple strength brewed (or French Press) coffee work? Is the flavor significantly different in the instant powder than in brewed coffee? Or is it simply the quick dissolve and the lack of liquid that makes the powder appealing in baking?</p>
","<p>I've struggled with this issue as well because I live in a moist climate and instant espresso powder cakes up on me between uses.</p>

<p>Generally recipes which use instant espresso power are trying to add a kick of bitter and roasted flavors to deepen chocolate flavors and make them richer.  You can try substituting instant coffee 1:1, but the flavor of the baked good will certainly suffer a loss of richness. Increasing the amount of instant coffee, however, would likely add more bitter or acidic flavors -- and caffeine -- to the cookie or cake than you want.  Also, instant coffee takes longer to dissolve, so it needs to be added straight to a liquid.</p>

<p>There's no real way to substitute liquid coffee in most recipes, such as chocolate cookie or brownie recipes, because the recipe has no water in it in the first place.  In the rare recipes where there is water, you could substitute strong-brewed coffee for an equal quantity of water+espresso powder, and this would likely work fairly well.</p>

<p>So, summing up: there's no really good substitute for instant espresso powder in recipes which call for it that I've found with some significant experimentation.  Hopefully someone else has had better ideas than me.</p>

The crust (under the toppings) is about a 1/4in thick. If you look at it as a cross-section, there's a thin layer of cooked crust topped by a more soft, doughy layer, almost like a ""dumpling"". Looking at the bottom, the crust is medium brown on average.</p>

<p>The dough is homemade, rises for about 2 hours, worked into a crust (about 1/4in thick), and only sets long enough for me to top it. I've tried cooking on a pizza pan, a stone, a cookie sheet, 350, 400, etc. </p>

<p>CLARIFICATION: The dough that I made is NOT from the pizzeria. It's from a recipe book on pizza doughs.</p>

<p>CLARIFICATION 2: The specific part that I'm trying to reproduce is the ""doughy"" part. If you look at the pizza from the side it has a layer of what appears to be ""not completely cooked"" dough. No air pockets/bubbles/etc, just dough. I know I'm not explaining this very well, I apologize. </p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I recommend starting with a chilled dough, puncturing with a knife or fork (see below), and cooking in a greased pan initially then bricking.</p>

<p>Cooking directly on the stone the entire time works better for thinner crusts than mid-dough. By mid-dough, I am referring to the ones that plump up a bit and finish between 1/4"" - 1/2"" in thickness. They can have both uniform, almost cake-y cross-sections, or air pockets and bubbles depending on how kneaded they are (more kneading means cake-ier, denser dough).</p>

<p>I worked in a shop that made a mid-dough similar to what you describe. It was a standard dough recipe (flour, water, yeast), but I have had success replicating it at home at 450'F with beer and less kneading. At home I use a pan and then finish either on the rack or a stone. In any case, you get a dough that tears nicely and has a good chew.</p>

<p>The dough itself was mixed in the morning and kept refrigerated for as long as 12 hours as individual shells in greased pizza pans covered with saran wrap. To prepare a pizza, we pulled the shell, punched it with a fork (puncture a ring around the edge to create a crust, puncture the inside to allow for air). Dress with sauce and toppings.</p>

<p>We had a stone-bottomed oven, but initially the pizza is baked in the oven in the pan until the bottom of the dough has hardened enough to get ""bricked"" (the dough should be rigid enough as to be removed from the pan with one spatula).

"Never ending soup; is it actually safe?","35171","","<p>In the poor student or youth worker days it was popular to have never ending soup; a large pot on the stove that was topped up with new and leftover ingredients when available.</p>

<p>Normally the pot was stored in the fridge overnight.</p>

<p>Food items added were sometimes plate leftovers from fellow flat (share house) mates, who would in turn be eating the soup, too.</p>

<p>Most days other ingredients would be fresh(ish) vegetables, beans, grains, and fresh meat products sourced from the local butcher as money allowed.</p>

<p>Brussels sprouts where banned, and so were strong spices (you added those to your bowl before serving).</p>

<p>Also, for irony, a large (cleaned) stone is always left in the pot.</p>

<p>Fresh bread was sometimes baked in the oven while cracked bones were browning, but the oven was often an electrical and environmental death trap.</p>

<p>The pot kept going till the summer holidays, and no one got food poisoning in my time, or from any student stories I have ever heard.</p>

<p>This sort of activity is recorded in history as being a popular resource-saving idea.</p>

<p>Are there any real food safety implications with this method of cooking? And have any actual studies of this technique ever been published?</p>

<p>I still recommend this money-saving idea to current students, not keen on bad practices being continued though.</p>
","<p>It takes quite a while for a pot of hot soup to cool down to 40°F in the fridge. Several hours, sometimes, depending on the shape of the pot and the volume of soup. If you're heating and re-chilling the same soup daily, it's going to spend a lot of time in the danger zone. From a safety perspective, you'd be much better off making a pot of soup every few days and then reheating just the portion that you're actually going to eat.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Soup <em>is</em> a great food for stretching a dollar, but I don't see how it's any more expensive to make a fresh pot twice a week and it shouldn't take much time either. I understand that you were adding scraps each night, but you could as easily save those scraps for a day or two until you make the next pot of soup.</p>

"What can I use to substitute apple juice in a preparation of ribs?","35169","","<p>I am using a quick prep of ribs on a UV grill (that doesn't really hold a temp under 300'F; qed, no long slow cooking).

","<p>In all honesty, I think that apple juice is just a euphemistic way of saying sugar-water.
The braising happens due to the sugar content mostly, which is why it doesn't really matter what type of juice it is (citrus excluded).
The flavour of the apple juice will be almost completely lost during cooking, so you don't need to worry about it too much.</p>

"Baking in gas oven does not brown the top","35008","","<p>I need advice from those who bake in gas oven without fan. I bake on the middle rack and have an oven thermometer(my oven is -20 deg off). My cakes get baked darker on bottom and paler on top. Cookies can get burnt at bottom if I wait for them to change color on top. The result is that the cookies, puff pastry are not crisp, the sheet cakes are sticky on touch when they cool down.
Really need advice from those who had faced and overcome this. Many thanks!</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: What I really want to know is how to increase the top heat? The cake or pastry is getting baked faster at bottom but since top heat is less though the cake rises fine it does not get browned on top. If I wait longer for it to brown it starts getting burned at bottom.</p>
","<p>This is an issue I've had to come to terms with myself. I spent most of my catering life spoilt by having massive fan assisted electric ovens with space for 24 trays at once. Then one day I left it all behind to work in a tiny 2 chef kitchen where all we had was a bottom heated gas oven. The first 6 months was a nightmare. It's still not easy even to this day but I'll share a couple of tricks me and my colleague have found.</p>

<p>Its all about the air flow:</p>

<p>Forget about the middle shed for baking it's useless. It's there for roast joints and ... Stuff. Get your baked goods on the top shelf. The reason you are not getting browned tops is all the heat is hitting the bottom of your tray, by the time it reaches the top of your oven and bounces back down to your food it's no where near the temperature required.</p>

<p>In order to help cushion the bottoms of your food and direct the heat towards the top you need to put a tray lightly large then the tray you are cooking on, on the shelf below. You can add water to this tray for bread and Yorkshire puddings as the steam helps regulate the heat also, but when cooking pastries I find it makes the pastry more likely to split and crack. </p>

<p>Locate the thermostat in your oven. In ours it's at the top right, in the middle. Always ensure there is sufficient space around it for the heat to hit it. If it's blocked in anyway you'll find the oven just keeps pumping heat out. It'll be 300c at the bottom but the thermostat will still think it 100c. </p>

<p>Sometimes you will find the tops are now cooking perfectly but the bottoms are a little less done. At that point you will be safe to either move the food down a shelf to help crisp the bottoms or if making scones you can safely flip them over just to finish off. </p>

<p>Good luck. </p>

"How does lemon juice ""cook"" meat?","34895","","<p>Various meats can be ""cooked"" using lemon juice. But how does lemon juice actually ""cook"" the meat?</p>
","<p>Let's start with a definition of <em>cooking</em>.</p>

<p>The Oxford English Dictionary defines <em>to cook</em> as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To prepare or make ready (food); to make fit for eating by due application of heat, as by boiling, baking, roasting, broiling, etc. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, from a chemical point of view, what happens when you are cooking meat is that you are using heat, amongst other things, to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denaturation_%28biochemistry%29"">denature</a> the proteins of the meat.
Denaturation can also be achieved by other means, such as marinating the meat in an acid, such as citric acid (contain in lemon juice) or acetic acid (contained in vinegar).</p>

<p>You can also use other agents to induce denaturation, but they are not always fit for eating.</p>

<p>However, it is important to understand that from a purely cooking perspective the two things are not the same: ""cooking"" with lemon (I guess it is fine to use the verb <em>to cook</em> as long as you put it in quotes), gives a completely different result than cooking with heat. This is because other chemical reactions happen during application of heat and because, obviously, you do not end up with an hot product!</p>

Since I don't use it very often, it becomes hardened.  My work-around is to use a grater to grate it but it would be useful to avoid the problem in the first place.</p>

<p>How should I store it to prevent hardening? Do I put it in the freezer? If so, does it need to come to room temperature before using it?</p>
","<p>Storing brown sugar in a tightly sealed container (such as tupperware, rubbermaid, etc.) is the best method.</p>

<p>Once it dries out however it can be re-moisturized by placing a piece of apple or bread with it inside a tightly sealed container.  After a day or two the brown sugar will soften and the bread will dry up or the apple will shrivel.</p>

<p>This is due to the hygroscopic nature(ability to absorb moisture from the surrounding atmosphere)of brown sugar. </p>

<p>You'll see ""brown sugar keepers"" in gourmet and cookware shops that are round decorative unglazed ceramic or terra cotta disks.  The concept is to soak them in water for an hour or two and then dry and place in the brown sugar.  Save your money and use a piece of bread or apple when the brown sugar is drying up.</p>

<p>You can also soften it for immediate use by microwaving for a little bit.  This should only be used for immediate use because after the sugar cools it will have lost more moisture (due to the fact that microwaves are heating the moisture in food).</p>

<li>All but the Twin Cermax line are X50CrMoV15 steel, hardened to 54-56 HRC (some reports say up to 57 Rockwell C).  This means they're slightly softer than Wusthof (which now hardens many of their products to 58 HRC), but less brittle.</li>
<li><strong>Twin Cermax uses special, superhard (66 HRC) MC66 steel, meaning they take a sharper edge and hold it MUCH longer than the other lines</strong>.

</ul>

<p>The microserrated blades aid in slicing, but hurt the ability to chop and mince.  They WILL help retain a cutting edge longer, but also cannot be sharpened normally.  </p>

<p>Edit:
Personally, I've not been impressed by Henckels knives.  Wusthof knives strike me as better quality at a similar price, and Victorinox is almost as good but a lot cheaper.  Why do I say this?  Well, Wusthof blades aren't as thick and unwieldy as Henckels, and they harden the steel to 58 Rockwell, so it takes a better edge. Victorinox is comparable hardness to Henckels, but about half the price, and the shapes of the blades just seem so perfect, with a deeper belly to slice thick items, and awesome grippy Fibrox handles.</p>

<p>Edit 2: 5 March 2016  - Henckels appears to have moved to a 57-58 HRC steel standard now for many of their blades, and switched to a narrower 15 degree bevel.  This means they are capable of finer cuts, but the edges may be a tad more fragile. Twin Profection is now 60 HRC. This means that steel-on-steel, the knives should now be competitive with Wusthof. The Twin Signature and International Forged Classic still use the inferior 53-55 HRC steels. Victorinox has also raised the prices on their Fibrox-handled knives.  Personal opinion, they're still a much better value than Henckels, but Henckels may be more competitive with Wusthof now.</p>

What's the best way to store it?</p>

<p>I know vinegar will keep for a long time, but the reduction tastes so sweet and so not vinegary that I have no faith that preservation is related. </p>
","<p>It should last years. If the reduction contains just vinegar, reduced until thick. This yields a very acidic solution very high in sugar (partly caramelized, depending on how long it was cooked). Other than sugar and acetic acid, there are some polyphenols and other gunk, some aromatics, and a bit of water.</p>

<p>There are two primary ways that food spoils: decay by microorganisms and oxidation. Decay happens when things get stinky and slimy, such as meat that has been left in a warm place for a few days. Bacteria can live in a lot of habitats, but need fairly mild conditions to thrive. Oxidation occurs when unsaturated fats (and other substances) pick up rogue chemicals from the environment, and is often refereed to as 'rancid'. This process will occur whenever something that can oxidize is exposed to air, but tends to progress slowly.</p>

<p>In the case of a balsamic reduction, the high acid and sugar content will stop bacterial growth. Since the reduction also contains acid, anything that could have been oxidized has already oxidized. Therefore a balsamic reduction should last pretty much forever. You might want to seal it up to keep bugs from getting in it, but other than that, it should be stable for years.</p>

"Induction range vs gas","34800","","<p>In the next few months I have a kitchen remodel planned. One item to be replaced is the range/oven. Currently we have a ""vintage"" electric stove.</p>

<p>I am undecided as to whether to choose gas or an induction model. I had gas in a previous house and I really liked it. However, I have reservations about combustion gases and unhealthy effects on air quality. I have heard <strong>great</strong> things about induction ranges, but my biggest reservation there is that I'll need to replace a fair bit of cookware. Personally, I have no experience using induction.</p>

<p>My question is mainly directed at those who have used both induction and gas, but if you've used either that's ok as well. <strong>So, given a choice between induction or gas, which would you choose?</strong> </p>

<p>P.S. - Not sure if this should be a community wiki, but if so I'm good with that.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
I was hoping to hear from someone who uses an induction range. The <em>ideal</em> answer would be something like, ""I've used gas and induction and when I bought a new range I bought ""x"" and here's why"". Anyway it's not an ideal world...</p>

<p>My issue is that I have used gas for cooking and know lots of others who do as well. I have one friend who used an induction range in a vacation home, and her take was that she hated it at first, but then came to like it. Another friend has a countertop induction burner, but he's not a cook as he just uses it to boil water. The thing is that induction ranges are not very common in the U.S. or at least among people I know.</p>

<p>So, to refine what I'm interested in.... If you are an avid cook, and have used an induction system, ""Is it responsive?"", ""Is it controllable, in that say, you can set a burner at 180 and it'll stay there?"", ""Is it durable and easy to clean?"".</p>

<p>Also, my reservation about replacing cookware pretty much went away. I found flooring materials through salvage for less than half of what I expected to pay. That pretty much opened up my budget if I decide to go with induction rather than gas.</p>

<p>Finally, what I really need to do is find a way to test drive an induction range. I'll be checking in with some local shops to see if there is a way to accomplish that. </p>

<p><em>And by the way, I have of course googled on this.</em></p>

<p>Thanks for the input so far.</p>

<p><em><strong>Another Update</strong></em></p>

<p>I was hoping to get more comparative <em>experience</em> in using gas and induction. I suppose I didn't get much of that because induction ranges do not have wide usage in the U.S. market. </p>

<p>I <em>know</em> that I generally like cooking on gas ranges. My main concern with gas is indoor air pollution. Somewhere among my bookmarks is an article about particulate matter and CO generated by gas ranges. </p>

<p>On the other hand, I really like some of the things I've read about induction ranges. Efficiency, safety, control, etc. </p>

<p>My final decision on what I actually wind up purchasing is down the road a bit. Hopefully, I'll get to ""test drive"" an induction range in the meantime.</p>
","<p>We have recently remodelled our kitchen and moved from a gas hob to an induction hob. In general it cooks much the same as gas and you get similar levels of control over the temperature. One style of cooking that is not recommended is 'slide' cooking as this will likely scratch your hob surface - this can be mitigated by putting a piece of parchment paper under the pan or lifting the pan off the hob. we don't use a wok and can't see how we could with our hob.</p>

<p>The surface of the hob gets hot but not as hot as it would it it were gas or electric this means that spilt / spattered food doesn't generally burn on to the hob surface and it is much easier to clean. </p>

<p>The hob is touch control and so far we've not had any problems with this. If you lift a pan off the heating zone it will switch itself off automagically after a certain amount of time. Before this happens if you put a pan back on the zone it carries on cooking. If there are no pans on any active zones then the whole thing switches off after 2 minutes.</p>

<p>We chose a NEFF Flushline hob that sits in a natural black granite work surface and the whole thing is positively beautiful and a pleasure to work with.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Tonight I cooked dinner, which involved sausages for me, and chicken drumsticks for my partner. The sausages went great, then I proceeded to add some more oil and start the chicken.</p>

<p>This is where my pain started. Soon after, the juices from the meat started coming out and caused the oil to spatter all over my arm. I'm only guessing that this is the cause, but it did seem related. I'm now sporting some minor oil burns and wondering if there's any way to reduce the spattering caused by the juices in the meat when cooking this way, as we both enjoy the taste.</p>
","<p>While the above suggestions would get rid of the oil splatter problem, they would also result in overcooked meat with a soggy exterior, as all the water created during frying (for example, chicken releases a lot of juice) would remain in the pan and steam the meat instead of frying it. </p>

<p>Your best bet is to get something called a splatter screen. I've seen one at <a href=""http://www.ikea.com/au/en/catalog/products/10165849/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ikea</a></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SGeJq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>, and at walmart, and I would assume kitchen supply stores would carry it too. A splatter screen is basically a fine metal mesh lid with a handle that fits over a variety of pans/pots and while it allows the steam to escape it also prevents the oil from splattering everywhere by catching in it the fine mesh. The best $10 you'll ever spend.</p>

"Does milk tenderize meat?","34240","","<p>In <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/11733/anyone-for-milk-soaked-minced-beef"">another question</a> I suggested that milk might be used as a tenderizer. That generated an amount of scepticism, so I think it is worth breaking the question out.</p>

<p>The idea came from ""The New Best Recipe"" which has a small section entitled ""SCIENCE: Why Does Milk Make Meat Tender?"". I'll repeat a little of what it says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""...if you skip the browning and cook the meat in milk (or any other liquid) at the outset, you limit the temperature of the meat to around 212 degrees. [...] As a result, meat cooked in milk does not dry out...""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I follow the argument correctly --and I'm really not sure that I do-- this means that milk has no advantage over water as a tenderizer!</p>

<p>Can anyone unravel this confusion? Does milk tenderize meat?</p>
","<p>The paragraph you quoted is utter nonsense.</p>

<p>Milk contains absolutely no factors which will tenderize anything. Tenderization is a process whereby protein strands are broken down, resulting in shorter strands, resulting in a more tender product. A lot of substances and physical processes will tenderize, to a greater or lesser extent, sometimes subject to other factors: acids, bromelain, a similar compound found in mango, physically pounding the meat, etc. Milk is none of those things.</p>

<p>Further, simply limiting the cooking temperature to under 212F/100C will not, in fact, guarantee a tender and moist result. To see this for yourself, boil a chicken breast in water or milk for a while. It will never go over the boiling point of water, but if you leave it too long? Dry, nasty chicken.</p>

<p>As Mike said in his answer, <em>braising</em> will result in a more tender end product; the length of cooking time plus the liquid medium helps to moderate the temperature and cook the protein very, very slowly. This retains more moisture within the product, and prevents protein strands from bunching up very tightly (which, really, is the same thing: protein strands force water out of meat as they constrict; prevent or ameliorate the constriction and you will have much moister and more tender meat). It is also worth noting that braising is always done at significantly below boiling temperatures; one braises at a simmer at most, more in the 60-80C range. </p>

<p>Milk <em>is</em> often used with certain proteins due to its facility in absorbing unpleasant odours or flavours. Liver is the classic example, but milk is also often used with sweetbreads and fish (amongst other things) to help draw off the funkier aromas before cooking. I do not know the specific scientific mechanism behind why this works; I suspect it is something to do with the fat molecules in the milk itself, which suggests that any fatty liquid would have the same effect.</p>

Would it be better to transfer the dough to a glass or plastic bowl to rise instead?</p>

<p>(Note: I've done this often and my dough does rise, I just wondered if it might rise more if it wasn't in a metal bowl.)</p>
","<p>Your metal bowl sitting in your 70°F room is 70°F (at least, if its been sitting there for a bit). Your plastic bowl, or glass bowl, or ceramic bowl, or any other bowl sitting in the same room is also 70°F. They're all actually the same temperature.</p>

<p>Now, given, when you touch the metal bowl, it feels cooler than the plastic one. This is because your finger isn't 70°F, and your body heat is transferred away quicker by metal than (say) plastic.</p>

<p>If the dough is room temperature, it won't matter—heat isn't flowing out of it. The dough itself doesn't generate much heat. If your dough started above room temperature, it will cool a little quicker in a metal bowl. But, if you wanted to keep it from cooling, putting it in a warm place is much more effective.</p>

<p>A stainless steel bowl is fine. I'd avoid aluminum (and copper, if anyone makes a mixer with such a thing) due to them being reactive, especially if you're making sourdough.</p>

"How much water does pasta absorb when it is cooked?","34089","","<p>How much water will dry semolina pasta absorb when it is properly cooked?  For example, how much water would one pound of farfalle or spaghetti absorb?</p>

<p>I am guessing the shape of the pasta doesn't matter, just the absolute weight.</p>

<p>I am not looking for how much water is required to boil it, nor what temperature is required, just how much should be absorbed.  I like my pasta cooked a minute or so past the box ""al dente"" stage.</p>

<p>The application is single burner cooking (I only have one available).   I can make the sauce, then add additional water and pasta to cook directly in the sauce, making for only one burner being required, and only a single pot to clean.</p>

<p>I understand the actual amount will require due to the vagaries of how much evaporates, but I expect that to be a minor adjustment.</p>
","<p>You need 1.1x as much water as pasta for al dente! I measured this myself, cooking penne rigate (in water, not sauce) - 200g of pasta weighed 420g after being cooked and thoroughly drained.</p>

<p>The estimate below from the nutrition facts is 1.4x, which probably corresponds to typical American overcooked pasta - a surprisingly large difference from mine. I'm guessing you'll be somewhere between, maybe 1.25x.</p>

<hr>

<p>You can also ballpark it from nutrition facts. <a href=""http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5798/2"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cooked spaghetti</a> has 31g carbs per 100g pasta, and <a href=""http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5779/2"" rel=""noreferrer"">dry spaghetti</a> has 75g carbs per 100g pasta. So 100g dry pasta turns into 100g*75/31 = 242g of cooked pasta, meaning the added water was ~1.4x the weight of the pasta. So for a pound of pasta, that's 1.4 pounds or about 2&nbsp;2/3 cups of water. Given people's tastes, this might be a little past al dente, so I would personally start with maybe 1.25 cups of water then add a little more if necessary. (I'll also try cooking pasta normally and weighing it if I get a chance.)</p>

<p>Note: if you have a significantly different variety of pasta, it will obviously behave differently. This is for pasta that's 13% protein and 75% carbohydrates. For the standard 2oz/56g (dry) serving on the package, it'll say 7g protein and 41-42g carbohydrates. I checked Barilla, De Cecco, Ronzonni, Garofalo, Safeway store brand, Trader Joe's store brand, and those nutrition facts, and they all matched. If you're branching out to other styles like whole grains or egg noodles, things will obviously change, but things are <em>very</em> uniform in the US.</p>

","<p>Cook the pancetta on a large pan, so that it fries in its own fat. It must turn red, but don't cook it too much as you are going to cook it a bit more later on.</p>

<p>Open two eggs. If you like the color of the carbonara intense, throw one white away, and keep one white and two yolks. Put them in a bowl, then add grated parmigiano and mix with a fork. The amount of parmesan should be at least the same volume of the eggs, maybe even more (twice does not hurt). This will give you a rather firm but still flowing compound. Firm is better than too liquid.</p>

<p>Cook the pasta. Spaghetti is the norm for carbonara, but also penne is a good choice. Get them ""al dente"" or some second later, as you prefer. Drain the pasta and put it in the pan you used to cook the pancetta (where the pancetta still is). Pour the egg/cheese mix on top of the pasta and put the pan on gentle heat, while you continue moving and mixing. Detach any layer of cooked egg from the bottom of the pan while you mix. The perfect carbonara must not be liquid, and it must not be clumpy solid, so <strong>keep mixing</strong> or you will get a pasta omelette.</p>

<p>Once you are done, turn off the heat, and take spaghetti up with a large fork, so to disentangle them while you transfer them on the dishes. move them in the dish with a small oscillating movement to disentangle a bit more. Continue like this for all the dishes you have to serve. At the end you will have the pancetta remaining in the pan, and you put it on top of each dish. </p>

<p>Add more grated parmigiano and some ground black pepper and eat as soon and hot as possible !</p>

"Is ""until juices run clear"" a valid test for poultry doneness?

Poultry is sufficiently cooked when the juices run clear, not red or pink.</p>

<p>In recent months and years, as I've grown more interested in and knowledgeable about the science of cooking, I've learned to be skeptical of such simplistic claims.  This one is repeated <em>everywhere</em> - even the <a href=""http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/foodsafe/foodhandl.html"">Ontario Ministry of Health</a> says it - but I've also run across various <a href=""http://www.foodpoisonjournal.com/2009/07/articles/food-poisoning-watch/cook-until-juices-run-clear-is-bad-food-safety-advice/"">claims that it is dangerous advice</a>.</p>

<p>What I'd like to know is this:</p>

<p><strong>What does it <em>actually</em> mean - chemically or biologically speaking - when poultry juices run clear?  Is it actually a reliable indicator that the food is safe to eat?</strong></p>

<p>P.S. I am quite well aware that the way one is <em>supposed</em> to test for doneness is to use a thermometer and ensure that the internal temperature has reached 165° F / 74° C.  I always do this, but thermometers can break, run out of battery, etc., so I think it is still helpful to know if the juice test is ever a viable alternative.  But most importantly I am interested in understanding <em>what is happening</em> to the meat that causes the juices to change colour, and under what other conditions this can happen.</p>
","<p>Chicken juices contain a soupy mix of proteins including haemoglobin (which gives blood its red colour when mixed with oxygen), and some myoglobin (which gives red meat its red colour when mixed with oxygen). Up to about 140F, they are unchanged, but heat them to between 140F and 160F and they lose their ability to bind oxygen and so their colours change. So if your juices are running clear, you know the temperature is at least higher then 140F and probably closer to 160F if they are indeed clear.</p>

<p>The question of what is 'doneness' is an interesting one. For most foods, doneness is a question of taste. After years of eating my chicken at 'at least 140F', I really like that taste. We usually cook foods to improve their taste, texture, nutritional value; very few foods traditionally kill or harm us if they are not cooked (cassava, certain beans are notable exceptions). Heating to 165F is recommended not for taste but to kill organisms such as salmonella - a tricky blighter that lives <em>inside</em> the cells of some other creatures and so can't be washed or peeled off.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that I'm the first generation cook in my family to own an instant-read probe digital food thermometer, so why is this now necessary? Well I may also be the first generation where salmonella in store-bought chicken is considered a saleable product and something to be cooked out by heat, rather than designed out by good farming and food handling practice. The 165F statement from food safety bodies was brought in to deal with such issues.</p>

<p>In France, there are still plenty of people who like their chicken <em>very</em> pink. With my own grown chickens, I will cook them till a skewer pierced into the deepest part of the thigh (but not near the bone), shows clear juices and on deep-breasted old breeds that can leave a tinge of pink towards the bottom of a (deliciously juicy) breast. I'm personally comfortable with that particular risk/reward balance.</p>

I made some chicken and some quesadillas on a particular pan.  However, my parents got back and my mom is astounded to find the pan all dirty with oil still sticking to the pan.  I washed it with soap, so why is it still sticking???  It is like it is embedded into the pan.  Not sure what happened!  Anybody knows?  I am also unsure about the type of pan it is.  At this rate, I'll be buying new pans every so and so months if I lived alone.  :(  I wonder if it has anything to do with cooking food in a not so high temperature?</p>
","<p>As I understand it, when you combine high heat and vegetable oil you get a fairly stable polymer (much like a plastic or resin).  The polymer bonds with the surface (which is porous), and results in robust surface. This is what we use to season cast iron cookware, but it's less desirable on stainless and other lighter colour hardware.</p>

<p>You can prevent the coating from forming by never allowing he oil to maintain a high temperature for long periods by itself.  Keeping food in contact with the pan will both help keep the temperature down, and reduce the chance of the oil bonding with the steel.</p>

<p>Cleaning the oil off once it's formed is usually pretty simple: add water (or soda water) and heat for 10-15 minutes. Often the oil will wipe out (or need mild scrubbing with an appropriate scrubbing pad).  You should not have to use steel wool (or a caustic cleaner), both of which can damage the smooth surface of many pans.</p>

"Why put cinnamon in chili?","33941","","<p>We had an office chili cook-off recently (I didn't enter). Two of the chili recipes presented used cinnamon predominately, perhaps even overpoweringly (IMO). Given that they also heavily sweetened their chili with honey and sugar, both had a cinnamon dessert flavor profile mixed with a bland tomato/beef profile. In a word, ""yuck!""</p>

<p>In searching today, I've seen several recipes around calling for the use of cinnamon in chili. I could see it maybe being a background flavoring to add a mild spicy bite and a touch of earthiness. But, some recipes seem to be pretty heavy in it's use.</p>

<p>I'm assuming the office cooks didn't develop the right flavor (unless going for a dessert chili was their objective). What kind of flavor profile would be the right one to develop when using cinnamon in chili?</p>
","<p>Cinnamon adds a different spice profile than chili powder or red or cayenne pepper would. It is a common savory spice in Indian food and I believe it's also used in savory dishes in Chinese cooking. It's a very versatile spice :).</p>

<p>We also use cocoa powder in our chili as it provides a real depth of flavor (dark bitter flavors which are quite good in chili). </p>

<p>Both of these add some curiosity and difference to the chili without themselves adding sweetness. Usually they get added as a fairly safe way to add something ""different"" to standard chili.</p>

"Peeling and dicing potato before boiling it","33920","","<p>I've mostly seen people peel a potato after it has been boiled and then cutting it to pieces if required. Given it's muddy exterior, I find it cleaner (and probably takes less heat) to remove the skin with a peeler before boiling. Am I losing anything when I use my method? What do you suggest?</p>
","<p>A lot of us just eat the peel, but assuming you don't want to...</p>

<p>Certainly it's going to be a lot <em>faster</em> to boil a potato that's already been cut up than to boil a whole one, so between boiling whole and peeling, dicing, then boiling, I'd certainly pick the latter. It doesn't really have much to do with cleanliness, though; a good washing leaves the peel plenty clean and safe (and like I said, I eat it). You're not losing anything with your method, besides the nutritional value of the peel.</p>

<p>I imagine the reason a lot of people boil their potatoes whole is to be able to peel them without a peeler. You could sort of have it both ways. If you partially cut the potato (thick slices, probably), you could boil them in not much longer than it'd take to boil small cubes, then peel the slices by hand, and cut further if necessary. Not sure it'd really save you a ton of time, but if your peeler is dull/broken/missing/stolen, it'd be a decent fallback. (You could probably also partially boil them whole, peel, chop, then finish cooking, but that's starting to sound like it just makes more work.)</p>

It came out really well, except that the meat was very tough.</p>

<p>I bought the meat pre-cut as ""stew meat,"" as recommended by the guy at the meat counter at the supermarket, and thus not specifically chuck roast. I bought it last weekend, expecting to prepare it that day, but plans changed, so I didn't prepare it until now.</p>

<p>I covered the meat (~1 lbs, cut up) with some white flour, then browned it until it was maybe 70% brown (a little red still visible), prepared the rest of the sauce, then let the sauce and meat simmer for an hour.</p>

<p>Did I brown the meat too fast?  Did letting it sit in the fridge for a couple days make it more tough?</p>
","<p>Supermarket 'stew beef' is notoriously unreliable.  Its often just scraps of beef that the butcher or market can't sell otherwise.  My stews were hit and miss for years while I tried to tweak cooking time and such. But then one day I watched a movie on rouxbe.com (paywall, sorry) and they talked about not using 'stew beef' - its often too lean and doesn't have the 'stuff' to produce tender, but juicy bits.

<p>So, why didn't my potato wedges turn out crispy? Is there a trick that I've missed or an error I've made?</p>
","<p>By frying your potatoes then putting the lid on, you fried your potatoes <em>then steamed them</em>, so it's no wonder they weren't crispy. Although it takes longer, par-boiling the potatoes first is <em>by far</em> the best way to get crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside potatoes.</p>

<p>Par-boiling cooks the inside of the potato, so that all you need to do in the pan is crisp the outside.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cut your potatoes however you like. Place them in a pan of cold, salted water and bring to the boil. Boil for 5-10 minutes depending on how waxy your potato is (floury potatoes don't hold together as well).</li>
<li>Drain the potatoes into a colander and let them dry out for 5 minutes. Then give them a shake in the colander to fluff the outside of the potatoes - the fluffy bits will catch and crisp up beautifully. At this stage you can dust your wedges with flour or semolina for extra crispy results. You can also add spices and seasoning.</li>
<li>Heat a large frying pan over medium heat and add plenty of oil - about 5mm depth. When the oil is hot, carefully add the potatoes - consider frying in batches if your pan isn't big enough.</li>
<li>Fry the potatoes until golden and crispy.</li>

"What is the white dust on red grapes?","33836","","<p>I bought some red grapes, and they have a thin layer of white dust on them. What is this? It has no flavor and seems to be harmless, but sources differ on what exactly it is, so if anyone has an authoritative source, I'd be interested to find out. </p>
","<p>This <a href=""http://www.tablegrape.com/foodservice/terms.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">coating</a>, which wipes right off and is indeed harmless, is called the ""bloom"" of the grape or sometime the ""blush"". As described <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_in_winemaking"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, (the wiki for Fermentation in winemaking), it contains trace amounts of natural yeast, though thought to be the result of <em>ambient</em> yeast rather than the result of growth process proper.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.chow.com/food-news/53503/whats-that-white-stuff-on-grapes/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here</a> we find a more thorough answer,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s mostly harmless wax, says Kay Bogart, a winemaker who works in
  outreach for the University of California at Davis’s viticulture
  program. The grape plant produces it to protect the berries from
  moisture loss. It’s also often just plain old dust, adds Jim LaMar, a
  professor of wine sensory evaluation at California State University,
  Fresno. Until recently, winemakers believed the white stuff was
  yeasts, responsible for wine fermentation. Now they believe such
  yeasts are airborne. In any case, that white stuff isn’t pesticide
  residue. Which is not to say that there isn’t pesticide residue on the
  grape, so wash it anyway before you pop it into your mouth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the book <em>Caravaggio: A Life Sacred and Profane</em> by Andrew Graham-Dixon, we find of Roman mythology the following statement regarding Bacchus, the ancient god of wine and intoxication,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bloom on the grapes, which dusts them with a layer of whiteness
  and dulls the reflected light caught in their opalescent skins, is
  echoed by the dry and whitish lips of the god himself.</p>

"How long does it take botulism spores to germinate in the fridge?","33815","","<p>Based on <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/18632/are-the-claims-legitimate-linking-botulism-to-vacuum-prepared-foods"">this question</a>, I started wondering how long I could keep an anerobic food in the fridge before I have to worry about botulism colonization.  1 day?  3 days?  2 months?  Clearly it's not a short period of time (hours) or we'd all be dying of botulism poisoning by now.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, nothing I've been able to find on the net seems to be based on solid studies of germination times.  So, if I put a pre-prepared sous vide packet in the fridge, or homemade garlic oil, a low-acid sauce, or lemon curd, or similar, when do I have to toss it to be safe?</p>
","<p>This completely depends on all of the <em>other</em> factors involved in botulinum growth, not to mention the particular strain you're concerned about (there are several).</p>

<p>Salt, acidity (low pH), low moisture, and extreme temperature (low or high) will all slow botulinum growth significantly.</p>

<p>There are <em>proteolytic</em> and <em>non-proteolytic</em> types of bacteria. The proteolytic <em>C.botulinum</em> bacteria will <em>never</em> grow in the refrigerator - they cannot grow at temperatures below 12° C <sup><a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/10/101003081927.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">source</a></sup>. The non-proteolytic strains can grow at temperatures as low as 3° C. That is <em>very</em> close to refrigerator temperature so clearly they will grow very slowly - again, the exact speed depends on other factors - but they will grow.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/foodnut/09305.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">other sources</a>, the proteolytic strains (the ones that cannot grow in the fridge) are the ones that tend to produce gas and off-odours, so they'll be more easily detectable. They also have far lower heat resistance, so they are easier to cook away. But of course, if they've grown to a sufficient level, it's too late to do that.</p>

<p>As far as I know, there aren't specific guidelines for vacuum-packed foods, whether commercially packed or simply cooked sous-vide. I'd ask you to consider that botulism is not the only type of foodborne illness that can grow in the refrigerator. There's also <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm079667.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">listeria</a>, <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1968.tb09092.x/abstract"" rel=""noreferrer"">salmonella</a>, and possibly some others I'm forgetting about. Cooking (especially sous-vide cooking) doesn't kill every last one of them, just enough to make the food safe. By the way, listeria and salmonella are both <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facultative_anaerobic_organism"" rel=""noreferrer"">facultative anaerobes</a> which means that they can grow with <em>or</em> without air.</p>

<p>There's also the small matter of your actual refrigerator temperature. Although the theoretical temperature (4° C) is lower than that required for all but the hardiest of bacteria, once you move up even a single degree to 5° C there are <em>many</em> more kinds that can start to grow.  How cold is your fridge, really? I've heard of some being as high as 10-12° C in parts! If your fridge temperature is even slightly high, botulism will be the least of your worries.</p>

<p>Honestly, given the incredibly tiny number of actual documented cases of botulism (<a href=""http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/10/9/03-0745_article.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">less than a dozen per year in the U.S.</a>) compared to the insanely high total number of food poisoning cases every year (<a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29285754/ns/health-food_safety/t/food-poisoning-strikes-americans-year/#.TqxpO977ZMo"" rel=""noreferrer"">1 in 4</a> according to some sources), people seem to place <em>far</em> too much emphasis on that particular species. I realize that it's one of the scariest on account of that whole ""instant death"" thing, but even if you could prove that your improperly-stored food is 100% free of botulism toxin, you could still get seriously ill from eating it. You're literally worrying about the <em>least</em> probable vector for food poisoning.</p>

<p>Bottom line, I'd strongly advise you to treat sous-vide food just like any other food in terms of food safety and freeze it if you plan to store it longer than 4-5 days. There are just too many variables at play to conclusively say otherwise.</p>

<li>Is there a problem with letting it cook in the fat?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Make sure you use a pan with high enough sides so that fat doesn't overflow. If it's a thin baking sheet with only short edges, especially one that tends to curve/warp in the oven, you could easily dump fat all over the bottom of the oven. But as long as it's a sturdy pan, the fat isn't going to get any higher than the beef itself started out (except for splattering), so if the beef itself all fits in with a bit of space at the top, you'll be fine. If it seems like you're cutting it close, split it into two batches.</p>

<p>Make sure also not to cover <em>too</em> tightly; you want steam to be able to escape. You want it to be covered well enough to keep fat from splattering everywhere, and to keep it from drying out fast and burning on the top or bottom, but you also don't want all the water to get stuck in there until it boils over.</p>

<p>Letting it cook in the fat is really just a personal preference. If you want the final result to be super lean and maybe a bit dry, don't do it; if you want to keep it moist and juicy and don't mind some fat, cooking it in the fat is good for it.</p>

<hr>

<p>For food safety issues...</p>

<p>All that matters is what temperature the beef reaches. The <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/HealthEducators/ucm082294.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">FDA recommends</a> that it reach 160F. You don't really need a thermometer to check in this case, though: if it's all obviously brown it's fine.</p>

<p>So, yes, that general idea is probably safe, but I wouldn't try to pin the time down now. Just put it in the oven and check periodically until it's done. Exactly how long it takes will depend on how thick the beef is in the pan (i.e. how big the pan is).</p>

Most of the techniques I've seen involve oil and salt and cooking that for a bit and then wiping it out. Is this necessary? Do I need to do it every time I use the pan? Are there other techniques that you folks use? I had never heard  of this for stainless steel, but I want to make sure I'm taking care of the pan correctly.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>I've never heard of doing anything other than giving it a good cleaning, as you would with any new item before first use.</p>

<p>I've only heard of seasoning used for cast iron and carbon steel, not for stainless steel.  Looking online, I did find <a href=""http://www.overstock.com/guides/How-to-Season-Stainless-Steel-Pans"">instructions for seasoning stainless steel</a>, but I'd be inclined to look at the paperwork that came with the pan -- if the manufacturer recommends doing something, follow their instructions.  If they don't, just give it a good wash.</p>

"How can I prepare left over Stir Fry for the fridge?","33484","","<p>I like making Stir Fry and I've tried several times to make two meal's worth so I can refrigerate half and take it to work, but so far every attempt has been sub-bar. It's veggie stir fry and I use a variety of sauces (most of which involve soy sauce) and a little vegetable oil.</p>

<p>The problem is mostly the sauce; I can't seem to drain it out, so it builds up at the bottom and gets nasty, or at the least it smells very strongly by the next day. I can't strain out the liquid from the bottom of my Wok very well and even after separating out the portion to be refrigerated I can't quite strain it; the sauce is there but just thick enough to not drain off.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to properly drain out the excess sauce or is there some method I can use to make sure the extra portion is edible, at least for a day? I know it's not going to be half as good, but it's completely inedible after a night in the fridge.</p>
","<p>I make stir fry all the time and do the same thing as you. I would make extra, enough for 2 - 3 meals. </p>

<p>The thing I do to prevent the vegetables from getting too mushy in the refrigerator is by cooking the stirfry about 75%(I make sure if I am doing this that the meat is fully cooked first) and then take out the portion that I intend to refrigerate. This allows me to either finish cooking it in the microwave if I am taking it to work or reheat it up in the stove if I am staying home.</p>

<p>Also since I am taking the portions from the upper part of the stirfry, there is less sauce that the vegetables will be steeping in so that should solve your problem of too much sauce.</p>

<p>Another thing you should remember is that the types of vegetables you use makes a big difference. If you choose all vegetables that turns really soft when cooked(onion, squash, peppers) then reheated stirfry using those vegetables will be not as unpalatable. The trick is to use a variety of textured vegetables. </p>

<p>Also I dont want to state the obvious but if your problem is your sauce, have you ever tried using a different(lighter) sauce recipe?</p>

"Glass Dish Baking Temparature","33470","","<p>Generally I have heard that most recipes are designed for baking in metal dishes. I have also heard that glass will get hotter than metal, and thus I should cook it at a lower temperature for longer.</p>

<p>Does anyone know whether these statements are true? Am I going to burn the edges if I leave it at the same temperature? What is the truth behind this?</p>
","<p><strong>First, the short answer:</strong></p>

<p>There's a lot of erroneous information circulating concerning glass bakeware, and very few reliable sources or repeatable experiments seem to be cited.  In general, I'd say that <strong>the variance among different metal pans of different materials, colors, thicknesses, and coatings will have more significant effects than the difference between glass and metal</strong>.  So, if you're someone who worries a lot about pan color or thickness and adjusts your oven up or down by a few degrees for it already, then yes, this may be a concern.  If you're someone who just assumes all metal baking pans are equivalent anyway, glass is not going to behave much differently -- I'd just say monitor your food when trying a new pan/dish, and adjust your time and temperature accordingly.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Now, the long answer:</strong></p>

<p>Part of the problem with comparing glass and metal is that there are so many differences:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Metal pans conduct heat faster than glass, which can change both how evenly the heat gets distributed throughout the pan and how fast things cook.  But this is mostly relevant when the pan is changing temperature (as when first put in the oven) or heated unevenly.</p></li>
<li><p>Metal pans can vary in color: darker pans will cook faster, while lighter or more reflective ones will cook more slowly.  Glass is generally transparent, which decreases some types of radiative heat from the pan color, but it also allows infrared light to pass through which increases radiative heat.</p></li>
<li><p>Metal pans are usually quite thin compared to glass.  Glass therefore heats up and cools down more slowly, so it will be less responsive to changes in baking temperatures.  (On the other hand, metal pans can also vary significantly in thickness, too.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these factors may be more or less relevant depending on your specific baking situation and recipe.  For example, if we take the last consideration from the list: if you're cooking something for a relatively short time, glass dishes may spend most of the baking time just warming up, which will affect browning and doneness on elements in contact with the pan.  But if you're baking a dish for a long time, this factor is less relevant, and the extra heat which is transmitted through the clear glass may actually cause food to cook faster.</p>

<p>There's a common rule-of-thumb passed along in many cooking sources that one should decrease the oven temperature by 25F when using a glass baking dish and perhaps decrease cooking time as well.  Other sources agree with the 25F decrease, but recommend that cooking time will be <em>increased</em>.  But I've seen no reliable source justifying when this is necessary or what exactly we are comparing the glass dish with!  If we're comparing glass to its closer cousin, a ceramic casserole dish, then yes, in many cases a glass dish may cook slightly faster due to the extra heat transmitted through the clear glass.  But it's much more complicated for comparisons to metal.  Harold McGee in <em>On Food and Cooking</em> seems at one point to lump glass together with light-colored dull metal pans in terms of overall baking properties, pointing out that both will transmit heat better than shiny metal pans and thus will cook (about 20%) faster.  But dark colored or black pans will increase browning and cooking even more.  I recall seeing a <em>Cooks Illustrated</em> test some time ago that basically claimed the oven temperature reduction for glass was generally unnecessary, but I don't recall the details (and can't find the reference now).</p>

<p>In terms of actual empirical data, well, there's <a href=""http://www.genuineideas.com/ArticlesIndex/browning.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this source</a> on browning, which baked dough for 15 minutes in four dishes of the same size but different colors and materials.  Glass here performed slower than a black pan or thin (shiny) aluminum, but faster than white ceramic.  But we can draw few conclusions from such a limited test, since (as I pointed out above) glass dishes take longer to heat up and would likely have performed differently in a longer bake.</p>

<p><strong>All of that said, I would offer a few general guidelines:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>If baking for a short time (say, less than 20-30 minutes), the lag-time in glass warming up will be significant.  Cooking may be somewhat slower for food in contact with the glass surface compared to a metal pan.  In a hot oven, it may be useful to <em>lower the oven temperature somewhat</em> and <em>cook longer</em> to allow the food in contact with the glass to ""catch up"" with the top of the food (which might otherwise brown faster).</p></li>
<li><p>When baking for longer times, glass will cook and brown somewhat faster than shiny metal pans, about as fast as dull (light) metal, but not as fast as dark metal pans.  In that case, you may want to make small adjustments in the same way as you might for different colored metal baking pans.</p></li>
<li><p>If baking a casserole or similar wet dish and using glass instead of opaque ceramic, it may cook and brown somewhat faster due to heat transmitted through the clear dish.</p></li>
<li><p>Glass will generally retain more heat when removed from the oven than metal pans, so baked goods or other food left in the glass dish will continue to cook somewhat longer.  In some circumstances, this may justify removing the dish from the oven when <em>slightly</em> underdone or else removing the contents (particularly baked goods) from the pan earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't think there's any truth to the general statement that glass <em>always</em> ""cooks faster.""  Lowering the oven temperature slightly may be a good idea if you are concerned about the top surface browning before the bottom in a particular recipe, but glass is not a unique material to do that for.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, I'd recommend just using other doneness indicators (internal temperature, browning, texture, firmness, etc.) to determine when your food is done.  The one nice thing about glass baking dishes is that you can view the food from many more angles, which can often give you information about how fast the dish is cooking on the bottom as well as the top -- and you can adjust oven temperature as needed to try to even things out.</p>

"How to know when chicken breast has cooked through?","33420","","<p>Sometimes chicken breast can be thick and I never know how to tell when it's cooked! How can I be certain it is cooked all the way through?</p>
","<p>A thermometer is the only way to be sure.</p>

<p>For methods with a consistent level of heat (stove, oven), you should able to learn the average cooking time, and outwards cues of color and texture that match the right internal temperature. Remember that these will vary with cooking method and temperature. Internally, the meat should look opaque and white.</p>

<p>These are CUES of doneness, not guarantees. Use the thermometer.</p>

"How long will fermented/brined pickles last?","33365","","<p>I've been interested in making some pickles, and a lot of the places I've found say that salt brined or fermented pickles generally taste better than acid-brined pickles. That is, pickles pickled in a saltwater brine taste better those pickled in vinegar. While that's subjective, it's still gotten me intrigued in saltwater brining some vegetables. </p>

<p>However, each of the sources I find give me a different estimate for how long they last in the fridge. Some say 1 week (too short, surely?) and some say up to 1 year (that seems <em>too</em> long...). So my question is, how long will a pickle last in its brine after being put into the fridge? </p>

<p>Edit: After some thinking, I guess it would depend on a lot of factors, but mostly the salinity of the water and the temperature of the fridge. Given that these are the most important factors (but I could be wrong!) if the temperature is <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/4529/what-temperatures-should-i-keep-my-refrigerator-and-freezer-set-at"">35 deg F in the ideal fridge</a>, how will salt content change how long the pickle will last?</p>
","<p>The short answer is <strong>1-2 years for traditional pickles</strong>, assuming a good recipe with adequate salt content and fermentation time (traditionally anywhere from a month to a few months).  For modern <strong>quick fermented</strong> homemade recipes, where the pickles are fermented in a <em>week or so</em> instead of months, I'd recommend using them up within <strong>a month or two</strong>.</p>

<p>Some representative sources (note the bolded bits about fermentation time):</p>

<ul>
<li>""Fermented or processed pickles also have a very long shelf-life, <strong>about two years</strong>."" (<a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=CvIl2k8jGgMC&amp;lpg=PA245&amp;ots=S0gpc0Mmc8&amp;dq=fermented%20pickles%20shelf%20life&amp;pg=PA245#v=onepage&amp;q=fermented%20pickles%20shelf%20life&amp;f=false"">source</a>)  </li>
<li>""FERMENTED PICKLES: The oldest method of pickling, when a naturally occurring bacteria transforms the sugars present in the ingredient into an acid, preserving the food. These are called 'processed' pickles, and though they take <strong>as many as five weeks to cure</strong>, <strong>they last up to 2 years</strong>."" (<a href=""http://www.nyfoodmuseum.org/_pkwhat.htm"">source</a>)  </li>
<li>""The product is completely <strong>fermented in 3-6 weeks</strong>.... In contrast to salt stock brining procedures [i.e., pickles removed from their liquid after fermentation and stored in a very heavily salted tank for future processing], genuine dill pickles do not require desalting and are often sold with the filtered fermentation liquor that is produced during the process.  The product must be consumed <strong>within 12 months</strong>."" (<a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=p-iy24GEE0wC&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=fermented%20pickles%20shelf%20life&amp;pg=PA172#v=onepage&amp;q=fermented%20pickles%20shelf%20life&amp;f=false"">source</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>While these are common estimates, many books on the subject won't even give such shelf-life estimates (e.g., Sandor Katz's <em>The Art of Fermentation</em>), because there is so much variability depending on recipe and storage conditions during and after fermentation.</p>

<p>The other issue is that fermented brined pickles are ""alive"" in the sense that they continue to have microbial activity even after refrigerated.  Unless you ""process"" the pickles after fermentation by heating to a high temperature and canning, you should expect that pickles will change their taste and texture continuously.  You might like pickles that are ""just finished,"" but dislike their flavor or texture after a month or two in the fridge (or the reverse).</p>

<p>Traditional pickle-makers often take advantage of these changes, for example by selling ""half sours"" which taste like something between a fresh cucumber and a pickle and have only been partially fermented.  ""Half sours"" and other pickles that have not completed fermentation before refrigeration have a much shorter shelf-life (usually a few weeks), because the lack of full acidity in the liquid and remaining sugars and other nutrients in the cucumbers may still allow other things to grow and for spoilage to occur.</p>

<p>Even after a longer fermentation, expect pickles to gradually get more sour and to soften in texture as the months go by.  However, with adequate salt content and full fermentation, and as long as you are not contaminating the storage container, there's no reason to expect they will actually ""go bad"" at refrigerator temperatures for at least a few months and potentially much longer.</p>

<p>Traditionally, long-storage pickled cucumbers were fermented in (and subsequently stored in) a cool place, like a root cellar or other underground compartment, which probably stayed around 50-55 degrees Fahrenheit most of the year.  At these cooler temperatures, pickles usually needed to ferment for at least a month and sometimes a few months before achieving full flavor.  Since the root cellar temperatures were often above refrigerator temperatures, they would then continue to get even more sour and gradually begin to break down as the months went by.  However, the purpose of storage was to have cucumbers available throughout the year, so last year's batch would be used up and then be replaced by the new harvest.</p>

<p>Today, most people tend to ferment homemade pickles faster (often at room temperature) and often with less salt than the season-long ferments of the past would use.  This produces pickles more quickly, sometimes in as little as a week or so, with pickles that are not as extreme in their sourness and saltiness as the long-storage pickling of the past.  The flavor profile can also be somewhat different, due to greater activity of some microorganisms at room temperature.  Depending on the recipe, they are often not as stable and should probably be consumed within a few weeks or months.  (For example, Alton Brown's relatively fast pickle <a href=""http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/dill-pickles-recipe.html"">recipe</a> recommends storing the pickles no longer than two months in the refrigerator.)</p>

","<p>It's caused by the high amount of potassium in the banana. Microwaves react with metals, bouncing off and cause arcing. You can even create a cool light show by putting a raw peeled banana in the microwave. Don't worry, it won't explode, but it will make a mess, it's also harmless.</p>

<p>This can also happen in some <a href=""http://www.freshplaza.com/news_detail.asp?id=19396"">frozen vegetables</a> depending on the soil conditions they grew in. As noted in the linked article, other high concentrations of metals such as magnesium, iron, and zinc can be the responsible mineral.</p>

<p>Momentary brief sparking is harmless and won't harm your microwave, but the USDA recommends turning off your microwave if you see sparks nonetheless. If it does start a fire, unless it's a <em>very</em> small fire, do not open your microwave door.

"Why is my meat grinder getting clogged with sinew?","33282","","<p>Last Christmas, I got a meat grinder and I've stared experimenting with sausage making. My previous batches have been around a pound of pork, and I noticed that it seemed to slow down as I went. Today, I pushed through five pounds of chicken thighs and pork fat, which was a huge chore -- almost immediately, it the grinding would slow, and after maybe a half pound, I needed to take the blade out and clean the sinew out of the die. I could then go back and grind maybe a half pound again, before things clogged up.</p>

<p>Is this normal? I can't really imagine it is, or no one would ever grind meat.</p>

<p>I've tried the blade both ways -- one way is definitely the correct way; the other way doesn't cut at all.</p>

<p>I've cut the meat into cubes about the diameter of my thumb -- definitely smaller than the augur spacing.</p>

<p>I know, this isn't the world's best grinder (it's a ""Back to Basics"" brand). Does my blade need sharpening already? Is there some basic meat grinder technique I'm missing? Is the grinder just crap?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Is this normal?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it is. Sinew and other connective tissues (silverskin/fascia, ligaments) are very tough stuff; you need to remove as much as possible by hand before grinding.</p>

<p>Sinew and ligaments are strong, whitish strands or ""cables"" connecting bones to muscles and to other bones, respectively. They'll be in the same place on every piece of a particular cut of meat: a poultry drumstick has an easily-identifiable piece of sinew -- actually the ""Achilles' tendon"" -- heading from the fleshy part to the exposed end of the bone.</p>

<p>Silverskin is a connective boundary between muscles. It's a thin, clingy, and annoying sheet, translucent silvery white, that you will find on the surface, and defining the divisions of, various cuts of meat. It might make it through the grinder if your blade is nice and sharp and the piece isn't too big, but it's best to take it off (your teeth can't deal with it much better than the grinder can). You'll need a thin, sharp, narrow blade for this: a filet/boning knife, sometimes a good paring kife.</p>

<p>Essentially, anything that's not fat or muscle needs to be taken out before the meat goes into the grinder.</p>

<p>Chicken thighs have a lot of connective tissue. Some of it is hidden inside the muscle segments on the underside of the thigh; make sure you cut those open.</p>

<p>Depending on the particular piece of meat you have, you may end up with what seem like extremely small bits after this process. Even a nice pork shoulder can result in 1/4"" or thinner pieces after the internal connective tissue is removed. This won't have any real effect on the grinding process; the only thing to watch out for is thorough and even mixing if you end up with many different sizes and are marinating/curing the meat before grinding.</p>

<p>You can grind without removing <em>all</em> the tissue (it gets frustrating sometimes), but you'll have to be prepared to stop the grinder and clean the blade and plate frequently -- the instant you notice that the meat is not coming out of the plate in clean, cohesive, and separate lines. If you see any signs of smearing or over-grinding (the grind will start to be too fine and become pink as the fat and meat combine), <strong>stop</strong> and clear the blade. Otherwise, the mixture won't emulsify properly, the fat will melt out when you cook it, and the sausage will be dry.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does my blade need sharpening already?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It may very well, but this still won't help with sinew and ligaments. </p>

<p>You should treat your grinder blade the same way you treat your kitchen knives -- maintain its edge, rather than waiting for it to become completely dull. I'd say that I put my blade onto a sharpening stone every 50 lbs. or so. The nice thing is that it's extremely easy -- you are grinding all the arms of the blade at the same angle: flat. The plate also needs to be maintained by grinding the surface where it meets the blade (the edges of the holes should be sharp), but I'd say that this can be done much less freqently. The blade and the plate can both be maintained quite successfully and easily with a piece of fine (800 grit) wet-dry sandpaper slapped on a table.</p>

"Better ways to drain tofu in a hurry?","33149","","<p>So far the best way I've found to make tofu taste good is to exchange as much of the water in it for liquid carrying flavor. In order to do that of course you need to get the water OUT. The age old wrap it in tea towels and let it set with some weight on it just doesn't seem compatible with our kitchen (very small, with little counter space) or our family (has a active toddler that gets into everything).</p>

<p>The best way I've found to date is:</p>

<ol>
<li>freeze the tofu (in it's container) until it's rock hard. (at least 2 nights)</li>
<li>Let the tofu thaw in the fridge until it's completely thawed through. (at least 2 days)</li>
<li>slit the package open along one long side, poke a hole on the opposite side for air to get in and and allow the block to drain into the sink.</li>
<li>compress the package (over the sink) with your hands (if it's the soft plastic vacuum packed kind)</li>
<li>take the block of tofu out of the package and slice it on my cutting board into slices 1/2"" thick (or whatever size I need for the dish in question if they're smaller)</li>
<li>place the slices on an upside down plate, place another plate upside down atop it (bottom to bottom - our plates have a flat, sealed bottom so they're food safe.)</li>
<li>hold the plate and tofu sandwich above the sink and lightly squeeze with a hand on both sides until liquid stops coming out.</li>
</ol>

<p>The problems with this are:</p>

<ol>
<li>have to plan ahead, if I didn't take the block of tofu out of the freeze two days ago, we're not eating it for dinner tonight.</li>

<p>You slice it into the size pieces you wan then there are two different ways I have used:</p>

<p>1) Microwave it for about two minutes. Water leaks out onto the plate, which you drain then microwave it for a couple more minutes. Keep doing this until it stops leaking out water. </p>

"does washing vegetables and fruit with baking soda make sense?","33084","","<p>I have checked the other questions about washing vegetables and fruit, but they don't mention baking soda. Google brings up only unreliable (random blogs that give no reference) or biased (baking soda brands) sources. So, here it goes: my grandmother swore by washing vegetable and fruit in a weak baking soda solution (I am talking about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bicarbonate"" rel=""nofollow"">sodium bicarbonate</a> NaHCO3, not baking <em>powder</em>).</p>

<p>I tend to follow her advice and wash fruit and vegs in a baking soda solution, but I just gave the matter some rational thought: how concentrated should the solution be? And what the heck and I doing anyway? Does it make any difference? It is not that I am obsessed with cleanliness, I just want to know whether baking soda in the water makes any difference, or if I am just wasting time (and soda).</p>

<p>The FDA does not suggest baking soda, just plenty of water. I have found a paper, <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/501694"" rel=""nofollow"">Antimicrobial Activity of Home Disinfectants and Natural Products Against Potential Human Pathogens</a> that indicates that baking soda and vinegar have a disinfecting action against bacteria and the polio virus, but they are consistently less effective than commercial disinfectants like Clorox (nothing strange here, otherwise why would we need Clorox, right?).</p>

<p>Any suggestions? Sources? </p>
","<p>From what I can tell it seems like you are asking whether a baking soda solution is a good solution for cleaning fruits and vegetables. The answer to that would be not really, you're wasting good baking soda. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16496573"">Research</a> shows that even purpose made commercial vegetable cleaners were no better than plain water for cleaning vegetables, it's the soaking time and technique used that makes the difference. </p>

<p>The only chemical tested that seems to make and difference is <a href=""http://www.nutritionevidencelibrary.com/evidence.cfm?evidence_summary_id=250345"">chlorine</a>, which demonstrably reduced contamination on the outside of melons. However, you don't eat melon rinds, I wouldn't wash vegetables or fruit that I was going to eat in a chlorine solution because chlorine is unpleasant stuff and will probably ruin your flavors. </p>

<p>So washing your vegetables in baking soda, vinegar, or baking soda and vinegar is no better than washing them in plain old tap-water. It's better for your flavors that you do not as well. The only use I know of for baking soda in the preparation and cooking of green vegetables is that adding a bit when boiling green vegetables helps preserve their vibrant green flavor by neutralizing the acids that break down the chlorophyll. The trouble is it also turns them to mush, so I never use that method. </p>

Rocky <a href=""http://www.marksdailyapple.com/drinking-raw-eggs/"" rel=""nofollow"">ate raw eggs</a> all the time! haha So please feel free to make the mousse and eat it too! Although cooking them almost always kills bacteria if they reach 150 degrees Fahrenheit. The most dangerous part about using eggs is something that many of us were taught to do at a young age, separating the yolk. Most people separate the yolk by cracking the egg and pouring it back and forth between the two egg shell halves. This is the easiest way to spread salmonella because it can hide on the egg shell or in the pores inside the egg. One thing to never do is wash an egg. They are washed after they are laid and a new barrier is put on by the egg company, some sort of hardened mineral I think. Washing the egg will make your situation worse by destroying this new man made barrier. For the last part of your question I suggest not feeding your baby and thing that has a small percent chance to have any bacteria, such as mousse, because their immune system is still developing. I would also choose not to feed your baby anything high in sugar, thats what Grandma is for later in life. The baby's tastes are forming now and veggies are the way to go with that. Need to teach them to like good for them foods. They like sweet stuff when they are born so they don't need to learn how to like those. Hope I helped!</p>

","<p>To take one concern away - practically none of the worm-looking parasites in food are dangerous. They are yucky, but harmless, even nutritious. </p>

<p>But as far as I can see it from the picture, these are not worms at all. Beans and related plants have an embryo in their seeds. In white legumes, the embryo is a light pink color and looks indeed like a larva. The way to check is to look at the still-intact beans. They are all made up of two symmetrical halves inside. Cut them open through the plane which separates the two halves. If they have your suspect at the concave part of the bean, where it used to attach to the pod, then this is the embryo, just a normal part of the seed which is supposed to grow into a new plant when planted. </p>

<p>If the embryo of multiple beans looks differently from that (or is too small to notice), then these may be larvae after all. In this case, you will probably choose to discard the food because of the disgust factor. It is still not objectively unsafe. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Shrimp</strong>, <em>ebi</em>, available raw in sashimi, but almost always lightly poached.  The poaching brings out sweet and subtle flavors otherwise masked by a metallic tang.  It also prevents the highly perishable shrimp from losing texture to spoilage.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Eel</strong>, <em>unagi</em>, as you noted, is ALWAYS grilled, and steamed. This is necessary to achieve the truly transcendent flavor and texture of <em>unagi.</em>  In fact, the cooking of eel is such a challenge that it is generally a whole separate chef profession in Japan.  Most eel comes from one of the professionals, because sushi cooks know they will never be able to match the quality themselves.  Improperly cooked eel becomes tough and has unpleasant flavors.

"Safe to leave oven on at 180F while at work to cook ribs?","32888","","<p>I'm currently at work and I'm having a little panic attack.</p>

<p>I followed a recipe that require the ribs to be wrapped in foil and cooked at 180F for 9hours.  I left about 30 minutes ago and for who knows why I didn't think it could be a bad idea before, but now I'm feeling unsure and worried.</p>

<p>The ribs are wrapped in two layers of aluminium sitting on a baking sheet.  The ribs were coated since last night in a dry rub and I've added sauce on them this morning before closing the wrapping again.</p>

<p>Please give me your thought.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I just wanted to give you guys an update.  So by precaution I asked my boss if I could take the rest of the day off and he agreed to let me go around noon (4+ hours into cooking), a risk I had to live with.</p>

<p>When I got home, my house was still standing in one piece and when I opened the door the smell running through my nose was incredible. I left the ribs to cook in the oven for another 5 hours before attempting to put them on the grill of the BBQ at high setting.</p>

<p>The ribs were a bit too tender so I lost some in the process of grilling them, but the taste was amazing.  It's the first time I manage to cook rib without boiling them first and I can honestly say I'm satisfied with the result, though I would probably cut down on the last hour in the oven.</p>

<p>As for the safety of this adventure, I think it would be safe to redo it unattended especially because of how low temperature is set, but as other people mentioned it is important to have a clean oven.</p>

<p>Happy safe cooking everyone.</p>

","<p>Yes, there's a risk, but it's not significantly higher than having most other home appliances turned on  (eg, a lamp, dehumidifier, dish washer or <strike>dryer</strike>).</p>

<p>Although it heats up, a full-sized oven is insulated, and you're not operating at a very high temperature.  Provided it seals well, even if there's a fire, there would be little oxygen to sustain it.  I would <em>not</em> trust a toaster oven or desktop oven. with this sort of thing, as they're not as well insulated, nor do they tend to seal well.</p>

<p>As ovens are based on temperature, and will cycle on an off, rather than just feed in a constant amount of power (such as a cook top) ... so it won't get so hot that it causes other issues.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I made the (possibly incorrect) assumption that this was an <strong>electric</strong> oven.  I don't know that I'd trust a gas oven the same way (as I would assume that it is <em>not</em> well sealed) ... although people leave their home heating systems and water heaters on without shutting them off when they leave each day, so it's probably not an issue.</p>

"Why does coffee taste awful after reheating it in a microwave oven?","32534","","<p>I brew my coffee with a percolator using finely ground beans and it comes out great when it is still hot. However, I have to brew at least two cups in the machine. So if I make coffee in the morning, the afternoon cup is cold and I have to reheat it.</p>

<p>If the coffee gets cold and then I reheat it in a cup in the microwave, it tastes terrible! Why?</p>
","<p>It has nothing to do with the microwave and everything to do with the volatility of aromas and flavors in coffee. Even coffee kept warm for 4 hours won't taste very good. In my experience, stale brewed coffee results in a more pronounced acidity, if left out to cool, or a woody, muddy, bitter kind of flavor, sometimes with more pronounced acidity, if held warm. If you were to make a straight espresso, it's optimal to drink it within 20-30 seconds. Brewed coffee can usually be held warm around 30 minutes before pronounced deterioration becomes obvious.</p>

<p>A popular Japanese TV show suggested perhaps stirring a pinch of salt in to stale, reheated coffee, which may trick your tastebuds enough into tolerating it. I've found that tactic less than adequate, but your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>How to avoid it and how can I get rid of the black-ness?</p>
","<p>The black spots can be one of several things, but are likely a variety of mold. Black stains can also be caused by a reaction to the iron in your knives (particularly if you use carbon steel blades instead of stainless steel). If it is mold, it is growing because even though the surface of your cutting board is dry, moisture has soaked in, probably because it needs to be oiled or waxed.</p>

<p>To recondition a butcher block or cutting board that is stained or gouged, you can sand the surface down, and reoil.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a sanding block to keep the surface from getting wavy as you sand.</li>
<li>Start sanding with 120 grit (80 if you are removing big gouges), and sand evenly, moving with the grain, until the stains are gone, or almost gone (if a few very deep ones survive, don't worry about it).</li>
<li>Repeat the sanding with 240, then 400 grit until the roughness from the previous sanding is gone.</li>
<li>Reoil with any Butcher Block Conditioner. There are many out there, and they are either food-safe mineral oil, or that oil with a few other waxes mixed in. Many are good, but my favorite is <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001ESTA30"">Howard's Butcher Block Conditioner</a>. Follow the instructions, but it will amount to making a liberal application, allowing it to sit for a while, then wiping off the excess.</li>

It's a very fine metal mesh basket with plastic frame. I've had it for perhaps 10+ years and it's still working well after brewing thousands of cups of tea.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem:</strong><br>
However, it seems that the metal mesh is slowly becoming ""clogged"" or something.  The tea still infuses fine, but it's more prone to spilling and dripping because water doesn't pass through as quickly.  <strong>How should I clean this thing?</strong></p>

Sometimes when bits seem to be stuck, I'll take a toothbrush or other dish brush to scour a little more thoroughly. I've also tried soaking in water.</p>

The teeli web site doesn't seem to have any suggestions for cleaning; hardly surprising since it's not needed any significant maintenance in 10 years of service.</p>

"How to prevent fish disintegrating in frying pan","32320","","<p>Twice now I've tried pan frying fillets of white fish (Swai and Flouder) in olive oil and butter.  Both times the fish has disintegrated into unsightly mush.  Is there some technique I'm missing?  How can I pan fry without the fish falling apart?</p>
","<p>When we pan fry white fish, we use a non-stick but do not marinade nor bread it.</p>

<ul>
<li>We stick a little bit of oil in the non-stick; just enough to cover
the bottom.</li>
<li>Heat the pan up until the oil is shimmering and you can smell the oil (for example you will smell corn for vegetable oil). How high of heat really
depends on your burner. We have a gas stove top and use the large
burner at 5 1/2 and our non stick is an all-clad stainless steel (no copper).</li>
<li>Put your fish in the pan and do not move it for a few minutes. You
should hear sizzling but not crackling. If the fish in the oil is
crackling, turn the heat down a little.</li>
<li>At the end of a few minutes, shake the pan and see if the fish slides
around. If it does not, the fish may need a little more time on that
side. To help it along my husband likes to shake the pan every 10-20
seconds to get air pockets under the fish and allow the oil to coat
the bottom of the fish some more.</li>
<li>Once the fish slides, flip it and remember how long you cooked the
first side for just to have an idea. You will cook the other side for less time.</li>
<li>Watch the sides of the fish to see how the cooking progression is
going.</li>
<li>If you want fully cooked fish wait for the sides of the fish to
almost become fully opaque. Think of when you are watching even
thickness chicken cooking from pink to white. Resting time under foil
will cook the fish the rest of the way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tips</p>

<ul>
<li>If the filets are not even thickness, move the thinner ends to the
cooler sides of the pan. You can also fold over the thinner side (more common with salmon filets) to match the thicker part and stick a tooth pick in it, that way the filet is the same thickness all the way around.</li>
<li>If you have a sauce to pour over the fish, make the sauce while the
fish is resting. This way you are able to cook the fish on both sides
to get a nice crust without worrying about the sauce steaming the
fish.</li>
<li>If marinading the fish, take the fish out of the marinade and let
drip for a few seconds to get enough of the liquid off then follow
the above tip to make a pouring sauce.</li>
<li>For skin on fish, we usually put the fish in skin side up first then flip it</li>

"Can beef stew be reheated several times?","32285","","<p>I purchased 2 pound of meat, and the same day cooked it into a stew.  For dinner I had a small amount of it, and then put the pot into the refrigerator.</p>

<p>The next day for lunch I would like to reheat the entire pot of stew to boiling temperature, let it cool to eating temperature, eat some, and afterwards put the entire pot back into the refrigerator.</p>

<p>I would like to repeat this pattern for a few days.  I am told there is a risk of bacterial contamination, and the proper way is to only reheat the small amount I want to eat each time, not the entire pot.  But as long as I reheat to boiling temperature, is that really true?</p>

<p>The direct answer is, every time you re-heat and cool the entire pot, you're passing through the ""danger zone"" (40-140 °F or 4-60 °C) where bacteria will continue growing.  Even if you manage to kill all of them, this is a problem because:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some bacteria leave behind harmful protein toxins that cannot be
  ""killed"" (denatured) by cooking. Cooking food is only effective
  against live organisms, not their toxic waste products.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yes, there is a very real risk.  To reduce this risk as much as possible, you'll want to follow the alternate method you describe of only re-heating the amount that you want to eat at any given time.</p>

<p>That's also desirable because:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you bring the entire pot back up to boiling each time, you're continuing to cook it.  Besides the risk of contamination, that will also affect the quality and palatability of the stew because it will be drastically overcooked after just a couple repetitions.</li>
<li>It's a lot more efficient to apply just the heat needed to re-heat a small portion than it is to re-heat a larger amount that you're just going to let cool back down anyway.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, keeping your stew in the pot may be undesirable, especially if it has acidic ingredients like tomatoes, which can react with a metal pot (particularly aluminum) and give your stew a faintly metallic taste.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor and don't try to to take this shortcut.  It's a bad idea for a number of reasons.  Pack the stew into individual servings instead and keep them refrigerated until you're ready to eat them.</p>

"Why is there a difference between softened and melted butter when baking?","32177","","<p>I once tried to make some cookies and assumed that melted butter would be the same as softened butter.  It didn't work out...  </p>

<p>Why does it make a difference if you use softened or melted butter?  Seems like it all ends up the same if you beat it into a recipe...</p>
","<p>Basically, when recipies call for softened butter, they use the creaming method; the sugar and butter are mixed together in such a way that the sugar cuts little air bubbles into the butter.  These little bubbles can add some extra puff to the cookies.</p>

<p>Can they be substituted for one another in recipes?</p>

<p>For baking quick oats can be used in place of old fashioned oats. However, if a recipe calls for quick oats, you may not get expected results using old fashioned oats. Typically, a recipe that calls <em>explicitly</em> for quick oats generally has too short a cooking time for regular oats to fully cook (e.g. pancakes).</p>

"Can you estimate how long it takes to reduce a liquid?","32016","","<p>In a lot of recipes, there is a step that includes reducing your liquid. In most sauces, this isn't a problem, since you just need to thicken it and that's something you can see and doesn't take a long time.</p>

<p>However, last week I was making a base for a sauce, that included water, vinegar and white wine. The recipe asked me to reduce it till it was about 1/3 of the original amount. I didn't think it would take as long as it did and as a result, everything was ready except the sauce.</p>

<p>Is there a way to calculate how fast something reduces? I can understand it would depend on the ingredients, on the surface area and on the temperature, but assume that I know these variables.</p>
","<p>If you're boiling something rapidly, and it's not in a terribly deep, narrow pot, then essentially all of the heat output of the burner is going into turning water into steam. The latent heat of vaporization of water is 2260 kJ/kg, so if you want to reduce something by a volume V, and your stove has power P, the time required is:</p>

<pre><code>t = V * (1 g/mL) * (2260 J/g) / P
</code></pre>

<p>If V happens to be in mL, and P is in W (J/s):</p>

<pre><code>t (s) = V / P * 2260
</code></pre>

<p>This would be modified slightly if you're using a really tall, skinny pot, since the convection within the pot, from the bottom to the top of the liquid, would be less efficient, with more heat transferred to the sides of the pot and out into the air, but I doubt you're actually going to try to reduce something like that. The P here is the effective power; for example, a gas burner wastes a lot of heat out the sides, so the advertised power will be higher. See <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/21831/1672"">TFD's answer</a> for approximate efficiencies.</p>

<p>If you don't know the power of your stove, in all honesty, the easiest way to measure it would probably be to just see how long it takes to boil away a given volume of water, and work backwards. To get an accurate result, you should not boil a pot dry - once the water is a thin enough layer, the heat transfer might start working differently, with the pot itself heating up more, and water splattering. So you could, for example, put in a liter of water, boil away at the stove setting you intend to measure until it's substantially reduced in volume, record the time, then pour it out to measure how much you boiled away. At this point, knowing the power output might be overkill, though; you can really just measure the time per volume reduction, and use that, unless you care about the power for other reasons.</p>

<p>Trying to deduce the power of the stove from, say, the temperature of an empty pot or of the burner without a pot on it (assuming it's electric) would be difficult; you'd have to deal with the heat transfer between metal and air, and the convection in the air.</p>

<p>Dependence on ingredients shouldn't be significant - you're still just boiling water, unless there's a substantial amount of alcohol, in which case the latent heat of vaporization will be different. Pure alcohol has a latent heat of vaporization of 841 kJ/kg; I haven't found a good table for mixtures.</p>

<p>For solutions, as I noted in the comments, the latent heat of vaporization should be that of water, plus/minus the heat of solution of the solutes (I forget which direction that's measured in). The most common solutes are probably salt and sugar, which have heats of solution of 70 and 16 J/g, respectively. (I found <a href=""http://webserver.dmt.upm.es/~isidoro/dat1/Heat%20of%20solution%20data.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this table</a>, and converted.) The next most common thing I could think of that might be present in substantial concentrations is citric acid; <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021961486900807"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this paper</a> reports a heat of solution of -57 J/g. In all these cases it's small compared to the latent heat of vaporization of water, so pretending the liquid is water should be a good approximation. It's possible that things change if you're reducing <em>really</em> far: heat of solution does depend on concentration. That is, things are different thermodynamically (statistical mechanically?) in a nearly-saturated sugar syrup than in slightly sweet water.</p>

It's actually the size of a small hockey puck, white and pretty hard. (I've only encountered soft mochi in this shape and generally they had some sort of filling). The only other time that I've seen hard mochi is once when I bought frozen mochi from the store (sold as one solid rectangular block, about 1/2"" high). With this frozen mochi, they suggested baking it. When baked, it browned on the outside and puffed up a little bit.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever seen the white mochi pucks that I've described? How do you eat it? I'm going to attempt to steam one and try to bake another to test. Is this the proper way to cook this type of mochi?</p>

<p>It seems like you can:</p>

<ol>
<li>grill them - they will brown a bit and rise.</li>
<li>boil them - they won't rise</li>
<li>microwave them</li>
</ol>

<p>And the ways to serve it is with:</p>

<ol>
<li>Butter+soy sauce (an interesting combo that I will try)</li>
<li>Rolled in ground sesame seeds + sugar or salt.</li>
<li>Rolled kinako (toasted soybean powder + sugar.)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p><em>Boiled</em></p>

<p>I cut them into about 1 inch x 1 inch pieces and threw them in boiling water. Boiled them for about a minute or so...then removed them to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process.</p>

"What's the best way to cook BBQ ribs in the oven and grill?","31811","","<p>I have some pork ribs that I want to barbecue, but being relatively inexperienced with BBQ and lacking a decent grill thermometer, I want to simplify things by cooking them partly in the oven and partly in the grill. Researching online has thrown up many variations as to temperature, timing, and which order to cook them in. So, some sub-questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it better to grill the ribs first, then put them in the oven, or vice versa?</li>
<li>In either case, is it best to use indirect or direct heat on the grill to get the necessary smokiness and glaze?</li>
<li>What temperature should the ribs be cooked at in the oven and for roughly how long (I know outcome is more important than timing)</li>
<li>Should the ribs be wrapped in foil in the oven for the entire cook?</li>
</ul>

<p>FWIW my instinct is to grill (with some wood chips for smoke) first, then oven, but my concern then is how to get a good glaze.</p>
","<p>The goal with ribs is ""low and slow"" cooking to break down connective tissue.  But a quick sear will help to lock in juices and provide a good smoky flavor.  I find it's preferable to do this first so that the smokiness can work its way into the meat over the slow cook to come.</p>

<p>After seasoning, I would start with a sear on your grill over direct heat (8-10 minutes per side).  Then, either move to a very low indirect heat on the grill and cover, which will provide a more smoky flavor, or transfer to your oven at a very low temperature (most home ovens go down to about 250F which is what I'd use).  Baste both sides every half hour or so if you're using sauce.  It should take about 2-3 hours at this low temperature to get good results, although you can let it go a lot longer if you want.  I would have no problem at all cooking ribs for 6, 8, or 10 hours assuming you've got the time.</p>

<p>If you're cooking on the grill the whole time, the smoke will help create a delicious glaze.  If in the oven and the glaze isn't as thick as you'd like by the time you're ready to serve, you can crank on the broiler and place the ribs underneath for just a couple minutes to dry out the glaze a bit.</p>

<p>You do not need to wrap them in foil during cooking if you have quality ribs and cook them slow.  The only time I'd wrap them in foil would be at the very end once you have finished cooking, in order to keep them warm until you're ready to serve.</p>

"What is the ""standard"" salsa tomato?","31764","","<p>I make a lot of fresh salsa (pico de gallo style) in the summer, but I don't usually think much about the type of tomatoes I'm usuing. Usually I just buy whatever looks best (fresh &amp; ripe) at the farmer's market, so I've used everything from beefsteak and heirloom to cherry and grape. I've been quite happy with the results, but I'm still wondering: is there a ""standard"" tomato variety for salsa?</p>

<p>I've read <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/2903/how-does-one-begin-to-create-salsa"">this question</a> and <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/7668/how-do-i-make-homemade-salsa-thicker"">this question</a> about homemade salsa, but neither of them really mention tomato varieties; the focus seems to be on other ingredients or preparation techniques.</p>
","<p>A standard tomato implies that there is a standard salsa, which there isn't - but let's stick with your specific case of <em>pico de gallo</em> AKA <em>salsa cruda</em>.</p>

<p>The distinguishing characteristic of salsa cruda is that it uses <em>raw</em> tomatoes - the <em>cruda</em> literally means <em>raw</em>.  Since you aren't going to be cooking them, and since water is going to be your primary binding agent, you'll want to use plump, juicy tomatoes that have potent flavour when raw, and that just so happens to be those bog-standard globe tomatoes you see in the supermarket aisles.  Of course, if you can get garden-fresh tomatoes, so much the better.</p>

<p>Cherry tomatoes are also a great choice - they're very juicy and a little sweeter than globes - the only downside is that for a <em>chopped</em> salsa (as in pico de gallo), they tend to make preparation much more difficult and messy. If you've got the time and patience, give it a try; cherry tomato salsas taste much ""fresher"" than those made from globes.</p>

<p>The other common types of tomatoes, most notably roma and pear tomatoes, are really meant more for cooking. That's not to say you <em>can't</em> eat them raw, but they don't have a lot of juice or raw flavour, so they don't make a good base for cruda. Roasted roma or heirloom tomatoes (especially fire-roasted) make a great <em>addition</em> to salsa, but of course, it's not really ""cruda"" anymore if you cook any of the ingredients.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favour and <em>don't</em> use the plum tomatoes in a can; they're plenty juicy but have almost no seeds and no flavour.</p>

<p>So, all in all, for pico de gallo I believe that regular globe tomatoes are the most appropriate, but any tomatoes with strong flavour and plenty of juice will do.</p>

","<p>Using a cut of meat without too much connective tissue will definitely help. Talk to your butcher about good options.

If you do grill stew meat, lower temperature and longer cooking time may help some, but in that case you'll probably want to do the veggies separately.</p>

<p>A good marinade will help. You can add some meat tenderizer, or make fresh pineapple juice one of the marinade ingredients. Pineapple contains an enzyme that'll break down some of the connective tissue, but it has to be fresh -- canned juice will have been heated, destroying the enzyme.</p>

You might decide that you simply like it better with a different fiber - justkt suggested a few in the comments; thanks! And I know you're not exactly looking for variety here, but I might as well suggest it.

"""Indian Spicy"" vs. ""Thai Spicy""","31468","","<p>What ingredient(s) make the spiciness from Indian food distinct from the spiciness of, say, Thai food?</p>

<p>Indian good seems to have a longer, slower burn, rather than a ""sharper"" spiciness of Thai. I know spiciness in Thai food comes from Thai bird chilis; what's the corresponding ingredient(s) in Indian food? Most of the recipes I've seen call for ""red pepper"" -- none of the ground red pepper I've used comes anywhere near that sensation -- is there a special kind of red pepper used in Indian cooking? Or something else I'm missing?</p>
","<p>Well, that depends on the individual Thai dish or Indian dish and how it was cooked, of course.  But I understand what you're talking about.  However, the difference in heat sensations is not due to the kind of pepper employed. It's all about fat, really.</p>

<p>Frequently Thai dishes are made with fresh peppers, and have a lot of acid and salt in them (from citrus, tamarind, and other flavors) but very little fat (comparatively).  Because of this, many Thai dishes have an instant burst of intense hotness which goes away realtively quickly.  The paragon of this is probably Thai salads, like larb or green mango salad, which are highly acidic and very very spicy.</p>

<p>On the other hand, most Anglo-Indian food (familiar to Americans and British) is in the form of ""curries"" which use a slow-cooked dairy base (butter, milk, and/or cheese), and are spiced with dried ground or whole chile peppers.  As a result, when you first taste them the fat conceals the capsicum from your tongue, gradually revealing it as your saliva breaks it down.  Hence the ""slow burn"". (I've tried to find a medical reference for this to link, but have not been able to yet).</p>

<p>Similarly, Thai coconut milk curries can build up heat slowly and that heat sticks with you -- because of the hot peppers cooked in the fat of the coconut milk.  </p>

<p>Incidentally, there isn't <em>one</em> kind of chile pepper used by either culture.  The Thai have dozens of varieties of hot pepper and Indians have hundreds (as well as a dozen different regional cuisines, a few of which are not spicy at all).  In the USA, these tend to get narrowed down to a handful of different pepper varieties (and substitutions like jalapenos) because of limited availability.  The spice you call ""red pepper"" could be any of a half-dozen different ground dried peppers of varying hotness.</p>

<p>So the insturctions on the box say to add 1/4 cup of water, 1/4 vegetable oil, and 1 egg.</p>

<p>I've seen some sites that says to add one more egg. Would that really help? Has anyone converted a brownie mix into a cake?  </p>
","<p>My answer would be to add more cake flour if you have it, but AP flour will do it too, then add an additional teaspoon of baking soda.</p>

<p>The flour will lighten the mix so it's not so dense chocolate/cocoa, and the additional baking soda will help it rise more than a brownie.</p>

<p>An additional egg won't hurt, and it will certainly help the stickier of the cake, but I don't know if it's necessary.</p>

"Which baking dish is best to bake a banana bread?","31372","","<p>When I bake a banana bread or cake at home, I always use a square Pyrex(about 20cm in width and 7 cm high) dish.

"Using cast iron on a glass range","31328","","<p>I currently rent, and the only problem I have with the house we're in is that it has a glass-top range.  I absolutely love my cast iron cookware, and use it as often as possible.</p>

<p>I've heard a few reasons not to use cast iron on glass, including:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can scratch the glass if you're
not careful</li>
<li>It's very easy to break the glass if
you drop it</li>
<li>You can <a href=""http://www.thathomesite.com/forums/load/cookware/msg010049447701.html?20"">melt the glass top</a>
(mentioned in linked thread)</li>
<li>It can be hard to minimize hot spots</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not very concerned about (1) and (2), as I've already been using cast iron on glass for years with no problems (I'm very careful when I do use it).  </p>

<p>While researching (4) I came across (3), something I had never heard before.  So, I now have a few questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Is melting the glass really
plausible?</strong>  This seems unlikely to
me, as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass#Glass_ingredients"">quick search</a> revealed that
lowest melting point for common
glass types is 1500C or higher, a temperature I have no plans to reach - but
I'm not a physicist or a chemist, nor do I know what kind of glass is used to make a glass top stove.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is a <a href=""http://www.fantes.com/trivets.html"">heat diffuser</a> effective on a
glass range?</strong>  I have experienced a
few hot spots on my large (12"")
skillet, and obviously when
experimenting with my two-burner
griddle.  Would a heat diffuser help, especially with the two-burner (which I've all but given up with on
glass for now because it's so
uneven).</p></li>
<li><p>Any suggestions for <strong>safely and
effectively</strong> using cast iron on a
glass-top range (short of being very, very careful when moving the pans)?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>I also have a glass-top stove at home. So far, I really like it: the heat is very even and there is good heat transfer, provided the pan makes good contact with the surface (one skillet I have has a bit of a lip, which makes it heat more slowly).</p>

<p>I've slapped skillets and pots full of water around on mine, and have yet to break it. I'm probably more careful than I would be on a metal range, but it seems sturdy.</p>

<p>But to your points:</p>

<p>1) There is no way cast iron could melt the glass. Iron melts lower than does glass (1200*C vs. 1500*C), so before you manage to melt your stove, your pan will be a puddle. It may, however, be possible to deform the stove top if you let an empty pan heat for some time. I don't see why this would be more of an issue with cast iron than with any other piece of cookware.</p>

<p>2) A heat defuser will work fine. Don't get the kind that is designed for use with gas, but anything else should work fine.</p>

<p>3) The burners on my stove are smaller than my skillet, so I find I need to move the skillet around to heat the edges. Also, flat-bottomed pans and pots seem to be much more effective on the flat glass top, as conduction seems more effective than radiation here. I polish the bottoms of my pots to get better heat transfer, although this is just me being anal.</p>

<p>Also: cast iron can't scratch glass. Glass is much harder than iron (see <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Mohs_scale#Intermediate_hardness"">this wikipedia article</a>), glass having a 6-7 on the Mohs scale, iron having a 4.</p>

Are there food safety considerations speaking for thorough heating, as with chicken, or is it acceptable to cook it medium rare? Also, what temperature corresponds with the different grades of doneness? I intend to roast half a small rabbit in the oven; the meat doesn't look suited for collagen-based cooking, the animal is probably too young. </p>
","<p>In the food safety section of Modernist Cuisine (1-138) it says that all wild rabbit must be cooked through:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The section on meat (3-96) recommends bringing rabbit loin to an internal temperature of 59C (138F) and going by the section I've just quoted this is obviously only for farmed meat. The recommendation for the legs is to cook sous vide for 1 hour @ 66C (151F) which again obviously refers to farmed because that's definitely not long enough to tenderise wild rabbit meat. </p>

<p>I would really recommend cooking the leg meat and loin separately as I find that the loin dries out long before the legs are cooked through. The legs are much nicer braised too.</p>

<p>It didn't rise/grow and so I couldn't hollow out the shells.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Recipe was from <em>The Australian Women's Weekly Original Cookbook</em> (Golden Press Pty Ltd, 1977) p. 204</p>

<p>It is almost identical to the one published on their website <a href=""http://aww.ninemsn.com.au/food/cookbooks/787237/chocolate-eclairs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aww.ninemsn.com.au/food/cookbooks/787237/chocolate-eclairs</a>, with the exception that the cookbook recipe used 1C water and 1C plain flour.</p>
","<p>It's actually been a few years since I made éclairs, so I might be forgetting a few things, but here are my immediate reactions to the recipe:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>""Plain flour"" (by which I assume they mean all-purpose flour) is not appropriate for choux paste.  You should be using bread flour (AKA ""strong flour""), you need the extra gluten for this.  That is probably the most important reason why your choux paste didn't turn out right.</p></li>
<li><p>The ratio of fat to water is off.  You want a 2:1 water:fat ratio.  Use 50 g of butter or shortening for every 100 mL of water.  For reference, if you're going to adjust the ratio then you also want to use approximately 2.4 eggs per 100 mL of water.  The recipe mentioned in the question is close, but slightly short, so be careful if scaling up.</p></li>
<li><p>The ratio of flour to water is <em>blatantly</em> wrong, for <em>both</em> the posted recipe and what you say is the cookbook recipe, and you should never ever use volumetric measurements for flour in such a sensitive baking recipe.  You want to measure out 75 g of flour per 100 mL of water.  For a cup of water that's about 175 g of bread flour.  Don't even try to calculate the volume, <em>weigh it</em>.  This is extremely important, if you don't use enough flour then the choux paste won't fully gelatinize!</p></li>
<li><p>A ""pinch"" of salt is probably OK at this small scale, but if you ever decide to scale up then you need to be accurate; use 2% salt (2 g per 100 mL of water).</p></li>
<li><p>The recipe <strong>is</strong> correct in warning you against letting any of the water evaporate, and telling you to cook and stir the roux until it clears the side and forms balls when shaken.  You should also see a white film on the bottom of the pan.</p></li>
<li><p>One thing that the recipe <em>doesn't</em> mention that is <strong>extremely</strong> important is that you need to wait for the roux to cool before adding the eggs.  Whole egg coagulates at 65° C (149° F) so it is absolutely imperative that the roux is cooler than that, otherwise you will end up with scrambled eggs.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you completely incorporate the eggs.  Scrape the sides of the bowl if necessary.  And don't try to cut corners by adding all the eggs at once; you really need to add them one at a time, otherwise you'll end up with lumps.  Missing this probably won't cause failure to rise, but you don't want lumps, trust me.</p></li>
<li><p>When you're done, you should have a paste that resembles the consistency of a meringue, but heavier.  That is, it holds its shape, even against gravity, but is still soft enough to spread.  I check with my finger.  If it's too stiff, you can add milk to soften it, but if it's not stiff enough, then you didn't get enough of the flour gelatinized and your paste is ruined.  (So don't overmilk!)</p></li>
<li><p>I don't agree with their ""very hot oven, then lower the temperature to 180° C"" instruction.  180° C is a very low temperature for baking choux paste, and I don't think that the 10 minutes of ""very hot"" temperature (whatever that is) are going to compensate for it.  I have always baked choux paste shells at a straight 200° C (390° F) for 30 minutes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That's about it for tearing apart their choux paste recipe.  I'm not even going to <em>touch</em> their ""custard cream"" recipe, which is just not even remotely close to the chantilly cream that éclairs are supposed to have.</p>

"How can I identify dutch process cocoa?","31013","","<p>I have a hard time finding ""dutch process cocoa"" in the store sometimes.  </p>

<ul>
<li>What other names might dutch process cocoa be known as?  </li>
<li>Is there something else in the ingredients that might identify dutch process cocoa.  </li>
</ul>

<p>What is the key property of dutch process cocoa that makes it do its job?  (Especially in cake and brownie applications?)</p>
","<p>There really isn't another name for Dutch processed cocoa. You could perhaps look at the ingredients or label and search for some reference to alkalization. Cocoa powder, Dutched or natural, consists of a single ingredient: cocoa. The difference is that Dutched cocoa has an extra step in the manufacturing process.</p>

<p>Normal cocoa powder is created from cocoa beans. These beans are fermented, roasted, shelled, and then ground into a paste known as chocolate liquor. This is roughly 50/50 cocoa butter (fat) and cocoa solids. At this step it is can be molded and sold as unsweetened baking chocolate. To make cocoa powder the liquor is hydraulically pressed to remove ~75% of the fat, and then pulverized into cocoa powder.</p>

<p>Dutched cocoa powder has an extra step before the shelled beans are ground into liquor. They are soaked in an alkaline solution of potassium carbonate. </p>

<p>Dutched cocoa was created in the 19th century by a Dutchman named Coenraad J. van Houten. Van Houten had invented the method of using a hydraulic press to defat chocolate liquor. Hot chocolate in these times would have a fatty greasy scum floating on the top of the beverage. Removing much of the fat prevented this. However, it also made the drink much harsher, acidic, and gave it a much lighter color. </p>

<p>Van Houten's idea was to counteract the cocoa's natural acidity (pH ~5.4) by soaking it in an alkaline solution. This neutralized the acids in the cocoa raising the pH to neutral (7) or higher depending on the duration of the soak. The higher pH also has the added benefit of darkening the cocoa; the higher it goes, the darker it gets.</p>

<p>Now, you might think that mellowing out the cocoa would be undesirable for the flavor. However this has been shown to not be the case. It turns out that the very acidic nature of natural cocoa can actually mask many of the natural undertones of flavor in the chocolate. Chocolate is much like wine and has hundreds of flavors that make up its flavor profile. These include sour, bitter, astringent, fruity, figgy, nutty, floral, smoky, and may more. Dutching only targets the bitter, astringent, sour and fruity undertones allowing the remaining ones to really showcase the chocolate.</p>

<p>There is a bit of misinformation that floats amongst bakers that the pH of the cocoa can affect the leavening of the baked good. Many recipes will actually sternly suggest using either Dutched or natural cocoa depending. This makes sense since leavening is a sort of balancing act that involves both acids and bases. However, it has been experimentally shown that this does not actually occur, and baked goods made with both Dutched and natural cocoa powder showed no differences in leavening.</p>

<hr/>

<p>So to actually address your questions. Again, no there isn't another name for Dutched cocoa, but it can't hurt to check for alkalized verbage. There is (should) also no additional ingredient that would identify a cocoa powder as Dutched. The key property it provides is simply chocolate flavor.</p>

<hr/>

<p>This answer is adapted from the Jan. 1, 2005 Cook's Illustrated review of <a href=""http://www.cooksillustrated.com/tastetests/overview.asp?docid=9942"">cocoa powder</a>. Their results showed that without fail Dutched cocoa was voted superior to natural cocoa in every single blind taste test including: pudding, shortbread, devil's food cake, and hot chocolate (which was masked by a sippy-top so reviewers could not see the tell-tale color).</p>

<p>If the cost doesn't make you do a double take (it's not really that expensive considering the quantity). I highly suggest you buy a 1 kg (2.2 lb) bag of <a href=""http://chocolatesource.com/products/detail.asp?selection=529&amp;section=10"">Callebaut Cocoa Powder</a>. This was the winner of the blind taste test performed by Cook's Illustrated. I must agree that it will change your baked goods for the better like you would not believe.</p>

<p>Do you put it directly on gril (with peel) ?</p>

","<p>The best way I have found is to soak the ears in husk for several hours before grilling. This lets the husk soak lots of water. Then place the corn, still in husk, on a hot grill for about 10 minutes, ~1/4 turn, 10 minutes, turn... until the husk gets brown, even burnt.</p>

<p>You should be able to tell when the corn is cooked by the smell. The sugars in the corn will start to caramelize and brown in the husk and it will give off a delicious caramel smell. You can check them by peeling down the husk to make sure that they are cooking well.</p>

<p>Times will depend on your grill and how much patience you have. In general, it is difficult to overcook. You want to watch out for drying, but that usually takes a while if you soak the ears beforehand.</p>

<p>Foil is a poor substitute for the natural wrapper. The husk both protects the cob from too much direct heat as well as holding water close to the cob to gently steam the kernels. And its just prettier with the browned and burnt husk, au natural. </p>

"How to poach an egg without vinegar?","30868","","<p>What is the best way to poach an egg without vinegar? Is there a quick and easy alternative?</p>
","<p>Heston Blumenthal has brought his unique scientific approach to bear on this recently. The main pointers for a perfect poached egg are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The egg <em>must</em> be <strong>fresh</strong>. A fresh egg has a thicker, more gel-like albumen. As it gets older, this becomes watery, and so just disperses throughout the water when you add it. To test if your egg is fresh, place it in a jug of cold water. If it floats, it's not fresh - the egg has had time to absorb air through its shell. A fresh egg sinks and stays sunk.</p></li>
<li><p>The water temperature should be 80ºC/176ºF <strong>exactly</strong>. You can measure this with a sugar or probe thermometer. The egg should be at room temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>The egg should not come into contact with direct heat, so put a plate or small bowl on the bottom of the pan, bottom up.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Once the water (in a medium to large saucepan) is up to temperature, carefully add the fresh egg and cook for <strong>4 minutes exactly</strong> (for a large egg of the domestic chicken, <em>Gallus gallus domesticus</em>). Drain and serve - the white should be set but not rubbery (a drawback of using vinegar) and the yolk should be creamy and rich.</p>

"How can I make the tops of my macarons smooth?","30839","","<p>After a recent trip to France, I have become mildly obsessed with making <em>macarons</em> (using <a href=""http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2005/10/french-chocolat/"">this recipe</a>). I have made a couple of batches so far - the first didn't turn out well, more like cookies than <em>macarons</em>, due to under-whipped egg whites and too-coarse almonds.</p>

<p>The second batch has turned out better, much more like <em>macarons</em>. I whipped the egg whites to stiff, glossy peaks and blitzed the almonds, powdered sugar and cocoa in a food processor to remove lumps and make the almonds finer. Some of the <em>macarons</em> even have the characteristic little 'feet'.</p>

<p>However, while the flavour and texture seem generally good, they don't have the smooth, perfect surface of a proper <em>macaron</em>. Looking at videos online, it would seem my mixture is too stiff, because any little tip of mixture left by the piping bag fails to 'melt' into the main part of the <em>macaron</em> - it simply sits there. Also, any little craters left by air holes in the mixture fail to smooth themselves out, so the result is a bumpy <em>macaron</em>.</p>

<p>Given that the egg whites <em>need</em> to be stiff and glossy, what else could be a factor in achieving a smooth <em>macaron</em>? I assume the amount of powdered sugar is a factor, but how much can I safely reduce the amount by?</p>

<p>The French say that when you take the whisk out of the meringue, it has to look a bit like a bird's beak, hence the way the meringue forms a soft peak slightly pointing downwards.</p>

<p>But to be honest, I don't believe that is you problem. I guess you just undermix your batter. People often say it has to fall like a ribbon or like magma, but I always thought that is hard to imagine. You can take a knife and cut through the batter. If it flows back immediately, it's ready. But let me tell you: One or two strokes too much with the spatula and the batter becomes unusable.</p>

<p>And one tip I can give you: The process of transferring the batter into the piping bag also 'mixes' the batter, so maybe don't go too far if you are unsure.</p>

<p>And as already said, it is important to tap the the tray from the bottom after piping as it helps to remove any air bubbles in there. Also, always pipe straight from the top (90° angle). This also helps the batter to smooth out.</p>

<p>I wouldn't recommend you to chance the amount of powdered sugar, as the French use Tant pour Tant (TPT) for their macarons, which means fine almond meal and powdered sugar are mixed proportional to each other.</p>

"How to identify a good espresso?","30814","","<p>During the last week I ordered many different espresso shots at coffee shops around the place where I work - some cheap, some expensive, some chains, some independent stores.  </p>

<p>As I heard that it is difficult to make a good espresso, I wasn't surprised that there were major differences in the outcome: While some where really watery and thin, others were pretty oily and thick. Of course, I also enjoyed some more than others.</p>

<p>That takes me to the question: How do I identify a good espresso? Are there any general ""guidelines"" on how an espresso should taste/smell? How should it be consistency wise?</p>
","<p>The standard espresso drink is the <strong>double espresso</strong> (a double espresso shot).  Although you can get single or triple espressos, if you are comparing quality, the double espresso is the standard.  Regardless of which type of shot you order, if you are comparing quality across different cafes, you should always order the same thing (ie don't order a single at one cafe and a double at another).</p>

<p>Once again for standardization, I would recommend ordering a double at each one.</p>

<p>My explanation of good espresso will be about <strong><em>straight espresso</em></strong> (<em>no milk, no sugar</em>) in an espresso mug/cup.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Here are some characteristics of a quality double shot:</strong></h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Temperature:</strong>

<ul>
<li>The espresso should be quite hot when served.  If it is only lukewarm or warm right after it is made, then the barista did not heat the cup that it was served in.</li>
<li>It should be to the temperature where it is too hot to drink (for most people).  It should only take a minute or so to cool off.  Perhaps two minutes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Crema:</strong>

<ul>
<li>There should be a nice layer of crema on top of the espresso (a few millimeters thick, completely covering the espresso).  This comes from the release of carbon dioxide when the espresso is extracted under pressure.</li>
<li>The color should be golden-brown to dark brown for a double shot.</li>
<li>The color will not always be uniform, it will sometimes be slightly lighter where the shot actually poured in the spot on the crema.</li>
<li>The crema should remain for at least three - five minutes if not longer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Taste:</strong>

<ul>
<li>The espresso should be bitter, but not too bitter (high levels of bitterness are more characteristic of espresso long shots).</li>
<li>It should be rich, but not too rich (again, high levels of richness are more characteristic of espresso ristretto shots).</li>
<li>It should NOT be sour.  If it is sour, it has been sitting for too long before being served or was over-extracted.</li>
<li>It should not taste watery, this is usually a characteristic of under-extraction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Smell:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Hard to describe for espresso and the aroma will vary a lot.  One thing to avoid is a 'sour' smell, which usually indicates a sour taste, as described above, or that the coffee being used is inherently too acidic.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consistency:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Espresso is going to be thicker and more viscous than regular drip coffee, but it won't be syrupy.  When you are done your espresso, the drop or two that remain at the bottom of the cup, when dried should leave a distinct brown residue on the bottom of the cup.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Notes, and other things to keep in mind:</h2>

<ul>
<li>You will have to remember that different cafes will use different varieties of beans for making espresso, so this is going to affect the flavor.</li>
<li>Different cafes use different amounts of ground espresso and different amounts of water when preparing their espresso.  The industry standard is 2 oz (about 60 milliliters) for a double shot, but in my cafe we do our double shots to 3 oz.</li>
<li><strong><em>Most importantly</em></strong>, learning to recognize good espresso is an experienced based endeavor, just like with wine, beer, or food.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>On a personal note</em>, I love to do this with cafes as well!  I always judge the quality of a cafes espresso and ability by ordering my favorite drink: <strong><em>a double espresso long</em></strong>.  In fact, I am going to a new cafe to do it today!!</p>

"Why add salt to the water when cooking rice?","30776","","<p>Given the great answer to the question on <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/2574/why-add-salt-to-the-water-when-cooking-pasta"">adding salt to water when cooking pasta</a>, I am curious whether the same explanation holds for rice as it does for pasta (flavor and starch gelation)? Is there more at work?</p>

<p>Flavor is true in my experience, but what else?</p>
","<p>For rice it depends.  Cooking any starch in water will first cause the starch granules to swell and eventually tangle up with each other (the gelatinization).  Dissolving sugars or salts in the water slows down the process by raising the temperature the swelling starts.  While few prefer pasta as a stuck blob of strands, the same is not the case for rice.  I like my Basmati loose, but my risotto and sushi sticky, so salt may be required for Basmati and optional for Arborio.</p>

<p>There are many techniques for controlling the starch for rice.  To control the starch gelatinization of rice:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://www.finecooking.com/recipes/boiled-basmati-rice.aspx"">cook it like pasta with lots of water, then drain</a>; or </li>
<li><a href=""http://blog.ideasinfood.com/ideas_in_food/2008/01/7-minute-risott.html"">par cook it</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Method 1 won't avoid the grain surface starch gelatinization, but it will help with stickiness (you may oil coat it after draining).  Method 2 delays the starch release allowing you to finish a risotto in seven minutes.  Cool for parties or for restaurants.</p>

"How much dried lemon zest to substitute for ""zest of one lemon""?","30642","","<p>Most recipes that use lemon zest call for ""zest of one lemon"" or some such amount. To avoid the bother of organic lemons that invariably go bad before I use them and having to fiddle with zesting I'd like to use dried zest soaked in lemon juice instead.</p>

<p>How should I substitute the amounts? I'm guesstimating that drying would reduce the volume by about half, but how much good fresh zest is there on a lemon in the first place?</p>
","<p>Use one teaspoon of dried zest for one tablespoon of fresh zest, which is about what you get from a lemon.</p>

<p>Most foods dry to about a third their original size, so I would use one third of the amount called for. Lemons vary a great deal in size, but the recipe probably means one tablespoon of fresh zest, which is normal for ""medium"" sized lemons.</p>

<p>Something to watch out for is that most cheap ""dried lemon peel"" products are actually made from the zest <em>and</em> a bit of the pith, which will both give you a bitter flavor and short you some of the lemon flavor you expect. Look closely at the zest you buy, if you can see that the individual pieces have two distinct layers, or a pale yellow or white color, steer clear of that brand. This is probably a ""get what you pay for"" situation, so spring for the higher end lemon zest.</p>

<p>I have also had great luck drying my own lemon zest. Unless your kitchen is humid, it will probably dry in a day or two just sitting on a plate on the counter.</p>

"How do you reduce static in a coffee grinder?","30584","","<p>Is there a way to reduce/eliminate the static buildup in a burr grinder?  I've tried a few different coffee grinders and inevitably on removing the grinds bin, I get a spray of coffee all over the counter.</p>
","<p>My grounds bin has a <em>lid</em>. So while the grounds still collect static, they don't fly all over the place when I remove the bin from the grinder. </p>

<p>Beyond that, try switching up your coffee. The cheap ""8 O'Clock"" stuff I keep on reserve is terribly staticy, while the beans I roast myself don't have nearly the trouble. I tend to enjoy a lighter roast, so keep that in mind - you might benefit from grinding beans with just a <em>bit</em> higher moisture content (of course, if you have a strong preference for dark roasts, this doesn't help much).</p>

"What is the difference between granulated cane sugar and granulated sugar?","30571","","<p>I see two types of sugar in the baking aisle that I can't differentiate: ""granulated sugar"" and ""granulated cane sugar"". The latter is considerably more expensive. So, what is the difference between granulated cane sugar and this (unspecified) granulated sugar, and why would I want to choose one over the other?</p>

<p>As I understand it, cane sugar is extracted exclusively from sugar cane, while the other kind (the one that is not labeled as cane) can be a mixture of sucrose from several sources. Is this difference enough to make one a better candidate when cooking? baking? sweetening tea/coffee?</p>
","<p>There is no real difference between types of granulated, white sugar. The options you are likely to see are cane sugar and beet sugar. Granulated sugar from sugarcane is often considered ""superior"" to beet sugar by Americans, but the idea that cane sugar is in any way superior to beet sugar has no basis. Granulated beet sugar and granulated cane sugar are completely interchangeable and indistinguishable. Swapping them will cause no issue.</p>

"How can I safely reuse tea?","30532","","<p>I regularly reuse my tea bags, sometimes over as much as a five hour span. </p>

<p>I am sure that there are limits to the safe re-use of tea, but I can't find any USDA or other authoritative guidance.  </p>

<p>What are reasonable precautions I can take to ensure that I am not putting myself at risk for foodborne illness?</p>

<p>Please provide evidence-based answers, not anecdotal reports.  I don't mind if the answers are somewhat speculative based on evidence from analogous food preparations.</p>
","<p>The issue here is how long do you steep the tea, at what temperature, and under what conditions do you store the used tea bags? The reason ""sun tea"" has been discouraged has been because of the likelihood that the tea leaves that are in the bags are contaminated with bacteria such that a long soak in luke-warm water such as that of the ""sun tea"" causes them to multiply to the extent that they become a serious health risk. Tea leaves are not typically pasteurized during their processing, and may carry viable bacteria and/ or bacterial spores.</p>

<p>If you were to soak the tea bad in warm water not hot enough to get a good bacterial kill initially, there may be enough viable bacteria in the tea leaves to grow during that 5 hour interval such that the next cup may be seriously dangerous (some may divide every 15 minutes, for example). However, if you were to adequately kill the bacteria and spores off by a nice hot soak (for this example, you would need to use a pressure cooker since some bacterial spores are not even killed by boiling water at atmospheric pressure), refrigerate the tea bag afterwards, and then reuse it 5 hours later it would likely be perfectly fine.</p>

<p>I think the final answer to your question comes down to your own personal risk tolerance and the conditions above. If you brew in luke-warm water or for a very brief time and then leave the bags out at room temperature you are just asking for trouble and eventually you may hit the loaded chamber in your own personal Russian roulette game.</p>

<p>For empiric answers, take your particular brewing temperature and time and compare it to the USDA tables for pasteurization. Then, look up the growth curves for the major pathogens at your storage temperature and figure out how many would likely be present after 5 hours (20 generations at 15 minutes per generation or 2^20 times more bacteria than viable after the brewing event at the end of the storage interval).</p>

"Do induction cookers increase risk of cracking cast iron?","30529","","<p>I recently purchased a counter-top, one element 1800W induction cooker, mostly just to see how well the technology worked compared to my gas range.</p>

<p>I took it out of the box and immediately threw about a half inch of water in a cast-iron skillet as a test and set the coil to max power. I noticed that the water began boiling almost immediately (impressive) but in very tight hot spots (two very clear concentric rings, presumably the shape of the coils or some magical physics property of the magnetic fields), taking a long time to spread to other areas (as expected with cast iron).</p>

<p>In fact, the hot spots heated up so quickly that the water was almost completely boiled before the handle had even a hint of warmth, and areas as close as a half inch or so to the hot spots remained cool to the touch for some time after the hot spots were hot enough to boil water. </p>

<p>My question is: Due to the rapid heating and large temperature differentials seen here, in practice does this lead to an increased incidence of cracking cast-iron with induction cookers? If so, what precautions should be taken (e.g. preheat cast-iron at a lower power first, only use cookware designed specifically for induction, etc.)?</p>
","<p>Cracking? No, not in my experience. I own like 20 cast iron skillets (I've been told I have a problem).</p>

<p>Warping? Yes. I have a 2,800 watt per burner commercial induction stove with a very small pattern like yours. If you repeatedly overheat a pan on high for searing, it will eventually bow outwards. Warping can be mitigated by preheating your pan gently.</p>

<p>That said, if the pan is full of water or oil (for deep frying, not stir fry) there is nothing to fear. I have had the same stainless stock pot for 8 years and I roast it on high all the time (with liquid). Water is a very effective coolant (it's what keeps your car engine from overheating). The likelihood that a pan full of water will overheat is very unlikely, nigh impossible.</p>

<p>Do I really only have 5 minutes to drink espresso before its no longer drinkable?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://www.baristaexchange.com/profiles/blogs/omg-they-re-dead"">This barista</a> says no, you can enjoy your shot for a little while:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In reality, there are only a couple of things that happen to espresso
  over the course of a few minutes.  First, the crema or foam that sits
  on top of the espresso reintegrates with the liquid.  Crema, on its
  own, contains some of the best flavors and aromatic qualities of the
  espresso in high concentrations.  Drinking it straight can be
  overwhelming but, it stands to reason, that having the crema
  reintegrate might actually be a good thing.  Second, the espresso
  cools down.  The temperature of espresso has a lot to do with how we
  taste the various flavors contained within it...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not an espresso fan myself--I like regular coffee, but not after it has cooled down, and never reheated.  Many folks are perfectly content to microwave a cold cup and drink it.</p>

<p>I imagine that older, colder espresso is palatable to you to the extent that you are willing to tolerate it.  A small shot of coffee--and lets face it, that is all espresso is, even if it is brewed in a fancy manner--is going to cool off much more rapidly than a full cup, or a full pot.</p>
