"How do you identify a plant?","103972","","<p>I'm pretty new to gardening and landscaping. Having recently bought a house, one of the things I'd like to be able to do is identify the trees and smaller plants that are on the property so I can learn how to take proper care of them. Rather than post a bunch of pictures here, how do you go about identifying unknown plants and trees? Are there resources (online and free are a bonus!) that you go to?</p>
","<p>There are a few plant identifier webpages where you can get answers (by color of the flower, shape of the leaves, etc.) and the page shows list of the matching plants. Sometimes it's not easy to identify. A few examples of those web pages:</p>

"How often should you mow a growing lawn?","102562","","<p>During the warm months when my grass is growing, is there a mowing schedule I can use to encourage the lawn to be green and healthy? Mine often seems ""unhappy"" when it's been cut (goes pale, some browning), which makes me want to mow it less-often.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can check to know when it's best to cut the grass?</p>
","<p>It doesn't matter so much how <em>often</em> you mow, as much as <em>how long</em> the grass is.</p>

<p>If your lawn looks yellow and dried out after you've mowed it, you probably have the blade on your mower set too low. Some people like a super-short lawn like a putting green, but doing this requires both a specific variety of grass and lots of extra care spent on fertilizing and other upkeep. Since you're probably not one of those people, your grass will be healthiest if you let it grow a little longer.</p>

<p>The first time I mow my lawn in the spring, I mow it on the longest setting. Subsequently I'll mow about every 1-2 weeks, depending on how much rain we've gotten (I don't ever water the lawn--we get plenty of rain where I live), moving the blade a little lower until it's on about the middle setting. Recently I've noticed that my lawn is looking a little yellow in patches, so I'm going to let it grow a little longer, then move the blade back up. If your lawn is in a similar state, you'd probably benefit from doing the same.</p>

<p>Conveniently, somewhat longer grass is also more comfortable to walk on barefoot.</p>

"Are household LED bulbs suitable as supplemental light for plants?","102473","","<p>I live at a fairly northerly latitude where we have limited hours of daylight during the winter. Low-wattage (5-8W) white LED bulbs seem to be becoming more common as a household light source. Do these LED bulbs provide suitable light for growing plants indoors over the winter?</p>
","<p>Plants need approximately the same wavebands of light that we humans see in; from violet to deep red, and on into the non-visible near infra-red (380 to 720ish nanometres - nm).</p>

<p>Normal incandescent bulbs deliver much of this, although special bulbs for plant growth are better - different spectra affect different aspects of plan growth, e.g. blue light can affect stem growth.</p>

<p>LEDs by contrast only emit light at very narrow peaks, and normal plant growth often needs a wider spectrum. At a push plants can get by on red LEDs emitting at 690nm with some supplementary light in the blue around 450nm, which can be supplied by some white LEDs. Many white LEDs emit in the approx. range around 450 to 550nm, which will not be enough alone to enable plant growth.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8kTPk.png"" alt=""Light Absorption Spectrum for Plants""></p>

<p>Check the image: the green lines are where you want your plant to be, so you can see that by relying only on white LEDs you won't be growing good berries. Supplementing with a few red LEDs (sorry I don't know how many you'd need, but look at the paper ""<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1198233/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Design and fabrication of adjustable red-green-blue LED light arrays for plant research</a>"" for information), and it will help a bit.  </p>

"Can I cut off exposed tree roots without harming the tree?","100077","","<p>Large trees often have roots protruding out of the ground around the base of the trunk (such as the ones that can push up sidewalks next to the tree). When is it safe to cut those roots (that might be a hazard to people running in the area near the tree), and when should you be worried about that causing damage to the tree?</p>
","<p>There is some guidance <a href=""http://aces.nmsu.edu/ces/yard/2003/071203.html"">here</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is difficult to say how much of a tree's root system can be removed. I prefer to talk about how close to the tree you can cut roots. I teach a concept called ""Critical Root Radius (CRR)"" which recommends not cutting roots inside the CRR. This Critical Root Radius (radius, not diameter, in feet) is calculated by measuring the diameter (not radius or circumference) of the trunk (in inches, not feet) at four and one-half feet from the ground and multiplying by 1.5. A tree with a five-inch diameter trunk (at the four and one-half foot level) will have a CRR of 7.5 feet. The CRR provides a general guideline.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and <a href=""http://www.mortonarb.org/?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=698&amp;Itemid=6"">here</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Balance between the tree’s crown (top) and root system is important for maintaining healthy trees. When roots are lost for any reason, the imbalance creates stress. A tree usually has 4 to 7 major roots. Cutting just one of them within a few feet of the trunk can remove up to 25 percent of the root system.</p>

<p>Other than or in addition to pulling it meticulously, what's the best strategy to remove grass from my flower bed and then keep it from coming back?</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, the only effective means I've found of removing it without damaging nearby plants is pulling it up by hand.  If it's so overgrown that the roots are intertwined this can be almost impossible.  You didn't specify what kind of grass, but from my experience, Bermuda grass is very invasive and will spread like crazy...especially if you have some well tilled flower beds with good soil for it to spread into.  Bermuda grass is hard to kill even with Roundup.  If you are able to get it out, the best control method is prevention.</p>

"How do I remove dandelions without damaging my lawn?","93254","","<p>My lawn is infested with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taraxacum"">dandelions</a>. Although they're benign, the flowers are fun to play with and the plant has <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taraxacum#Properties"">several useful properties</a>, it sure is an eyesore and I'd like to get rid of it. How can I eradicate this weed without damaging my lawn?</p>

<p><sub>Source: Wikimedia commons</sub></p>
","<p>There are several ways of removing these dandelions from your lawn:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you have a <a href=""http://www.american-lawns.com/grasses/cool_season_grasses.html"">cool-season lawn</a> and are happy to take the chemical route, you could use a selective weedkiller containing 2,4-D or MCPP, such as <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0026KTT4U"">Trimec</a>, Speedzone or Momentum, which are best applied in mid-spring or early fall</p></li>
<li><p>You could hand-weed using <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0030MIHAU"">this tool</a> which has received excellent reviews, and would make your task much easier; however, bear in mind that if you leave even a small fragment of dandelion root in the soil, it will produce a new plant.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Good lawn maintenance is also essential to keep your lawn weed-free:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since dandelions thrive on thin weak turf, a good preventative measure is proper lawn maintenance.</p>
  
  <p>Mow high and mow often. Mowing high means keeping your grass on the longer side of its optimal height. This keeps the soil cooler and provides shade that restricts the growth of annual weeds. Weed seeds on the soil surface need the heat of the sun to flourish. Scalping your lawn is an open invitation for weeds. Second, once weeds have already invaded your lawn, frequent mowing will keep them in check. A weed can't form seedheads when its topmost growth keeps getting lopped off.</p>
  
  <p>Fertilize at the correct times. The goal is to feed your lawn, not your weeds. Cool season grasses should be fertilized in early spring and late fall. Fertilizing cool season grasses in the heat of the summer will only promote more weeds. Warm season grasses should be fertilized at the height of their growth period in the summer. Avoid feeding in the cooler spring or summer when the weeds are likely to emerge.</p>
  
  <p>Water deeply and infrequently. There are weed seeds hiding out in your lawn just waiting for the right conditions to emerge. Those seeds grow best when kept damp with light frequent watering.</p>
  
  <p>Reseed in the Fall. The fall is the best time to reseed for several reasons. Grass has nine months to get its roots deep and to get more established before facing the summer heat. It has a better chance surviving than grass planted in the spring. In the North, crabgrass and other weeds complete their life cycles in the fall and die out. So they aren't there to compete with the new seedlings for space, water, and soil nutrients.</p>

"Why do people paint some tree trunks white at the bottom?","93085","","<p>I've seen trees with the lower trunks painted white in a number of places around the world but have never found a definite answer to why this is done. Some suggestions that I've heard are to make them more visible at night time so people don't walk into them. Another is to make it easier for birds to see bugs on the trunk. Does anybody know why you would paint part of a tree white? What type of paint you would use? And why that paint doesn't damage the tree?</p>
","<p>In ""The Garden Primer"" (Damrosch), p 422:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple borers can also kill the tree outright just by tenneling in through the trunk [...] Painting the trunk with white latex paint diluted to 50 percent will make it easier to spot the sawdust residue produced by the larvae's tunneling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similar advice is in the Fedco Trees catalog; they suggest mixing white latex paint with joint compound.</p>

<p>Also in ""Primer"" on p 659:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another danger to the trunk in winter is sun scald [...]. You can protect younger trunks from winter sun and wind by wrapping them in burlap or painting the trunks with white paint.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This same advice is repeated in ""The Backyard Orchardist"" (Otto), p43. She actually says to paint not only the trunk, but scaffolds out to nine inches from the trunk.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure I've seen a mixture of something involving white latex paint to apply to the trunk that is supposed to deter four-legged pests. (I want to say that the recipe had sand in it so that any deer/rodent tasting the bark would get an unpleasant mouth feeling and would avoid the tree, but I can't put my hands on a reference right now.

","<p>I think you have <a href=""https://ipm.illinois.edu/diseases/rpds/926.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cucumber mosaic virus</a>, because of the mosaicing, curling, and drying of the leaves, and the stop in production, plus the time frame of infection matches perfectly.</p>

<p>There is no cure. What you can do is try to keep it from spreading, which is done by removing affected plants from the environment. Burn or seal them in bags to prevent the virus spreading. Do not add to your composting system. </p>

<p>It is spread by any insect that feeds on cucumber family plants. When they land on an infected plant, and then land on another one, the disease will spread. I would suggest that you remove the affected plant immediately, and keep an eye on the remaining one. If the other one hasn't contracted the disease, yet, hopefully removing the mosaiced one will greatly decrease the likelihood of contraction. Another thing that reduces (but not eliminates) the chances of catching the virus is laying out an insect barrier early in the season. This keeps away most contact with virus carrying insects.</p>

<p>And the brown spots at the base of the stem appear to be corking, which is when an herbaceous plant builds up corky material on older stems when they increase in diameter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Symptoms</h3>
  
  <p>Cucurbit plants may become infected at any stage of growth, from emergence of the seedling to near
  maturity. External symptoms may develop within four or five days after young plants become infected,
  but may take up to 14 days to develop when the foliage is older and more mature. Symptoms develop
  more rapidly at 79° to 89°F (26° to 32°C) than at 61° to 75°F (16° to 24°C). The severity of symptoms
  is at least partially related to the virus concentration. CMV symptoms in cucumber are more severe on
  plants exposed to short days or reduced light than on plants exposed to long days and bright light.
  Cucurbit plants rarely become infected in the seedling stage. When this happens, the cotyledons may turn
  yellow and wilt. New leaves are slightly mottled a yellowish green, remain small, wrinkled, and distorted.
  Plants infected in the seedling stage remain dwarfed or may die, and seldom produce fruit. <a href=""https://ipm.illinois.edu/diseases/rpds/926.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><sub>Source</sub></a></p>

","<p>Cedar is the most commonly available rot resistant wood. There is another solution which lacks aesthetic qualities but adds years to the life of wood.  Wood rots when it is constantly moist. Here's how to avoid this and use any wood you can get that is not treated:</p>

<ul>
<li>dig a trench about 3 inches wide and six inches deep around the perimeter of your bed.</li>
<li>add two to three inches of 3/4 to 7/8 crushed gravel and tamp down</li>
<li>start assembling your wooden raised bed </li>
<li>on the side of the wood facing the soil line it with an impermeable layer. ( I happen to have some pond liner left over which does a great job but you can also use 40 - 60 mil plastic sheeting used for covering insulation.  This plastic should last five years if covered.)</li>
<li>place your wood and liner in the trench, back fill with soil and you are done</li>

<p>Here is a <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080707171641.htm"">nice article</a> from sciencedaily.com that talks about the benefits of adding coffee grounds to your compost pile. Some excerpts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>On the general benifit of coffee grounds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coffee grounds can be an excellent addition to a compost pile. The grounds are relatively rich in nitrogen, providing bacteria the energy they need to turn organic matter into compost.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>On adding them directly to the soil.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mix grounds into soil as an amendment. Make sure to keep them damp. Add some nitrogen fertilizer if you do this, as coffee grounds encourage the growth of microbes in the soil, which use up nitrogen. While microbes are breaking down the grounds, the nitrogen will provide a source of nutrients for your plants</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>On composting it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Add grounds to your compost pile, layering one part leaves to one part fresh grass clippings to one part coffee grounds, by volume. Turn once a week. This will be ready in three to six months.
  Or, put them in an existing unturned pile. Just make sure to add a high carbon source, such as leaves to balance it.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>It also advises against adding uncomposted grounds near plants.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... uncomposted coffee grounds are NOT a nitrogen fertilizer... Germination tests in Eugene showed that uncomposted coffee grounds, added to soil as about one-fourth the volume, showed poor germination and stunted growth in lettuce seed. Therefore, they need to be composted before using near plants.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>The method you choose depends on how much coffee you drink (i.e., how much coffee grounds you generate) and how much time &amp; patience you have.</p>

<p>Composted coffee grounds are probably the best, as they provide a good source of nitrogen and mildly acidic soil. However, if you don't want to get involved in composting, I think you'll be fine putting coffee grounds directly in the soil and mixing it slightly. It probably might take a little longer to break down on its own, but it'll be ok. Coffee ""tea"" is also one way of doing it, but I think it's more of a diluted one-time fertilizer drink for the plant. You don't get the same benefit as having the coffee grounds in the soil, which dissolve a little bit of nutrients each day and encourage growth of microbes. </p>

<p>Coffee grounds are great for plants that like slightly acidic soil like tomatoes and blueberries. They're also good for azaleas, if you grow them (I found this out just today, when I read the contents of an azalea special fertilizer mix). I don't drink coffee myself, but I go to the local starbucks and get a bagful of used coffee grounds which I then use as fertilizer for the above plants in my garden.</p>

<li>After removing about 4 inches, the dirt becomes very clay-like, so I don't anticipate any settling. I will be tilling the clay with soft dirt and fertilizer before the sod</li>
</ul>
","<p><strong>Before you do anything, call DIG SAFE or its local equivalent.</strong> Hitting a gas line will ruin your day. (Hitting a sewer pipe won't be much fun either.)</p>

<p>You could rent a tractor with a front-end loader, a wheeled loader, a skid-steer with a loader (""bobcat""), backhoe with a front-end loader.</p>

<p>If you don't need to haul the soil away, you could rent a small bulldozer. With this strategy, you'll need a place to push the dirt.</p>

<p>If you are hauling it away, you'll want to think about the truck and how you'll unload it. In other words: shoveling dirt out of the back of a pickup is a hassle, consider a dump trailer, see below.</p>

<p>Regarding skill level:</p>

<ul>
<li>At the low end, wheeled loaders (tractor, backhoe) are probably the easiest to use. (I've been driving tractors since I was a kid, so I'm guessing at the skill level required for a novice.)
<ul>
<li>Be careful when dumping into the truck (or trailer, see below) not to hit the sides with the bucket!</li>
<li>Be careful when dumping into the truck that you don't bump the front of the machine into the side of the truck!</li>
<li>Be careful of overhead clearance near power lines!</li>
<li>Some machines have the tendency to tip forward when the bucket is loaded. If you don't have a lot of weight in the back, beware of tipping forward. (Especially when you're next to the truck...)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Beware that the arm hanging off the rear of the backhoe is easy to bump into stuff while you're backing and turning. I'd avoid the backhoe if you have any kind of obstacles and there's any other machine available. Otherwise be <em>very</em> aware of where the arm is while you're maneuvering around the yard.</li>
<li>Getting the soil even and level as you work is harder than it looks, and takes a fair amount of skill and practice to do quickly. I own a tractor with a loader, I don't use it much for this kind of work, and it takes me a while to get an area somewhat level -- and then I end up finishing with a hand rake. I know current/former full-time equipment operators who can do the whole job with the tractor in about a quarter of the time it takes me, not including the time I'd spend raking. (And I've been doing this a while and get semi-regular practice -- the point is that it takes a lot of practice to get good.)</li>
<li>The controls on the bulldozer might take some getting used to. I haven't used a bulldozer but I know enough that the controls operate differently.</li>
</ul>

<p>Things to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>As Scott Bruns mentions in his answer, make sure the loader can reach the truck you'll be loading.</li>
<li>You need to move about 25-35 cubic yards of material. A standard full-size pickup truck can hold about 2-2.5 yards. Beware that a yard of topsoil weighs 2000-2500 pounds. So a half-ton pickup can only carry about half a yard. That's 20 loads or more. Consider renting a dump trailer. Just make sure your truck has the tow capacity for the amount you load on the trailer. A trailer will generally reduce the clearance/height requirement for your loader; you won't have to lift as high. And a dump trailer reduces your labor requirement for unloading. (The trailer rental fee is much cheaper than the cost of repairing springs on your truck.)</li>
<li>You're going to remove the top 4-6"" of soil. What's underneath that? If you have really deep topsoil (12"" or more), then you'll maybe do ok. But a lot of residential developments have maybe 2"" of topsoil over the top of cheap fill (which is probably either heavy clay or very sandy depending on where you live and what's available nearby).
<ul>
<li>If you're in the shallow topsoil situation, you're going to have a hard time getting a lawn to grow where you remove the topsoil.</li>
<li>You may need to remove <em>extra</em> material and then add back good topsoil.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You might be able to get away with eyeballing the area to get it level. But if you want to do a professional quality job, get a surveyor's transit and use it to level the area. (You'll need a helper unless you get a laser.)</li>

"Should I remove the dead flower heads from my hydrangea?","89803","","<p>Earlier this year, I bought a hydrangea (from Ikea of all places!) and planted it out in the garden. It flowered nicely for a while, but the flowers have pretty much finished now and nearly all of the original leaves have withered.</p>

<p>New leaves are sprouting from the old leaf joints, but should I be removing the old flower heads above them?</p>

<p>The stems seem pretty sturdy, which makes me think I'd be doing it no favours if I took the tops off. For what it's worth, I'm in Northumberland in the UK.</p>
","<p>Yes, in general, you should remove the dead flowers. However, there are exceptions.</p>

<h3>Why you should remove:</h3>

<p>Remember that a plant's ""mission"" is to reproduce before it dies, to ensure the survival of its species (producing flowers is the first step). If you let the flowers stay till they drop off on their own, the plant, satisfied that it has successfully produced a flower, might decide to stop producing them (end of the flowering season). </p>

<p>However, when you remove the dead flowers you're sort of ""tricking"" the plant into thinking that its previous mission has failed (i.e., it hasn't produced a flower to ensure its survival). This in turn encourages the plant to produce even more flowers, resulting in larger, more frequent blooms. This is also a commonly used technique to extend the flowering season of annuals and perennials.</p>

<h3>When you should stop removing:</h3>

<p><a href=""http://extension.missouri.edu/extensioninfonet/article.asp?id=1355"">This article</a> has a very good reason to stop removing dead flowers before the onset of winter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a plant such as a continuous blooming rose, you should stop cutting spent flowers in September, allowing them to wither and dry on the bush. This signals the plant that its mission is indeed complete, and that it should ready itself for the coming winter. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, if you keep removing the flowers beyond late fall, sure you'll have more bloom, but your plant will not be prepared for the winter (i.e., stockpiling energy, reducing energy consumption, and shedding leaves) and might wither and die in the cold. This was something I didn't know, having not lived in a place with a winter season</p>

"How far (on average) do tree roots extend out from the base of the tree?","83964","","<p>I a looking to plot out my new garden site for next year and am wondering how far I need to be away from some nearby trees. The trees are a few different types (apple, oak, pine etc.) and anywhere from 20-40 feet tall. I am trying to see if there is a way to tell/guess how far the roots will reach before I start digging and find out the hard way.</p>
","<p>The roots of most trees are shallow (i.e., not more than 1' to 1.5' deep), but spread out very wide (see the picture below from <a href=""http://www.treesaregood.com/treecare/avoiding_construction.aspx"">here</a>)
. Given the height of your trees, they're not very young and you can be sure that the roots spread at least as far out as the tree is tall. Add a factor of half to that for every 10 years of the tree's life. Note that this is only a rough approximation and if you need a better estimate, you'll have to contact an arborist.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WG1TG.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>However, your trouble is going to be finding out <em>where</em> the roots are. I'm afraid you'll have to find that out only the hard way. In some cases, you can get an indication of which direction the primary roots radiate by looking at the base of the trunk, but not any more. </p>

<p>I've never found a need to leave <em>that</em> much space around a tree. As long as you don't dig too close to the tree, you'll be pretty fine planting stuff like 4-5 feet away from it (if you hit a root, then just dig a little to the side of it). Also, the further out you go, the lesser you'll have to worry about damage to the tree from digging. Trees can easily take a hit in few of their tertiary roots and not even be aware of it. </p>

<hr>

<p>bstpierre makes a very good point that Oak has a tap root which grows deep downward instead of out (think carrots). In this case, the foot print will be a lot smaller.</p>

<p>Also, another common rule of thumb is that the roots spread out 2-3x times the crown width. This is very true in the fig family and the like, where the trees grow moderately in height, but have a wide canopy like crown. See <a href=""http://www.extension.iastate.edu/pages/tree/roots.html"">this page</a> at Iowa State University Extension for more details.</p>

"Is throwing grass seed without dirt enough?","75281","","<p>I have seen some people throw seed without using dirt. Is it less or more efficient ? </p>

<p>Here is this video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-X9OupsOo"">here</a> that shows what I am talking about</p>
","<p>In the video, he applies a soil-based topdressing material after spreading seed on the lawn. I'm not sure where you're getting the ""without using dirt"" from. If you simply throw grass seed onto compacted soil, you will get poor germination.</p>

<p>I'm not a lawn expert, but if I was going to go to the cost and effort of spreading grass seed on my existing lawn, I would definitely spread a thin layer of finely sifted compost or topsoil over the top of the seed. If you have bare spots, I think it would be worth the effort to scratch these up so that the seeds make good soil contact when they land there.</p>

"How do you tell if a tree is male or female?","74681","","<p>I was reading through some of the questions on fruit trees, because I've been thinking about getting some blueberry bushes and cherry trees, and I see a lot of people mentioning that the trees don't self-pollinate, and that you need a male and a female tree to get fruit.</p>

<p>I thought that flowers had both male and female parts, and that the pollination was just from bees transferring pollen to other parts of the flowers. But to me, that sounds like there are trees that have flowers with only female parts, and trees with flowers that have only male parts. And then trees that self-pollinate that have both flowers.</p>

<p>If there are trees that are only male or female, then how do you tell what sex of tree you have? Do you have to look at the flowers to know?</p>
","<p>Some trees have a single ""gender"" but many do not.  The way to tell is to see if the male (pollen) parts are present on separate flowers on different trees from the ""female"" (ovary - ie, infant fruit) parts.  Also, you should be aware that issues with pollination may not always be related to needing both ""male"" and ""female"" trees around - sometimes a tree has what is called a ""perfect"" flower (with both male and female parts) but because the pollen from the male portion does not ripen at the same time or is in some other way incompatible with the female portion, it may require others of its kind around with different pollination times in order to set fruit.  Apples are that way, sometimes, as are hazelnuts.  This is why you often see recommended pollinators listed for certain apple varieties.  </p>

<p>Bushes are the same way - some have only one gender as well.  So do some fruiting vines, like Kiwi, which for the most part require one male kiwi for every 8 females.  There is at least one self-fruitful variety - Issai.  But even those fruiting plants that are self-fruitful will often be even more productive with additional pollinators.  </p>

<p>A little research on the type of fruit trees you have should turn up any issues of flower gender and suggestions for providing the best pollinators/pollinating environment so that your trees can be as productive as possible. </p>

"Does Dawn dishwashing detergent kill plants (shrubs & flowers)?","68197","","<p>Yesterday I was talking to my neighbor, and he was telling me he was cleaning the trim on his house with Dawn (dishwashing detergent used in the US) mixed in water. I thought I read somewhere that Dawn can damage or kill plants. Is this true? I was thinking about trying this myself, but have shrubs and flowers under the trim I want to clean.</p>
","<p>I've used sudsy dish soap such as Dawn before to combat insects such as aphids and it is quite effective and the one I used (it wasn't Dawn specifically) was biodegradable and that's important to me.</p>

<p>The key to using Dawn or anything (siding cleaner, bleach, etc.) around plants is that you need to lower the concentration of the chemical low enough that it doesn't harm the plants.  A number of years ago I cleaned my siding with a soapy liquid something like Dawn with bleach in it.  In preparation for this I thoroughly soaked the vegetation with water - I DRENCHED it to be sure - and then cleaned the siding as prescribed by the cleaner, then I hosed all my plants down again, ensuring that any of the cleaner was highly diluted.  </p>

<p>Plants are pretty resilient and tend to fare well under some extreme conditions.  A little insurance in the form of a good hosing down before/after the cleaning should be all they need.</p>

<p>What plants (vegetables/fruits) will grow well in this climate?</p>
","<p>I live in Vegas and have grown lettuce, spinach, and carrots and am now working on growing cucumbers and zucchini. (I'll let you know in about 6 more weeks how that turned out.)</p>

<p>I use a ""raised"" bed (actually, I dug about a foot down [boy, was that caliche fun] then used top soil and compost from Star Nursery instead of the horrible soil we have here) and created furrows, then planted seeds as per the packages. I kept the soil moist until I saw sprouts, then just made sure to water every couple of days after that. I got two good harvests of lettuce and spinach before the bugs <strong>devoured</strong> everything. The carrots turned out good since nothing seemed to be nibbling them underground. This time around I'm using a floating row cover over a PVC structure (sort of looks like a mini-quonset) to see if that helps. </p>

","<p>Fire is a great idea. I highly recommend it. I had a stump in my yard a few years ago and a friend lit a small fire on top (enough to burn for an hour or so) and just left it. The fire burned out the stump and all the roots which subsequently collapsed. There was a bit of a hole to be filled, but it was gone within 48 hours and about 20 minutes of light labour. No digging. No special equipment.</p>

<p>Obviously there are dangers to lighting fires in your yard so take resonable precautions. Also don't do this if the stump is above gas mains... </p>

<p>Fire is super underrated for stump removal! Other people will give answers like, ""spend 15 hours digging it out"" or ""spend hundreds of dollars"" - bad ideas. Burn it!</p>

"Which side of a house will get the most sunlight?","56172","","<p>Which side of a house will get the most sunlight?  Articles on the internet seem to have conflicting answers. Is this because it is dependent on location?</p>
","<p>In general, it depends on your location. In the northern hemisphere, the south side gets the bulk of the sun, because the sun is in that half of the sky. </p>

<p>But if you are on a hill, or have a hill to the east or west, it can significantly shorten your solar 'day'.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you are in an area that tends to get morning fog, east-facing will get less effective sun than west-facing, because by afternoon the sun will have burned off the fog.</p>

<p>Finally, elevation matters. Higher floors will get more sun because they ""see"" more of the sky.</p>

<p>So in general, the south-west of the house will get the most sun, with upper floors receiving more than lower floors.</p>

","<p>More often than not, Morning Glories will only produce buds and flowers on <strong>poor</strong> soil (i.e. if they feel their survival is threatened); if the soil is high in nitrogen and very fertile, they grow away, producing a lot of lush foliage and stubbornly refuse to flower. You did well not to add any fertilizer to the soil before planting, but I suspect that the manure you incorporated is the main culprit here; it has probably made your soil too rich.</p>

<p>Morning Glories also prefer sunshine throughout the day, and <em>dry</em> to moist soil. The fact that they are only receiving morning sun (the late-afternoon sun will be of little benefit) and, during the heat, have been watered twice a day, are almost certainly contributory factors. Morning Glories are deep-rooting, and over-frequent (particularly superficial) watering will simply encourage them to surface-root and stress them; it can also make them vulnerable to disease by depriving them of essential elements which are washed down into the sub-soil.</p>

<p>The distinctive yellowing between the veins of the lower leaves in your photos leads me to think that this may, in fact, have happened, and that the plants may be suffering from an iron deficiency; this can easily be remedied with a foliar feed - see article by the University of Arizona Extension <a href=""http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/garden/az1415.pdf"">here</a> - which you could give them next Spring.</p>

"When should I pile more dirt onto a growing potato plant?","45930","","<p>I've heard that I should be piling dirt onto my potato plants as they grow so that I end up with little mounds.</p>

<p>My potato plants have started to poke through the surface.  Should I totally cover them?  By how much?</p>

<p>What is the purpose of this, anyway?</p>
","<p>The whole point of 'earthing up' potatoes is to promote as much growth of potatoes along the stem while also protecting the potatoes from being exposed to light.  If the growing potatoes are exposed to sunlight, they will produce the toxin solanine and become inedible.  You know that spuds have been exposed to light because they also turn green due to the production of chlorophyll.</p>

<p>I start earthing up my potatoes when the leafy bits are just under 12 inches tall, making sure I leave some of the leaves exposed to the sun so they can carry on photosynthesizing - so not completely covered. I then do it once again a week or two later (depending on how fast they're growing) essentially until I run out of soil.  The potato mounds in my garden are about a foot high or so. </p>

<p>Another way to ensure your young potatoes aren't exposed to light is to use black plastic to cover the soil, although this method requires you actively water your plants as the rain can't get through.  A benefit of using plastic is that you have to do very little digging to get to your potatoes.  This year I used a combination of earthing up and putting a thin layer of newspaper and grass clippings over the soil.  We'll see how that goes...</p>

"Can salt be used to control weeds permanently?","45867","","<p>I was reading over <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/5206/608"">here</a> that salt can be used to control weeds in paved areas?</p>

<ol>
<li>Is salt an effective way to kill all (or most) plant types?</li>
<li>Is it a permanent solution?</li>
<li>Will using salt affect ground water (I have a bore) and nearby gardens?</li>
</ol>
","<p>Yes, salt will kill plants. In theory, if you use enough of it in the soil, it will kill a tree.</p>

<p>Regarding whether its permanent, no, its not. If you saturate open ground with salt, everything dies, and, by and large, nothing grows for some months, even years. In your case, you want to know whether it works permanently when its been applied to paving. No, is the answer, it will wash through eventually, so you will need to re apply.</p>

<p>Yes, using lots of salt to kill weeds will affect ground water, although how much its affected depends entirely on how much you use and how often. A small amount occasionally is unlikely to cause much harm.</p>

<p>But there is one other factor to consider - salt damages concrete and other paving materials. Damage occurs from the use of salt/grit mixes on concrete or paved surfaces as a de-icing solution - it's more likely to occur when used neat on paving, even if you're trying to only get it in the cracks. It is toxic to plants and other forms of life within the soil, and the risk of run off onto planted areas when it rains should also be considered.</p>

<p>Personally, I would not recommend it. The use of salt as a weedkiller because it's believed to be 'organic' and less toxic than a commercially available tailored-for-purpose path weedkiller is erroneous - salt, used frequently, is much more toxic in comparison to one or two applications of path herbicide a year, assuming the herbicide is intended for amateur garden use rather than professional agriculture.</p>

Our front yard is sod and has been doing fine, but the back is a heavy clay mix since the developers scraped off the top soil and sold it (so we've been told). </p>

<p>I have tried a fescue mix in the past, but it seems to die out rather quickly in Mid-July when the heat is at it's strongest. </p>

<p>Are there any specific seed mixes that work better in clay, or other techniques that can help us with our yard?</p>
","<p>I've seen this many times in new subdivisions.  The worst was a house with heavy clay soil where a year after the builder left you could still roll up the grass.  As you have found grass finds it hard to get roots into a compacted clay subsoil.</p>

<p>I assume that you are not able to remove the existing grass and add two to six inches of topsoil.  That would solve your problem immediately but would change the drainage around your house and that's never a good thing.</p>

<p>Stopping the grass from browning out in the summer when water loss due to heat is more than the roots can take up from the soil could be as simple as watering once a week during the dry periods.</p>

<p>A longer term solution is to sow more grass seed and top dress twice a year, spring and fall, with compost to a depth of 1/4"" to 1/2"".</p>

<p>Another solution that is hard to back out of is to plant clover and thyme.  Clover will <a href=""http://landscaping.about.com/cs/lawns/a/clover_lawns_3.htm"">break up the clay and add nitrogen</a> but cannot be easily removed once added to a lawn.</p>

<p>As far as grass mixtures for most homeowners the choices are ""Shady lawn"" or ""All purpose"".
The only difference is the ratio of different grass species.  For real success you need to improve the underlying soil.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/08-017.htm"">Good mowing practices help too</a>.  Cut late in the spring and cut as high as you can stand to let the roots store energy.

"Why is my new Acer tree dying?","45669","","<p>I recently bought a small red Acer and moved it into a more permanent pot.

The pot is about 1 foot in diameter and 2 feet tall, and has a drainage hole in the bottom about 1 1/2 inch in diameter.</p>

<p>I live in the UK and it's been very warm the last few weeks but we've also had a few downpours. I've watered it a few times but not every night. It's in direct sun from about 10 am to 2 pm.</p>

","<p>First, your Acer is not dying, it's just very unhappy. This is a common problem on Acer palmatum varieties here in the UK- usually, the cause is wind, that is, you've placed the plant in a spot which isn't sheltered enough. They hate windy areas, and they don't like hot midday sun in high summer either. What they do like is dappled sunlight, or morning sun, or afternoon sun, just not roasting hot sun in the middle of the day, but a sheltered, non windy spot is critical.</p>

<p>I agree with other's comments about drainage - you may have been watering more to obviate the shrivelled leaves, thinking drought was causing that; that would explain why the soil in the pot looks very damp, but if you have no drainage holes in your pot, it's critical that you make some, or change the pot. If there's a single hole in the bottom, and you've crocked it, that's fine as it is. Water copiously when you see or feel the compost on the top is slightly dry to the touch - but don't wait till it's shrunken from the sides of the pot. It will take a while for your tree to put out roots well into the compost to pick up moisture, so in the meantime, it's a small rootball surrounded by soil which shouldn't be allowed to dry out too much.</p>

<p>A word about compost though - Acer palmatum varieties do not like limey or alkaline growing mediums, and you don't say what you used to pot it up. It doesn't look like there's a compost problem, I'm 100% sure this is a 'not sheltered enough' problem, but if you used something that was alkaline, change the compost. Use ericaceous - they don't really need high acid, but at least you'll know it's not alkaline, and it won't do any harm.</p>

<p>Last year (1st summer) it produced a small amount of blossom. This year it produced a lot of blossom but no fruit but it has gone into a growth spurt. I haven't lost any blossoms due to winter freezes and I didn't ""dead head"" it. I'm in Manchester and we did have a dry spring. </p>

<p>I gave it some garden compost last winter and I've fed it every 2 weeks with a general fruit &amp; vegetable feed (I do not remember the brand/contents). I watered the garden every other day with a hose pipe. I watered the ground around the tree for 20-30 seconds until surface water started forming and then moved on.</p>

<p>Is there anything I could do to encourage it to produce fruit next year? It is supposed to be self fertile.</p>
","<p>The Victoria Plum <em>is</em> <a href=""http://www.keepers-nursery.co.uk/product.aspx?id=VICTOR"">self-fertile</a> and, although cropping can be improved by a compatible <a href=""http://www.keepers-nursery.co.uk/searchpolpartner.aspx?id=VICTOR"">pollination partner</a>, it should fruit satisfactorily without one.</p>

<p>There are a number of possible reasons why your tree is not producing any fruit:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It may be too young; plum trees usually start cropping when they are 4 or 5 years old, depending on the rootstock that has been used.</p></li>
<li><p>You may be overfeeding it - once every fortnight seems excessive and is likely to promote lush leaf growth at the expense of fruit, which the growth spurt you mention suggests may have happened; one good feed (perhaps 4 oz/140g of Growmore per square yard) in early Spring, followed by a compost mulch in mid-Spring, should be enough to keep it healthy and encourage fruiting. Overfeeding will also make it more susceptible to disease. I don't have a plum tree, but I have two apple trees, and prefer to take the organic route; I feed them only once a year in Spring, with compost and chicken manure pellets (at the rate mentioned above) which I also use on my vegetable plot, and although the soil in which they are growing isn't the best, they always fruit really well.</p></li>
<li><p>The blossom it produced may have been scorched by a late frost, although I gather from your comment that this is unlikely.</p></li>

Two theories persist about how Poa trivialis is introduced to a turf stand. Some believe that Poa trivialis grows naturally over most of the world and Poa trivialis seeds or stolons can germinate after lying dormant for many years, thus contaminating a turf stand. Others believe that it is introduced as a contaminant in turf seed and seed producers growers have since self-imposed Poa trivialis growing and shipping restrictions to help prevent this.</p>

","<p>Your tap water will have particular properties depending on where you live, the source of your water, and whether you have some sort of water softener or filtering system. My tap water, for example, is from the public system and is considered 'hard' because it has a high mineral (calcium and/or magnesium) content.  If I use tap water consistently on certain plants, I can see white rings of calcium deposits sitting on the soil surface; this can change the chemical properties - such as the pH - of the soil which can affect plant growth. Softened water has higher levels of salt than plants prefer, and these salts can build up in the soil. I've never seen the chlorine in public water causing any ill effects on my plants, but if you have sensitive house-plants you can let chlorine-treated water sit out for 24 hours to let the chlorine evaporate. As long as you live in an area that isn't subject to extremely acidic rain, rainwater is preferable because it's missing things like excessive minerals or disinfectant chemicals.  </p>

","<p>The shortest answer is no. I have grape vines all over the property, and they will re-sprout from any stems underground, and from any roots thicker than 1/4"" in diameter. The best method to remove them, in my experience, is to trim all excess vegetation in the hedge bushes 8"" from the ground, down, with the crowns cleaned out, and cut everything else out to the ground level every few weeks. Tearing the roots out in moderation may help, but excessive digging will greatly weaken the hedge. This will be difficult at the beginning, but it looks great and well cared for when your done, and the vines underneath will eventually weaken due to the loss of photosynthesis. Also, putting a two foot wide strip of water-penetrable plastic down under each side of the hedge, leaving space for the bushes, and then adding a three inch layer of dyed wood chips helps greatly in keeping down weeds, and also looks great.

"How to get rid of insects on basil while leaving the leaves safe to eat?","36224","","<p>With reference to this question: <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/1223/insect-infestation-on-my-pepper-plant-what-do-i-do"">Insect infestation on my pepper plant, what do I do?</a></p>

<p>I have these insects in my indoor ""kitchen window sill"" basil and they do seem to be chewing it fast enough to slow new growth, which is annoying. </p>

<p>The first suggested solution to getting rid of the insects is to spray them off the plant outside and then submerge the plant for long enough to drown any remaining. If I did this to my basil, wouldn't it drown the basil too? As I understand it, basil doesn't like wet feet.</p>

<p>What is the best solution to getting rid of such insects and still being able to use the leaves in food without hassle? Maybe the water spraying and drowning as suggested in related question is still the best?</p>

<p>ADDITION: The insects I'm dealing with are definitely not white fly, which is why I posted a separate question from this: <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/761/white-flies-on-basil"">How do I get rid of white flies on my basil?</a></p>

<p>UPDATE (9/Aug): I tried the detergent spray twice (per GardeningDirections user) without any apparent effect by the next morning. I then tried drowning the bastards last night (per Mikey) and hopefully it has been more effective, but I still saw two which I squashed this morning. I'll whether I can just kill off the remaining ones by hand. Any other suggestions at this point before I try to figure out what to do to close the question?</p>

<p>UPDATE (24/Aug): I have taken the whole planter container outside and picked off the individual larvae from the underside of the leaves in bright sunlight so none would be missed. Now I am hoping the insects' natural predators will keep them down for long enough for the basil to recover and then I'll bring the plant back inside. I still haven't ruled out trying pyrethrum spray but that's a last resort.</p>

<p>UPDATE (15/Sep): I have used a pyrethrum-based spray to kill perhaps 90% of the bugs while the planter box was outside but it also knocked the basil plants themselves so I did not respray. Now I notice there are still one or two insects left which have laid new larvae all over the undersides of the leaves... and I've also put these creatures through an evolutionary bottleneck so no doubt they'll be tougher to kill than ever! <em>So I officially give up.</em> These basil plants will be transferred to the garden outside, to survive or not. I will get new plants for my indoor planter box.</p>

<p>UPDATE (19/Oct): Transplanted outdoors a month ago the basil is still surviving, even thriving and the insects formerly dominating them are clearly being eaten by proper predators, which hints to me that the best possible way to control the insects would perhaps be to introduce a few friendly predators into the kitchen!</p>
","<p>IMHO <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/1223/insect-infestation-on-my-pepper-plant-what-do-i-do/1226#1226"">that answer</a> should work fine in your situation. It's a pretty ""standard"" procedure for dealing with such pests on potted plants.</p>

<p>Submerging the pot in water for <strong>an hour or two</strong>, then allowing it to <strong>dry out</strong> will <strong>not</strong> have any adverse effects on your Basil plant (or any other ""common"" potted plant I can think of).

"What should I consider when putting raised garden beds on concrete?","36186","","<p>I have a bunch of raised garden bed frames, and I'm considering putting them on a slab of concrete that I have in my back yard. I wanted to avoid putting them on the grass, as when I've done this previously the grass has grown up through the soil in the raised bed.</p>

<p>I'd like some advice on how I should proceed.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0LO5j.jpg"" alt=""concrete with garden bed frames""></p>
","<p>It appears your beds are pretty deep. At least a foot deep by my estimation. Most edibles you'll plant won't need to be that deep. 4-6"" is enough for a lot of plants except for root vegetables but you can always add an extension in those areas. You don't have to make the whole bed deep just for a few potatoes or carrots.</p>

<p>Since you have that much depth what I think might work is to do what people do with plants in pots. Provide drainage at the bottom of the beds and poke some holes on the sides, along the bottom to let the water escape.</p>

<p>Maybe 1-2"" of gravel, landscape fabric, then your soil mix on top of that? That's what I would try if I absolutely had to put the beds on concrete. </p>

<p>As for what to fill the beds with. There's an active community of gardeners that practice and modify Mel Bartholomew's <a href=""http://www.squarefootgardening.org/"">Square Foot Gardening</a> which recommends equal parts of compost, vermiculite and peat moss.</p>

<p>But you said you're doing this mainly because the grass grows up through your beds. Have you tried <a href=""http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn74145.html"">solarizing</a> the area to kill off vegetation and seeds, putting down some landscape fabric then your beds and growing medium?</p>

"How long does it take for the compost to ripen?","35818","","<p>I’ve got a compost bin (a big plastic box with air holes) that’s used by two or three families. We have been putting kitchen scraps and stuff into the composter for about a year now (mostly vegetables). The composter does not stink, it gives a nice earthy smell even when I turn it (which I do every two or three weeks). Today I even found earth worms in it, which I was very happy about. The only thing that troubles me is that the stuff inside does not look like it could be used for plants anytime soon, there’s a lot of small pieces of stuff, not everything is properly brown, in short it does not look much like soil, not even in the oldest layers.</p>

<p>So how long does it take for the contents to turn into soil? Is it possible for the process to somehow stop? (<em>The winter is quite mild this year here, temperatures seldom dropping below 0°C (32ºF).</em>) How do I know I’m on the right track? Are there some “milestones” that could be seen from how the stuff looks inside the composter?</p>
","<p>The short answer: your compost will be finished in six months to a year.</p>

<p><a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/106/51"">It will finish faster if you turn it</a>, slower if you don't.</p>

<p>(<em>A picky correction to your question: compost will turn into <strong>humus</strong>, not actually soil.</em>)</p>

<p>Rumor is that compost can be finished in as little as a few weeks, under ideal conditions. (I've never seen it.)</p>

<p>Folks who do vermicomposting (i.e. with worms) claim that 1 pound of worms will devour half their body weight per day, leaving just castings (worm poo). Worms can help the composting process, but keep in mind that if you heat up your pile by turning it you will either kill the worms or they will leave because they're uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Yes, the process can stop. Especially if it gets cold -- but it will restart once it warms up. It will also stop (really, it will probably just slow down a lot) if the bacteria inside the pile use up all of the oxygen. <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/3113/51"">This is why turning the pile reactivates the process, because it introduces air.</a></p>

<p>I like the idea of ""milestones"" -- this is a good question:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/319/how-hot-can-my-compost-get"">Temperature</a></strong>: Is it hot? I have a thermometer with an 18"" probe that I can stick into my pile. If it is warmer than ambient temperature, then the bacteria are working inside the pile. (In summer when it's 80°F outside, I'm happy if my pile is 100-120°F; in winter when it's 30°F, I'm happy if the pile is 40°F.)

<ul>
<li>This is also a cue to know when to turn the pile. Once the temperature starts dropping, it's time to turn it.</li>
<li>If you turn the pile and it doesn't heat up any more, then you know it's close to being finished.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Smell</strong>: As you mention, you want a nice earthy smell. If it smells <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/2010/51"">sour</a> or <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/755/51"">rotten</a> you've probably got too much water and not enough air. If it smells of ammonia, you've got too much nitrogen (""greens"") and not enough carbon (""browns"").</li>
<li><strong><a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/479/51"">Moisture</a></strong>: The pile should be about as damp as a wrung-out sponge. Any less water and the microbes can't thrive. Any more water and they will suffocate because air can't move as well.</li>
<li><strong>Texture</strong>: Perfectly finished compost has a fine texture with no large chunks -- certainly nothing recognizable from the initial feedstock. (In my experience this never happens either -- there's always something left over from what you started with. If you want ""perfect"" compost, e.g. for starting seeds, it's easy enough to sift the compost so you take the fine stuff and leave behind the chunks to compost further in your next batch.)</li>
</ul>

<p>A couple of things to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you're constantly adding new material to the composter, you'll never get a complete batch of finished compost. There will always be something fresh in there. That's why you see a lot of recommendations for ""three bin"" systems: add fresh material to one bin, the second bin is in the process of finishing, and the third bin is finished and is where you take compost from when you need it.</li>
<li>You said kitchen scraps ""and stuff"". Not sure what the ""stuff"" is, and you must have a good balance if it doesn't stink, but <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/422/51"">make sure you're adding enough ""browns""</a> -- carbon-heavy materials like autumn leaves, shredded cardboard or black and white newspaper, straw, etc.</li>

","<p>Vegetable oil does not work well because it beads up on top of the water and does not spread across the surface. It also goes rancid.</p>

You can try a <strong>horticultural spray oil</strong>. It only takes a few drops to form a microscopically thin sheen across the water. This is recommended for bird baths so it's pretty safe for the innocent bystanders in your yard. </p>

<p>You can also try <strong>mineral oil</strong>. It's completely non-toxic. There are also <strong>non-chemical larvicides</strong> (that are mostly mineral oil) which are made specifically for this situation.</p>

","<p>Soil needs do vary a little between the three basic types, the Guatemalan, the Mexican and the West Indian; however, all three will tolerate most types of soil, but not wet feet; they prefer a light/ sandy potting compost (specially formulated for indoor plants) that is <strong>free-draining</strong> and will not take too long to dry a little between waterings (when it should be slightly damp to the touch but <em>never</em> wet). Garden soil, of course, is unsuitable for indoor plants, as it may not be sufficiently free-draining or balanced in nutrients, and also contains organisms that could thrive indoors and cause disease. A standard multipurpose potting soil, available from your local garden center should meet your avocado's needs, but I would try to avoid a peat-based one, as it loses moisture very quickly and, if allowed to dry out, is quite difficult to wet again.</p>

"Please help me ID this apple or apple-like bush/tree in my yard - Small green apple with no stem and thorns","33955","","<p>I have lived in this house for many years.  I have always had a bush behind the shed that I couldn't identify.  I always knew it was green most of the year and that it had thorns but that was about it. </p>

<p>Well a couple of days ago I was looking at it and low and behold there was an green apple or an apple like fruit on it!  I was excited but it wasn't like a normal apple.  There was no stem, it was directly attached to the branch, and I have never seen an apple with thorns that are an inch or so long.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what it is or if it is native or a non-native ornamental plant.  I live in New Albany, Indiana which is in southern Indiana near Louisville, KY. Also on my property here in town I have dogwoods, an ornamental cherry, a holly, some catalpa trees, a white pine, and some miscellaneous other bushes/hedges. It is an old property and I think most of the trees were placed here by a previous owner. My dad and I are very curious as to what it is.</p>

"Can dahlias be grown as perennials?","33838","","<p>The wikipedia article on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahlia"">dahlia</a> says that they are perennial plants. However, the dahlia section at my local garden center claims (in their little info booklets) that they are annuals. Upon further research, I <a href=""http://www.thegardenhelper.com/dahlia.html"">found that</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generally, seed grown varieties of Dahlias are started as bedding plants and then treated as annual plants. They will produce tubers during their first year of growth which can be dug and replanted in the same way as larger Dahlias, but because of the ease of growing them from seed, most gardeners prefer to discard the old plants and start fresh the following year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, they're only <em>treated as annuals</em> and are not really annuals. This coincides with some other articles on the web that suggest removing dahlia tubers and storing them over the winter and replanting them in the spring (i.e., if you choose not to discard them) if you live in a cold place. </p>

<p>My question is: Will dahlias grow as perennials and not die if I just leave them in the ground? I live in SoCal and we don't have winters here.</p>
","<p>Absolutely.  If you can protect them from freezing (probably not too much of a problem in Southern California) and rotting from too much moisture (again, probably not a problem for you), they should be just fine.</p>

<p>I live in Portland, Oregon and have had some dahlias in the ground for -- I think -- 5 years now.  They're underneath the overhang from my porch, so don't get the full brunt of the winter rains here.  I also get a natural mulch from a nearby deciduous magnolia which protects against freezing.  I have <a href=""http://www.dahlias.com/hulinscarnival-item237.aspx"">Hulins Carnival</a> and a pink dinner-plate variety (can't remember what it's called) planted there, both of which grow 4' to 5' tall, so the tubers are planted deep; this also helps against freezing.

"How should I prune a weeping willow without shortening the life of the tree?","33690","","<p>I prune a lot of neighborhood trees, but I've come to a small problem. Some people like their weeping willows high enough that they can walk underneath without brushing it. I have been doing this by hedge trimming the stems at seven feet. </p>

<p>Now I hear that this greatly shortens the life of the tree, as compared with an unpruned tree. Is this true, and if so, is there a better way to prune it?</p>
","<p>Improper pruning can shorten a tree's life.  However you would have to work really hard to damage a willow with bad pruning. Here's why:</p>

<ul>
<li>Willows grow fast</li>
<li>they will bud from old wood, even really old wood</li>
<li>they are a messy tree, commonly dropping leaves and branches  </li>
<li>they are used to breaks or cuts in the branch structure</li>
<li>willows have been <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppicing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">coppiced</a> for centuries.  If that kind of hard pruning doesn't kill them off bad pruning is not likely to either.

</ul>

<p>If you continue to use a hedge trimmer at the seven foot level you will cause the tree to develop a mass of new growth at that height.  It would be better practice and more aesthetically pleasing to use a pole pruner to deliver a series of graduated cuts at various heights. This will yield a wide band of new growth instead of a ribbon at one height.</p>

<p>Edit: @David You are right. Trimming with a hedge trimmer is essentially pollarding. However all the cuts are at the same height and, if continued for years, will produce a thick mass of branches. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollarding"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Traditional pollarding</a> creates quite a different look.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/296EQ.jpg"" alt=""Brown Spot 2""></p>
","<p>I would have said <strong>Blossom End Rot</strong> because that seems to be the most rot along these lines., and especially as you have it on a few of the larger fruit. It is caused by a Calcium deficiency. Check your MiracleGro - it is probably almost all NPK but might have Calcium in smaller quantities. Is that enough? I don't know.</p>

<p>Usually the problem occurs more due to a mobility problem with the Calcium when watering is erratic - yes the plant might get water, but it might go a couple of days without water and then get it all at once. I have seen this and is probably hard to avoid with modern drought restrictions.</p>

<p>Ohio State have a <a href=""http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/3000/3117.html"">Blossom End Rot Fact Sheet</a> that is worth reading. As well as lack of Ca in the soil, and erratic watering, they mention ""competitive cations"". What they mean is the pepper plant is absorbing similar ions to Calcium instead of Calcium - and then has a lack of calcium in the fruit. They mention ammonium specifically, but magnesium is probably a candidate (it is common, and is chemically very similar). Check your MiracleGro - if it is ammonium based, them this could be your cause. OSU's recommendations are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Maintain the soil pH around 6.5. Liming will supply calcium and will increase the ratio of calcium ions to other competitive ions in
  the soil.</p></li>
  <li><p>Use nitrate nitrogen as the fertilizer nitrogen source. Ammoniacal nitrogen may increase blossom-end rot as excess ammonium ions reduce
  calcium uptake. Avoid over-fertilization as side dressings during
  early fruiting, especially with ammoniacal forms of nitrogen.</p></li>
  <li><p>Avoid drought stress and wide fluctuations in soil moisture by using mulches and/or irrigation. Plants generally need about one inch
  of moisture per week from rain or irrigation for proper growth and
  development.</p></li>
  <li><p>Foliar applications of calcium, which are often advocated, are of little value because of poor absorption and movement to fruit where it
  is needed.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>When I've seen it, watering has been the main issue during drought conditions. Rot has not been too widespread. Pick the fruit before the rot gets too big. You can still eat it - just cut the rot off. If you wait too long, the rot will spread (secondary infections have taken over) and there's nothing worth saving.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bitter pit is caused by low levels of calcium in the fruit and poor distribution of calcium within the tree during fruit development. However, it is rarely due to a deficiency of calcium in the soil and can even occur in trees growing on chalk.</p>
  
  <p>Bitter pit is more usually connected with an irregular supply of water, which prevents calcium being taken up and circulated around the tree. Problems are generally worse in seasons when there are wide fluctuations in rainfall and temperature and a shortage of water to trees at critical times during fruit development.</p>

"How do I get rid of pill bugs in my vegetable garden (or is it even the problem)?","32740","","<p>I have had multiple plants in my vegetable garden that have seemed to just vanish from the garden over the period of about a week. I have notice pill bugs eating the remains of the plants. They seem to be focused on my lettuce. How can I determine if the pill bugs are the ones at fault or if they are just feasting on the fatal lettuce remains? If they aren't the pill bugs, how do I determine what would cause it?</p>

<p>A little bit of detail: This is a new garden in which I pulled up grass and placed a thick layer of Miracle-Gro's Garden Soil for Flowers and Vegetables on-top of the clay soil that we have here. We have had a very large amount of rain over the last couple weeks that has caused everything to stay saturated for days along with some high winds that took out some of my tulips. I am in hardiness zone 6b.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of what the damage looks like on plant that was in good shape yesterday.</p>

<p>And a new discovery today. The bottom of my bell pepper plant appears to have been chewed on.</p>

","<p>I have only ever noticed pill bugs feasting on stuff that is piling up and rotting as they usually don't come out into the air or sunshine. So I would be interested to know if you have enough space between plants and if you are leaving food (rotting leaves etc. piling up near plants). It seems strange that these guys would come out into the open to feed.</p>

<p>I have actually posted several questions about trying to control slugs etc. that were eating my lettuce, but I was never quite sure what it was. I ended up finding the source of the problem by going outside at night just before I went to sleep with a torch. If I needed to go the bathroom late at night I also went outside for a look until I eventually found the culprit. It was then a matter of control.</p>

<p>Your choices are then: manual removal by going out at nighttime for several nights physically removing the invaders, using traps (beer trap, slug pellets) or spraying your plants so they don't taste nice. Unfortunately in your case if the rain persists the last two options don't work.</p>

"How can I control thistle in a lawn?","32049","","<p>Our back fence (an iron bar fence) borders a golf course, and between us and the fairway is about 50 feet of ""native"" landscaping.  This mostly means long, native grass (some type of crab grass?).</p>

<p>... it's also terrible when even small growth appears in my lawn. Given how spiky it is, bare feet is <em>not</em> a good idea.</p>

<p>I ended up spraying weed-killer on this patch and got it mostly knocked down.  However, the bits that had already spread to my lawn have come back year after year.  They don't go away when I  spray with lawn-safe weed killer, and I even had Tru-Green service for a while and nothing they did was successful either.</p>

<p>I have tried pulling them out by hand, but our lawn, unique soil (solid clay), and the toughness of the root system makes most of them simply break off at the soil, leaving them to come back in just a few weeks.</p>

<p>I can also offer a few suggestions for thistle:</p>

<ul>
<li>If possible, loosen the ground around the base without breaking the roots before you pull it</li>
<li>The best place to grab the weed is just below ground level when you pull them up</li>

"Is it possible to grow the corn kernels from commercial popcorn?","31489","","<p>It doesn't seem like there's any process that would kill the kernels, as they're just being dried out. So would it be theoretically possible to grow the kernels into full corn plants? Would there be any difference between the kernels found in commercial, microwavable, bagged popcorn and corn kernels sold specifically for planting?</p>
","<p>It is possible to grow plants from the kernels you get for making popcorn, but remember this is a corn that isn't any good as sweet corn. it it very starchy and not sweet. it would only be good to use for more popcorn. </p>

<p><a href=""http://m.wikihow.com/Grow-Popcorn"">Here</a> is a quick tutorial on germinating the seed.</p>

<p>In essence, what they recommend is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get the plain kernels for home made popcorn from the market (unflavoured).</li>
<li>Place the kernels in between damp sheets of kitchen paper to germinate. </li>
<li>The kernels that have germinated should then be planted out into the
ground in blocks of at least 3 x 3 (as corn is wind pollinated) and spaced at roughly 1' apart.</li>
<li>Keep watered in dry spells. </li>
<li>Leave the ears of corn on the
plants until the leaves surrounding the corn have browned. </li>
<li>Bring the ears in to dry out further. </li>
<li>Once fully dried, twist off the kernels to use as you would with store bought.</li>
</ol>

<p>N.B. A great tip, if your patch suffers from rodent or squirrel attack (they do love corn), is to place empty soda bottles over the ears of corn with ventilation holes punched into it so that you don't encourage mildew to attack the corn. </p>

"Why did my jalapeños turn black?","31374","","<p>Last year I grew jalapeños. The fruits were tiny, but I was able to harvest a few handfuls. I noticed that many of them started to turn black on the plant. They were still edible, and they weren't rotten. The skin of the fruit developed black patches, shiny like the rest of the skin. It looked as though they were ripening to black (instead of red like other peppers would). The plants looked perfectly healthy otherwise, and continued making fruit.</p>

<p>Is this normal? If not, what causes it / how can I prevent it?</p>

<p><em>(Sorry, no photos available, I didn't think to take pictures at the time.)</em></p>
","<p>A lot of peppers naturally turn black as they make the transition from green to orange/red/yellow during the ripening process.</p>

<p>This can be understood by looking at how different coloured pigments mix. Mixing of pigments is subtractive (unlike light, which is additive), and when you mix green pigment with orange (can try with paint at home), you get a shade somewhere between muddy to deep brown (depending on how deep the orange and green are). So when the fruit makes the transition from raw (green) to ripe (orange), there's some sort of mixing of the pigments, which appears as if the fruit is blackening. </p>

<p>I've had this happen to my jalapeños and bell peppers and there is nothing to worry about. On the left is my bell pepper that's starting to ripen and on the right is how a ripened fruit should look like (my previous fruit).</p>

","<p>Mushrooms, or toadstools, are usually caused by decaying organic debris, such as pieces of wood and dead tree roots, just below the surface of the lawn; they can also be caused by a thick layer of thatch (the layer of grass clippings, dead roots etc that accumulate on the surface, just below the grass line - see <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/902/how-to-tell-if-my-lawn-needs-to-be-dethatched/912#912"">here</a>), and they thrive in damp conditions.</p>

<p>Given that there aren't many of them, and they don't seem to be the type that forms rings that grow wider and wider every year, I don't think you should be too worried; you may find them a bit unsightly, but they are not likely to cause much damage.

<p>As far as I'm aware, there is no reliable water-on technique for ridding a lawn of toadstools; you could try iron sulphate (1/2oz in a gallon of water per square yard), but it doesn't always work and, when it does, sooner or later, the mushrooms often return.

<p>How long can I continue to do this?  Will a be able to harvest a consistent small amount of basil forever or should I take all the leaves and make pesto at some point (like I would have done if they were planted outside)?</p>
","<p>One cannot give an exact time frame for a plant's survival. If you live in a cold place, the plant will die when temperatures start dropping, otherwise, it can live year round. The most important thing is to not let it bolt. A bolted plant looks like <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/1649/saving-basil-plant-after-it-has-been-sitting-in-trash"">in this question</a>. You can read through the advice given in <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/81/best-conditions-for-basil"">Best conditions for basil</a> and try to follow that to keep it alive.</p>

<p>Note that regardless of where you are located, a basil kept indoors should stay alive assuming it does not exposed to the cold or the very hot and it gets all the other general requirements (sun, water, etc). Bolting (flowering) is caused by adverse conditions (the plant thinks it is going to die soon) - remove those conditions (e.g. winter) and it should live for many years.</p>

<p>Once it has gone to flower and to seed, one option is to wait for the seed to form and dry. Then brush the seed off with your hand and let it fall so that it seeds itself. We've kept basil growing outdoors for quite a few years like this (any plants still alive are killed by the winter frosts, but the seed germinates in spring)</p>

"Do peppers change color when left on the plant?","30368","","<p>My mother and I purchased some pepper plants from Costco.

However, they've started to sprout their fruit, and we're noticing they're distinctly green.</p>

<p>Mom hears tale that peppers turn red if you don't pick them from the plant. Is this fact, will the pepper change color when left on the plant past its full growth? Is this only for particular breeds of pepper? If it does change color, is there a specific length of time I should wait, or perhaps some way to tell when the color change is complete?</p>

<p><em><sup>†</sup>The card doesn't clarify much past that. Just says ""pepper"" matures in ""60-100 days"", and talks about both mild peppers and hot peppers.</em></p>
","<p>When the peppers come to fruit, they're going to start out green. Doesn't matter really what type you've bought, that's their first stage.</p>

<p>How long you leave them to ripen will determine what colour, and subsequently the flavour packed into it, when you pick them off. The ones you time to hang on the branch for longer will give you more bang for your tastebuds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All baby peppers start out some shade of green and change color as they mature. Some peppers stay green until they mature to yellow or red; others may turn white, lilac or purple before maturing to red or yellow. You can eat peppers at whatever stage you prefer, but the color change in ripening peppers is caused by the breakdown of chlorophyll, which coincides with the maturation of the seeds. Sugars and other flavor compounds also accumulate during the final stages of ripening, and vitamin C content often doubles. So, fully ripe peppers taste better and are more nutritious.</p>

What are other options for creating such layout maps? </p>

<p>Cross-platform solutions would be nice, but if not, please indicate which OS it supports. Free and commercial software are both welcome.</p>

<p><em>Note: I am personally using a MacBookPro and an Ubuntu machine. Windows options are certainly welcome as well.</em></p>
","<p>Exactly which design software package for landscape planning is best for your needs will come down to a number of factors, some of which are listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Freeware.</p></li>
<li><p>Commercial.</p></li>
<li><p>Which Operating System platform you run.</p></li>
<li><p>How much time you're planning, willing to invest in learning the software - some of these packages are extremely powerful (and complex once you get below the surface of them).</p></li>
<li><p>Do you require an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API"">API</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Are you interested in a strong user community (eg User help/support).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Whatever package you decide to use, I can't recommend strongly enough that it be vector based.</strong></p>

<p>My first recommendations are ""simple"" (and free) CAD/Drawing packages, that's not to say they're not powerful, just can be viewed as somewhat limited by (some) ""professionals"" in the design community:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.123dapp.com/"">Autodesk 123D</a> - Windows only.</p></li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Personally I would go with Google SketchUp, as it's:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Simple to use.</p></li>
<li><p>Large user community (eg Lots of freely available content, tutorials, support, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>2D &amp; 3D.</p></li>
<li><p>Allows for an easy upgrade path to <a href=""http://sketchup.google.com/product/gsup.html"">Google SketchUp Pro</a> if required further down the road.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My second recommendations are ""powerful"" (commercial) CAD/Drawing packages, bias to <a href=""http://autodesk.com/"">Autodesk</a> products, as that is where my somewhat expertise lays:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.autodesk.com/autocadlt"">AutoCAD LT</a> - Windows and <a href=""http://www.autodesk.com/autocadltformac"">Mac</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><a href=""http://www.autodesk.com/revit"">Autodesk Revit Architecture</a> - Windows only.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>It's a difficult one to recommend, but for landscape planning I would probably have to go with AutoCAD Map 3D.</strong></p>

<p>My third recommendations are ""powerful"" (commercial) non-Autodesk CAD/Drawing packages, though to be honest I can't really recommended any of them as I don't have any ""real"" experience with them, I'm aware of them, have very! limited experience with a couple of them:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.graphisoft.com/products/archicad/"">ArchiCAD</a> Windows and Mac.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.bricscad.com"">Bricscad</a> - Windows and Linux.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.landfx.com/"">Land F/X</a> - works with AutoCAD, Bricscad &amp; SketchUp.</p></li>

<li><p><a href=""http://www.bentley.com/mixrostation"">MicroStation</a> - Windows only.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For the ""average"" homeowner that wishes to do some, get into, landscape design, I would have to recommend starting with Google SktechUp.</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> What type of lawn do you have, warm-season or cool-season?</p>

<p>I would guess you have a warm-season lawn, seeing as you're in Texas, but if you could please confirm one-way or the other, and also the type of grass that makes up your lawn, that would be useful to know.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have Bermuda grass...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok! you have a warm-season lawn.</p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> How high do you mow your lawn ie How tall is the grass after you've finished mowing?</p>

<p>Depending on your grass type and the answer given to the above question, you ""might"" be better served mowing at a higher height.</p>

<p>You haven't yet said how high you mow your lawn, but we do now know you have a warm-season lawn, therefore my recommendations are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Early in the growing season (early to mid Spring) as the grass is coming out of Winter dormancy, cut your lawn at 1&#189; to 2inches (37.5 to 50mm), then from late Spring onward move the cutting height on your lawnmower up, 2inches (50mm) minimum, 2&#189;inches (62.5mm) would be better.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> How much water do you give your lawn during each watering?</p>

<p>If you're not sure, do something like the following to measure the amount of water:</p>

<ul>
<li>Put a empty, shallow (tuna) can in the middle on the watering zone and measure the depth of the contents after your sprinkling system has turned itself off after 20 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>I give the lawn about 1/3"" 3 times a week. I think I'm going to the twice a week at 1/2"" you were suggesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a lawn to remain alive (instead of allowing it to go into dormancy) during extreme heat and drought, it needs at least 1inch (25mm) of water per week. The 1inch (25mm) of water is best delivered via either:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>One deep watering a week that delivers a minimum of 1inch (25mm).</p></li>
<li><p>Or two waterings a week, each one delivering a minimum of &#189;inch (12.5mm).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Watering a lawn more than twice a week (even during extreme heat &amp; drought) has a negative effect on the lawn ie</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It encourages the grass to develop a shallow root system, where as what you really want to do, especially in a situation like yours, is encourage the grass to develop a deep root system, make it go deeper to look for water below the surface.</p></li>
<li><p>Frequent watering also increases the possibility of diseases developing in your lawn.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm also going to look into adding compost to the lawn this fall. My dad was also saying that I could buy some gardening sand to fill the cracks in. Would you recommend this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally I wouldn't add sand in your particular situation. <strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, sand is an excellent drainage material and will aid water getting down deep into your soil, but I believe you want to try and close up those cracks and prevent them from returning, therefore I think you would be better served by making the top 12 to 18inches (300 to 450mm) of soil as fertile as possible, thus allowing that soil zone to hold as much water as it can. That said, I would fill those cracks with finely sieved (&#188;inch/6.25mm) compost (maybe with some gardening sand mixed in) &amp; compost tea.</p>

<p>I would seriously look into improving your soil below your lawn. <strong>How?</strong></p>

<p>Below are a couple of things I've done (and continue to do for the most part):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Spread 1inch (25mm) of compost all over the surface of the lawn twice a year.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Once in the Spring - did that for 3 years, stopped doing it this year.</p></li>
<li><p>And once in the Autumn (Fall) - have done that the past 3 years and will continue to do it, as part of my Autumn (Fall) lawn care maintenance programme.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Make 5 gallons of compost tea each week (from late Spring to earlier Autumn ""Fall"") and apply the 5 gallon batch to the front garden one week, then the following week apply a new fresh 5 gallon batch to the back garden. I repeat that cycle for the period given previously. I have been doing this for 2 years now, and without question I have noticed a massive increase in worm activity eg lots of worm castings on the surface of the soil.</p></li>

<p>The transformation from what I started with, to what I have now, is (almost) unbelievable...</p>

<p>You can read more about my lawn care practices <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/1390/whats-an-organic-way-to-discourage-crabgrass-from-a-large-lawn/1391#1391"">here on SE Gardening</a>. I've now added a few photos to that post, especially take not of the 4 photos labelled <strong><em>""... after 4 weeks of continuous +95°F (35°C) heat, almost zero rain, watered once a week (per above) and not mowed during that time"".</em></strong> Maybe last year, but most definitely 2 years ago I would have lost about a &#8531; of the grass in my back garden and would have had cracks in the soil that I could've stuck my fingers down into after going through such an excessive heat period. I'm not saying my lawn and/or soil are now perfect, but without a shadow of a doubt they're improving, getting better each year...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hopefully with your help my lawn will be the envy of the neighborhood in no time!</p>

<p>Don't expect instant miracles, if you do, I'm afraid you will be somewhat disappointed and may get a little frustrated due to lack of (instant) progress. In reality it's going to take at least a year or two before you see any noticeable improvement, but I guarantee if you do stick with it, you will end up reaping huge! rewards and personal satisfaction from seeing the transformation...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q.</strong> Also, could these cracks potentially cause a foundation issue?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cracks in the soil won't directly cause any issues with the foundation of your house.</p>

<p>Below are a few things that factor into <strong>potential</strong> foundation problems when dealing with excessive drying out of the soil:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Depth to underside of foundations.</p></li>
<li><p>What type of soil the foundations bear on.</p></li>
<li><p>How wide the foundations are ie The bearing area onto the soil.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Excessive drying out of the soil causes the soil to ""contract"" (shrink), if this occurs to a large enough extent (along with factoring in the above 3 points, plus some I'm sure I've missed) it can <strong>possibly</strong> cause the foundations to settle.</p></li>
<li><p>If after an excessive drying out period, the soil suddenly becomes ""super saturated"", thus causing the soil to ""suddenly"" expand, this (along with factoring in the above 3 points, plus some I'm sure I've missed) can <strong>possibly</strong> result in ground heave that exerts enough upward force to push the foundations up.</p></li>

"What is a suitable slope for a lawn to drain water away from a house?","29753","","<p>We're about to level our front yard. It will be partly sown with grass, and partly planted with trees &amp; shrubs, though it may not be completely relevant to this question. What is a suitable slope to gently drain water away from the house? <strong>I think one of the tradespeople I spoke to suggested a 1 in 65 slope</strong> would be adequate, which by my calculations would be a drop of roughly 15mm for every horizontal metre. <strong>Is this about right, not enough, or too much?</strong></p>

<p>Also, I had a go at pulling a string taught from one side of the yard to the other. Holding my spirit level against the string didn't really work very well for working out what was level. <strong>What is the best equipment for determining what's level?</strong> </p>

<p>I think I have a small spirit level that can attach to a string (from a picture framing kit) which might be better, though I don't know how accurate it will be (I can calibrate it against my big spirit level probably).</p>

<p>Background info: we have high rainfall sometimes in the winter, though the soil should have reasonably good drainage qualities (no clay). The size of the yard isn't very big. The max distance from the house to the edge of the yard is probably about 7 metres.</p>
","<p>The minimum slope that I recommend is two percent, or 1/4 inch per foot. As an example, the grade at a spot four feet away from your house should be one inch lower than the grade next to your house. This will do for most houses with soil that will absorb water readily.</p>

<p>For your 7 metre garden (~ 22.9 feet) this would be no more than a 6"" drop.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that too much slope means difficulties with mowing equipment.  12.5 degree of slope or a 22.2 percent slope is as much as you want to have close to your house.</p>

<p>@Scivitri's comment:  I agree, for the purpose of grading a laser level would do the job.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Will landscaping companies want these materials if I offer them free of charge?</li>
<li>If not, is posting an ad (eg in craigslist) an effective method?</li>
<li>Are there cheaper methods than renting a dumpster?</li>
</ol>

<p>Any advice related to disposing of these materials is much appreciated. </p>
","<p>It would be generous to call that ""sand"" -- definitely don't spread it on your lawn. Looks more like fine gravel to me.</p>

<p>If you just want to get rid of it all:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Craigslist and/or freecycle ads might get rid of the field stone and the concrete blocks. (I know people who have disposed of strange things via freecycle -- really fast.)</p></li>
<li><p>If you keep your eyes open as you drive around, you might see a sign up where someone is looking for fill. Talk to them and see if they will haul it away (any combination of the sand, stone, and concrete). You could also try posting to craigslist/freecycle advertising ""Free Fill"" and mentioning the composition. I you have the means to load someone's truck (e.g. a tractor with a loader, or if you're willing to help them shovel it), definitely mention this in the ad. If you're willing to pay to haul it away (or have the means to haul it yourself), you will almost certainly find someone willing to take it.</p></li>
<li><p>Depending on how much traffic goes by on the road, a ""FREE STONE"" sign in that pile of stone might do the job. You could probably get rid of the blocks that way too.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to reuse any of this stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li>You've got enough stone there for a small, rough stone wall like the ones you see while you're driving around New England (I think you said you live in the Boston area). You can plant a small garden bed with annuals or perennial flowers by the wall for an interest point in your yard.</li>
<li>Those concrete blocks have about a million uses. I use them all the time and have seen them used for doorstops, ballast, ad hoc bookshelves, seats, garden terraces/raised beds, blocks to hold up the truck in your front yard, etc.</li>
<li>If you sift the sand, you could maybe use it as a kid's sandpile. Or a litter box for about 80 cats.</li>
<li>Unsifted, you could keep the gravel in barrels to use for grit on your icy driveway/walkway in the winter. Or if you don't want to wait and already have a gravel driveway, spread it on the driveway now.</li>

"How long does mulch last?","29380","","<p>Our house is in need of mulch around bushes, trees etc.<br>
We are finally getting around to address this, and have calculated we need two yards to get around 2 inches of mulch onto everything. We live in the northeast and get a lot of snow. </p>

<p>Is it best to wait until next spring? If we choose black mulch, will it degrade too much where we just need more next spring?  Or does it last a couple of seasons and only requires ""sprucing"" up. </p>

<p>We accept the previous owners did not do much and the landscape requires a lot of work and maintenance, but we also do not want to put in all the work of covering everything in mulch only to have to do it again in 6 months. </p>

<p>Can anyone enlighten me to how long mulch roughly lasts? 
Also is 2 inches a good amount, too much? too little? </p>
","<p>A good layer of mulch should still be apparent after one year of laying. If the mulch is gone after one year, you'll need to add more next time.</p>

<p>Being a busy landscaper myself, I don't have time to get everyone covered in spring, and pretty much mulch whenever it's not freezing out. I find that the mulch generally lasts about the same, no matter when you lay it, but when laid in fall, it will be comparatively faded by spring, and although still there, it won't be as attractive as 'everyone else's' new jobs. Some people don't care, some want it freshened up. This I do by top-dressing, or sprinkling new mulch on for appearance, not wanting to change the depth too much. This is just for color. </p>

<p>Or you can use premium bark mulch, which fades some, but doesn't as badly as black dyed chips. Those two mulches are the most common in my area, followed by brown dyed. </p>

<p>About when to lay it, it doesn't really matter, as far as the plants are concerned. I'll give a list of pros and cons for your case:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>spreading mulch this fall</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>pros: it will last until next fall, it will help suppress spring sprouting weeds, it will protect plants better</li>
<li>cons: It will look more faded, when everyone else's spring laid stuff is looking sharp</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>spreading mulch next spring</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>pros: it will look sharp when everyone else's do, it will last until next spring, it will better suppress fall-germinating weeds</li>
<li>cons: it is usually getting thin by the next year when spring weeds start germinating</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I've met quite a few people who swear by fall spreading, and quite a few others who mulch 2-3 times per year (or worse, pay me to do it). It's pretty much up to you and what you like. </p>

<p>Depthwise, I usually go by what is already there. On an unmulched bed, or nearly so, I often use more than two inches, but if there's a good, full layer of mulch from the year before, I'll basically add only a covering for cover. Especially under eaves, look for undecomposed mulch piling up, and remove that before you add new.</p>

<p>Too much mulch cakes up, creates a moisture barrier, and can harm plants. Premium bark can be laid initially thicker than dyed chips, because 1), it packs down a lot more and 2), it tends to decompose faster.</p>

<h1>No Spark</h1>

<p>If you don't have a spark, you probably have to replace the ignition coil/module. There's a good YouTube video that shows <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYoNC7np_8M"">how to replace a lawn trimmer ignition coil</a>. Your model may vary, but the procedure will be similar.</p>

<h1>Weak Spark</h1>

<p>If you have a weak spark, try cleaning, regapping, or replacing the spark plug. </p>

<h1>How a trimmer ignition system works</h1>

<p>The ignition system is made up of 3 major parts. A magnet (located on the flywheel), an ignition coil, and a spark plug. When you turn the engine (pull the cord), the flywheel rotates. When the magnet on the flywheel spins past the ignition coil, a current is induced. This current travels through the ignition wire to the spark plug.  The electrons want so badly to return home (ground), they jump the gap in the spark plug. As they jump, they produce an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_arc"">electric arc</a> (also known as a spark). This arc ignites the fuel air mixture in the chamber, and the trimmer starts.  </p>

"What can I use sawdust for in a garden?","27766","","<p>After sawing a lot of wood, we're left with quite a lot of sawdust. I have been using it during composting to ensure that the compost doesn't get too green and wet, but is there something else I can use it for in the garden - and is it ok to use the sawdust in the compost, as I've been doing?</p>

<p>The sawdust is from natural and untreated wood.</p>
","<h3>Sawdust for Composting</h3>

<p>First I would make sure the wood has not been chemically treated. Check a cross section of the wood for the distinctive ring of green color around the first half inch or so. If it has been chemically treated, it will contain chemicals like arsenic, chromium, and copper &mdash; not suitable for composting. </p>

<p>Make sure sawdust (and other carbon-rich ""brown"" materials) isn't more than about 80% of the material you are composting. That's just a basic guideline. You need some nitrogen-rich ""green"" material (living organics like leaves, fresh grass clippings, and other kitchen scraps) for decomposition. </p>

<p>Ideally, add the green materials and then spread sawdust on top of them.</p>

<h3>Sawdust for Mulch</h3>

<p>Sawdust is sometime recommended as an effective mulch for acid-loving plants (e.g. rhododendrons, begonias, impatiens, blueberries, etc), but for anything else, you will have to manage the acidifying effect as the sawdust decomposes. Wood chips and saw dust will rob soil of nitrogen as it decomposes, but since saw dust will decompose a lot faster, you may have to compensate the addition of nitrogen.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that saw dust can also compact severely over a single season, so you have to be sure to break it up periodically. Some people recommend a combination of straw <em>and</em> saw dust, but you have to <strong>watch for excessive water runoff</strong> nonetheless.</p>

<p>I'd like to apologize for my ignorance.  Please help me provide you with more info if needed.</p>
","<p>The appearance of the soil surface in your photos leads me to think that <em>over-watering</em> may be the cause of the mold/fungus; a constantly wet growing medium provides ideal conditions for mold to develop. The soil needs to dry out a little between waterings, so that it is only slightly damp to the touch, and never wet. The slight browning of the stems where they meet the soil also suggests that, unless they get drier conditions, they could develop collar rot. While some plants prefer moister conditions than others, very few will survive long if their feet are constantly wet.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't identify either the plant or the pest from the photos you have posted, but I would suggest that you:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>carefully remove the top 2 inches of soil and replace it with fresh potting compost (preferably a peat-based one, as this will dry out better between waterings);</p></li>
<li><p>try to ensure that the plant gets a few hours of bright natural light every day, to encourage it to bloom if it proves to be a flowering house plant;</p></li>
<li><p>water thoroughly (until water comes out of the drainage holes - superficial watering leads to surface rooting, stress and disease), but only when the soil is dryish; </p></li>
<li><p>spray the soil surface and the whole plant once a week with a solution of soapy water, if the insects persist / reappear; if this doesn't do the trick, try to identify the pest using the <a href=""http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/horticulture/m1183.html"">link Mike Perry has suggested</a> and spray the plant and soil surface with a suitable insecticide;</p></li>
<li><p>apply a liquid fertilizer - see <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias=garden&amp;field-keywords=liquid%20plant%20fertilizer&amp;x=13&amp;y=18"">here</a> - every two or three weeks, but only during the growing season.</p></li>

However, I started a new job last week and have not had the time to tend to them. Now the leaves have curled lengthwise, some have turned yellow and some have grown a green moss on the soil. The soil near the plants is quite dry. Only the lower leaves are turning yellow on one plant. I have pruned some stems and found no discolouration within the stems.</p>

<p>Since starting the new job, I haven't watered or fed them, but the greenhouse has a fairly damp environment, with the walls and roof covered in drops of water. I've watered them with a little liquid food and left them out of the greenhouse in sun and light wind for 12 hours now and most of the leaves are starting to perk up. The yellow leaves on one plant have fallen but the upper leaves on the same plant have perked up. </p>

<p>Anyway, there are a number of damp related pathogens she describes:</p>

<p><strong>Verticillium Wilt</strong> Seems to be the most likely. Two fungi species infect peppers. Cool, moist weather during growing season. Sudden wilting of one part or all of the plant. Leaves dropping. Eventual death. Tomatoes and eggplants also affected. A cut stem will show vascular discoloring. No cure. No resistant varieties. Soil solarization may help (plastic mulch that uses heat to kill pests). Or grow in soil that has not seen <em>Solanacaea</em> before, or sterile soil. Discard plants.</p>

<p><strong>Phytophthora Blight</strong> Also known as chili wilt. Can cause fruit rot, root rot, leaf blight. Loves high humidity and excessively wet soil. All or part of the plant suddenly dies. No cure for root rot. Solution: good soil drainage and do not overwater. Remove and destroy infected plants.</p>

<p><strong>Fusarium Wilt</strong> Soil born fungus. More prevalent in warmer parts of the US.Poorly drained soil. Overall wilting, leaves turn yellow from the base of the plant upwards. Remove plants and destroy. Do not replant peppers in the same soil for many years or try soil solarization.</p>

<p><strong>Damping Off</strong> Affects seedlings. Fungus on seeds just as they come out (okay I have seen this)</p>

<p>There are a few others which don't seem to match (eg. bacterial wilt - warm areas only). Nutritional deficiencies seem to be limited to pod drop/wilt. Similarly Tobacco Mosaic (TMV) doesn't match your described symptoms.

"How can I harvest my own grass seed?","27253","","<p>I have a kind of perennial evergreen grass that I would like to spread around the yard. How can I save seeds from the plants efficiently ?</p>
","<p>I think it's a worthwhile experiment, but there are a few issues with trying to collect seed from your lawn.</p>

<ul>
<li>As mentioned in xpda's answer, stop mowing, let the grass grow tall and make seed. Collect them when they're fully dry. Depending on the type of grass you have, it may get tall before it sets seed. Some types actually form seed while they're still fairly low.</li>
<li>To collect, I would probably walk around with a big paper bag and clip the seed heads (tops of the grass) into the bag. When it's all collected, close up the bag, shake well to separate the seed, and pour it through a screen to separate the debris. Store in a cool, dark, dry place until you're ready to plant it.</li>
<li>While your desirable grass is going to seed, weeds may have a chance to go to seed. If your lawn is not a pure stand of the desirable grass, the seed you collect may be contaminated with weed seed.</li>
<li>Depending on the type of grass you have, and the types of grasses that are growing nearby, you run the risk of cross pollination. If cross pollination occurs, the seed you collect will not be a pure strain of the desirable grass. (It could be ""better"" or ""worse"" depending on what traits come in via random cross pollination with nearby weeds.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some types of perennial grass will spread vegetatively (not via seed). If you have this type, you may be able to take plugs from your existing lawn instead of collecting seed. As long as your lawn is a pure stand and you're not taking weeds up with the plugs, this will ensure that you're propagating a true genetic copy instead of risking cross-pollination.</p>

"How to stop grass growing through landscape pebbles?","25937","","<p>I have an area in my front yard where I have a row of dwarf <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buxus"" rel=""nofollow"">Buxus</a> surround by a strip of decorative pebbles.</p>

<p>I layed down a sheet of lining to prevent the grass from growing through the pebbles, but this hasn't stopped it. Within six months the grass has taken over.</p>

<p>The grass can't be easily pulled up by hand. I've tried this, but it is futile. Say the area is about the equivalent of 1m<sup>2</sup>, it takes about a week to pull up a third of the grass and that still doesn't get the roots. This type of grass grows like a vine, not in clumps. A section easily breaks if you pull it and the roots and other sections are left in the ground.</p>

<p>How can I kill the grass without poisoning the plants?</p>
","<p>A couple of suggestions based on the info you've provided.</p>

<p>First, you can try flame weeding. (If your liner is very shallow (sounds like it is), you may want to skip this -- or at least test a small area to see if it is going to melt the liner.) Read the directions! The objective is simply to scorch the leaves of the weeds so that it dries up and dies. You aren't trying to <em>burn</em> the weeds. It may take several passes over the course of a few weeks to completely kill it -- whenever you see new grass popping up, give it another scorch.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, or you can't/won't try it, I'd suggest reworking the entire area. If you're only working with 1m<sup>2</sup>, it shouldn't be too bad.</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the pebbles, save them in a bucket.</li>
<li>Remove the liner, discard. (it probably has a lot of holes.)</li>
<li>Dig out the soil under the area to a depth of 10cm. Save it to use somewhere else -- mix it into your compost pile if nothing else.
<ul>
<li>If you get to 10cm and still find roots from the grass, keep digging!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is the grass is creeping in through the edges? (I.e. does this grass live in your yard, and is invading the bed?) If so, you'll need to add some heavy-duty edging along the side of the area you dug out to prevent it from creeping back in. Find some that's the depth of the area you dug out.</li>
<li>Replace the soil with a 5cm layer of coarse sand, followed by a 5cm layer of 7-12mm pea stone.
<ul>
<li>Tamp down the sand a bit (stomp on it with your feet, or use a shovel) so it is compacted.</li>
<li>For an area this small, you could consider putting an extra layer of liner between the sand and the pea stone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Put the liner above the pea stone.</li>
<li>Replace the decorative pebbles you saved in a previous step.</li>
</ol>

<p>I will freely admit -- this is overkill, and would probably be too much work for a large area, but for a small area with such an aggressive weed, it should do the trick.</p>

","<p>Well you're right to be concerned. The soil level around the base of a healthy tree should preferably not be raised at all, but if you must, 2 inches of something very light and free draining you might just get away with. However, because you've got a closed in 'well' around the base, it doesn't sound as if any soil there will be particularly free draining. The problem is because the soil may/will cause rot and fungal infections in the base of the trunk (which is supposed to be exposed to the air) because it is now buried. Infections like this at the base of a tree do cause plant death.</p>

"How can I encourage a jade tree to grow a strong trunk?","25036","","<p>I have spindly jade plants.

This is a problem any time I need to move things on the windowsill, as pieces break easily and I'm running out of places to start new jade trees!</p>

<p>I was taught to reduce the number of new buds and get the plant to ""focus"" on a few branches and stem by pinching off some or all of the new pairs of buds, but either I haven't been diligent or that isn't working. </p>

<p>Wikipedia suggests <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_plant"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pruning jade plants in spring</a> but I'm not sure I should cut whole branches now that it's summer.</p>

<p>Short of learning the patience necessary for bonsai, is there any way I can help my jade plants grow a stronger trunk and be less prone to breakage?</p>
","<p>There are a variety of different jade trees; this includes some with naturally thicker trunks and others which grow thin like vines. So you may be battling against the way the plant grows naturally. Essentially, you may the wrong variety of jade tree for what you are aiming to achieve.</p>

<p>If this is the case, I suggest you begin by looking around and purchasing a variety that has a thick trunk. This will likely solve half your battle. With shaping plants for bonsai you can't force an azalea to look like a pine tree.</p>

<p>Most well watered jade trees are extremely hardy and you can literally hack one to pieces and all the pieces will grow into new trees. The only thing about pruning in spring is that you will get some growth back by the end of the growing season, whereas if you prune in winter you will be left with an ugly plant until summer.</p>

<p>What you do need to do if you want to concentrate the growth towards the center is trim the ends of new growth. If the branch has grown quite long, don't be afraid to cut back aggressively, (depending on the size you are wanting to achieve and the leaf size) maybe an inch back from where you want the leaves to appear. Once you have one branch growing to the right length then just remove any new growth in coming years. The plant will use this saved energy on growing the trunk.</p>

<p>Usually to make a nice looking miniature plant with a thick trunk also consider only having a few branches coming out from the trunk. This will make it look less like the first plant in the question you linked and will have the benefit of more energy going into trunk and branch development.</p>

<p>Also be aware that thick trunked trees don't grow overnight, you need to ensure your plant is well watered, fertilised and has a decent enough sized pot. You don't grow thick trees in small pots, this is a myth. Most bonsai fanatics grow their trees in the ground for 2  - 5 years before potting them. They dig them up and replant them annually or just buy them that way.</p>

<p>Don't worry about collecting every leaf to start a new tree, but if you find friends who like the look of your plant then consider giving some away.</p>

"What techniques can be used to manually sieve stones from the soil efficiently?","24726","","<p>After our house was built there is quite a bit of hardfill (river pebbles) mixed up with the topsoil around the section (approx 180sq.m.). We want to level the section, and loosen the top layer of soil to ready it for laying a lawn and growing a garden, and we're wondering what to do about the pebbles. </p>

<p>We understand that leaving too many stones in the soil will reduce the capacity of the soil to hold moisture and can also prevent tree roots from forming normally so we're considering sieving the soil somehow. It sounds like the local landscaping contractors can't help us with sieving, so I suppose it will have to be done manually.</p>

<p>We'd be happy if we could remove any stones with a diameter of 20mm or more.</p>

<p>Ideas so far include:</p>

<ul>
<li>bird-netting (dump the soil on top, then lift the netting); this might be hard work when it comes to breaking up clumps of soil?</li>
<li>a wooden frame (supported, somehow) covered with chicken wire (several layers of wire to reduce the gap size); this might get stones stuck between layers of wire</li>
<li>something more rigid from the local building recycling firm (have yet to see what they've got)</li>
</ul>

<p>I would really appreciate any other ideas, or accounts of what's been tried and has proven effective. Thanks!</p>

<p>[Edit] Have added a photo to give an idea of what we're dealing with. This soil was dug up and scattered around the left side of this photo by contractors putting in the fence post to the left.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PEDnu.jpg"" alt=""stony ground, with brick for reference""></p>
","<p>The wooden frame you describe is what I use, but instead of chicken wire I use hardware cloth (wire mesh). I have one frame with 1/4"" mesh and one slightly larger (3/8""? -- I think 1/2"" would be too big)). My large frame measures about 3' square, the small frame is built to fit over a specific bucket and measures about 15"" square.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with frames like mine is that you have to physically shake them by hand to get the soil to shake out. If I was going to build another one (and I likely will), I'd make it maybe 2' wide by 4-5' high so that I could set one end on a sawhorse and toss material onto it with a shovel. The material (rocky soil, compost, etc) would ""roll"" down the face of the screen, the fine material would fall through and the large material would stay on the front.</p>

<p>If you didn't want to build a frame, I've seen people just throw a section of hardware cloth over a wheelbarrow and toss material onto it. Looks like more ongoing work though -- I think you're better off building a frame.</p>

<p>If you're a bit handy with carpentry, I've also seen frames that are built on a stand that has a couple of levers so that you can toss material on it and then grab the handles to shake it out. I think I saw it used at an archaeological dig site, but from what I could see the construction looked fairly simple.</p>

<p><strong>Details</strong></p>

<p>A couple of things that I didn't mention above:</p>

<ol>
<li>The sifter should be designed so that rocks come out easily -- you don't want a fully enclosed frame, because then you have to tip it over to dump out the rocks.</li>
<li>Ideally the sifter will be inclined -- the rocks will just <em>fall out</em> instead of you having to remove them.</li>
<li>Decide where you want to have the sifted soil land (e.g. wheelbarrow, container, or the ground) and design the sifter around that destination. For example, if you want to capture soil in your wheelbarrow, make the frame wide enough so that it sits on the wheelbarrow edges, tilted so that you lose the rocks between the handles, and not so high that it will tip over your wheelbarrow.</li>
</ol>

"Is it bad to water plants in the evening?","23258","","<p>Is it bad to water plants after the sun has gone down or near dusk?  If so, why?</p>
","<p>An advantage is that you can conserve water because of less evaporation -- there's no sunshine.</p>

<p>A major disadvantage is the flip side: the sunshine can't help dry out plant leaves that get wet. Some plants don't like cold and wet foliage. These conditions can foster blight on tomatoes for example. See also <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/81/best-conditions-for-basil/144#144"">this answer</a> that mentions being careful not to leave basil damp overnight.</p>

<p>So if you're watering in the evening, don't spray the foliage. Use a soaker hose or other irrigation technique that targets the roots instead of the foliage.</p>

<p>Early morning is a good time to water. You can give the soil a good soaking and everything has a chance to penetrate before being burned off by the sun. Anything that gets on the foliage will dry up with the sun and you're less prone to disease and fungi.</p>

"Why does my blueberry bush have brown/scorched leaves?","23096","","<p>I recently purchased a dwarf Northsky blueberry bush from a mail order company.

<p>I plucked those off and transplanted the bush to a larger container and I noticed the plant was also severely rootbound. I had to break off a lot of its roots to plant it. It has been about a week now, and I've noticed maybe two or three more leaves with those symptoms. Since then, the plant has bloomed about 5 really pretty looking flowers. </p>

<p>I want to know if the leaf symptoms were a sign of it suffocating in its original container or shock from being shipped, or maybe that of a more serious disease.</p>

<p>Currently the plant is being kept indoors while I try to nurse it back to health. I keep it in a room with good southern sun exposure. </p>
","<p>The burnt/scorched looking leaves could mean a lot of things. My first guess would be over fertilization either at the nursery or by you. Blueberries need acidic soil at a pH level of about 4.5-5. If you used a regular high nitrogen fertilizer, it would be terrible for the plant and the leaves can get ""burnt"" from the fertilizer.</p>

<p>Secondly, blueberries like well drained soils. They have very shallow root systems and stagnant water can also lead to discoloration of the leaves, although this is usually deep reddish-brown (like fall colors), and seldom have a burnt appearance. However, I won't rule this out. Since you said that it was heavily rootbound, it is very likely that the water wasn't draining away fully. I explain a bit more about this and how to increase soil pH for blueberries in <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/2323/is-it-really-important-to-give-blueberry-plants-acidic-soil/2324#2324"">this answer</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Below quote comes from Growing Small Fruits for the Home Garden:</p>
  
  <p><strong>Watering</strong></p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Lack of supplemental watering from June to August severely limits successful production of blueberries in the Pacific Northwest. Shallow-rooted plants require close attention to maintain a uniformly moist environment around their base. They require 1, or possibly 2 inches of water each week, in the absence of any rainfall. Be sure the entire root zone is wet after an irrigation. Drought symptoms include <strong>reddened foliage</strong>, weak, thin shoots, and reduced fruit set. Maintain a 2-inch mulch layer to preserve soil moisture.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Also see the scientific reason in Mike's answer, although I'm not sure if that applies to blueberries too.</p>

<p>Lastly, it could be something as simple as sun scorching. If the nursery was in a place that had long periods of direct, intense sunlight every day, it could have scorched the leaves. <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/1704/how-do-i-prevent-my-berry-leaves-from-getting-scorched-in-the-sun"">This happened to my raspberries</a> and the advice there was to use a sun shading fabric.</p>

I cut it down but now there are little branches coming out of the ground in the area the tree use to be. I think it is the old root system trying to stay alive. I really liked the location of the tree, one of the neighbors said it was an apple tree. I cut it down in the winter, had no idea what it was. My question is if I wanted the tree to come back could I let one of these branches keep growing and it would turn into a tree again or is this just some sort of last ditch effort of the tree trying to stay alive but would not turn into a tree again.</p>
","<p>There is one possible problem. If it is an apple tree, and if you cut it really low down, close to the ground, the growth you're getting may be off the rootstock itself, rather than the original, grafted apple variety. If the stems you get turn out to be thorny as they mature, then you'll have a wild apple rather than a variety that you might actually want to use. Some apples are grafted much higher up on the stem or trunk, so even if you didn't cut low down, you may find all you've got is a wild apple.</p>

<p>I'd be inclined to poison the stump with a stump killer, together with any major roots you can find, or else bore out the stump to a depth of 18 inches, taking some of the major roots too. And then plant an apple tree of your choice, if that's what you want.</p>

<p>However, if you find that your mint requirements are generally more than what you can reasonably take from the plant at once, I would suggest getting a second or a third plant and cycling between them.

In fact, it looks healthy to me.</p>

<p>I believe the thin ""dried"" stem that you see in the right is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>stolon</strong></a>, which is how mint propagates. Stolons generally spread horizontally along the ground surface. However, by their very nature (technically being stems), they seek out light and since there is no way to grow horizontally in a pot, they grow upwards. In my plant, since it's in the ground, the stolons just spread outwards, instead of upwards. </p>

<p>Another identifying feature of a stolon is that they have longer internodal distances. What I mean by this is that if you look at the distance between the ""notches"" (where the leaves form) in the thin stem on the right and in the other thicker ones, you'll see that it's longer, which further confirms my suspicion. </p>

<li><p><strong>Your plant is <a href=""http://www.evergreengardenworks.com/rootball.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">root bound</a></strong></p>

<p>A plant is said to be root bound when it is grown in a container too small for it. The roots fill up the volume of the container and when it cannot grow any more, the plant stops growing too. A root bound plant <strong>will not</strong> grow even if the conditions are favourable and you have a perfect watering/feeding/fertilizing schedule. Here's how the roots will look like inside the container.</p>

<p>The article linked above puts it quite well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At what point do plants stop growing in a pot? It's a bit involved, but the simple answer is that new growth stops or slows when they become rootbound. So what's rootbound? Rootbound is when there is no effective space for new roots to occupy. Roots effectively occupy the entire volume of space between the soil particles. One of the first symptoms of being rootbound is, in fact, that plant growth slows despite favorable environmental conditions (light, water, fertilizer, etc). The second symptom is that rootbound plants begin having difficulty taking up fertilizer. This is undoubtedly related to the inability to form new root tissue. You see this as a chlorosis despite the fact that they have been properly fertilized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that you grew it in a pot specifically to contain the roots, I'm quite certain that this is the problem. You could try transplanting it to a bigger container to provide more space for the roots. Don't forget to untangle the bound roots before you transplant.</p></li>

<p>If there are any suitable candidates, please rank in order of indoor-toughness.</p>
","<p>For many indoor tropical plants life in the office is slow death.  You may feel that way yourself after a bad day!
With minimal light levels and good watering practices most tropicals will live for a while. The ones that require high light will draw on their stored resources in the roots and gradually go downhill.
Tropicals that tolerate low light levels for a long time are</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epipremnum_aureum"">pothos</a>  - indestructible and common</li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aglaonema"">aglaonema</a> - and its relative <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spathiphyllum"">spathiphyllum</a></li>

</ul>

<p>If you don't mind some extra work most palms (date palm, canary palm, bella palm) will tolerate low light levels for many months before needing a refresher session in higher light.
Ficus have an undeserved reputation for being finicky about light levels.  Most new plants are inadequately conditioned for low light and drop many leaves with a change to lower light.  An older plant grown in lower light will thin out but look quite acceptable. Particularly if it's height allows the foliage to be closer to the lights.</p>

<p>A faraday cage has no influence on plants that I know of but too much water will.  Water thoroughly and let dry out. Constantly wet soil means root rot: the number one killer of tropical plants.  If you don't mind a little extra work the self watering pots or making your own with a <a href=""http://www.greenculturesg.com/articles/may06/may06_self_watering_pot.htm"">capillary wick</a> are an excellent way of providing a good water cycle. I use strips from self watering mats rather than the acrylic string indicated in the link.</p>

","<p>A brushwood killer applied to pre drilled holes or cuts into the woody roots or severed trunks of the tree is best. In the UK, SBK would be the one - this is a liquid and contains the active ingredient triclopyr, which is particularly effective with woody growth. Using something like this in pre drilled holes, carefully applied without spillage, and covered with something afterwards, reduces the impact on the immediate environment including waterways, although it seems your tree is growing near drainage rather than a water supply for drinking. I do not know whether a product like this would be available where you are.</p>

"Why is my pine tree turning brown?","22391","","<p>I have 4 pine trees (not sure the type but they look like Christmas trees) in my back yard.  They were planted at the end of May by the people that we bought the house from.  One of them has turned completely brown (but still has needles on the tree but they are slowly falling off), and the others are beginning to turn brown near the edges.</p>

<p>I live in Maryland (USA) and it is the start of winter but not below freezing if it matters.</p>

<p>What should I do to save these trees?  Is the one that is all brown already dead?  Will it come back?  Maybe I am not watering them enough?  How much water should they get?</p>
","<p>It may be too late for the one that is completely brown, and you may decide you don't want to keep the others which have brown parts either. Trees, any variety, need regular and copious amounts of water in their first 2 years, so around 2 gallons a week as a minimum, more if the weather is hot and dry. They are at risk of dying from drought without it, and in the case of conifers, will start to go brown and shed needles in some parts, if not all.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, your trees will always have those dead and brown parts, although growth may continue in other parts, and even at the tips of dead branches, if water arrived in time, but they do not regenerate or grow replacement needles in parts which have been affected.</p>

","<p>String trimmers tend to leave the cut edges of grass rough and ragged, which is unsightly as well as not good for the grass plants. The strings on the trimmer are also generally not good for more than just a few yards of heavy cutting before they become weak and start to break off, requiring more string be let out of the reel to continue working. This can make mowing with a string trimmer rather frustrating.  Because of these issues, I believe string trimmers are not the best thing to use for mowing whole swaths, so personally I'd go with the reel mower for doing more than just spot clean up of the lawn areas.  </p>

","<p>Yes, your arugula's crop season is coming to an end, as bstpierre notes. Mine finished going to seed and dried out completely by last week (I live in southern California, so you can compare the weather here with your location). </p>

<p>You certainly have planted them very close to each other, which is why they aren't tall/the leaves aren't bigger (in comparison, mine's about 3-4 feet tall). Next year, try to give them some more space (depending on how much you can spare), ideally about 10 inches apart. The plants will support each other as they grow, just like some varieties of peas. I don't try to collect the seeds, but instead let the pods dry out, pop and spread it on its own. When it grows again the next season, you can pull them from wherever they are and plant it neatly in a row/grid.</p>

<p>One thing that I did notice that was different from other greens in my garden, is that the leaves of arugula still remained edible right till the very end and do not increase in bitterness like lettuce does. The reason for this is that in lettuce, <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/529/109"">the bitterness is a defense mechanism</a> against pests, especially during the final bolting phase. On the other hand, arugula is inherently bitter and most insects avoid it, so there is no need for an additional defense mechanism.  Since arugula is an acquired taste anyway, there is no discernable change in bitterness. So for now, the green leaves are perfectly fine to eat.</p>

"Can a lemon tree become an orange tree?","22034","","<p>I feel stupid to ask this, as there are many posts on Google about this, and I can't tell, if people are writing these stories for fun or it is real.</p>

<p>Some claim that if you have a many old lemon trees they can become orange trees if you are not <em>careful</em>, whatever that means.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Could it be that pollen from an orange tree could convert a lemon tree?</p>

<p>Or is this whole thing a hoax?</p>
","<p>Most citrus trees are grafted onto a different rootstock, usually sweet orange these days, even if the fruit from the top graft is going to be lemon or lime. The only way a lemon tree can completely turn into an orange tree is if the grafted part has died and the rootstock then grows on its own, producing the fruit its programmed to produce, depending on the rootstock used. That might be sweet orange (most likely) or sour orange, or even, on older trees, rough lemon. The grafted part might die for various reasons - infection or even over rigorous pruning, right down to the base, which is likely to encourage the rootstock to take over instead.</p>

<p>The other possibility for partial change is if a sucker arises from the rootstock (below the scion, or graft point, at the base of the plant, usually) and is allowed to grow - because rootstocks are generally more vigorous than the grafted parts, this may well grow strongly and produce its own, different fruit. More suckers may arise, and they take over the growing process, and the grafted part dies or fails to produce. </p>

<p>Chimerism is somewhat different - this might be something that happens in very old trees, but citrus stock has, for some years, been produced by cloning, which means chimerism, unless it occurs naturally (rare), isn't really an issue via grafting. Even if it did occur, it wouldn't make the whole tree an orange instead of a lemon.</p>

","<p>I agree with Tea Drinker.  You could (and probably do) have a large population of small slugs hiding in your soil as well as larger snails and slugs hiding in the leafy parts of your garden during the day.  To combat them without pesticides, you can use a combination of approaches: 1. go out into the garden after dark and collect the little critters, making sure you look in the areas surrounding your veg and flower patches, and discard them (chuck them over your garden fence or dispatch them in a glass of cheap lager); and 2. if available in your area, you can buy nematodes that will infect and kill your slug (but not snail) population (this is the brand available in the UK:  <a href=""http://www.nemaslug.org.uk/"">http://www.nemaslug.org.uk/</a>) There are other non-toxic methods (there are organic slug and snail pellets available), but I've found these two approaches to be the most effective.</p>

<p>I've also found that coarse sand can also act as a barrier to snails and slugs, particularly in the greenhouse or other moderately-protected areas.</p>

<p>Additionally, I grow all my lettuces in planters and ring the planters with copper tape which, in my experience, is great at keeping snails off tender plants (e.g <a href=""http://www.organiccatalogue.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=1756"">http://www.organiccatalogue.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=1756</a> .)  This time last year, my potted hostas were nearly decimated by slugs, but this year there's not a hole in sight!  By the way, I've found that snails and slugs climb right over the copper rings that sit directly on the soil and they ignore sunken beer traps, but maybe I have fussy slugs.</p>

<p>I am starting a treatment, with soap, vinegar and scissors, like it is scale, anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2012-05-22:</strong> Just after my last update I have started my 'treatment'. I have washed the leaves and whole plant with a soap and vinegar mixture, then flushed with clear water. I was able to get rid of most of the white stuff and for a moment things looked well. But in an hour first leaves started wilting. In a couple more hours most of them wilted. The next day most of the leaves and some branches were clearly dead. The pests would probably not harm this plant as I did…  I hope they were killed together with the most of this plant.</p>

<p>Probably the solution was too strong, the leaves to delicate for such treatment or I was not able to flush it properly. Or all of these. Do not try this at home!</p>

<p>Out of curiosity I have kept the plant to see if it can survive. Now, a week later, new leaves and branches appear. The three fruits are still there, even some flower buds seem still alive. The pests are nowhere to be seen, but I know I need to wait a few more weeks to know if they are really gone.</p>

<p>The next time the bugs appear, I will buy some pesticides at a local gardening shop and use them properly rather than trying a compilation of 'organic' treatments described on the Internet. :)</p>

<p><strong>Update 2012-06-19:</strong> Over a month passed and the plant recovered from my 'treatment'. Unfortunately so did the insects. Yesterday I have found them on my Cayenne plant, then one adult on a Habanero and lots of small ones on the Twilight, which started this story. This time I have bought a pesticide (systemic, for chewing and sucking insects) in a nearby gardening shop and sprayed all my plants… I hope this time the results will be much better.</p>
","<p>The last picture clinches it - it's undoubtedly scale.</p>

<p>Scale is really hard to get rid of entirely.  For most of the lifecycle it's very tiny and impossible to spot all of.  It spreads to other plants.  It leaves a sticky residue underneath the plant that's hard to remove.  So... consider tossing the plant.</p>

<p>You can slow it down a lot with organic sprays, and by peeling the brown adults off with a thumbnail if it won't damage the plant.  After you think it's gone,  keep treating the plant and inspecting daily for a couple of months.  The life cycle of scale is about 6 weeks, and for most of it's life it's virtually invisible.  </p>

<p>Keep infected plants away from other plants.  No flying is involved - when young they crawl.</p>

<p>Another technique is to spray or gently wipe down the leaves (tops and bottoms, being sure to get around the bottom central rib) with rubbing alcohol.</p>

<p>For any given technique, you can find five people who say it doesn't work, and one person that says it does.  Regardless of what you use, you must continue long beyond when you think it's gone.</p>

<p>The sticky honeydew they leave on the leaves often grows sooty mold, a black fungus - rinse or gently wipe it off occasionally.</p>

<p>So what is the difference between a spade and a shovel?</p>
","<p>Seems it depends where you live!</p>

<p>In the UK, a spade is most definitely not a shovel, they're two different tools intended for different usage. A shovel is broader, more curved from left to right, and sometimes longer in the blade, sometimes slightly broader at the sharp end, sometimes with a sort of ledge running either side down to the tip. Occasionally you find a shovel with a pointed tip, and the other difference is, they come in numbered sizes. It's the sort of thing builders use when shovelling sand or concrete into a mixer, or mixing cement by hand, for instance, or for shovelling coal, or shovelling loose topsoil from a pile into a wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>A spade is what's shown in the pictures under the question you refer to, whether it has a rounded tip or not. Its shape and weight are designed for digging in the ground - try doing that with a shovel, and you'll quickly discover the difference between the two, apart from their appearance.</p>

","<p>I believe there appears to be conflicting advice concerning ""stratification"" (eg place in a refrigerator or not) and if to plant the ""pits"" or the ""seeds"" (within), mainly because it really depends on the exact method of seed germination you choose to pursue...</p>

<p><a href=""http://horticulture.psu.edu/files/hort/extension/growing_tree_fruit.pdf"">GROWING NEW FRUIT TREE PLANTS FROM SEED</a> (direct link to PDF) via Penn State University Department of Horticulture</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The seeds of all common tree fruits (apple, pear, peach, and cherry) require a chilling 
  period before they will germinate and form new plants. The chilling period occurs after the fruit portion is ripe. This period is known as either dormancy or afterripening. During this period the embryo develops until it is mature. This is accomplished by subjecting the seeds to a cold treatment.</p>
  
  <p>There are two systems whereby the necessary after ripening could be accomplished:</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>Plant the pits (or seeds) directly outdoors after the first frost of the year (normally sometime in the Autumn/Fall). The cold Wintertime temperatures put the seeds though their ""stratification"" period.
<br />
<br />
When planting outside in areas that go through freeze, thaw cycles you can get away with planting the pits, as mother nature will take care of breaking them open via seasonal changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Before planting the seeds (or pits) indoors, the seeds need to be put through their ""stratification"" period, this is where placing them in a refrigerator comes in.
<br /> 
<br />
To help increase the germination rate of indoor planting it's advisable to remove the seeds from the pits, when and how you do this is really up to you, personally I think it makes more sense to extract them from the pits just prior to planting ie After they've gone through their ""stratification"" period.
<br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Extract seeds and/or pits from the fruit of which you wish to reproduce new plants. Remove all adhering fruit portions and allow seeds to air dry. Then, place them in a glass jar or other suitable container to which a loosely fitted lid or cover may be added. Set the seeds aside in a cool place until mid-January.
  <br />
  <br />
  ... in mid-January mix the seeds with either moist (not wet) peat moss, sand or shredded paper towels. Return mixture to the container and replace lid. <strong>Place container and seeds in the refrigerator until after the last severe spring frosts. The seeds should remain in the refrigerator for at least 60 days.</strong>
  <br /></p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>Of course you can accomplish the required ""stratification"" period via either ""outdoor"" or ""indoor"" (refrigeration) methods, then transplant the saplings or seeds to where you want them (outside or inside).</p>

","<p>One thing you can do is dig a series of swales. They can be nearly invisible -- you dig a shallow ditch on contour, and then fill it in with compost so that you can't really even see it. This helps slow runoff and avoid erosion. (You probably won't get away with ""invisible"" on a 25% slope.) Additionally, the swale holds water and allows it to seep slowly into the lawn below. This gives the lawn a more even source of water.</p>

<p>In revising this answer, I realize that I should have recommended planting trees at intervals on this slope. If possible, you want something that will root deeply and hold the soil well. A major rain event could cause a landslide.</p>

<p>Here's an <a href=""http://permaculture.org.au/2010/05/20/water-harvesting-and-storage/"" rel=""noreferrer"">illustration from The Permaculture Research Institute</a>:</p>

<p>That same page has an <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/v/UFeylOa_S4c"" rel=""noreferrer"">informative video</a> on how it is supposed to work.</p>

<p>If you don't do this (and I have gotten away with not doing it, though not as steep as 25%), you can possibly get by with straw covering and keeping it moist. The risk here is that a thunderstorm which drops a bunch of rain all at once can wipe your planting out.</p>

<p>Hydroseeding would be another possibility. You'd have to rent a machine or get someone to come in and do this for you. I've seen (but haven't done myself) some very steep slopes successfully planted with a hydroseeder.</p>

<p>We have really good luck with composted horse manure, though we don't generally care about all the weeds (mostly clover) that comes along with it. About a 2"" thick layer of this on top of the soil does a great job. The compost absorbs a <strong>ton</strong> of moisture, I've never seen it erode. It's kind of like hydroseeding, but with shovels instead of a machine, and a ""ready made"" seed &amp; fertilizer mixture... ;)</p>

"What's an organic way to discourage crabgrass from a large ""lawn""?","20489","","<p>I have a large area that's infested with crabgrass. I'd like to use organic methods to encourage the grass mix over the crabgrass.</p>

<p>The fact that it's a large area means I can't afford to apply (nor do I want to) herbicides.</p>

<p>The soil is acidic and thin in spots -- there are ledge outcroppings visible. It gets an annual lime treatment (according to soil tests).</p>

<p>What sort of maintenance should I do (on a budget) to discourage the crabgrass? I'm not in a hurry, nor do I require perfection. I'd just like to lower the percentage of crabgrass.</p>

<p>(Full disclosure: this ""lawn"" is actually a small horse pasture. But for what I'm looking for in terms of advice, just think of it as a big lawn that needs organic methods.)</p>

</ul>

<p>Personally, I pretty much follow all the advice given in this brilliant article:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.richsoil.com/lawn-care.jsp"" rel=""noreferrer"">Organic Lawn Care For the Cheap and Lazy</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So far, the advice given in that article <strong>hasn't</strong> totally prevented my crabgrass problem. I'm still battling crabgrass, especially when summer heat really kicks in here (St Louis Missouri), constant mid 90's&#176;F (30's&#176;C) to tomorrows forecasted high of 115&#176;F (46&#176;C).</p>

<p>From everything I've read, been told, and from 4 years personal experience with doing battle with this annual weed, I have come to the conclusion it's a slow battle that takes years to get under control (win), <strong>especially if going with an organic approach.</strong> Each year I have definitely seen an improvement, meaning less crabgrass, and yes I'm getting a little tired of this battle, but because I've decided to go into battle with an organic approach, I keep telling myself, ""Perseverance and time is the answer in winning this battle"".</p>

<p><strong>Here is what I basically do each year, keep in mind I have a cool-season grass, a ""Tall Fescue"" lawn:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I have one lawnmower and two blades for it. I get both sharpened at the end of the cutting season (sometime in November for me). I install a sharp blade immediately before the first cut of the cutting season (sometime in April for me). I then swap out that blade with the other sharpened one about halfway through the cutting season (end of July, beginning of August for me).</p></li>
<li><p>When installing the sharp blade on the lawnmower for the first cut, I also:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fill it up with fresh fuel (petrol, gas), the fuel has been treated with a suitable fuel stabilizer.</li>
<li>Fill it up with new oil.</li>
<li>Put a new spark-plug and new air-filter in.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mow high and when doing so only remove approximately &#8531; of the grass blade height. In my case, 3inch (75mm) is my final cut height, that is as high as my current lawnmower will cut. My next lawnmower will be able to cut to at least 4inch (100mm).</p></li>
<li><p>Seeing as my lawnmower is a mulching mowing, I leave all the grass clippings on the lawn (free, natural fertilizer), except with first cut and last cut of the season. I collect up those cuttings and dispose of them via a community yard waste pile.</p></li>
<li><p>Fertilize the lawn with corn gluten meal  (by <a href=""http://www.bradfieldorganics.com/corngluten900.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bradfield</a> because I can get it easily locally) in very early Spring, when I see the Forsythia shrub in flower in my area.</p></li>
<li><p>For the first time this year I also decided to fertilize the lawn with corn gluten meal in mid June. Why? See ""Table 4"" here: <a href=""http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G6749"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cool-season grasses: Application schedule for organic fertilizers</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Corn gluten meal <strong>isn't a ""magic bullet""</strong> for controlling unwanted weeds (plants). I've read and been told that it can take at least 2 to 3 years (following recommended application rates on yearly bases) before seeing any results with this method.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Once or twice a week, I walk the lawn and pull out by hand all the weeds (unwanted plants) I can see, roots and all. The first year I did this (4 years ago), I would be out there for at least an hour doing that (wife would continually tell me it was more like two). This year, I'm out there 5 minutes (10 minutes at the very most).</p></li>
<li><p>I make 5 gallons of compost tea each week (from late Spring to earlier Autumn ""Fall"") and apply the 5 gallon batch to the front garden one week, then the following week apply a new fresh 5 gallon batch to the back garden. I repeat that cycle for the period given previously. I have been doing this for 2 years now, and without question I have noticed a massive increase in worm activity e.g. lots of worm castings on the surface of the soil.</p>

<ul>
<li>I spread the 5 gallons of Compost Tea via a watering-can over approx 1800ft&#178; (170m&#178;). Lawn area is about the same front &amp; back for me. So one week the front lawn gets treated, then the following week the back lawn gets treated, repeat, repeat...</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li><p>During dry, hot spells (generally July &amp; August here in Missouri), I water the lawn approximately once a week. I water deeply, at least 1inch (25mm) of water. I don't have an in-ground watering system, instead I use a sprinkler connected to a hose on the front lawn and the same again on the back lawn. I move the sprinklers once the areas currently being watered have received its 1inch (25mm) of water. I do this by timing, as I've worked out how long it takes my sprinklers to deliver that amount of water to an area.</p></li>
<li><p>During dry, hot spells (generally July &amp; August here in Missouri), when temperatures are constantly over 90&#176;F (32&#176;C) I <strong>never</strong> go out and cut the lawn. A cool-season lawn hardly puts on any new growth in those kind of temperatures (will start to enter dormancy). Once the temperatures have dropped back into the 80's&#176;F (mid to high 20's&#176;C) for a few days, I will go out and cut the lawn, but only if it needs a cut. If it doesn't, I just wait until it does and temperatures are right for cool-season lawn cutting.</p></li>

<p><em>While I fully realise the above does not give you a <strong>""magic bullet""</strong> for dealing with crabgrass, I hope it does proves somewhat helpful.</em></p>

<p><em>Good luck, and please let me know if you find that <strong>""magic bullet.""</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<p>I've now been maintaining a cool-season lawn for 5 cutting seasons, prior to that I had no ""real"" experience with that lawn type. Therefore I've made mistakes, learnt a lot and still have a lot to learn.</p>

<p><strong>Mistakes I've made:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>1st cutting season - Was cutting far too low, 1 to 1&#189;inch (25 to 37.5mm) finished cut height.</p></li>
<li><p>1st cutting season - Was collecting the clippings (via mower bag) every cut.</p></li>
<li><p>1st cutting season - Did not water at all.</p></li>
<li><p>1st cutting season - Did not collect up <strong>all</strong> the fallen leaves in Autumn (Fall).</p></li>
<li><p>1st &amp; 2nd cutting season - Did not apply any kind of fertilizer.</p></li>
<li><p>2nd cutting season - Reseeded bear spots in Spring (late April, early May).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Things I've changed, learnt:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cut high, I would say 2&#189; inch (62.5mm) is the absolute minimum for a ""healthy"" cool-season lawn.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a mulching type mower, leave the clippings on the lawn (free natural fertilizer).</p></li>
<li><p>Apply some kind of fertilizer, even if you only apply once a year (do so in the Autumn ""Fall"").</p></li>
<li><p>During hot, dry spells, water deeply (approx 1inch/25mm) once every week or two.</p></li>
<li><p>I think we can all agree, pulling weeds from wet ground is a <strong>lot</strong> easier and more effective, seeing as we get the whole weed (plant), root an all out of the ground. But today (2011-07-22) I finally noticed that if I look at my lawn immediately after watering (or a good rain), I can very easily see any young (small) crabgrass that's within my lawn. How? <strong>The young (small) crabgrass has a very different green colour from my lawn grass, I believe the water on the lawn helps magnify that difference in colour. In my lawn it looks luminous ie Light, bright green. Where as my lawn grass is a dark green.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Reseed in early Autumn (Fall) ie Performing major cool-season lawn maintenance at this time of year, will give you the best results (reap the rewards the following cutting season).</p></li>
<li><p>Pick up <strong>all</strong> the fallen Autumn (Fall) leaves, be careful with Black Walnut leaves &amp; diseased leaves, for the ""average"" gardener it is ""generally"" considered best practice to dispose of them separately (don't put them in your compost pile). Shred them up if you can, put them into bags, store the bags in a shed or garage for the Winter, then at the very beginning of Spring empty those bags into your compost pile.</p></li>
<li><p>Organic lawn care (organic anything) is a long, slow process, not a ""miracle"" instant fix. Each year you build on the previous year, some years you will move forward more than others, but you should see at least some forward movement each year (unless you're really unlucky).</p></li>
<li><p>An organically maintained lawn isn't going to be totally weed (unwanted plants) free. Period. You can't control outside conditions eg Birds dropping seeds into your landscape. Weed (unwanted plants) seeds being blown into your landscape by the wind.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Nothing to do with crabgrass control, but hopefully you will indulge me if you've gotten down this far (if it proves ""unwanted"" I will happily remove this section), as a ""bonus"" (for myself) for taking an organic approach to lawn maintenance, I planted some Spring bulbs in the front lawn last year (November 2010):</p>

<ul>
<li>50 Crocus ""Lawn Mix"".</li>
<li>12 Scilla ""Siberica"".</li>
</ul>

<p>I am so glad I did, the wife loved them, a few of the neighbours made some nice comments...</p>

"Is there anything I can put on my lawn to prevent my dog from digging?","20282","","<p>About a year ago, we had a really bad gopher problem in our backyard. I've successfully trapped and eliminated all the gophers but my dog sometimes can still smell something and goes crazy digging. I wouldn't mind the digging, but we just laid sod earlier this year. The lawn in the backyard covers roughly 3,500 square feet.</p>

<p>I'm curious if there's anything I can do (besides being 100% vigilant while my dog is out back) to the lawn itself that could eliminate the gopher odor, or make it harder for him to scent. Obviously, I don't want the grass to be negatively impacted.</p>
","<p>This may seem odd, but it has worked for me. Place the dog's feces in the hole they dug, then cover it back up. You may have to do this many times if they continually dig there holes in different places. At some point your dog will dig in a hole that you have covered up once before. At this point they will be disgusted by what they find and will learn to stop digging. Or if there is indeed a smell they are digging for, they will now have another (bad) smell on top of it.</p>

<p>Doing this kept our dog from digging for a full year. He relapsed recently, but one treatment has him back to being dig free.</p>

<p>There is one other thing to keep in mind, sometimes dogs dig to find cool or warm dirt. If you leave your dog outside during temperature extremes, they may just be digging as part of their natural instinct to keep their temperature stable. Giving your dog a place that they are allowed to dig or providing a dog house can assist if this is the source of the issue.a</p>

"What is the best way to prevent animals from eating my garden without a fence?","20072","","<p>We have a raised bed garden that does well for the most part.  For aesthetic purposes, my wife will not let me put a fence around the garden.  Most of the veggies and herbs do well and do not get eaten by the various critters.

","<p><a href=""http://www.veggiegardener.com/make-your-garden-deer-resistant/"">This web page</a> lists techniques for making your garden ""deer resistant"":</p>

<li>Plants they don't like</li>
<li>Deer repellent</li>

<li>Motion activated sprinklers, lights, noise makers</li>

<li>Dog</li>
</ul>

<p>You mention other critters, but don't say what kind -- rabbits, woodchucks, voles? The control method will vary greatly:</p>

<ul>
<li>For rabbits and woodchucks:
<ul>
<li>a low fence might work, but you'll have to bury part of it since they can dig</li>
<li>more smelly sprays</li>
<li>traps -- live or dead</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For voles, good luck... maybe an outdoor cat or two?</li>
<li>Some of the motion activated noise/light devices may work well on other animals depending on what is invading your garden.</li>
<li>Raccoons can be deterred with a couple of low strands of electric fencing around the garden. I don't know if this will count against your fence ban -- it's a temporary fence that could be taken down after the growing season.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fences are the most common advice I've seen (and what I use) and from what I can tell the most effective. If you can't do this, you may want to try some of the sprays/repellents. E.g. fox or cat urine.</p>

<p>Depending on the animal, some people use a live trap and then transport the animal far enough away to make it someone else's problem. Just make sure you can deal with a live trap in a timely manner -- leaving an animal die slowly baking in the sun all day is much worse than just using an ""instant-kill"" trap.</p>

<p>Again depending on the animal, you can cage the plants, e.g. small cubes of wire fencing around your spinach, lettuce, etc to keep small animals off.</p>

"How can I keep gravel from moving out of my driveway during winter?","20029","","<p>I have a gravel driveway going horizontally across a hill, and have trouble keeping the gravel in the driveway, especially during snow. This is because every time I shovel out the driveway, stones get picked up by the shovel and thrown into the grass. Of course, this takes a long time to pick up. Big rainstorms also wash out gravel. It is crushed limestone in the 1/2-1"" diameter range. I can't pave it because I haven't got the money, and there are some nice trees over it which would be bothered by pavement. How do I keep gravel where it belongs?</p>
","<p>Two traditional methods which work but may not agree with you are:</p>

<p>1) tar the surface.  I believe you could get a local construction company to do this as spraying hot tar may not be a chore you want to do</p>

<p>2) If your driveway is already compacted and drains well this is my preferred solution:  </p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravel"">Crusher run</a> or
Crushed stone: this is generally limestone or dolomite that has been crushed and graded by screens to certain size classes. It is widely used in concrete and as a surfacing for roads and driveways, sometimes with tar applied over it. ... A special type of limestone crushed stone is dense grade aggregate, or DGA, also known as crusher run, or colloquially as ""crush and run"". This is a mixed grade of mostly small crushed stone in a matrix of crushed limestone powder.</p>

<p>This should be available in bulk at good prices from any quarry or landscape supplier. Spread in a layer so the top of the existing gravel and compact with a roller and apply water to harden.
For spots where it could wash out mix with Portland cement.</p>

<p>Average Coverage</p>

<p>*1 cu. Yd. will cover approximately 100 sq. ft. at 2"" deep</p>

<p>If you are going to go to the effort of doing this you should also do some grading on the uphill side to add a ditch and add piping to let the water through from one side to another.</p>

","<p>Roots exposed to the sun might think they have reached the surface and start to put shoots out.</p>

<p>Those particular containers don't look very strong - don't underestimate the weight of wet soil. Ideally you should have some more rigid that does not collapse under the soil's weight or when you move them.</p>

<p>Do these containers have holes in them? Holes in the bottom are required for drainage, but holes in the side could wet (and degrade) black paper/card as recommend by @shanna.</p>

<p>Plastic pots can be okay, but you need something stronger and opaque. All plastic pots will eventually degrade with the UV from the sun. Perhaps not a significant problem at high latitudes, but here in Texas, they definitely have a limited life (as does plastic garden furniture!) and some are better than others.</p>

"How do I get rid of wild blackberry?","19778","","<p>I have an area that is being taken over by wild blackberry thickets. this area had been growing wild flowers and is on a dry southwest slope.</p>

<p>How do I get rid of them, preferably via organic means, and prevent them from taking over again?</p>

<p>Once I've cleared the area of them, I will probably scatter wildflower seeds or something similar...</p>
","<p>First, I don't believe there's a quick fix, solution, to successful removal of wild blackberries.</p>

<p>I suggest starting any of the below methods in mid Spring.</p>

<p><strong>If you're dealing with a small area (3 or 4 bushes at the most):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cut everything down to about 12inches (300mm) above ground level.</p></li>
<li><p>Let the area regrow for 3 to 4 weeks.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the above couple of steps as many times as you can, three times being the absolute minimum.</p></li>
<li><p>Immediately after you've cut down for the last time, dig the bushes out, doing your very best to dig out as much of the root system as you can.</p></li>
<li><p>Then mechanically till the area. Remove any roots you see.</p></li>
<li><p>After that, go out once a week with a ""sharp"" hoe and remove any vegetation that has popped its head above the surface.</p></li>
<li><p>4 weeks after tilling, mechanically till the area again. Remove any roots you see.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, go out once a week with a ""sharp"" hoe and remove any vegetation that has popped its head above the surface.</p></li>
<li><p>4 weeks after the previous tilling, mechanically till the area one final time. Remove any roots you see.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, go out once a week for the next 2 to 3 weeks with a ""sharp"" hoe and remove any vegetation that has popped its head above the surface.</p></li>
<li><p>The area should now be ready for wildflower seeds...</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you're dealing with an area larger than ""small area"" (via ""organic"" herbicide):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cut everything down to about 12inches (300mm) above ground level.</p></li>
<li><p>Let the area regrow for 3 to 4 weeks.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the above couple of steps as many times as you can, three times being the absolute minimum.</p></li>
<li><p>Immediately after you've cut down for the last time, spray the vegetation with -- be sure to read and follow all the (safety) instructions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>High strength (20%) horticultural vinegar weed killer.</p></li>
<li><p>Or a product like <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=Poison+Ivy+Defoliant"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Poison Ivy Defoliant</a>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Repeat the above spraying procedure once every 2 to 3 weeks for two further applications (minimum).</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of weeks after the final ""spray"" application, go out there and clear away everything you can see.</p></li>
<li><p>After that, go out once a week for the next month or so with a ""sharp"" hoe and remove any vegetation that has popped its head above the surface.</p></li>
<li><p>The area should now be ready for wildflower seeds, but before doing so, get a soil test done, this will inform you if you need to change the soil pH -- the herbicide, especially such strong vinegar based ones will more than likely have made the soil very acidic.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you're dealing with an area larger than ""small area"" (via non-herbicide means):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cut everything down to about 12inches (300mm) above ground level.</p></li>
<li><p>Let the area regrow for 3 to 4 weeks.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the above couple of steps as many times as you can, three times being the absolute minimum.</p></li>
<li><p>Immediately after you've cut down for the last time, dig the bushes out, doing your very best to dig out as much of the root system as you can.</p></li>
<li><p>Then mechanically till the area. Remove any roots you see.</p></li>
<li><p>After that, target the area via either:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/113/weed-control-in-a-butterfly-garden/1298#1298"">Solarization</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Covering the ground with old carpet or thick brown cardboard or heavy-duty black plastic or... then bury that under a thick layer of mulch (6inches/150mm minimum).</p>

<ul>
<li>Leave in place until the following Spring.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>When using Solarization or Mulching as a method, extend the area 2 to 3 feet (600 to 900mm) all the way around past the last visible sign of the blackberry bushes, doing so will help prevent any underground roots that are left from working themselves out into the open, thus allowing the plant a means of survival.</p></li>
<li><p>After using either of those methods (Solarization or Mulching), the area should now be ready for wildflower seeds...</p></li>
</ul>

"Why did my young cucumbers turn yellow and fall off?","19648","","<p><a href=""http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img537/2604/223Te1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">small cucumbers turned yellow http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img537/2604/223Te1.jpg</a></p>

<p>My baby cucumbers turned yellow and fell off. I have 2 cucumber plants that produced 8 cucumbers each, however, the other flowers with small cucumbers turned yellow and fell off.</p>

<p>What causes that problem? How can I solve it? </p>
","<p>Pollination is probably the issue - the cucumber is formed behind a female flower, but if the flower does not get pollinated, then it yellows, shrivels and drops off. You haven't said whether you're growing under glass (less likely to be pollinated by insects) or not, but you can hand pollinate - take a small paintbrush, grasp the male flower (the ones without the tiny cucumber behind them), gently swirl the brush around in the centre of the flower, till you can see yellow pollen on it, then transfer that to the female, using the same procedure.</p>

"How often should I fertilize vegetables?","19246","","<p>I only ever add fertilizer after I remove a previous crop and break up the soil a bit, but should I be adding fertilizer to vegetables that take 10 or so weeks to grow, such as zucchini?</p>

<ul>
<li>How frequently should I add fertilizer?</li>
<li>Are there particular types of fertilizer that are good to add while a vegetable plant is growing?</li>
<li>How can I add fertilizer if I am using mulch such as hay, should I just sprinkle it on top and water it in?</li>
</ul>
","<p>The short answer is ""fertilize when the plants need it"".</p>

<p>For a longer answer, here are some guidelines that I follow:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(I know I sound like a broken record) Get a soil test done. This will tell you what your soil does and does not have. A good test lab will give you advice on what amounts of fertilizer to add. If you use organic growing practices, the lab should be able to provide advice on which fertilizers to use.</p></li>
<li><p>Consult a good gardening book for the requirements of particular vegetables. (I like Ed Smith's ""The Vegetable Gardener's Bible"" because it provides low/medium/high for N/P/K for each vegetable in an info box on each vegetable's reference page.)</p></li>
<li><p>Know your pH, and adjust pH so that the soil is the proper acidity for vegetables. (Generally around 6-7; some like it higher or lower -- consult Smith's book or others to see specific recommendations.) Plants can't take up nutrients as effectively when the pH is too far out of the optimal range.</p></li>
<li><p>I add copious amounts of composted horse manure (since it is ""free""). I haven't had the compost tested, but based on the soil tests that come back after a few years of adding manure, it seems to be high in potassium and phosphorus. Because of this, I don't really fertilize for P/K, just for N. If you have amendments available locally that you can add, till these in either in the fall, or a couple of weeks prior to planting.</p></li>
<li><p>Build up your soil organic matter content. This helps to build healthy soil that holds nutrients and water better, and helps to convert nutrients to a form that plants can take up more readily.</p></li>
<li><p>Regarding fertilizing mulched plants, you have three options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Apply fertilizer on top of the mulch and water it in. Some (especially nitrogen) will be lost to the mulch.</li>
<li>Pull back the mulch and apply fertilizer on top of the soil.</li>
<li>Use a foliar feed (liquid fertilizer sprayed on the leaves).</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>In my experience, if you feed the <em>soil</em> appropriately before planting then you won't need any fertilizer while the plants are growing. You mention zucchini -- I've had incredible growth for an entire season when the plants were put into beds with very rich soil (or when they volunteer out of the compost pile). And on the other hand I've had zucchini which I could barely keep alive even with regular top dressing with dried blood and foliar fish fertilizer because the soil was so poor. It's really important to build great soil; if you do this, then you won't have to fertilize the plants at all during the growing season.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally (and the main part of my answer): <strong>observe the plants</strong>. In my experience, if you have a generally healthy soil and you've been adding compost, the primary nutrient you may be lacking is nitrogen. If the leaves are pale / yellow, it may need supplemental nitrogen. When I see this, I use a couple of different tactics: foliar feeding with fish emulsion (I think it is 1-2-0 analysis, don't have the jug handy now), or side dressing with dried blood (something like 12-0-0). For ""hungry"" plants (e.g. squash, celery, etc), I typically add a scoop of horse manure to the planting holes before transplanting. This summer that was all the celery needed; I didn't need to do any supplemental feeding. But the squash was in a newly built bed which hasn't had the soil built up over several years, and it needed a couple top dressings of compost as well as a couple rounds of foliar feeding -- the leaves would getting pale and the plants weren't thriving like they normally do.</p></li>

"What is this plant that resembles tomato and has small dark fruit?","18885","","<p>I got lazy and let weeds takeover a bed near the porch that has some azaleas and perennials. When I went to pull some of the weeds, I noticed this ~3ft high plant that looks like a tomato plant. It is starting to fruit and has very small dark, almost black, fruits.</p>

<p>Is this some kind of tomato?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SERm3.jpg"" alt=""Leaves, flowers and stalk resemble tomato plants.""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NXzAH.jpg"" alt=""small dark fruits""></p>
","<p>That looks a lot to me like one of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanum_nigrum""><em>Solanum nigrum</em></a> (""black nightshade"") varieties -- see the ""Solanum nigrum complex"" paragraph under ""Taxonomy"" in the Wikipedia article.</p>

<p>I'm not sure where you're from, but they grow as weeds all over North America, as well as -- as far as I know -- most of the rest of the world. They are not tomatoes, and most of these varieties are very dangerous.*</p>

<p>The leaves are smooth and kite-shaped with wavy margins and prominent veins. The berries are clustered and spherical, 1/4"" diameter or a bit more at full growth, and turn from green to shiny black as they ripen. The flowers are white and five-petaled, with prominent yellow ""beaks"" in the center (technically, <em>anthers</em>) . (Personally, I think they're fairly handsome plants.)</p>

<p>It is <em>related</em> to the tomato, as well as several other food plants -- eggplants, capiscums, and potatoes. This accounts for the vague similarites one can see in the fruit and the leaf structures. They are all members of <em>Solanaceae</em>, the ""nightshade family"".</p>

<p>Some parts of different varieties of this genus and species <em>are reported</em> to have different degrees of edibility, depending on you, the plant, the ripeness of the berries, how you cook it, the day of the week, and whether your car is red.</p>

<p><em><strong>Please don't eat</em></strong> any part of this plant unless you get a <em>much better</em> identification from an actual botanist or someone who can see the plant first-hand and is verifiably an expert.**</p>

<hr>

<p>*Among non-mushrooms, poisonous nightshades are probably second only to the poisonous hemlocks (""poison hemlock"" and the ""water hemlock"" genus) in terms of deadliness.</p>

<p>**Actually, that goes for any wild plant. Most aren't poisonous, and most of the poisonous ones aren't automatically deadly, but why make yourself sick for curiousity when there's plenty of books you can check first? Many of the poisonous wild ones are closely related to our food plants -- like this one, and various members of the pea family.</p>

"Can my lawn be saved or is it time to dig it up and re-sod?","18805","","<p>The majority of the grass in my backyard has turned brown and/or died after what we believe was a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blissus_leucopterus"">chinch bug</a> onslaught that went untreated for way too long.  It is St. Augustine grass in South Florida.</p>

<p>I finally treated the whole backyard with Spectracide, so hopefully that takes care of the bugs.  Now the problem is repairing the damage.  If at all possible, I'd like to avoid re-sodding due to the labor and costs involved, but if there's no alternative, then I'd at least like to make sure I do things properly to ensure the newly planted lawn thrives.</p>

<p>I have maybe <strike>100-150</strike> 300-350 sq ft of surviving grass back there... is there any chance that the surviving grass will spread to fill the backyard (relatively quickly?) or that the brown/dead grass will regrow?  Is there anything I can do to accelerate the process?</p>

<p>If not, is it time to just dig everything up and lay down new sod?  What would be the proper way to do so in order to ensure I'll have a thriving, attractive looking lawn for my efforts?</p>

","<p>To keep things simple (mainly for my benefit), lets go with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Total lawn area, 1500ft<sup>2</sup></p></li>
<li><p>Healthy lawn area, 300ft<sup>2</sup></p></li>
<li><p>Dead lawn area, 1200ft<sup>2</sup></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore you have an area of 20% ""healthy"" lawn remaining.</p>

<p>Depending on what you read and from where it comes, it's ""generally"" said it is worth the time and effort to repair a lawn that has 50% to 66.6% healthy lawn area remaining, anything less than 50% is better served by removing everything and starting anew.</p>

<p>Personally I don't buy into that 100%, I think other factors come into the decision making process eg</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cost (your budget - how much money do you have to put in or are willing to put in to the project).</p></li>
<li><p>Time (labour - your time; do you want instant results or are willing to wait).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Below I'm going to offer you both options, <strong>starting anew</strong> or <strong>repair</strong>, you can then decide which way you want to go.</p>

<p><strong>Regardless which option you go with:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The vast majority of the work should be carried out mid Spring to <em>very</em> early Summer (the closer to mid Spring the better IMHO).</p></li>
<li><p>Get a <a href=""http://soilslab.ifas.ufl.edu/ESTL%20Home.asp"">""professional"" soil test</a> done, this will tell you if your soil requires any kind of amendment(s) for growing a healthy lawn.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Starting anew (via creating a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stale_seed_bed"">stale seedbed</a>):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>At the beginning of Spring use a cultivar/tiller to till the top 4 to 6 inches (100 to 150mm).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Then with a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rake_%28tool%29"">heavy-duty metal garden rake</a>, work the tilled area to remove any large stones, vegetation (including roots, wood, etc) and foreign objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Afterward, the worked area should be as close to final grade as you can get it, the flatter you can get it the better (try your best to avoid bumps and dips).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spread an inch (25mm) or two (50mm) thick layer of high quality compost over the complete area.</p></li>
<li><p>With the cultivar/tiller, till the complete area again to work the compost layer into the top 4 to 6 inches (100 to 150mm).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Then again with a heavy-duty metal garden rake, work the tilled area to remove any large stones, vegetation (including roots, wood, etc) and foreign objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Afterward, the worked area should be as close to final grade as you can get it, the flatter you can get it the better (try your best to avoid bumps and dips).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If there is no rain forecast, lightly wet down the surface.</p></li>
<li><p>A week later go out there with a (sharp) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoe_%28tool%29"">hoe</a> and remove any weeds (vegetation) you see.</p>

<ul>
<li>Repeat this weekly hoeing for the following 3 to 4 weeks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You now have a stale seedbed, and are ready for your new lawn.</p></li>
<li><p>Lay down a 1inch (25mm) thick layer of high quality compost over the complete area.</p>

<ul>
<li>With a heavy-duty metal garden rake level this compost layer to your final grade.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Lay your St Augustine sod (instant lawn), when doing so, stagger the joints as if you were building a brick wall, also take the time to ensure you get nice tight joints.</p></li>
<li><p>Lay a scaffold-board over the top of the sod. Shuffle along the board a few times, this will ensure you get good contact between the sod and the soil underneath. Move the board over the width of the board, repeat ""shuffle"" process. Repeat, repeat... until you've tamped down the complete area.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lightly water your newly laid lawn, you will want to do this daily for the first couple of weeks (assuming you have no rain). After that, water lightly every 2 to 3 days. Basically you don't want the sod drying out (contracting and gaps appearing along the sod joint lines).</p></li>
<li><p>A month after installing your sod, you can revert to you ""normal"" watering schedule (or follow the recommended watering requirements for St Augustine).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If you wish to save some money and can wait some time before having a fully established lawn you can install plugs (normally about 2inch/50mm diameter) of St Augustine at 12inch (300mm) centres. Plugs should be planted in a staggered pattern.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you go the ""plug"" route, I recommend also getting enough <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryegrass"">Annual Ryegrass</a> seed to seed the complete area. Doing so will fill in the bare areas between the plugs, give you a green looking lawn while the plugs establish themselves (begin to spread and fill in), and help prevent weeds growing in those bare areas...</p></li>
<li><p>Lightly water your newly laid lawn (plugs &amp; seed), you will want to do this daily for the first couple of weeks (assuming you have no rain). After that, water lightly every 2 to 3 days. Basically you don't want the ground drying out.</p></li>
<li><p>A month after installing your newly laid lawn, you can revert to you ""normal"" watering schedule (or follow the recommended watering requirements for St Augustine).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Repair (or starting anew without tilling)</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mid Spring, with a light-duty metal rake, rake the complete area to gather up <strong>all</strong> the ""dead"" material.</p></li>
<li><p>With a (sharp) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spade"">spade</a> or an edging tool, give the healthy grass areas nice clean straight edges (especially important if you are going to lay sod).</p></li>
<li><p>If going the sod laying route, do the extra step below:</p>

<ul>
<li>With a (sharp) spade, ""feather"" a 3 to 4ft (900 to 1200mm) wide strip around the the perimeter of the healthy grass areas to remove a ""thin"" wedge shape. This will allow the new installed sod to gently grade into the existing grass area (thus ensuring you don't end up with a small ""step"" where new meets existing).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>With a core aerator (preferably one that pulls plugs out of the ground), aerate the complete area. When aerating it's best to work in one direction (up and down your garden), then cover the area again, but the second time working perpendicular (left to right across your garden) to the first. </p></li>
<li><p>Lay down a 1inch (25mm) thick layer of high quality compost over the complete area.</p>

<ul>
<li>With a heavy-duty metal garden rake level this compost layer to your final grade.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Lay your St Augustine sod (instant lawn), when doing so, stagger the joints as if you were building a brick wall, also take the time to ensure you get nice tight joints.</p></li>

<p><strong>If you wish to have a green looking lawn now and through the Winter, I recommend throwing down some Annual Ryegrass just to give you the look:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>When daytime temperatures have dropped into the low 70&#176;F (20&#176;C) or into the 60&#176;F (high teens &#176;C) go out into the area with a light-duty metal rake and rake the complete area. Gather up as much ""dead"" material as possible, but keep in mind it doesn't have to be perfect (save perfection until you do the real work in Springtime).</p></li>
<li><p>Afterward, with a heavy-duty metal rake, scratch-up the surface of soil ie Break up the surface of the soil a little.</p></li>
<li><p>Spread (broadcast, sow) enough Annual Ryegrass seed to seed the complete area.</p></li>
<li><p>Spread &#189;inch (12.5mm) thick layer of high quality compost over the complete area ie Bury the seed under this thin layer of organic material. Doing so will help:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Germination greatly.</p></li>
<li><p>Prevent the seeds from drying out.</p></li>
<li><p>Prevent the seeds from being eaten by birds.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Lightly water the complete area, you will want to do this daily for the first couple of weeks (assuming you have no rain). After that, water lightly every 2 to 3 days. Basically you don't want the ground drying out.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the grass is 4inches (100mm) high or higher, it is ready for its first mowing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Personally, I would mow to a final cut height of 3inches (75mm) or higher. The higher the better IMHO. You don't want to mow Annual Ryegrass too short, especially in your part of the country (warm and humid)...</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>I wouldn't do any major lawn care work at this time of year (late Summer, early Autumn/Fall) on a warm-season lawn.</p>

<p>Watering shouldn't be necessary, but they require high humidity at all times, and a daily/twice daily misting of the stems, root area, and leaves is beneficial. The temperature should stay over 65 degrees F. at all times, but if it goes over 80, the high humidity is even more important. </p>

<p>About pothos. It is a very resilient plant, and can take a lot, but it needs to be watered regularly, as it grows in soil as other plants do. Unfortunately, there is no plant that will be entirely independent with watering, so if you really can't pay attention to your plant, then do as Bamboo suggests, and get a fake plant.</p>

"What's the difference between annual, biennial, and perennial plants?","18442","","<p>Before deciding whether to purchase a plant, and how best to plan where to place it, the basic knowledge of how long it lives and how often it blooms is a necessity. What's the difference between annuals, biennials and perennials?</p>
","<h3>Annual means that the plant has a full life cycle (seed-to-seed cycle) in at most one year.</h3>

<p>It will germinate, bloom and die that year. This is not a calendar year per se. Some species germinate in autumn, survive through the winter and bloom next spring. </p>

<p>A good example is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagetes_patula"" rel=""nofollow"">French Marigold</a>.</p>

<h3>A biennial plant takes two years to complete it's life cycle.</h3>

<p>It will germinate and grow, survive through one winter, and in the second year it will grow more, bloom, and die. Biennials are less common than both annuals and perennials.</p>

<p>A well-known example is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsley"" rel=""nofollow"">parsley</a>. </p>

<h3>Perennials are plants that live more than two years.</h3>

<p>By this definition, many plants including trees are perennial, although the term is more commonly used for herbaceous plants.</p>

<p>A good example is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucanthemum_%C3%97_superbum"" rel=""nofollow"">shasta daisy</a>. </p>

<p>Lots of vegetables are grown as annuals, while they are actually biennials or perennials. For example parsley will be harvested in its first year, as are carrots. Onions are biennials that can be grown from seed in the first year. The resulting small onions can be planted again (you can buy these as well), to be grown to a full size onion. Peppers, tomatoes, etc, are tender perennials that are usually treated as annuals in the vegetable garden. </p>

I don't particularly want to collect seed from the plants, but what should I do with the remaining flower spikes / plants?</p>

<p>Should I cut the spike off the plant near its base? And if I do, will the plant recover to produce another spike next year?</p>

<p>Or should I just get rid of the plant entirely and sow seeds now for next year's display?</p>
","<p>Foxgloves are (in Seattle and England) very hardy perennials.  You can easily trim the stalk back to the base and the plant will come back fine next year.  The only thing I've ever had to be cautious about is the fact that foxgloves produce a large quantity of seed, and they have been pretty good about sowing themselves around my garden.  There are times when I've simply pulled up the whole plant when it starts to look a bit ratty, because I know that there is going to be a new crop of foxgloves popping up around the garden next year.  And that means that it's also easy to save up the seeds if you want more for next year or have found a particular variety or color that you'd like to propagate further.</p>

","<p>Pollination is essential. Check to see what the area has pollinating insects like bees, butterflies or flies. The insects may not be out in full force considering that it is winter, but you would know better than I. If you are fairly certain that you have active pollinators, water may be an issue.
If the plant does not have weekly deep watering, the flowers will drop. Make sure that the soil is wet at least 6 inches deep. Mulch to preserve moisture. Water deeply on a weekly basis, more if the climate is dry.</p>

<p>If you have both pollinators and adequate moisture,  you could always try pollinating by hand using a fine paintbrush or some cotton swabs. Just lightly transfer pollen from the flower of one plant to the flower of another. Let us know what happens. Often wnd can be a good enough pollinator for these plants.

","<p>The pictures help a lot. These trees were eaten back, but not too far for a good recovery. The fastest way to get them looking normal will be shearing. Shear back the areas the deer didn't hit, and while you're at it, you can do the others, to match. Do not cut past the growth line, where there are plenty of green stems to regrow from. Also, don't cut the terminal growth. </p>

<p>This will put the plant into 'grow-back' mode, and it will grow from the newly sheared parts as well as the deer-sheared parts. Shearing will also make the hedge denser and stronger.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Most coniferous evergreens have a growth line. It is characterized, by a noticeable drop in green vegetation, and a thicker stem diameter.  This is the point on the branches where the viable growth buds are. Inside that line, the branches will not regrow well, if at all, when cut. It is safe to shear from the growth line out.</p>

"How much should I water my cherry tree sapling?","17806","","<p>My good friend's dad helped me plant a cherry tree sapling (about a handspan high) the other day (I don't know what kind). He brought over the rooted pot, dug the requisite 18-24cm depth, and transferred it (soil and all) into the hole. We then made a torus/donut barrier with topsoil, and mulched it lightly. (If I missed anything important that I should have done, let me know.)</p>

<p>My question now is <strong>how much do I water this thing?</strong> Initially, we flooded it (literally, caused a pool of water in the barrier) as per instructions. I know that cherry trees don't like ""wet feet"" (or too much water, hence the topsoil barricade), but how much do I need to water it?</p>

<p>I generally spray it with the hose (non-hard setting) for about a minute per day before the sun comes up. Sometimes I spray the topsoil/mulch barrier too.</p>
","<p>The standard advice for newly planted nursery stock, <em>water deeply once a week or, if it is hot, twice a week</em>, is good for large ball and burlap trees, bare-root stock planted in the spring, and partially established plants (second year after planting). Container-grown trees and shrubs, which constitute an overwhelming majority of nursery stock sold, need to be treated a bit differently.</p>

<p>Contain-grown plants can be easily identified when you remove them from their pots:</p>

<p>The growing medium will be coarse textured, either a mixture of perlite or pumice and peat or a mix of bark mulch and coarse sand.</p>

<p>There will be plenty of happy white roots to hold the root ball together.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the growing medium looks like ordinary garden soil or there are relatively few roots holding the root ball together, the plant is probably <em>containerized</em>, that is, bare-root stock potted up early in the spring. Newly planted <em>containerized</em> stock can be watered the standard way, deeply once a week.</p>

<p>In the retail garden center and at the grower before that, container-grown nursery stock is watered thoroughly every day during sunny, warm periods, twice a day when it is hot. A gardener's job is to transition the plant from container-grown to ground-grown. This usually translates into a thorough watering every other day for the first week or two, half as often in cloudy weather. After the first couple weeks, look to make the waterings less frequent paying attention to the plant for clues to how happy it is. Check to see if it is drooping in the afternoons. Yellowing or purpling leaves are also a common sign of stress. By the end of the first month, you should have transitioned the plant to once a week waterings. Still, check it regularly to make sure it is happy.</p>

<p>Now, lets talk about these vague adjectives, <em>deeply</em> and <em>thoroughly</em>. You want to wet the soil to the full depth of the root ball. As a rule of thumb, one inch of water, a volume of water inch deep over a given area, will typically penetrate to a depth of 4 to 6 inches, two inches will penetrate 6 to 10 inches, etc. Judge accordingly. Usually, this means filling your watering basin two to three times, or letting the hose trickle for at least five minutes.</p>

","<p>This is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spathiphyllum"">spathiphyllum</a>, a close relative of the anthurium.  The identification key is the white flower with the spadix that drops pollen when mature.</p>

<p>These plants do well in a moist soil and a range of light conditions from medium to bright indirect light.  I have seen them very happy sitting in an inch or two of water.  When they get too dry they collapse as seen in the picture.  To make it confusing they will also collapse if they have root rot but seeing as the leaves still have some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turgor"">turgor</a> I don't think this is the case here.</p>

<p>For this plant, if the soil is not wet, water it.  If the soil is already wet let 24 hours pass. If it's still passed out then take it out of the pot and look at the roots.  Healthy roots are firm and white or brown. Roots that have rotted are soft and black.</p>

<p>If the plant has root rot throw it out. They are difficult to save at this stage. If it's just dry it will recover quickly.</p>

<p>An aid for these plants is to add a <a href=""http://www.hydroponicvegetablegardening.com/HVGBasics.htm"">wick and reservoir</a>.  It can be as simple as taking a knitting needle to push a wick up into the root ball from the bottom of the pot and sitting the pot on top of some small stones inside another pot. Keep the water level at a few inches so the plant is above water but the wick brings water to the roots and the plant will never collapse again.</p>

<p>Edit: the other ways to tell an anthurium from a spathiphyllum or Peace Lily are that the spath has larger leaves.  In some varieties they are six inches long. Anthurium leaves tend to be thicker and a darker green.  The anthurium spadix sticks out from the bract known as a spathe whereas in Spathipyllum's the spadix starts enclosed by the spathe and and in many cultivars remains cupped by it.</p>

I thought it would be good for the garden but then some people made me doubt.</p>

<p>Was that a good move or not? And why?</p>
","<p>What's done is done, but in future years, as others suggest, collect up the leaves and compost them separately, either in a contained heap or in binliner bags with holes in the bottom. Leaves should be wet, crammed in a binliner, the tops tied shut, holes poked in the bottom, then left in a corner somewhere to rot down over a year or so, by which time they will have shrunken right down to something commonly known as 'black gold'. This can then be added to your soil with, if applied in spring, a handful or two of nitrogen in some form or other. In the UK, that would be Growmore or other granular nitrogenous, but balanced, feed.</p>

<p>The reason you wouldn't normally allow leaves to degrade slowly on the ground in your garden, or dig in shredded or whole leaves, is because the fungi and bacteria which break down the leaves require nitrogen to function. Therefore, if you add chopped leaves directly to your soil, the activity of those organisms will increase, and remove more nitrogen from the soil in which your plants are growing, leaving less available nitrogen for plants to take up.</p>

"Are there benefits to changing the direction you mow a lawn?","17074","","<p>This is one of those ancient bits of ""wisdom"" I vaguely recall from my childhood; and now that I have a lawn which seems quite happily established, I'm looking into keeping it that way.  So, I want to know if there's any truth to it.</p>

<p>Supposedly, each time you mow your lawn, you should change the direction you mow.  For example, travel north/south one mowing, then east/west the next mowing.</p>

<p>It's obvious if you look at a freshly mown lawn which direction the mower traveled, which I think lends this idea its believability.  But I can't honestly think of any benefit to the plants.  After a day or two they're all still happily growing ""up"" after all.  And with a motorized spinning blade, I don't see how you could say that a blade of grass was cut ""this way,"" anyway.</p>

<p>So, is there something I'm missing?  Is there some benefit to the plants?  Or is there some quirk of reel mowers which made it true in the past; and if so, is it still true?</p>
","<p>I suspect the guidance came from a time of reel mowers, which do actually push the blades of grass over in the same direction. (I use a reel mower to maintain our acre and a half.) As you've pointed out, with a rotary mower there is a lot more randomness involved.</p>

<p>That said, if you mowed your lawn with the exact same path every time, you would probably always miss the same little triangle ""downstream"" of a particular tree. If there's a bump, the grass ""before"" the bump would always be a little too short and the grass ""after"" it always a little too long. If you always mowed parallel to a path the grass next to the path might not get cut, but if you went back and forth across the path it would.</p>

<p>Probably you can solve most of that with a trimmer. The advice is certainly about the last little bit of perfection rather than overall lawn health. But it doesn't take any longer for you to mix it up once in a while, or to follow a pattern where you go east-west one time, north-south the next, west-east the next and so on. It probably does reduce the amount of trimmer work you need to do and give you a little more uniformity.</p>

Watermelon vines are thinner and longer than squash vines, and the leaves are deeply lobed, compared with the squashes wide, flat leaves. </p>

<p>The fruit looks very similar when young, but when they are matured the watermelons have a dramatic decrease in starch content, and have low density flesh with extremely high moisture content, and a high level of fructose. The cucumber genus is lower in water content, but also store the energy supply as fructose rather than starch. The melons have more sugar than the cucumbers. </p>

<p>Notice that the ones with the higher starch ripen latest in the season, when animals need starch to build up fat for winter. The more sugary juicier fruits are ripened a little earlier, when the animals need quick energy. </p>

"Which way to put lawnmower on side?","16735","","<p>When cleaning my lawnmower I have to put it on its side so that I can clean its underside.  However, I keep on reading that you can only put it on one side, not the other, otherwise oil and/or gasoline leaks into other components.</p>

<p>I have a PowerPlus POW63771, which has a 4-stroke engine. There is no information in the manual saying on which side to put it.</p>

<p>Below is how it looks:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/w3mGW.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/w3mGW.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.marionmowers.com.au/service_tips/21597.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">MarionMowers</a>, It says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If your lawnmower is four stroke (which it is), tip the mower so that the spark plug is pointing skyward, never tip it on its side with the spark plug to the ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cannot work out on which side to tip my lawnmower. Given my picture where the spark plug is almost in the middle of the mower, should the oil cap (which is truly on one side) be pointing to the ground or to the sky?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>Before you start doing anything on your mower disconnect the spark plug wire and make sure it's away from the spark plug so the engine doesn't accidentally start if you turn the blades. Think of how old prop planes were started by turning the prop.</p>

<p>On lawnmowers I've used and seen there spark plug has always been either on the front or back but tipping it forward or backward doesn't leave it in the most stable position to clean it. Your manual states ""Hose under deck by tilting the mower so that the spark plug is up"". That would indicate you remove the bag and tip it backwards so the handle is touching the ground.</p>

<p>If you tip it so the spark plug is down oil can get to the spark plug and foul it.</p>

<p>Many times I tip it to the side, I used to have a mower with the spark plug in the back, because it's more stable that way in some cases and if the spark plug is pretty much center front or back the spark plug doesn't get oil on it. I make sure the air filter and muffler (usually on same side for mowers I've used) are pointing up. Don't want oil flowing into the carburetor or air box. One old mower I had years ago would leak oil out of the muffler if tipped on that side and then smoke up the next time it was used.</p>

<p>And before you start cleaning double check to make sure the spark plug wire is disconnected. Yes I know I said it twice. :)</p>

"How do I plant potatoes that sprouted in my pantry?","16668","","<p>I'm gearing up to plant some red potatoes from the grocery store that sprouted in the pantry. When I plant them do I plant them stem-side-up? And, should I plant them shallow so the stems poke out of the soil?</p>

<p>And last, would this be considered planting or transplanting?</p>
","<p>First, if the potatoes are big, you should cut them into smaller pieces so that you have one or two eyes (the bit that's sprouting) on each piece. Leave the cut pieces out for a day or so to allow the cut surface to dry out a little. This will help to prevent the potatoes from rotting in the ground.</p>

<p>While you're waiting, dig a trench about 12"" (30cm) deep to plant the potatoes in. Potatoes like a light, well-drained soil, so if yours is heavy, consider mixing the diggings with some compost to help lighten it. Backfill the trench with about 4"" (10cm) of the dug soil.</p>

<p>Place the potatoes with the growing stems pointed up, about 16"" (40cm) apart, and cover them with 4"" (10cm) more inches of the dug soil. Be careful not to damage the shoots, but it's OK to cover them a little: potatoes contain a lot of energy so they'll have enough to grow and emerge from the ground when they can start making energy themselves.</p>

<p>As the plants grow, you continue to fill in the trench; don't cover them completely after that first time. Eventually you will want to mound more soil around the stems, up to around 12"" (30cm) high by the time the flowers die back, which is when they start putting energy into making tubers. Potatoes grow on the covered stems, so you want a good amount of the stems covered by that point.</p>

<p>I also have a half-barrel with a Valencia orange tree in it. The soil seems to be full of grubs. If I turn over a handful with a small trowel I find a grub about 1 in 3 tries. I don't want to dig down and risk harming the roots, so I can only see the grubs near the top. They never come above the soil, and I haven't seen any beetles on or near the tree. The tree seems to be doing fine, but I'm concerned. Will the grubs be a problem? What can I do about them without harming the tree?</p>
","<p>Grubs like the one you've pictured feed on plant roots.  If there are a lot of them, then yes, they are doing damage. You may just not be noticing it yet. The worst part is they will eventually pupate into adult beetles, and those will work on damaging the above-ground parts of your plants.  If they are Japanese Beetles (hard to say without more info but the grub you pictured looks like one) then they can really devastate certain plants.  </p>

<p>Here is <a href=""http://www.organicgardening.com/learn-and-grow/japanese-beetles"">an article on Japanese Beetle control from Organic Gardening</a>.  Basically, control of Japanese and similar beetles is a three-fold fight - you need to try to reduce the numbers of grubs in your soil by using some sort of grub killing control measure (some organic options are listed in the linked article) eliminating as many adult beetles as you can during the year and then blocking them from your plants so they do not lay more eggs into the soil to bother your garden next year.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/j3vYW.jpg"" alt=""Weigela in bloom closeup""></p>

<p>The bush is quite old and I've never really done anything with it so I'd appreciate any advice you can offer!</p>
","<p>I would be very happy to have a weigela that looks that good!  They bloom on wood that is one year old. Here are some general guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>prune after flowering is finished</li>
<li>new stems are more vigorous than older growth so they should be encouraged by removing up to one third of the old growth once a year.  For this plant that would mean cutting one of the thick woody stems this year at the base.  Use a saw or a pair of loppers to get a clean cut.</li>
<li>if you wish to reduce the size of the plant overall you can prune branches back by one third. Prune by hand, do not use a hedge trimmer.  Do not cut a branch to leave a stub, cut back to where it divides.</li>
<li>the usual shrub maintenance of top dressing with compost, removing competing weeds and pruning other shrubs and trees to maintain the amount of light it gets are also good practices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Edit: yes, where you prune an existing branch back to reduce the size of the plant you will reduce the amount of flower.  It looks like you have enough room for a full size plant so I would just practice removing up to one third of the old growth each year.  If you do this every year you will end up with more flowers in a few years as the new growth comes in.</p>

<p>It really only eats the undecomposed material, rendering it into something the plant can access. If the look bothers you, it would be fine to remove the patch, but it won't harm the plant. As stormy notes, this type of fungus usually only appears when the soil surface doesn't get much time to dry out. This constant damp is hard on a potted plant. Make sure the top 1-2"" of soil dry out in between waterings. </p>

<p>What causes this, and what can I do to prevent it?</p>
","<p>If the blossom end turns black, that's blossom end rot, due to irregular water supply disabling calcium uptake, but the other cause of this problem is the female flower, particularly when the weather is wet. The flower traps water and causes the end of the burgeoning zucchini to start rotting. It usually only affects some of the fruits, and a way round it is to carefully remove the flower once you can see the zucchini is starting to grow away nicely, but when it's still small.</p>

"Can I move a self-seeded oak tree into a pot to keep it small?","16183","","<p>An oak has self seeded in our garden. Has got to about a metre tall and seems happy. We don't have anywhere near enough space for an oak but seems a shame to kill it. Can we move it to a pot to keep it dwarf?</p>
","<p>Oak trees are well suited to bonsai, but that is not your biggest problem here.</p>

<p>You have two main problems: getting that thing out of the ground with its root system in tact and secondly getting it to survive once it comes out of the ground.</p>

<p>Getting the tree out of the ground, even though it appears small isn't an easy task. I can't find a reliable source right now, but you will need to dig a circle with a diameter the same size as the height of the tree and you will likely need to dig at least the same length deep. Young trees usually have one long main root and if you damage that your chances of the tree surviving are slim.</p>

<p>Professional bonsai growers who grow their own trees in the ground usually wait for a rainy day to dig out the plant so the ground is soft and the clinging soil doesn't pull so hard at the roots. </p>

<p>If you are not purchasing nursery stock to ""bonsai"" then you need to acclimatize the plant to living outside of the ground for 1 - 2 years before putting it in a small pot where it will be restricted in terms of moisture and the size of its root system. So initially you will need to put it in quite a large pot with plenty of soil.</p>

<p>Make sure you keep the soil well watered at least for the first 3 - 6 months. As the soil in the ground is kept moist and protected from the sun, but inside your pot it can dry out easily and the plant doesn't have the breadth and depth of a root system of trees in the ground.</p>

<p>Lastly I'd like to say that this is not an easy task, it actually requires practice and has a low success rate as small trees are not hardy. Our neighbours have a sweetgum (<em>Liquidambar styraciflua</em>) that provides us with around 30 small trees a year, but only about one a year ever survives past 6 months and that's keeping it in the ground.</p>

<p>I've tried this several times myself, but in the end, I can with much less effort buy a year old, acclimatized bonsai starter for $3 from my local bonsai nursery. It's not worth the sweat and strain just to see your treasure drop its leaves after 2 weeks and die. The same thing is likely to happen in the ground anyway.</p>

"Ant colony in my compost bin: are they beneficial?","16129","","<p>I've got a smallish black plastic compost bin in my garden and I recently noticed that an ant colony has taken up residence. This has happened a couple of times in the past, but they tend to move on when I turn the compost (not surprising, given I'm ruining their home).</p>

<p>However, is their presence actually good for the compost? Do they speed up the composting process by aerating it and dining on the 'food' therein? And if so, should I leave them be for a while?</p>

<p>The ants themselves don't bother me.</p>
","<p>The composting process depends on a complex chain of organisms -- which can include ants -- to consume and thus break down the food in your compost pile. See <a href=""http://web.extension.illinois.edu/homecompost/science.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this page</a> from the University of Illinois extension service, which comments on ants in compost:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ants - Ants feed on a variety of materials including fungi, seeds, sweets and other insects. They help the composting process by bringing fungi and other organisms into their nests. Ants can make compost richer in phosphorus and potassium by moving minerals around as they work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the ants don't bother you, letting them work on your compost a bit would have some benefit -- you're enhancing the food web by allowing them to stay. The downside is that, by not turning the bin when the internal temperature drops, you may not achieve high enough temps for long enough to kill off weeds and harmful bacteria. But if your mix wasn't going to achieve this anyway, then it's not an issue.</p>

"Is it really important to give blueberry plants acidic soil?","15975","","<p>I have two blueberry bushes which I planted at the end of the summer. Although I had read online that they prefer acidic soil, I didn't have the time to check the pH of our soil, and go out to buy something to make it more acidic. My bushes seem reasonably healthy (although perhaps suffering from a lack of water), but I wanted to know how important it is to give them acidic soil?</p>

<p>There are a few parts to my question:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this something to bother with, or just something to do if you are a really serious gardener?</li>
<li>Does the soil acidity affect the growth and health of the plant, the fruiting (quantity and quality), both, or neither?</li>
<li>If you would recommend adding something to the soil to lower the pH, what?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
","<p>Blueberries certainly like acidic soil (about 4-5 pH) and is quite necessary for a healthy plant with good fruit production. This is not just for ""serious gardeners"", but is something that blueberries need. While the plant might grow in neutral soils, the fruit production might be low and the leaves generally sparse. I can tell you from experience that my blueberry bush did not do well before I  decreased the pH of the soil. </p>

<p>You can increase the soil acidity in a few ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>mulch the plants with pine needles, if that's easy to acquire in your area.</li>
<li>work peat into the soil around your plant and in the top couple of inches (take care not to damage the roots, they're shallow) and then cover with mulch.</li>
<li>use a soil amendment mix that's commonly sold for Azalea/Gardenia. These are two other plants that require acidic soil and it's common to find mixes for these. These work very well for blueberries too and is in fact, what I use since I can't find either of the two above all that easily.</li>
<li>If your soil is already moderately acidic, you needn't do any of the above, but <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/801/how-do-i-apply-spent-coffee-grounds-as-a-fertilizer"">use composted coffee grounds</a> every few months to maintain the acidity.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, blueberries also need well drained soils. As I've mentioned above, they have very shallow fibrous roots and if your water doesn't drain away, it will cause root rots. So never plant blueberries in the low points of your garden, where water is more likely to collect.</p>

<p>Also, you'll need to water regularly too, because shallow roots can't reach deep down for water. Use a thick layer of mulch to conserve moisture and water it often enough such that the soil is always moist and never let it dry out for too long.</p>

  <p>When about 1/2 inch of thatch develops in bluegrass, remove it before the grass is damaged. Thatch is best removed by power raking, verticutting or coring with a machine that may be hired or rented.

","<p>Hmm, well Phil Hawthorn, Greenthumb are really being pathetic! Couch grass in lawns is not a problem - stolons within lawn grass will die out within a year with regular lawn maintenance and cutting, so if yours is being cut frequently, and you've not had couch grass before, it won't be that. It's more likely something like Yorkshire Fog - it doesn't look like annual meadow grass, but there are other coarse leaved weed grasses that might have invaded. </p>

<p>Greenthumb should know how to treat these - you either dig out the clumps and reseed the patches, particularly if they are isolated, or slash into the stolons with a sharp knife before cutting. The other advice is to rake up the grass foliage, so it's standing up properly before mowing, and change the direction of the cut at each mowing. If Greenthumb suggests this is some kind of annual grass, then a grass box should be used, or all clippings collected.</p>

  The area with rocky dirt and moss needs new grass. I don't know the procedure for prepping the lawn for seeding/sodding, or under what circumstances I should seed vs. sod. I have a feeling I'll need to till those rough areas, but I don't know if I should just dig out that rough dirt and replace it with (top?)soil. Also, I'm not sure how to level off the trough in the front yard.</p>

<h2>Update 1</h2>

<p>Can't believe it's been almost a year since I started this project! A second kid, additional year of marriage, and 5 more college courses under my belt later, progress has been made.</p>

<p>First off, <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/3010/what-is-the-best-tool-method-for-vine-removal/30674#30674"">the Ivy's been removed</a>, the ditch from picture 1 has been filled in, the trees in pic 1 have been cut down. There was a monster holley tree I didn't show in my original post with some ornamental decorations, so for reference</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/v08He.jpg"" alt=""Holley Tree and Co""></p>

<p>And that's all been removed. Toward the end of last August, it looked a little something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sxxR7.jpg"" alt=""Progress made.""></p>

<p>I had an insanely busy schedule during this time, so my wife 'forced' me to pay someone to lay sod down for a function that was coming up, instead of my original (<strong><em>much</em></strong> cheaper) plan of planting grass seed. <s>I'll post a picture later,</s></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/G9yfm.jpg"" alt=""odd sod job 1"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QYKcE.jpg"" alt=""odd sod job 2"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/M3nOY.jpg"" alt=""odd sod job 3""></p>

<p>I didn't take one back when they laid it but I don't like it one bit. Everywhere in the above picture where there's dirt they laid sod, and took no care to make it even with the existing lawn, and there's a giant seam everywhere the sod meets the existing lawn. The sod guy said it'll settle eventually, but personally I think they did a crappy job. I came across an article (<a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/9517/is-laying-sod-higher-than-existing-lawn-best-practice"">maybe a question on here</a>) that I can't seem to find now that mentioned different heights people lay sod, some under existing lawn height, some at, some above (for settling reasons). I'm still not completely convinced.</p>

<p>What's immediately next is planting some small shurbs alongside the Japanese Dwarf Maple, and lay mulch down around that area. This is also the time for overseeding, so there's that. Weeds have been cropping back up, those dirt areas up toward the house were wretched with weeds last year, partly because it was bare dirt for a while before the sod came (end of August until late October), now they're creeping their way back in. Time to <a href=""http://4.static.newspaper.guestlistmedia.net/uploads/articles/10/679_xl.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lock and load</a>.</p>

<p>The next step as far as that sod situation goes is probably damage control and replace the rest of the lawn with sod <em>myself</em>, to get a nice <em>even</em> setup. Maybe I'll try wetting the edges and tamping it down somewhat first and see what happens. My wife suggests I should cut it, and it'll look better once I do, we'll see. It may wind up a question on gardening.SE</p>

<p>After <em>that</em>, it's off to the sides and back.</p>
","<p>MDMoore,</p>

<p>There's too much info I want to share to post as a comment so I'm starting another answer. I'm also going to link to some sections of my blog for further reading when you have some time. I've been in your shoes before. There's no easy fix. Some of the things you're saying, questions you're asking remind me of me when I first got started. People told me you can't just do a little something and expect great results. They were right. </p>

<p>Most of my advice is going to be with organic products because that's what I have the most experience with.</p>

<p>I split my lawn up into public/private. Public being the front/side lawn that is most visible and the private is the not so visible mainly consisting of the backyard. I renovated the entire public section last fall. I broke it up into sections because each section had different characteristics that I wanted to monitor but I did all the sections at the same time. Each section is it's own little island of grass surrounded by concrete paths, driveway or garden beds. </p>

<p>Just to clarify so we're on the same page. I would never sod or seed just a portion of a section as I had defined it. As I mentioned in the <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/8245/is-it-common-to-only-sod-a-portion-of-a-lawn"">other thread</a> there are so many different types of grass seed that if you don't know what you have chances are there will be a noticeable difference in the two. If you can't do the whole thing I would recommend splitting it up like I did, front and back.</p>

<p>If I were you, I wouldn't sod this year. As I stated in my previous answer, you need to figure out why you have problems in those areas where you have problems. Laying new sod without solving the problem is likely going to result in the sod just dying next year. Sod is more expensive than seed and it could just be a waste of time and money.</p>

<p>This is what I would do instead. If you plan on doing this you need to get started soon. Right now is the ideal time to plant new grass</p>

<p>I would spot spray some of the weeds to kill them. People commonly use RoundUp or some other glyphosate based herbicide. I used a couple of <a href=""http://www.organiclawndiy.com/2012/08/organic-lawn-renovation-burnout-ii-vs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">organic roundup alternatives</a> to kill my whole lawn but you can use them just to spot treat areas which I am doing this year in my backyard.</p>

<p>Give it a few days to kill the weeds then mow the lawn on the lowest setting you can on your mower. This is going to harm the grass and stunt it's growth. Normally a bad thing but this is what we want.</p>

<p>Next, dethatch the lawn to help get rid of built up thatch and expose the soil. You can rent a gas powered dethatcher at most tool rental places. I like to use a <a href=""http://www.organiclawndiy.com/2009/06/removing-ground-ivy-from-lawn.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">manual thatch rake</a>. I don't mind the work and its a different way to get some exercise outdoors on a nice day. Pile up all the thatch in a corner to start a compost pile if you don't have one. It also makes a good mulch for vegetable gardens.</p>

<p>Spread some fertilizer around using a spreader. I like organics because you don't have to be too precise. They won't burn your lawn and they're good for the soil, not just for the plants. There's an <a href=""http://www.organiclawndiy.com/2009/10/organic-starter-fertilizer.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">organic starter fertilizer</a> available from Espoma that has some added microbes which help the soil. The first time I used it I had to mail order it but I've been seeing it more at local garden center. If you don't find the starter fertilizer go with any organic fertilizer as long as it does not contain Corn Gluten Meal. Corn Gluten Meal can prevent weed and grass seeds from germinating.</p>

<p>Spread some decent grass seed at 1/2 the recommended rates throughout the lawn following the instructions on the package.</p>

<p>It might be too late for a soil test but you can try one of those little DIY pH test kits to check yourself. If your soil needs lime add some to help correct it. I have some general information on liming your lawn as part of my review for <a href=""http://www.organiclawndiy.com/2009/05/encap-fast-acting-lime-review.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Encap Fast Acting Lime</a>.</p>

<p>Get some compost. A lot of it. You want around 1 cubic yard for every 1,000 sq ft of lawn. If you can get it delivered in bulk it's cheaper. Lay a tarp on your driveway and they'll dump it on there. Then use a wheelbarrow and stiff tine rake like a bowrake to help spread it around evenly throughout your lawn. Not cheap but improving the soil is going to be comparable to buying sod. It's going to be better for your lawn and easier to apply.</p>

<p>The compost step is the only big time and money expense. If you want to skip it this year if you're too busy or not ready to commit to that at least get a few bags to spread over the really bad areas. Getting a bulk deliver is usually much cheaper so it probably won't save much money but might save some labor.</p>

<p>Next spread the remaining grass seed at 1/2 the recommended rate over the compost. Go over it lightly with a rake and start watering as per instructions for your grass seed. Give it one good soak to settle everything then 3-4 times a day depending on your weather give it a light sprinkling so the seed and soil around it stay moist. </p>

<p>At the end of fall/beginning of winter give the lawn one more shot of fertilizer.</p>

<p>It may sound like a lot of work but this is actually easier and cheaper than doing sod the right way. You can't just lay sod without preparing the soil first and that's the hardest part.</p>

<p>Next year you should have at least a half way decent lawn and that may be good enough for you. If not, you have time to do some soil tests for your problem areas and come up with a better plan.</p>

<p>Learn about properly maintaining your lawn for next year. Proper mowing and watering can make a huge difference. Mulch mow your clippings helps return fertilizer and water back to the lawn. All the <a href=""http://www.organiclawndiy.com/2008/08/no-and-low-cost-lawn-care.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">no and low cost lawn care tips</a> I posted on my blog were basically all I did to take care of my lawn when I was first staring. Not much in the way of fertilizer. It made a noticeable difference in the quality of my lawn right away. </p>

<p>One more time to be annoying and add emphasis... :) Sod is a living thing. It's not carpet. If you lay it without fixing the conditions that caused the old lawn to die, the new sod will die too resulting in a waste of time and money. If you insist on sodding instead of seeding, do all the steps I mentioned above except you need to kill and remove all the old grass and weeds using a sod cutter. The sod needs to come into contact with the soil and you need to properly amend and prepare the soil. If you lay sod over your old grass it won't come in contact with the soil and will die.  </p>

<p>You need to get this done within the next couple weeks.</p>

"How do I improve drainage vertically through clayey soil?","15627","","<p>I live on a hill where the soil has lots of clay.  My back garden has been terraced with small (1m) retaining walls.  The net result is that we have several lawns / gardens with the following properties:</p>

<ol>
<li>Surrounded on all sides by concrete retaining walls.</li>
<li>The top 20-30cm is good soil; the remainder is clay.</li>
<li>At the bottom of some of the retaining walls (i.e. a bit less than 1m below the surface), there are periodic drainage holes.</li>
</ol>

<p>So the drainage is quite terrible -- the water can't get out the sides, and it can only sink slowly through the clay.  To improve this, my idea was to dig a trench ~30cm wide along the side of the retaining walls (where the drainage holes are), fill the bottom 50cm with sand, and the rest with dirt, and then run drainage pipes from the rest of the lawn to this trench.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I have also read: ""Don't mix sand and clay; that's how you get brick"".  Is this a good idea?  Will it work?  Are there better options?</p>

<p>Edit: Photos below (excuse the laundry -- we can't let a sunny day go to waste :-) )</p>

<p>The corner with the manuka (centre first image, bottom-right second image) is evidently a little lower than the rest of that lawn, and thus in heavy rain it can be under 5+ cm of water.</p>

"How can I determine which trees are unsafe in strong winds?","15480","","<p>We had some fairly extreme weather in the UK, enough wind to blow over a tree. Luckily nobody was hurt as the trunk rested larger branches, narrowly missing the neighbours fence. The trunk  and branches have been cut in several places as it can be seen below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bjLe6.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Two of the same mature pine trees are planted either side of this tree which concern me as well as a few other trees in our garden. How can I tell which trees are expected to fall and what can I do about them?</p>
","<p>It's probably very hard to tell simply by looking at a tree, that otherwise shows no obvious indications of being weak, but here are a few things to watch out for:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I would be very skeptical of a tree that is perfectly straight (yours seems to be that way). It is a pretty good indication that the person who planted it trained it to grow straight by staking it to a vertical pole/support for a very long time. While this might be aesthetically pleasing, it does not allow the tree's stem to develop it's own bending strength. So when you have heavy winds, instead of the stem swaying and absorbing the force, the tree remains very stiff and eventually either snaps or transfers all the bending moment from the wind to the roots, which eventually give in. </p></li>
<li><p>If your tree has a sharp Y crotch (with the upper limbs very vertical), consult an arborist and cut the weaker one off. If you don't, they'll eventually break and cause damage in heavy winds/storm.</p></li>
<li>Stay clear of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callery_Pear"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bradford pears</a> if you're in a windy/stormy area. They're notorious for breaking under winds/snow/storm (primarily because of point 2 above), yet people plant them because they look pretty. If you find them in a house that you bought in a windy area, better cut them down.</li>
<li>As pointed out by <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/users/51/bstpierre"">bstpierre</a>, if you have a small woodlot (or just several trees surrounded by other trees) and you clear the peripheral trees or thin them down for whatever reason, you'll be exposing the inner trees to the winds. These are most likely going to be weaker, as they grew up being partially protected from the wind and now that there are't as many outer trees to break the wind, these are at risk of getting uprooted.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are some of the visual indicators that you can use to identify. However, the bigger culprit lies underground, which is very hard to correct once the tree is established. If the root system is not well developed or shallow, then it will easily be blown over in a mild storm. </p>

<p>A lot of these problems have to do with improper care for the trees when they're young. Here are some things to keep in mind when you plant a new tree, so that you won't have problems 5–10 years later:</p>

<ol>
<li>It might not be a bad idea to stake young saplings in regions with heavy winds so that don't get blown away. However, do not use a stiff vertical stake and train it upright. There are alternate ways of staking that provides support while at the same time, allows it to sway. See the answers to <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/q/1670/109"">this question</a> for more info on this.</li>
<li>Water less often, but water deep. Often people water their saplings every day/every other day in a shallow manner. By that, I mean watering just enough to wet the surface and maybe half an inch into the soil. This will result in the trees developing shallow root systems, because that's where the roots can find water. Instead you need to water maybe twice a week at most, but water deep so that the roots grow downwards in search of water. See the answers to <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/q/1980/109"">this question</a> (and is a standard advice in several answers scattered around).</li>
<li><p>Keep the height low by crown pruning. You can keep it as low as you think looks good, but I wouldn't let it get higher than 20 ft. This way, the winds won't have the same effect that it does on a taller tree. If anything happens, you're restricting the damage to just a 20 ft radius, and if you're careful to plant it 20 ft away from the house to begin with, you can also minimize potential damage. See the answer to <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/q/1430/109"">this question</a> for more information on crown reduction.</p>

<p>However, as <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/users/499/kevinsky"">Kevinsky</a> mentions below, crown reduction is not a viable solution for evergreens as they just grow a new leader or multiple leaders with weak attachment points.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>UPDATE:</h3>

<p>I just saw this picture on <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/vun4j/neighbors_tree_after_last_nights_storm_in_the/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reddit</a> showing a tree that got uprooted in the recent storms in the US. This clearly illustrates my point above about shallow root systems being an easy prey for strong winds.</p>

<p>In today's ""model"" homes with quick-n-dirty landscaping, the builders more often than not, top off with a foot of soil with a hard gravel/clay/cement base underneath. While this might be fine for most plants, you should not plant trees here. In this case, the tree grew shallow roots that spread through the lawn because it could not go any further down (possibly hard base). Besides, having a lawn also ensured adequate shallow water supply which mean it didn't have to try to grow downwards either.</p>

"How do I tell when an eggplant is ready to be picked?","15408","","<p>In the past I've had eggplant in my garden but my parents had always taken care of harvesting them since I don't eat it. This year I'm growing a couple for them and have some fairly large fruit on the plants. The problem though is they look the same now as when they first came out on the plants. How do you tell when an eggplant is ripe and ready to be picked? The variety I'm growing is <code>Listada de Gandia</code> if it helps.</p>
","<p>Usual way of testing for ripe eggplant is to try to dent it with the end of your thumb. If it gives way with as much pressure as you would dint a tomato then it's ready. I've grown that variety, very nice flesh and no bitterness. The white streaks will also go a bit off white. I can't locate my flickr page, which has a nice photo of those eggplants just about ready.</p>

"How can I kill or remove insects from cut flowers that I bring inside?","15078","","<p>When I cut flowers (typically daylilies) from my garden and bring them inside, I often find I am treated to a barrage of flies over the next few days.  I'm going to guess that there are maggot larvae within the flowers, which matures inside my home.</p>

<p>I'd also like to bring in my peonies, but they are covered in ants.  If a different technique is applicable for them, I'd like to know.</p>

<p>I love the idea of bringing my garden inside, but not at the expense of harboring an indoor insect colony.  Is there a way to kill the insects/larvae (with or preferably without chemicals?)</p>
","<p>Inspect your flowers before bringing them inside; if you see insects on them, give them a gentle shake or dislodge the critters by hand with something like a small, soft paintbrush. Another option is to cut the flowers in the early morning and let them sit in a bucket of water outside in the shade for a few hours before bringing them inside; the insects will often leave on their own. I've been bringing cut flowers in for years and find this usually works just fine. I wouldn't go to the effort of killing insects that are there naturally. </p>

"What are these swirly green growths inside my bell peppers?","14988","","<p>I occasionally discover swirly green growths inside my bell peppers, such as the ones pictured below.  What are they exactly?  Are they edible?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wyt7I.jpg"" alt=""bell pepper growths""></p>
","<p>It's an internal proliferation known as a form of parthenocarpy - formation of fruit without fertilization. So it's just a sort of clone or internal baby pepper, sometimes looking much more like a pepper than the pic you've shown. Common in sweet peppers and yes, edible.</p>

"When removing a tree branch, should I paint the exposed part of the tree?","14958","","<p>I am working on cleaning up my yard, and that means removing some lower branches.  I've heard removing at the node is important, so I am doing that.  I've seen other trees that have been painted at the removal point.  I'm guessing this seals the tree, helping prevent rotting.</p>

<p>Is painting or sealing the removal point necessary?  Is it detrimental?  Is there a specific product for the job or is paint the right thing?</p>
","<p>Depends on the variety of tree. If its a Prunus species, then wound paint may help to prevent silverleaf infection, but otherwise, wound paint is no longer recommended, since research shows that it does not prevent or stop any infection of the wounded area, and in some cases appears to be detrimental to the healing process.</p>

<p>When you prune the tree is much more important, and the method you use - a clean cut, without damaging the 'collar' or main trunk of the tree itself, and cutting just above a node, as you mention, are necessary, but some trees are better cut back when they are dormant, others at other times of year. Knowing the variety is necessary to advise further.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Acer varieties bleed profusely if cut before end of July in the UK because the sap is flowing strongly - you need the sap to be down, not rising, so best time is really late autumn/very early winter to be safe, although given you're in Canada, the sap might be dropping now, not sure. Might be wisest to wait till September.</p>

"What type of potting soil is most suitable for indoor herbs?","14694","","<p>I've tried a few times to grow potted herbs in my apartment with varying success, and I suspect it is related to the potting soil. I have basil and rosemary that are thriving in pots filled with <a href=""http://www.scotts.com/smg/catalog/productTemplate.jsp?proId=prod70332&amp;itemId=cat50154"">MiracleGro Potting Mix</a>, but I planted chocolate mint, spearmint, ginger mint, thyme, and tarragon in pots with <a href=""http://www.scotts.com/smg/catalog/productTemplate.jsp?proId=prod70262&amp;itemId=cat50154"">MiracleGro Moisture Control</a> potting mix, and those all died extremely quickly (within a week - one of the mints turned completely brown and shriveled within two days).</p>

<p>I followed the directions from the tags the seedlings came with (regarding sun exposure and watering), and I was careful not to damage the root bundles when I potted them, so the only thing I can guess is that the Moisture Control potting soil did not get along with these plants.</p>

<p>Does anyone know why that is? Is there something about the pH level or nutrient levels in this particular soil that make it ill-suited for herbs? Are there certain things I should look for on the labels when purchasing potting soil in the future? (I live in a city and have a very limited selection of potting soil types and brands in my local hardware stores/target.)</p>
","<p>I haven't used the MiracleGro Moisture Control potting mix myself, but some indoor gardeners seem to think that it's too moisture-retentive and compacts, causing drainage problems: see comments by gardengal48 <a href=""http://forums2.gardenweb.com/forums/load/soil/msg031506165583.html?10"">here</a>. I think this is likely to be the reason why the second group of herbs you planted, failed. Very few plants can survive if their feet are constantly wet</p>

<p>Although herbs' nutritional and moisture needs vary a little from one type to another (see Growing Herbs at Home, with a useful table describing their growth characteristics <a href=""http://www.savvygardener.com/Features/herbs.html"">here</a>), most of them can be expected to do well in a good quality multipurpose potting mix. If possible, I would avoid a peat-based one, as it loses moisture very quickly and, if allowed to dry out, can be quite hard to wet again.</p>

","<p>With 104&#176;F temperatures and especially if your pumpkins are in full sun, that is the most likely cause of what you're seeing.</p>

<p>Also did you allow the patch to dry out during that extremely hot period?</p>

<p>If yes, that would also have had an affect on what you are now seeing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pumpkins, especially early on when fruit is being set, benefit greatly from some protection from the full midday sun (especially when taking into account the kind of temperature you gave) ie Think shade covers.</li>
<li>Pumpkins are heavy feeds, plenty of organic matter and fertiliser (if you can't get enough good quality organic matter).</li>
<li>Pumpkins do better with a good constant water supply. You don't want to be drowning them, but keeping the soil constantly moist below the surface, greatly helps keep them happy. It's better to water at soil level, instead of from above. Drought, drying out of the soil can really stress your pumpkin patch.</li>
<li>Pumpkins like and need a lot of space, and also like their patch weed-free as much as possible. Careful, regular, hoeing of your pumpkin patch is a worthwhile job, your pumpkins will thank you for it. Added benefit of keeping your patch as clean as possible = Greatly reduces the risk of pests/disease taking hold.</li>

Over the past month or so, its leaves have been yellowing and dying rapidly. This is how it looked today, a Monday; last Thursday, I removed the dead and dying leaves, so the yellowing you see in the photograph happened over four days.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/E85AD.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>My desk has a southwest facing window high up on the wall; the plant is on a level with the window and is a few feet from it. There are tall trees near the building, but they're not in leaf yet, so it gets some indirect sunlight every day. I've been sitting at this desk for 1&frac12; years, and my plant wasn't like this last year.</p>

<p>What is causing this, and how can I help my plant recover?</p>
","<p>Here is a brief symptoms guide which may aid you:</p>

<ul>
<li>not enough water: older leaves die and are dry and papery</li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealybug"" rel=""nofollow"">mealybug</a> infestation: white cottony tufts in the axils of the leaves</li>
<li>natural aging: older leaves close to the base of the stem yellow and dry, rarely more than one or two at once</li>
<li>too much water: many leaves yellow, oldest ones first, leaves retain their <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turgor_pressure"" rel=""nofollow"">turgor</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>This looks like overwatering to me.  This is the most common cause of stress or death for houseplants.</p>

<p>Solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduce watering</li>
<li>move closer to light or increase lights</li>
<li>consider rejuvenation: cut one third of the stems off leaving six inches of bare stem and root in water. Once they are rooting cut another third of the stems off the parent plant and root in water.  Aglos readily bud from old stems.  With this method you can rejuvenate the old plant and have a backup in the form of cuttings you can pot up in six to eight weeks.  Reduce watering for the parent plant after you have cut back the foliage to make cuttings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Edit: Michelle suggests repotting which can be helpful. It depends on the extent of the overwatering.  If the plant is potbound and a little bit overwatered, then yes, repot.  Severe overwatering is quite a stress on a plant and repotting would just add more stress.  In this case taking cuttings as suggested is a better idea.</p>

<p>Check the roots in the soil.  New roots are firm and white. Old roots are brownish.  Dead roots can be soft and mushy or papery if they have dried out.</p>

","<p>Ooh, dear, sorry AvieRose, that's because there isn't a once and for all solution. Bindweed is practically impossible to eradicate, as you've discovered, so all you can hope for is to keep it in check. In light soils, it's often possible to extract the bulk of any root material when the area is unplanted, but in clay or heavy soils, it's much harder because, as you probably know, it will regrow from a piece of root no more than a quarter of an inch in size. I usually do what you did, insert canes and let it climb up that, then spray with glyphosate, and periodically, when revamping an area, attempt to extract as much of the root as is possible.</p>

","<p>Sorry, but this is definitely not real.  I'm including the best short article to explain why we see green, yellow, reds, sorta purples but not blue leaves. There is a plant that while the leaves are young produce a blue pigment (reflects blue light) to protect the new leaves from herbivores and there is ONE fern in the rain forest that is very blue.  Cyanobacteria are blue but color varies with different colors of the light spectrum today.  They were here 3.5 billion years ago and because of this bacteria, which is still a huge part of life on this planet now, we were able to be here.  Otherwise, there would be no Oxygen in the atmosphere.  These blue cyanobacteria changed our atmosphere completely, killing off the rest of life where Oxygen was toxic.  </p>

<p>Cyanobacteria were the precursors of our green plants today.  Chloroplasts evolved to do the photosynthesis necessary to make food and because of them, green light is reflected.  Now we see green LEAVES (flowers don't photosynthesize).  </p>

"Why won't my venus fly trap eat?","13992","","<p>Today I finally caught my Venus Fly Trap in the act, or rather caught this snap of the bug relaxing on the trap. The plant just won't eat. It may have been on a local store shelf for a while (instruction sheet says source is <a href=""http://flytraplady.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://flytraplady.com/</a> ).  I filled a tray with 1"" of reverse osmosis water and pushed a wandering box elder bug inside the dome. Today the bug is sitting on the one wide-open trap, looking lost, but untrapped.</p>

<p>I have not poked the traps in any way since I got it. Is this trap just exhausted? Is it not able to eat these guys (a pity because it's common inside in the winter.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jfwoB.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Quite possibly, although there are two explanations I can think of.</p>

<p>Each trap has some hairs on the inside (typically three on each side of the trap, but it does vary). A single touch to a hair is insufficient&nbsp;— there have to be two touches within about 20 seconds. The second touch can be to the same hair or a different hair. This behavior is interpreted as an adaptation against false triggering due to the wind/etc.
So it is possible the (rather large) insect didn't meet this criteria&nbsp;— if the body is quite high above the ""feet"", then there's only the lower right leg that might be close to touching a hair in the photo.  The insect seems a little larger as well&nbsp;— I've seen them catch English blue bottles which are probably about half the length.</p>

<p>Secondly, yes, the traps do become inactive. Each individual leaf trap has a 'life' of about 3 captures. Not sure if these are actual insect trappings or trap activations. One in a shop might get fired a lot by kids and as a demo, but then I think I've had them where I must have activated the traps more than 3 times.  Either way this is on a leaf by leaf basis&nbsp;— other leaves should still be active.</p>

<p>You can test it with a cocktail stick. You are right not to overdo it, but once just as a quick test is fine. Remember you will need to touch two of the hairs.</p>

<p>Finally: I don't think this is a problem in your case, but I see a lump of peat in the middle over the crown (centre of the plants where all the leaves are sprouting from). Don't bury this area, and don't soak it&nbsp;— Venus Fly Traps are susceptible to rotting around this point, and the whole plant will die. It usually happens when the plant is transplanted too deep.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT BY AN ONLOOKER WITH A LOT OF EXPERIENCE</strong></p>

<p>No one ever asked what the temperature was. Let alone being in march this plant should be asleep. Personally I believe your VFT is half asleep or needs some time to adjust to its conditions. Your crown does not look rotten or weak and you can see some new growth coming from it. The post below was talking about nitrogen content of the soil. If there was enough food in the soil it would be worse off than this picture and will die let alone the pH of the RO water and the soil locks out a good bit of nutrient uptake leaving salts to burn the roots and crown.</p>

<p>You're watering with RO water which is good. Give the plant some time. Let it overcome its shock, and in the summer it will perform wonderfully. During the fall you need to put the plant in an environment to where it can sleep. Water it less and put it in 40°F temperatures like a refrigerator, garage, or outside if you do not have hard freezes.</p>

<p>Never fertilize this plant. Never give the plant water that is chlorinated or impure.</p>

<p>How do I get rid of these things without the back-breaking effort of uprooting them all (there are probably too many), or the expense of paying a professional service for it?</p>

<p>I've heard vinegar works well (albeit it kills grass too), but I'd like to hear if there's another natural, inexpensive way to get rid of these nasty weeds.</p>
","<p><strong>Now that <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/q/1909/394"">the question has been updated</a> to include <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thistles"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Thistles""</a> I've revised my below answer a little...</strong></p>

<p><em>Credit for the ""dandelion"" part of this answer goes to my mum.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandelion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dandelions:</a></strong></p>

<p>When we (wife and I) moved into our current home 4 years ago, the front and back lawns were covered in <a href=""http://extension.missouri.edu/p/IPM1007-40#Dandelion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dandelions</a> (and other broadleaf weeds). I didn't want to go the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbicide"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">herbicide</a> route, and after speaking with my mum, she said the <strong>only</strong> way to truly get rid of (control) dandelions is to hand remove them (<strong>important:</strong> you need to remove root n' all) and recommended using a small hand garden trowel for doing so.</p>

<p>I didn't have a ""small hand garden trowel"", instead I bought a small (and cheapish) builders trowel and used that for 3 years:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b4PKV.jpg"" alt=""Dandelion remover - small builders trowel""></p>

<p>Then last year on clearance (paid $1) I picked up a <a href=""http://www2.fiskars.com/Products/Yard-and-Garden/Weeders/Softouch-R-Weeder"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fiskars Softouch Weeder</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ca72t.jpg"" alt=""Dandelion remover - Fiskars Softouch Weeder""></p>

<p>Both of the above hand-tools have worked well in removing dandelions (roots included).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first three lawn cutting seasons I pulled a lot! of dandelions, at least once a week I would walk the lawns and hand remove all the unwanted plants I saw (all of them went into a plastic bag for offsite disposal).</p></li>
<li><p>During last year's lawn cutting season I noticed a big drop-off in the number of unwanted plants I was removing, except for crabgrass (but that's a whole other story).</p></li>
<li><p>This years lawn cutting season I've only had to remove a handful of ""small"" (young) dandelions, this is to be expected as I can't control dandelion seed heads blowing into my garden (though I wish I could).</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, getting any unwanted plant under control via an ""organic"" approach is going to take patience and time, but if you stick with it, you will see (excellent) results.</p>

<ul>
<li>And bare in mind, even if you go a ""non-organic"" route, you're pretty much ""forced"" to continually use the chosen method if you don't want to see the unwanted plant(s) return.</li>

<p>I remove ""smaller"" thistles using the above tools, basically I treat its removal the same as dandelions ie Remove the unwanted plant, root n' all.</p>

<p>For ""large"" thistles I use a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spade"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">spade</a> to dig them out (root n' all). After digging them out I back fill the holes with some suitable material and make good the area.</p>

<p>Now, as it happens, a previous owner put down a lot of weed matting and covered it with perhaps 5cm of gravel.  My best guess, from looking at <a href=""http://www.ataktrucking.com/crushed-stone"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this page</a>, is that the gravel is equivalent to 3/8"" crushed stone.  Can I use that instead of pea gravel?</p>
","<p>Crushed gravel is the media of choice for providing drainage.  What you want is to have the maximum amount of airspace in the drainage layer so water has somewhere to go.  Normally you would use 5/8"" or even 7/8"" crushed gravel but 3/8"" will do.  Pea stone gravel would not be my first choice as it will pack down over time and provide less airspace than the irregular shapes of crushed gravel.
If you want to be diligent you can give the gravel you dig up a quick wash to separate out any dirt or other loose material.
And, when in doubt, add more drainpipe with sleeve!  There is no reason you cannot have several layers of drainpipe on top of each other in particularly difficult to drain areas.</p>

"Is mulch or topsoil better for new lawn in clay soil?","13403","","<p>We just built a new home and the back yard has quite a bit of clay in it. We are planning on seeding the yard in the next month (September). I'm trying to decide between topsoil (4-6 inches) or tilling in organic matter. The advantage of the organic matter is that I don't have to take soil away from the edges of the sidewalk to make room for the topsoil. Topsoil is also pretty expensive. I've heard that the mulch can burn the seeds though and I don't want to do something that will force me to do sod (see expensive).</p>

<p>Any advice would be much appreciated!</p>
","<p>Not sure where you're from but in the USA you can send a soil sample to your local university extension office and for a nominal fee they will give you a report on the soil that you can use to improve it for your intended purpose. Two key things to look for is the existing organic matter content and cation exchange capacity. This is always a good thing to do before doing major work for a lawn or garden.</p>

<p>When you say ""mulch"" I assume you're talking <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compost"">compost</a> and this is what it's called in your area?</p>

<p>Compost is pretty much the closest thing to a silver bullet when it comes to improving your soil. It can fix all sorts of problems. The only time compost will burn the seed or the seedlings is if it has not been composted properly. This is more of a problem with composted manures which are ""hotter"" or more nutrient rich. A good blend of compost from different sources such as manures, leaves and other plant materials that has been composted completely shouldn't be a problem.</p>

<p>Tilling your soil causes problems but if you need to seriously amend your soil it's the quickest option. A couple of issues are tilling will wind up leaving your lawn uneven and you'll need to fill in areas in the future to level it. Tilling will also bring up a ton of weed seeds that were buried too deep to germinate before so before you plant your grass seed water the soil and give the weeds a couple of weeks to germinate then deal with them before putting down your grass seed.</p>

<p>Clay soil isn't that bad for your lawn as long as you have a decent amount of organic matter already in the soil. You may not want to go to the expensive and effort of tilling in a lot of organic matter (2-6"") into your soil all at once. Another option if your soil has at least 5% organic matter and decent cation exchange capacity you can just top dress with about a 1/4"" layer of compost. This would require 1 cubic yard of compost per 1,000 sq ft. Do this every year for the next 3 years or so and then start doing it less frequently if you are happy with what you're seeing. Time, worms and other organisms will help work it further into the soil. </p>

<p>You should also do a percolation test to see how well the water drains. See:

"My basil had a shock after transplanting. What did I do wrong?","13361","","<p>First a little backstory: I bought the basil at a supermarket, where it came in a small plastic vase. I kept it in this vase for three weeks. During these three weeks, I did the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>kept it at the window, with an additional timer lamp to provide more light during the evening (here the sun goes down very early)</li>
<li>watered from the bottom, with a reversed coke to always keep some water around. The result was a humid soil on the top.</li>
<li>on top of a heat radiator. There's a space of 15 cm between the radiator and the actual board where the vase is sitting. I am not using an aggressive temperature. </li>
</ul>

<p>In these conditions, the basil appeared to grow well. Got good leaves and new sprouting leaves were well established. I got a couple of slightly yellow leaves in the lower parts of some plants. This may hint at excessive watering, as I read around.</p>

<p>Two days ago I realized the roots were coming out the drain holes, so I decided to transplant the plants into three vases. It is the first time I attempt this procedure, so I am quite sure I did it wrong: I took the plants out of the old vase. I found out that it was basically a lump of roots. I tried to pull, and I clearly felt the roots breaking. I tried to put the lump in water to release some soil but it remained a (now wet) lump. Ok. I just pulled it into three pieces, moved each of them into a vase, where I put some new soil, the lump, and soil all around and to cover it. The new soil is pH 5-6.5, with NPK 14-16-18 fertilizer in slow release coated granules.</p>

<p>After the transplant (which I did at around 15:00, which means that after the transplant, the plants got only three hours of indirect light), I put the three vases (which have drainage as well) in basically the previous situation: a water buffer in a larger container, with the vases inside. The only difference is that I haven't provided artificial light, since I am using the lamp for some sprouts.</p>

<p>After only one day, some plants are clearly stressed and on the brink of death.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3y9Lm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This is one of the three vases. Note how some plants appear healthy, while one is clearly dying. This happened within 24 hours.</p>

<p>What did I do wrong ? </p>
","<p>That is not unexpected in the first 24 hours. Transplanting certainly induces shock to the plant and all we can do is to minimize the shock. The snapping of the roots you heard is quite common when you separate out root bound plants and as long as you weren't aggressive or remove a lot of them, they should be fine.</p>

<p>That said, here are some observations that might affect your plant's health.</p>

<ul>
<li>A soil pH of 5-6.5 is perhaps a little too acidic for basil. Normally, basil can tolerate something a little to either side of neutral, so about 6-8. However, 5 is getting into blueberry territory and you might want to take care of that, lest the plant dies.</li>
<li>Basil requires full sun, i.e. 8+ hours of sun. Given that you planted in the afternoon, with only 3 hours of sunlight, followed by 12 hours of darkness, I'm not surprised that the plant hasn't had the time to recoup itself. If you have a part of the house which gets good direct sun, I'd suggest moving it there, at least till it establishes itself.</li>
<li>It is possible that the roots of the drooping plant were 'damaged' a bit more than the others, so it has to also heal and grow those in addition.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would suggest giving it a few more days to gauge its health (at least 2-3 full days, where it has had the chance to enjoy the sun), before concluding that its dying. Lastly, since it's pretty cold now where you are, I wouldn't suggest taking it anywhere outside as basil plants hate the cold. This could also explain a rather sluggish growth.</p>

"Managing weeds around fruit trees","13297","","<p>I have an elevated garden bed with some citrus trees.

Rake off the cut material. You do not want to cut too deep and damage tree roots.</p>

<p>Then lay down superior grade landscape fabric. One or more layers depending on the weeds as bstpierre notes. In some parts of the country this will be called a woven <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotextile"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">geo-textile</a> but result is the same.  Water and air penetrate through the fabric but weeds will find it challenging to come up through it.</p>

<p>Top up with a mulch of your choice.  Preferably not sawdust or other woody type material that will decompose quickly and use up nitrogen which your trees need.  I like pea stone gravel, you may prefer to use locally available materials which do not degrade quickly. </p>

"What are the best conditions for basil?","13038","","<p>What are the best conditions for basil to grow? I live in the UK and it never seems to last that long. Recently I've been putting the plants in the shade and drenching them in water, which seems to be working so far.</p>
","<p>There is one magic tip to prolonging the life of a basil plant: <strong>Pinch the flowers as soon as they appear!</strong></p>

<p>Plants such as basil basically just grow till they flower and then stop. As far as the plant is concerned, it has crossed the finish line and there's nothing left for it to do. So when you keep taking away leaves for your culinary needs, you're weakening the plant.</p>

<p>On the other hand, by pinching the flowers, what you're doing is effectively pushing the finish line forward, so the plant still runs towards it. So you'll get new growth every time you pinch them off and your plants will be lush and last longer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Monitor plant leaves closely. At the first sign of tunneling, squeeze the leaf at the tunnel between two fingers to crush any larvae. Done soon enough, this killing larvae can allow plants to survive minor outbreaks. Pick off and destroy badly infested leaves in small gardens.</li>
  <li>The more healthy the plant, the less chance that leafminers will hurt it. Maintain plant health with organic fertilizers and proper watering to allow plants to outgrow and tolerate pest damage. Keep your soil alive by using compost and other soil amendments.</li>
  <li>Use floating row covers to prevent fly stage from laying eggs on leaves.</li>
  <li>The parasitic wasp Diglyphus isaea is a commercially available beneficial insect that will kill leafminer larva in the mine. The wasp is especially beneficial to indoor growers of ornamentals and vegetables.</li>
  <li>Use yellow sticky traps to catch egg laying adults. Cover soil under infested plants with plastic mulches to prevent larvae from reaching the ground and pupating.</li>
  <li>Organic neem oil will break the pests’ life-cycle by preventing larva from reaching maturity. Neem oil may also have repellent qualities and interfere with egg laying activities.</li>
  <li>Botanical insecticides can be used to knock down adult insects but have little effect on the protected larval stage feeding inside the leaf.</li>

<p>How can I tell if I am over- or under-watering the tree and what else can cause the leaves to yellow?</p>

<p><em>The tree was planted last year, but was already 2-3 years old.</em></p>
","<p>You don' say whether your tree was planted recently or is a well-established one, but it sounds as though the problem is caused by over-watering, as you suspect. A mature Honey Locust is an extremely tough, drought-resistant tree, well fitted to survive long dry spells, but sensitive to over-watering.</p>

<p>If you planted your tree fairly recently. the following watering advice taken from the <a href=""http://www.draper.ut.us/vertical/Sites/%7B9B0E25D7-5E8F-45BF-AFAB-8658E160BEA4%7D/uploads/%7B2183C012-3952-4E1D-8F3B-D49A1B6ACA6F%7D.PDF"">Draper City Street Tree Guide</a> should help:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>• <strong>When To Water</strong>: Water frequently enough so the soil several inches below the surface is moist without being continually sodden. Soil with adequate moisture for root growth will form a ball when squeezed but will fall apart when bounced on your hand. Crumbling soil is
  too dry; sodden soil is too wet. Soil moisture can be assessed by poking a rod into the soil. Rod penetration indicates extent of moist soil.
  Resistance indicates overly dry soil… or a rock. <em>A rod coated with mud indicates over watering.</em></p>
  
  <p>• <strong>Watering Frequency</strong>: Water every 2 to 4 days if you have planted during the summer in extremely sandy soil. Water less frequently if
  you have more clay in your soil, and it is poorly drained, or if you have planted during the early spring or late fall. You must not water so
  often that the tree’s roots become waterlogged. Over watering will kill a tree as surely as no water at all. Late fall and early winter water is
  essential for trees planted less than two years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To preserve moisture, it would be a good idea to spread a 3  or 4 inch layer of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulch"">mulch</a> on the soil around your tree, but make sure that it doesn't come into contact with the trunk.</p>

<p>As yellowing leaves are the only symptom you mention, it's very unlikely that the tree is <a href=""http://www.ehow.com/about_5234579_honey-locust-tree-diseases.html"">diseased</a> or suffering from an in insect infestation; however, if its condition doesn't improve, it might be caused by a <a href=""http://www.ehow.com/info_8114261_locust-tree-turning-yellow.html"">nutritional deficiency</a>, and this could easily be corrected on the basis of a soil test.</p>

","<p>You won't get any strawberries if the flowers aren't pollinated, and I would say this is the most likely cause of your lack of fruit. With its small flowers, a lone strawberry plant on a balcony isn't going to draw the attention of bees and hoverflies which are a strawberry's main pollinating friends. Strawberries are self-compatible (able to use their own pollen) but they require insects to move the pollen from the male parts to the female parts of the flowers in order for fertilization to happen. To get around this, you can hand-pollinate the flowers or else build up a great flowery collection of plants to draw bees to your balcony. To do the duty of bees, I suggest you use a small paintbrush to move some of the pollen from the male parts (anthers) which form a ring between the central part of the flower and the petals, and brush the pollen against the female parts (pistils) in the center. Do a thorough job, though: the more pistils get pollinated, the larger your strawberries will be!</p>

Oregano, in contrast, seems to decide to become a creeping ground cover in the face of endless mowing, which isn't entirely a bad thing. We have fragrant walking paths.</p>

<p>Sure, while there are still full mint plants somewhere nearby, plants will continue to pop up in your lawn. But it's not like poison ivy or something. Mow them and enjoy the smell.</p>

"How do I compost a large pile of branches and heavy shrub clippings?","12716","","<p>This Spring, I pruned all my shrubs and pulled out a few pine stumps. My first thought was just to pile them all up on their own. I have never had good luck trying to compost such material with the rest of my compost. But I'm concerned that these heavy materials will take years to compost all by themselves. What can I do to speed up the decomposition of such materials?</p>
","<p>That is very woody material. Wood takes time to compost - probably years for your stuff. You need to do two things: break it into small pieces, and mix it with other material.</p>

<p>The shrubbery cuttings might be choppable by hand - but it could take time. That isn't practical for a tree. You really do need to rent a chipper. And if this is a regular occurrence, then you'll want to eventually buy one (rent one first so you don't over-buy or under-buy).</p>

<p>As for mixing stuff: I would mix with grass clippings (and start collecting them if you currently use a mulching mower) and kitchen waste (vegetable peelings, coffee, etc). You want to get a good mix. For a large heap, most people do this by layering.</p>

<p>An alternative would be <strong>hugelkultur</strong>. I'd never heard of it until it <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/412/what-woods-shouldnt-be-used-for-hugelkultur"">came up in a question on this site last week</a>. This is a form of slow in-situ composting. Basically you put the wood in the base of your beds and it decomposes over years, slowly releasing nutrients. Never tried it but if renting a chipper really isn't an option, then this is probably the only alternative (other than giving it to your local city's trash/tip services).</p>

My first inclination was to destroy the nest and send them packing, but I didn't know if they might aerate the soil, or keep worse pests at bay. Are they of any benefit to the garden?</p>
","<p>In my areas of knowledge (Seattle and London), the ants don't make a real difference one way or the other.  They won't damage your plants, nor will they give them much help.  Of course, I can only speak to the small black ants, but as far as I know even the larger, more aggressive ants are more of a threat to the gardener to the garden.  My sister lives in North Carolina and has to deal with fire ants, but she has to attack them because of the danger they pose from biting humans, so they're dealt with long before they could do anything to her garden.</p>

<p>I generally would take a live and let live approach.  As long as they're not overrunning your garden or biting you when you're gardening, they aren't going to be a serious issue, and there will likely be much more damaging bugs to focus your time an energy upon.</p>

  can also be a minor garden pest, especially in greenhouses where they

"Are my autumn blaze maple trees dying?","12345","","<p>We live in Oklahoma and planted some autumn blaze maple trees last fall.  They seemed to come out of dormancy fine and the leaves were nice and green.  We planted them in an area that stays pretty soaked most of the time, and I'm wondering if that's why the leaves are starting to turn red.  Is the leaves turning red a sign of over watering, or could it be some other problem I need to deal with?  Below are some pics:</p>

<p>UPDATE: I think I might have multiple problems.  I dug a small hole around the tree and the entire soil profile resembled loose mud.  The hole quickly filled up with water.  Also, for two of these trees, the tree can easily be moved around in the soil (you can see the root ball moving back and forth).  I think I've seen this mentioned as a crowbar problem.  I went ahead and staked the trees to prevent them from coming all the way out of the ground.  Are these trees just doomed if they live in such a wet area?</p>
","<p>This hybrid tree got the ""Urban Tree of the year"" award in 2003 for vigour and adaptability. It tolerates clay soil, dry conditions or <a href=""http://pnwplants.wsu.edu/PlantDisplay.aspx?PlantID=215"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wet soil</a>.  I see that it is sensitive to iron and magnesium deficiency on alkaline soils but that should be evident if the new growth is yellow with green veins which I don't see here.</p>

<p>Trees do change colour early if they are stressed. It's possible the tree was planted too deep. This diagram from <a href=""http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/uf/treeguidehtm/chapter6.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this site</a> may help you determine that.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kOSkf.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You should also check the underside of the leaves for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_mite"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">spider mites</a> if it has been hot and dry. I don't see the symptoms in the pictures but it's worth checking.</p>

<p>Also check for physical damage that may have occurred during transport or planting. Look for sunken areas on the bark indicating the cambium is dead.</p>

<p>And when you say the soil stays soaked most of the time this might be the main problem.  Damp or wet is one thing, soaked, where you can squeeze water out of the soil with your hand is another.  Try gently excavating a small hole in one area around the tree.  Examine the soil profile, can you still see the original root ball?
Is it wet too?  Or is the whole soil profile wet from top to bottom?</p>

<p>Edit: The original poster asked if windy conditions could stress a young tree.  I have not seen this myself.  If a tree has been planted for more than a year it should not be staked anyway.  But...this does allow you to do a little experiment....
Try moving the tree. A vigorous tree should not have that much motion after a year.  Alternately, a tree that has not developed a good root system can be rocked back and forth.  You may want to review <a href=""http://extension.umd.edu/publications/pdfs/fs756.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this guide</a> which discusses TDS or ""Too Deep Syndrome"".  Many trees are planted too deep and the issue is often compounded by too much mulch around the base of the tree.
Try excavating around the base of the tree and see where the swell of the root collar is.</p>

<p>Edit: Mike has told us that the soil is wet even in early June on the site.  This makes it more likely that the stress that the plants are exhibiting is due to a waterlogged soil.</p>

<p>Seeing as the trees are planted already here are some choices:</p>

<ul>
<li>Leave them be:  assume it has been a wet spring, trees are adaptable, these are a vigorous cultivar so you could just monitor them and hope they will adapt</li>
<li>dig them up and replant them higher as illustrated below.  This will stress the trees even more and is a messy job</li>
<li>consider changing the drainage of the area with my old friend, four inch drainage pipe with sleeve.  You may be able to dry the area up enough just by digging a trench, laying pipe and gravel and recovering.  This is called a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_drain"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">French drain</a>.</li>
<li>Or they could be a write-off.

I love the look of these plants so would hate to plant and care for them only to have to replace them come spring.</p>

<p>If the winter is on the mild side (for your climate) your coleus could probably make it through unprotected. If you make an effort to shelter the plant; coverings, mulching around the roots etc. you can likely improve your odds even in an average year.

<p>In case it isn't clear that leaves should be closer to the color of the grass in the background (as that is what color they were before).</p>
","<p>First off, your basil has <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolting_(horticulture)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bolted</a>, which means that it has sent out a long stalk with flowers on it and the plant is on its way to dying. This is part of the plant's life cycle and there's nothing you can really do about it. In future, remember that you can prolong a basil's life by <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/81/best-conditions-for-basil/154#154"">pinching the flowers</a> as soon as they appear. As to why this works, I gave an explanation in <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/939/should-i-remove-the-dead-flower-heads-from-my-hydrangea/965#965"">another answer</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remember that a plant's ""mission"" is to reproduce before it dies, to ensure the survival of its species (producing flowers is the first step). If you let the flowers stay till they drop off on their own, the plant, satisfied that it has successfully produced a flower, might decide to stop producing them (end of the flowering season).</p>
  
  <p>However, when you remove the dead flowers you're sort of ""tricking"" the plant into thinking that its previous mission has failed (i.e., it hasn't produced a flower to ensure its survival). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>""Tricking"" the plant encourages it to produce more growth (and flowers too, which you should keep pinching/deheading).</p>

<p>Now coming to the yellowing part, that could be due to many reasons. The simplest explanation, given the advanced stage of bolting, is that the plant is in its last days. The other equally simple explanation is that you have over-watered the plant. Both these produce yellow leaves exactly like in your picture (the fact that the leaves are yellower closer to the base makes me think it is due to over-watering). Other not so simple explanations are fungal diseases or nutrient deficiencies, which are rather hard to diagnose for basil, because the reaction is the same (yellow leaves).</p>

<p>My suggestion would be to let this one run its course and be more careful with a new plant and don't let it bolt.</p>

<p>However I find <a href=""http://www.utextension.utk.edu/mtnpi/handouts/Fertility/Soil_pH_Explained.pdf"">here</a> that soils in Tennessee are mostly acidic and tend to remain at that level due to sulfur from air pollution and existing soil composition.

","<p>If you are fertilizing this tree, I'd recommend that you stop, it doesn't seem to need any more!</p>

<p>From what I can tell from the photos, it looks like this tree doesn't get full sun -- it looks like there are other trees that might be slightly shading it. This could cause some of the vigorous vertical growth that you see -- it's trying to get up into the sun. (I say this more for understanding than for anything you can do about it, short of cutting down some of the competition...)</p>

<p>In your circumstance, you want to do a summer pruning rather than a winter (dormant season) pruning. The dormant season pruning will stimulate more vigorous growth, when your goal should be instead to open the tree up to let more light in. Just don't prune too late in the season -- since any pruning will stimulate growth, you don't want fresh green growth to be exposed to winter chill. It's best to do it in early/mid summer so that the new growth has a chance to harden off before winter.</p>

<p>Your goal should be to establish ""scaffold"" branches (these are the main, roughly horizontal branches). There should be about 4-6 distributed evenly around the tree, about 4' in height vertically from one scaffold to the next. (Imagine that you have four scaffold branches at a height of 6' pointing north-south-east-west, and then another four main branches at a height of 10'. I just picked 6' and 10' out of the air -- use what works for your tree.)</p>

<p>If you are trying to control the height, you can cut back the central leader to just above the top scaffold.</p>

<p>When you do have to remove lateral branches, cut them back to the trunk. (Using the scaffold example mentioned above, imagine that there's an extra lateral branch pointing northeast at 6' high, and it's 5' long. Don't just cut it back to 3' long, cut it back where it comes out of the trunk. If you don't prune it all off, it will just keep growing with several extra small branches pointed in that direction, and they'll interfere with the scaffold branch. It looks like you have a few lateral branches that have done exactly this.)</p>

<p>The general pruning advice given in Mike Perry's answer is good, though I'd recommend removing any downward-facing branches. These don't help anything, and they're more likely to break when loaded with fruit.</p>

<p>An addition to the tools he lists there, you might also consider a pole pruner. This is a long, telescoping handled (12-16' or so) pruner to reach tall branches. It has a pruning saw attached to the end. It also has loppers on the end with a rope that you pull to close the shears. Just don't stand under the branch that you're cutting!</p>

<p>Lastly, don't worry about it too much! I've seen apple and pear trees that have been rather neglected that still look good and produce more fruit than a family (or two or three) can possibly use. And in my experience they're resilient in the face of pruning mistakes...</p>

Overwintering is usually when you pot your pepper and take it inside for the winter (or just keep it in a pot it's already in for the winter).</p>

<p>Originally, I thought that indeterminate peppers were peppers that would continue to grow and produce fruit indefinitely, and that any indeterminate sweet pepper would suffice in answering your question. However, some people have different definitions of what indeterminate means, apparently. Some say it just means that the plants produce flowers all throughout a single season, and then die like other annuals regardless of the climate (this largely comes from my contacting <a href=""http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$Department/deptdocs.nsf/all/opp2873"" rel=""noreferrer"">a Canadian website</a> that spoke of greenhouse and field peppers, and their response to me, as well as Seed Savers Exchange—those who responded may not have had a great knowledge on the topic of the article, though, but seemed to have some good general knowledge about plants—but it's also a general observation that not everyone thinks it has anything to do with longevity or size, but rather bloom frequency only).</p>

<p>Some say <a href=""http://forums.gardenweb.com/forums/load/pepper/msg0615422925006.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">all peppers are perennials</a>, provided the climate is right. Some say all peppers are annuals (of course, they're wrong, but they might be right in that some peppers are annuals).</p>

<p>Here's what I've concluded (which may or may not be entirely accurate):</p>

<p>Most peppers are capable of surviving longer than one season (at least up until December), whether or not they do very well afterward. Some of them will survive up to 5+ years. One of the comments to your question, and <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/07/news/la-lh-rocoto-manzano-chile-20130507"" rel=""noreferrer"">another source</a> (15 years of fruit; 10+ feet tall), speak of 10–15 year old peppers, but I haven’t specifically heard of anyone growing one in-doors for that long, yet (although I personally believe it can happen). Some varieties of peppers are easier to grow for longer periods than others. Some peppers lose their leaves in the winter, and some don't (although how you treat them may or may not influence whether they lose their leaves). They say at least some habaneros don't lose their leaves in winter.</p>

<p>It seems to me that peppers that live longer probably produce better on the second and third years (but thereafter, I'm not so sure). I've heard this from two or three locations, but I don't have the sources, currently (I found them via web searches, probably in forums). However, I'm not referring to every pepper that can overwinter at least once as 'peppers that live longer'. Not all peppers that overwinter will thrive in this fashion, I hear.</p>

<p>Some people think <a href=""http://forums.gardenweb.com/forums/load/pepper/msg0708132917589.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">most sweet peppers don't live that long</a>, especially the hybrids, although if you take proper care of them, they might last somewhat longer and do better. However, I've read that at least big Bertha peppers, which are sweet, will do well on at least one subsequent year (in at least <a href=""http://bonnieplants.com/products/review/product/list/id/1827/category/28/"" rel=""noreferrer"">one person's experience</a>).</p>

<p>I could be wrong, but it really seems like the peppers that overwinter indoors the best are those that tolerate cold the best. Even houses can get pretty cold for some peppers. So, that's good to take into consideration.</p>

<p>Peppers are notorious for dying when it gets cold. Most people think all peppers die at the slightest freeze. However, I have heard an account of someone in Beijing, China who had some wild peppers outside that survived snow.</p>

<p>Some of the more <a href=""http://thehotpepper.com/topic/33656-any-cold-peppers/"" rel=""noreferrer"">cold-tolerant peppers</a> (and though they are all hot varieties, they just might survive mildly freezing temperatures) include these (although even the hardiest of these, with the possible exception of capsicum flexuosum, would probably die at 30 to 23°F (-1 to <a href=""http://thehotpepper.com/topic/33656-any-cold-peppers/?p=684024"" rel=""noreferrer"">-5°C</a>) and colder:</p>

</ul>

<p>Of the cold-hardy hot peppers listed above, goats weed is the most closely related to sweet peppers. So, it might be possible to get a hybrid going there, with a certain amount of cold tolerance.</p>

<p>[Edit: Having grown red Peruvian Rocoto pepper plants, Black Cobra, and Chocolate Habanero, and observing them in a frost down at at least 28° F. I should note that each variety suffered from the frost. Some random plants didn't suffer much, though, but I'm not convinced it was due to cold-tolerance, since the same was true for other kinds of plants. In short, I'm not convinced they're any more cold-tolerant than other peppers. However, they do seem somewhat more cold-tolerant than my tomatoes, which suffered much more. Black Cobra is similar to Goat's Weed; so, that's why I mentioned it. I'm trying to start true Goat's Weed, now, though. So, maybe I'll see about it next year.]</p>

<p>I'm not sure how cold-hardy it is, but this very hot pepper also can be <a href=""http://www.seedman.com/pepper.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">overwintered</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pequin_pepper"" rel=""noreferrer"">capsicum annuum 'pequin'</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm guessing peppers that people call determinate may also be perennials, at least some of the time, and that they probably just have greater intervals without flowers (or else are better at flowering at other seasons than those people are normally used to). This is, however, just a guess. They could really die at the end of the season regardless of frost or care.</p>

<p>There do seem to be very few peppers that people say are determinate, with the exception of commercial field peppers (whatever varieties those are), but if you grow the seeds from a store pepper, the seedlings will probably resemble one of the parents of the hybrid instead of the hybrid itself.</p>

<p>Really, the only varieties of sweet pepper that I’ve specifically heard can overwinter indoors well (at least once) are <a href=""http://bonnieplants.com/products/review/product/list/id/1827/category/28/"" rel=""noreferrer"">big Bertha</a> and <a href=""http://forums.gardenweb.com/forums/load/pepper/msg0708132917589.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">potentially</a> <a href=""http://all-americaselections.org/winners/details.cfm?WinID=427"" rel=""noreferrer"">pepper 'Carmen' F1</a> (<a href=""http://forums.gardenweb.com/forums/load/pepper/msg0708132917589.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">overwintered at least once</a>). I've also heard of some <a href=""http://forums.gardenweb.com/forums/load/pepper/msg0708132917589.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">orange bell peppers that overwinter well</a>, but I don't know what varieties they are. More than one person has mentioned orange bell peppers in this regard.</p>

<p>Some people say pruning peppers is good (and some think it may be necessary to keep them alive), while others think this should not be done.</p>

<p>I've heard of a fertilizer (<a href=""http://forums.gardenweb.com/forums/load/pepper/msg0615422925006.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">bloom builder plant food</a>) that is supposed to help at least cayenne peppers to fruit well even in the middle of winter. That might work for sweet peppers, too.</p>

<p>I don't remember where I read it, but I hear nitrogen will help pepper plants to get big, while phosphorus will help them to develop fruit. Too much nitrogen may result in a huge plant without much fruit. However, if you're overwintering, that may be exactly what you want (a plant focusing on growing larger may thrive better than a plant focusing on growing fruit), for I hear you can switch the fertilizer later on to get more fruit after the plant has already gotten large. I think I read that you want equal parts nitrogen and phosphorus (or a little bit less phosphorus) if you want fruit, and less phosphorus (though I'm unsure how much less) if you want growth.</p>

<p>I've never heard of bell peppers (or any plants) dying if they don't get pollinated. The flowers may not turn into fruit, but that should be it. If you're worried about it, you can always remove the flowers. Some plants that are annuals, such as amaranth, will die after they flower and seed (and pruning off the flowers may extend the life of the plant somewhat, although it may not be aesthetically appealing). I don't believe this applies to peppers, but if there are determinate annual peppers, it just might be possible.</p>

<p>If I were experimenting with new peppers to see if they could live a long time and produce well, I would personally want to try peppers with one or more of these qualities first:</p>

<ul>
<li>Above average cold tolerance</li>
<li>Takes a long time before it produces its initial batch of fruit</li>
<li>Known to grow to be about 5' tall or more</li>
<li>Orange color</li>
<li>Hierloom or wild varieties</li>
<li>Originate from South America or somewhere else warm.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would also be more concerned with leaves than fruit until the plant got big. I would also want to keep the soil and air warm (they say if it's too cold for you, it's too cold for your peppers), and give it a nice grow light, such as <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00GNWK2XO"" rel=""noreferrer"">this one</a> (I haven't personally tried it, but I like the reviews).</p>

<p>If you happen to get a large and old pepper plant and are worried that it might die some day, I have some advice for you. Take cuttings and when they have roots, pot them. If you prune your pepper, you might as well try it with the clippings. Yes, you can take cuttings of peppers and root them (although they say it's somewhat more difficult than with tomatoes). <a href=""http://www.fatalii.net/Growing_chile_peppers/Cuttings/Soil"" rel=""noreferrer"">Here's one way to do it</a> (this way is said to work for many fruit trees and roses, too, although for roses I've also seen a recommendation to rip some of the skin off near the bottom, which might also work for other plants), and <a href=""http://homeguides.sfgate.com/grow-chili-peppers-cuttings-35697.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here's another</a>, although if you have clippings to spare, I'd say test it with the plain water method too, just to see if it works (so you can save on hormone rooting powder). When you take cuttings, even if you have a hybrid pepper that doesn't produce seeds, you can still get more plants that produce exactly the same kind of pepper. People often recommend only taking small cuttings (for just about any kind of plant), but I would recommend experimenting beyond that advice if you have lots of clippings to try. When I did large cuttings with tomatoes, it worked well. Having roots that will be buried deep in the soil seems to be an advantage that makes it so you have to water less.</p>

<p>As <a href=""http://homeguides.sfgate.com/grow-chili-peppers-cuttings-35697.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">the link above</a> mentions, taking cuttings to grow and overwinter can sometimes be a better way to overwinter a pepper than digging it up.</p>

<p><strong>(Old answer):</strong></p>

<p>Some of bell peppers would suit your purpose (greenhouse production of bell peppers uses indeterminate cultivars, but field pepper cultivars are determinate), according to <a href=""http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$Department/deptdocs.nsf/all/opp2873"" rel=""noreferrer"">this website</a> and <a href=""http://www.howardresh.com/hydroponic-culture-peppers1.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this one</a>. If you stop pollinating, the plant will stop producing fruit, but it won't stop the vegetative growth. Indoors it is good to do this on an occasional regular basis, to give the plant a break period.</p>

<p>Indeterminate is what you want. Most people probably don't think of peppers as determinate and indeterminate (it's probably a tomato-thing to most people). <a href=""http://www.idigmygarden.com/forums/showthread.php?t=58190"" rel=""noreferrer"">Here's a forum post</a> with people discussing it. Peppers and tomatoes are in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanaceae"" rel=""noreferrer"">same family</a>. At least some indeterminate peppers are supposed to be good for hydroponic gardening.</p>

<p>Indeterminate plants grow and produce fruit indefinitely, I hear. Determinate plants do for a season.</p>

<p>Growing your peppers indoors, I would recommend a grow light, if you want your peppers to flourish. I'm not really sure how well they do without them, but I'm about to find out, as I just planted some less than a week ago. Also, make sure they're not in a cold room. They are said to like warm soil. I notice my seed roots grow faster when the room is warm.</p>

<p>I've seen it written that you want at least five gallons of dirt, but that's more than square foot gardening would require (although some things, such as watermelon, prefer deep soil). If you have room and light (as well as pots), I'd use a bigger pot for bigger and stronger plants.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hRvMQ.jpg"" alt=""clem2""></p>

<p><strong>CLEMATIS MONTANA VARIETIES</strong>
One of the hardiest of the clematis plant family. They are vigorous growers and will quickly cover large fences and wall. They require little  pruning other than keeping them within bounds. Clematis montanas produce masses of flowers in late spring. Colours vary from white through to rose-pink and many are scented.

<p>If you want an <strong><em>evergreen</em></strong>, <strong>Hedera helix</strong> and <strong>Trachelospermum jasminoides</strong> in my opinion are the best. But i think that a facing north wall also needs to breathe. A few months without coverage of leaves prevents mold, moisture and rot in the walls and rooms.</p>

<p>If you want a nice and <strong><em>enchanting atmosphere</em></strong>, <strong>Trachelospermum jasminoides</strong> and <strong>Lonicera caprifolium</strong> fill your garden with perfume, and make you sleep in a magical atmosphere. That is why I personally prefer them.</p>

<p>To avoid doors and windows covered by creepers, simply, when you prune the plant in spring, leave a free frame of about twenty centimeters. The space will soon be filled by new shoots.</p>

<p>But remember that all half-shade plants flourish more in parts where they get the sun, and bloom less in areas in the shade.</p>

"What are the pros and cons of different rock dusts?","11196","","<p>Rockdust is powdered rock that helps give plants extra minerals (such as silica for strong leaves and stems), trace minerals, calcium, iron etc. They can increase the soil pH somewhat, too.

However, it is said to contribute to soil bacteria that does make the soil more fertile, and whether or not it's fertilizer, it still helps plants to get bigger, stronger and healthier (it also helps to increase yields)—at least if all the reviews and articles I've read are correct.</p>

It has lots of positive reviews online, and it is probably the most popular rockdust with conventional gardeners. <a href=""http://www.permies.com/t/15724/soil/AZOMITE-rock-dust-stuff-radioactive"" rel=""nofollow"">A post I saw on a forum (and its comments)</a> indicates that it might be radioactive (gamma); the Azomite website has tested the alpha and beta (<a href=""http://www.azomite.com/faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">and claims it's not radioactive</a>), but they have not tested for gamma radiation. Azomite comes from a unique source (volcanic ash) in Utah, unlike any other area in the world, they say. I believe I've heard that Azomite (if not rockdust at large) is good for helping to revive suffering trees.</p></li>
<li><p>Agrowinn: This is another commercial rockdust. It has some claims over Azomite, but I don't really know much about it. I've seen it recommended that you reapply it regularly (which seems against the grain of other rock dusts—tell me if I'm wrong).</p></li>
<li><p>Glacial rock dust: This is said to have more pollutants than volcanic rock dust (such as basalt), but a lot of people seem to like it.</p></li>
<li><p>Basalt rock dust: Some sources say basalt rock dust is the optimal kind of rockdust, and I've never heard anyone deny that directly. It has less silica than Azomite and diatomaceous earth, for sure. It is higher in other minerals, however. It is said to be high in ferrous minerals. I've seen differing compositions listed for basalt rockdust. The silica content is probably (not sure) between <a href=""http://djsgrowers.blogspot.com/2009/04/volcanic-rock-dust.html"" rel=""nofollow"">20</a> to 50% of its composition, which means it must have a lot more of something else if it has so much less silica. Basalt can be significantly different colors. I imagine the darker basalts probably have more iron or something than the lighter ones.</p></li>
<li><p>Food grade diatomaceous earth: It's about 85% amorphous silica (the amount depends on what brand you get). It has some trace elements, aluminum and such. It's the only thing like a rockdust that I've actually used. I'm guessing that other than the silica, most other rockdusts are better for plants. However, the silica is not to be underestimated (however, other rockdusts have lots of silica, too; just not usually as much). I've personally used this more for other purposes than gardening (like eating it to cure food intolerances; yes, it actually worked for me there, although it had a negative affect on my short-term memory for a while, and made me constipated, probably due to heavy metal chelation). I've used it a little as an insecticide in an attempt to keep cutworms off my tomatoes. It helped some, but not all the time (perhaps it didn't when wet). Aphids didn't seem bothered by it, particularly. I'm speculating here, but rather than sprinkling it on the plant base, mixing a larger amount with the soil might be more helpful for cutworms. However, another solution (such as beneficial predatory insects) could probably be much better (for cutworms and aphids, that is).</p></li>
<li><p>Granite rockdust: I've heard you can get this for free from a local rock quarry. The same might be true for certain other kinds of rockdust. If you get it from a quarry, make sure they haven't been using harmful chemicals and stuff in their work.</p></li>
<li><p>Agricultural lime: This isn't thought of as rockdust, really. It's mostly to increase soil PH (or lower acidity). It has lots of calcium in it.</p></li>
<li><p>Greensand: This isn't really thought of as rockdust, either. I think it applies a lot of a few certain minerals. I think this increases potassium in the soil. It contains glauconite (which by itself may lower soil PH, but I don't know if greensand does, particularly).</p></li>
<li><p>Hornfels rockdust: I've only barely heard of this.</p></li>

I know I've listed a lot already, but I'd like to know more. I will probably pick the most thorough and informative answer (unless it's just a really good one that surprises me).</p>

<p>EDIT: This question only pertains to rockdust (not other remineralizers or soil amendments). If it's powdered rock of any kind, I'll count that (whether or not it's commonly referred to as rockdust).</p>
","<p>First, I have to say that many of these are so similar, you really won't find a lot of pros and cons between them. They are very similar, and though some might do better than others in certain situations, I haven't really found a reason to differentiate when using as a soil helper, and they all work. </p>

<li><p><a href=""http://www.azomite.com/faq.html""><strong>Azomite:</strong></a> Can cost over twice what basalt or glacial rock dusts do. It comes from a specific volcanic ash deposit in Utah, so it won't be as sustainable as other dusts can be. It is easy to use in spreaders. See <a href=""http://www.azomite.com/resources/coa.pdf"">here</a> for the mineral analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.fertilizeronline.com/rockdust.php""><strong>Agrowinn</strong>:</a> Only one company sells it, and it is very expensive. It has far lower mineral count than azomite (except for Mg). Scroll to the bottom of <a href=""http://www.fertilizeronline.com/rockdust.php"">this page</a> for the analysis. It is still a good mineral source.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.naturesfootprint.com/glacial-rock-dust""><strong>Glacial Rock Dust:</strong></a> Much cheaper than the above minerals. You can use it on a larger application, as it's far more affordable. See the analysis <a href=""http://www.gaiagreen.com/rockdust.html"">here</a>. It isn't necessarily ground as finely, so it can clog some spreaders.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://biodynamics.net.au/about-biodynamics/biodynamic-preparations/basaltrock-dusts/""><strong>Basalt Rock Dust:</strong></a> Great mineral content for the price. I prefer it over glacial because it's less likely to contain heavy metals (which you'll find in alluvial and glacial dusts) and is more consistent in mineral analysis. See <a href=""http://www-odp.tamu.edu/publications/142_SR/VOLUME/CHAPTERS/sr142_10.pdf"">here</a> for analysis. <a href=""http://www.rockdustlocal.com/faqs.html"">Here</a> is a FAQ page that compares basalt and glacial rock dusts. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Those are all the dusts you listed. (EDIT: More have been added to the list since.) Any others will also be similar in the way these are. </p>

<p>You may like to know that while these have high mineral counts, they aren't all available to the plant. They have to break apart even more, which is most easily accomplished using an acid, such as humic acid. The cool thing is, humic acid is the acid produced when organic matter decomposes. So adding rock dust with compost (especially compost that's not <em>quite</em> finished) can increase availability by over 200%. You will also have better results adding the dust to soils high in organic matter, for the same reasons.</p>

I am also thinking (but unsure) if I should pour cement down the slots to help make it solid and connected or how I should go about keeping them together. </p>

<p>Once all the bricks are lined I will also be getting some nice treated wood to build around them. This will be mainly just for aesthetics but I guess could also help hold the blocks in place.</p>
","<p>I've seen it done with one row of blocks laid right on the ground -- gives you the same height that a single 2x10 plank would. Two rows might work ok without cementing them together if you do some prep work for a foundation (coarse sand or stone, 4-6"" deep). At three rows, you'll definitely want to do foundation work and tie them together. If I were doing it three rows high, I'd mortar the joints instead of just dry stacking them (it will look nicer and you won't need to pour cement down the holes). On a solid foundation, this won't need any external support (I have a 10' wall built from 6x16x8"" blocks, built on a concrete foundation, that is not going anywhere.)</p>

<p>As a pro, if you put in the up-front work and do it right, it will last just about forever.</p>

<p>As cons, the up-front work is time consuming, requires some skill to get it right, and once you're done, it will last just about forever, whether you want it to or not. ;)</p>

"Can I grow a fruit bearing pistachio tree?","11107","","<p>I live in Zone 7 in Northwest texas.  It's pretty dry here and the soil is mostly hard clay.  I'm very interested in growing fruit bearing pistachio trees, but haven't been able to find any local nurseries that know anything about them (maybe that's a bad sign).  Lots of people grow Chinese Pistachios, but that's not the same tree.</p>

<p>Anyway, according to my reading (<a href=""http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/extension/fruitgarden/fruitvariety.htmlz"">Aggie Horticulture Extension</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistachio"">Wikipedia</a>, <a href=""http://www.crfg.org/pubs/ff/pistachio.html"">California Rare Fruit Growers</a>, and others) the pistachio will do well in arid climates and is hardy up to USDA Zone 8a.  So, it's in the zone...however, I'm more concerned about my soil.  </p>

<p>The California Rare Fruit Growers website describes the soil requirements like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The trees do best on soils that are deep, friable and well drained but moisture retaining. It can, however, survive in poor, stony, calcareous, highly alkaline or slightly acid, or even saline soils. The root is deeply penetrating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikipedia has this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pistachio is a desert plant, and is highly tolerant of saline soil. It has been reported to grow well when irrigated with water having 3,000–4,000 ppm of soluble salts. They need a sunny position and well-drained soil. Pistachio trees do poorly in conditions of high humidity, and are susceptible to root rot in winter if they get too much water and the soil is not sufficiently free draining.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there anyway I can succeed with this venture?  What's the best way to go about it?  Should I amend my soil to make it more sandy or loamy?  If so, how deep and large of an area around each tree would be best?</p>

<p>Any other advice before I attempt this?</p>
","<p>Inspired by @winwaed to dig in a little more, I found an article on <a href=""http://ag.arizona.edu/yavapai/anr/hort/byg/index.html"">The University of Arizona College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Yavapai County website</a>:</p>

<p><a href=""http://ag.arizona.edu/yavapai/anr/hort/byg/archive/chinesepistache.html"">The Chinese Pistache Tree - April 14, 2004</a></p>

<p>The article specifically compares the Chinese Pistachio with the Pistachio Nut Tree in one small section:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Chinese pistache is a close relative of the pistachio nut tree (Pistacia vera), but is much hardier. The wood is very hard and rot resistant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bit about being more rot resistant had me a little worried, but I read on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Young Chinese pistache trees should be planted in spring or fall. They must have full sun and do best in well-drained soil. However, they tolerate a wide range of soils, some alkalinity, and can live a very long time (several centuries).</p>
  
  <p>The soil should be allowed to dry on the surface between irrigations and never be soggy. Waterlogged soils are not suitable for Chinese pistache trees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The description of the soil requirements (both like well drained soil and cannot tolerate waterlogged soil) and the fact that there are many healthy Chinese Pistachio trees in my area leads me to believe that the Pistachio Nut Tree will probably be fine in my back yard.  The trees are not readily available in my area, but I'm planning on ordering several to plant next spring.  I'll try to remember to come back and update this post in a couple of years!</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Edit:</em> I found more information that leads me to believe I can be successful with this.  I found a <a href=""http://soildatamart.nrcs.usda.gov/manuscripts/TX303/0/Lubbock.pdf"">USDA soil survey of Lubbock County (PDF)</a> where I live.  It describes the soil where I live as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This soil is well drained. Surface runoff is slow, Permeability is moderate, and available water capadty is high. The soil has good tUth and can be worked throughout a wide range of moisture content. The root zone is deep and is easily penetrated by plant roots. The hazards of water erosion and soil blowing are slight</p>
  
  <p>The surface layer is friable, mildly alkaline, reddish brown fine sandy loam about 14 inches thick. From 14 to 46 inches is fria- ble, reddish brown sandy clay loam that is mildly alkaline in the upper 10 inches and moderately alkaline in the lower 22 inches. From 46 to 60 inches is friable, moderately alkaline, pink sandy clay loam that is about 30</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means is that I was working with a mistaken assumption that the soil was clay based on the level of compaction that I encountered when digging past the surface layer.  The soil is actually more sandy, which should be ideal for the Pistachio Nut Tree!</p>

"How to empty and fill a man made pond?","11078","","<p>I have a man made pond that I'd like to get rid of.
It's approximate 8 ft in diameter and about 1 ft deep.
What are the typical steps to fill the pond and get grass growing on it again?</p>

<p>Here's what I have in mind, but I have my doubts.</p>

<ol>
<li>Drain the water to somewhere (public drain?)</li>
<li>Remove rubber tarp that's likely containing the water</li>
<li>Fill the hole with the huge rocks from the edge and alternate rock source (link below)</li>

<li><p>Alternate source for rocks:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oLHAMl.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Should that do it?</p>
","<p>That's a relatively small pond. If you had the patience, you could empty most of it onto your lawn with a 5 gallon bucket, then pull up the liner and let the rest drain into the soil.</p>

<p>Personally, I would not use the rocks to fill it. I have a lawn that's so full of rocks it's impossible to dig anywhere. I would fill the bottom 6-8"" with whatever cheap fill you can get locally and then 4-6"" of good topsoil. You should need slightly less than a full-size pickup load of fill, probably $15-20 at your local gravel pit if you load it yourself.</p>

<p>You could rake 1"" of compost over the top to help the lawn seed get established.</p>

<p>Some issues that you may have with rocks:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you live in an area where it freezes in the winter, the rocks will heave and make the lawn uneven.</li>
<li>Even without frost heaves, over time the soil will settle into cracks in the rocks and you'll have a lumpy area of lawn.</li>
<li>Over time you may forget what was in that spot and rediscover that it's full of rocks when you want to plant something there.</li>
</ol>

<p>Keep in mind that even if you fill as I've suggested, you may have some settling occur over time as the soil in that spot compacts. Overfilling/mounding up the area may help with this, but it's hard to know how much to overfill in advance -- you may end up with a permanent mound there if it doesn't settle as much as you expected.</p>

<p>If you do decide to use the rocks for bulk as you fill it, I'd suggest watering in whatever you use for soil so that you have fewer issues with settling.</p>

"How do I repair a soaker hose?","11052","","<p>I laid out a soaker hose system for my garden this year. Unfortunately a few weeks ago I went to turn it on and noticed a loud spraying sound coming from one area, when I removed some mulch the water shot approximately 10 feet up in the air.</p>

<p>It shouldn't be too hard to find the hole, but what is the best way to fix it? Its a soaker hose, so the repair does not need to be water tight, but it should be enough that it maintains the pressure in the rest of the hose and will stay put so the hole doesn't reopen or get larger.</p>
","<p>You could get one of these self-fusing silicone tapes that are used to fix minor plumbing and hose leaks. You should be able to find it at any hardware store and they cost about 5$.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bn4VO.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now coming to using them, it's a double sided adhesive tape which can be a bit tricky at first and you'll need to do it carefully, else it won't sit tight.</p>

<ol>
<li>First, locate the hole in the hose. This should be very easy -- turn the water on (maybe not full blast) and pull up the hose from under the mulch. You can use little tape bits or whatever to temporarily mark the spots and then turn off the water.</li>
<li>Dry the outside of the hose thoroughly and if you can unhook it from the mains, do so and blow the water out. The surface should be completely dry, without moisture.</li>
<li>Now comes the hard part - wrapping it around the hose. Peel a little bit (3"") and hold it firmly against the hose, about 2-3"" away from the hole (or one end if it is a longish crack and not a hole). Now start wrapping it around the hose and moving to the other end till you're 2-3"" away from the hole or the other end of the crack and keep peeling the clear tape as required.</li>
<li>You should maintain <strong>at least 50% overlap</strong> each time you wind around the hose. Note that these things stretch quite a bit, so make sure that you pull it really well as you wind it. This is very important because the ""self-fusing"" nature or the reason why it sticks is because the double sided adhesive prevents it from slipping when it tries to unwind itself due to the tension from the stretching. The friction helps keep it tightly bound. If it were loose, it'll simply separate.</li>
</ol>

<p>Be careful to not peel off more than you can wind at once. Otherwise, you'll soon realize that it gets all twisted and sticks to itself in ways that you can't get it undone. </p>

","<p>As with all other seeds, you need seed and cutting compost, sometimes called seed starter compost in other countries. The seeds themselves should be 'ripe', meaning you harvested them when the pods were dry and crackling. Separate the seeds from the seed pods and remove any bits of stuff remaining. Sow the seeds about a quarter inch deep in a seed tray filled with seed compost - you can do this now, mid to late autumn is the usual time. Mist water so as not to disturb the seeds, and place the tray in a brightly lit spot. Keep the tray at a temperature of 60-70 deg F over winter, and keep it damp but not sodden - they should germinate within 2-4 weeks. Prick out into individual cells or small pots, still in seed and cutting compost, when they have produced their first set of true leaves. Keep them at the same temperature, pot on as necessary as they grow, switching to multi purpose compost.</p>

<p>Once all risk of frost is over, plant out if they are big enough - if not, keep in pots until they are. They will not flower for at least two years, and the results may be variable - crocosmia seeds do not necessarily come true to the parent plant.</p>

<p>If you want to increase your stock of the Crocosmia variety you already have, you can dig them up, split the clump and replant separately either now or in spring. Any seeds not used now can be stored in a paper bag, in a very dry, dark place.</p>

<li>Right now: should I do any initial pruning? (E.g. for apple trees it is often recommended to prune them to ""whips"".)</li>
<li>On an annual basis: what are the recommended timing and practices?</li>
</ul>
","<p>1) According to the temperature of this moment. I have read that it can snow until April. The ideal time to prune the mulberry tree is before the spring vegetative growth but avoid the intense frost of the coldest months. </p>

<p>2) The mulberry tree is a plant exuberant, most of the bud is able to bear fruit. Therefore, you can operate without much thoughts. Since, even in the event of drastic interventions, specimens don't fail to recover quickly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pruning should be carried out by removing the branches damaged by the weather, dried, dressed, thinned or weakened. You also remove the branches that overlap between them, in such a way as to give more air and sun inside the foliage, for the maturation of the fruits even more inside.</li>
<li>The branches of greater diameter must be trimmed to a third of their length, but, if necessary, it can also halve. In doing so we must always remember that the more buds are left on the mulberry, and the more the fruits are small, so if you want less blackberries, but full and juicy, you can perform pruning more pronounced.</li>
<li>it is always general rule that you should not remove more than 30% of the total leaf area of the mulberry tree, to avoid imbalances in energy to the plant.</li>
</ul>

<p>The pruning will always be in this period, performed in the same way.</p>

<p>And finally, an interesting advice: from the pruned branches can be removed mulberry bark, and set aside to ligatures in the garden (for example, those tomatoes and zucchini). This method 'ecological' avoids the use of synthetic strings!</p>

<p>If not, how can the problem be controlled? What safe insecticides suitable for fruit trees can be used?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DWE4I.jpg"" alt=""Tree with aphids""></p>
","<p>I had a similar problem on a newly-planted apple tree.  It wasn't fruiting, but the aphid infestation was severely stunting new growth.  Although aphids don't infest fruiting plant parts, aphid attacks will weaken the plant as a whole, so a severe infestation will most likely lessen fruit production in some way.  </p>

<p>The most affective, 'organic' mode of control for the aphids and the ants (at least for me) was to use a combination of ladybugs (larvae or adult) to attack the aphids in combination with a sticky barrier (like fruit tree grease or a glue band) around the trunk of the tree to stop the ants.  </p>

<p>By the way, I found that the glue band works far better than the gloopy gel-type barriers that are available. Glue bands are a product specially made for wrapping around fruit trees to keep climbing pests off. They're a strip of plastic(?) with a very sticky adhesive on one side. You wrap this around the tree, adhesive side out, and tie it on with twine to keep critters from sneaking under it. Here's what it looks like: </p>

"Why is my cactus droopy?","10930","","<p>I have a cactus (pictured) which I bought about a month or so ago. It has been slowly drooping, although the tag said to keep it dry in winter and I have only watered it once when I re-potted it. The stems seem to have gone all soft. Does anyone know what might be wrong with it and how I can save it?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0kVAml.jpg"" alt=""little indoor cactus looking droopy""></p>
","<p>Check the stems. Are they just limp, or are they decaying at the base? And check the soil. Is it dry all the way through? What I suspect to be the case is: Cacti need water too, just not as much. If the mix is dry all the way through, that is too dry. If that's the case, give it a good watering right away. The limpness, if there are no signs of rot, is simply wilt from moisture lack. Keep the mix barely moist throughout winter, not bone-dry.</p>

<p>Also, cacti need smaller containers. Planting in a container that size will lead to different problems, like dry center, where the original soil remains dry even after watering. A pot 1/4 that size should be plenty. If the bases of the stems are rotting, there is nothing you can do but take cuttings from the remainder, or graft them onto new rootstocks (easier than it may sound). Also, the plant seems to have leaned towards the window. In warm temperatures (70 degrees F. and higher), desert cacti need full sun for best health. If you can't provide that, I'd suggest that you look into a lighting system that will work for you.</p>

<p>As a note, cacti do best with a winter rest period, when you let them dry most of the way, but they need lower temperatures (between 55 and 65 degrees F.) and shorter, but not too much less intense lightwise, days in order to go dormant properly. If you can't provide the cooler temperatures, don't dry the plant out. It will wilt.</p>

<p>If the plant is healthy, I'd repot it back into a smaller container as well. Here's what the Reader's Digest book '<a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1168830.Success_with_House_Plants"" rel=""nofollow"">Success with House Plants</a>' (highly recommended, by the way) has to say about the potting requirements of cacti:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the wild most desert cacti have a widespread root system. The roots of a plant 6 inches tall can extend, just below the soil surface, for a square yard. This enables them to collect a good supply of surface water in the form of dew. The roots of plants grown in pots are much more compact and the potting mixture must have especially good drainage in order to avoid the risk of rotting. Apart from the drainage requirement, desert cacti have no special potting-mixture needs. A suitable mixture consists of about one part of coarse sand or perlite to two parts of either soil-based or peat-based mixture.</p>
</blockquote>

"When do I need to protect a fruit tree from cold, and how do I do it?","10843","","<p>The last couple of weeks we had unusually warm weather in the Northeast -- several days had record warm temperatures.

"How much fertilizer do I need for my vegetable garden?","10740","","<p>Today I received the results for my garden soil test, which show that I have only 5 ppm of nitrogen.</p>

<p>So my research (here, and elsewhere) has suggested that the best way to (organically) raise the nitrogen level is to add some blood meal.  But how much blood meal do I need?  The ""Fertilizer recommendations"" that came with my test results says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You should apply your nitrogen at a rate of ¼ lb N per 100 sq. ft. You can divide this amount in half and apply half at planting and half a month later during the summer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then later it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>To Calculate the Amount of Fertilizer to Use:</strong><br>
  ( % of nutrient in fertilizer ÷ 100) = Pounds fertilizer per 100 sq. ft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But using that formula, if I had a theoretical fertilizer with 100% nitrogen, I would apply 1 lb per 100 sq. ft., or 4x the recommended amount above.</p>

<p>What is an accurate formula to use to determine how much (organic) nitrogen fertilizer I need to apply?</p>

<p><b>EDIT</b>
I live in Central Kansas, and will be growing a variety of vegetables.</p>
","<p>The NPK numbers on the fertilizer represents the percent, by weight, of Nitrogen, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>O, respectively. So if your blood meal is labeled 12-0-0, then a 100 pound bag would contain 12 pounds of nitrogen.</p>

<p>If you have a 400 sq ft garden, you'd want to apply a pound of nitrogen, or 100/12 = 8.3 lbs of 12-0-0 fertilizer.</p>

<p>Note that the calculation for phosphorus and potassium is a little trickier, since the weights in the NPK number are the amount of phosphate and potash and not the pure element. See <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/1940/51"">this answer</a> for details.</p>

<p>@kevinsky's comment about varying requirements for different vegetables is a good point. You probably shouldn't make a blanket application over your entire garden. Check a good gardening reference for the relative amounts of nitrogen required by various plants and add more for plants that want it and less for plants that don't. Squash and corn, in particular, do well with extra. But if you give extra nitrogen to your tomatoes then you'll end up with a lot of foliage and not much fruit.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that you can reduce your long-term need for nitrogen amendments somewhat by increasing the organic matter content in your soil. The organic matter acts like a sponge, absorbing nitrogen and releasing it for plants gradually over time.</p>

<p>Lastly, be aware the nitrogen is volatile -- if you add the full amount at the beginning of the planting season, you may lose it into the air or it may wash away into the soil. Soil type is an important factor because sandy soils will tend to lose nutrients faster than clay soils. It's definitely a better idea to add half the amount at the start and then side-dress a month or two later.</p>

"What vegetable/fruits plants will rabbits not eat?","10632","","<p>I have an area for a few raised beds were it would be impractical to secure against rabbits. What can I plant there that they won't be interested in?</p>

<p>I'm assuming they won't eat any berry types, but what about newly planted tomatoes and other kinds of vegetables?</p>
","<p>Really, rabbits are far less picky than humans when it comes to eating plants, so there aren't many that no rabbits eat, that we would. However, there are a few that rabbits generally avoid (at least for me):</p>

<p><strong>Vegetable Beds:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Tomato</li>
<li>Squash</li>
<li>Cucumber</li>
<li>most melons (they eat watermelons here)</li>
<li>Corn (needs protection when young, but grows tall)</li>
<li>Sunflowers (needs protection when young, but grows tall)</li>
<li>Peppers, normally. One time a rabbit kept eating the plants of someone I know, so this one's debatable; depends on the variety and the rabbit.</li>
<li>Potatoes</li>
<li>Onions (usually, especially strong ones)</li>
<li>Garlic</li>
<li>Leeks</li>
<li>Artichokes (only because they're spiny; hungry rabbits will eat them if there isn't anything else</li>
<li>Many herbs</li>
<li>Rhubarb</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Woody Fruit:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The genus <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubus"" rel=""nofollow""><em>rubus</em></a> (brambles) because of the spines.</li>
<li>Thorny gooseberries (trained high - rabbits eat the leaves)</li>
<li>Juneberry (<em>Amelanchier</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know very many fruit plants they won't gnaw, but some berry plants can be trained as a standard, and a vinyl tree guard (or similar) used to keep them from gnawing. Where I am (and you aren't), you have to protect the trunk much higher than you'd think, because in winter (when they're eating bark), they can walk on top of whatever snow may be on the ground. Again, probably not a problem in Texas, but I'm including it to be less localized.</p>

","<p>I volunteered at a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maplelawn"">heritage garden</a> (shameless plug for a place worth visiting) that had old crab apple and their bark did exfoliate or peel in little scales about two inches high by an inch wide.  This is normal for mature crab apple and apple trees.  What is in your pictures doesn't look like a mature tree with a trunk over eight inches in diameter and neither is the peeling all over the trunk.
Given the diversity of the apple family it's hard to say whether this is normal or not. The real question is: does the tree look healthy and bear fruit? </p>

<p>If it does then watch and wait is my advice.  If the tree lacks healthy new growth or fruit then call an arborist for an on-site opinion.</p>

<p>Edit: from the additional pictures I can see that there is healthy bark underneath the peeling area and that the tree does not look stressed. I am in agreement with @Ed Staub that this is normal for apple trees. Dropping bark allows the tree to drop pests and diseases in the top layer.</p>

"How to care for a large redwood?","10478","","<p>I just bought a home in the CA bay area.  My front yard is dominated by a large redwood tree that seems in good health.  I really love the way it looks.  By large I mean 5-6 stories in height, planted most likely in the late 40s.  The tree is somewhat close to my front porch in that eventually some of the branches will probably grow out to touch the roof.  I assume I'll need to have those trimmed back.</p>

<p>I don't know how much tree trimmers know about redwoods specifically, so I want to be knowledgeable myself.  A trimmer recently recommended thinning out the branches and getting rid of the lower hanging branches.  I kind of like the lower branches (still above my head) as it feels more forest'y.  I worry about thinning reducing the shade.</p>

<p>What kinds of trimming should I be doing regularly other than keeping branches away from my roof?  Are there any other things I need to worry about with an old redwood: watering, pests or anything else?</p>
","<p>I have never pruned a redwood but their cultural needs are easy to list:</p>

<ul>
<li>rich acid moist soil</li>
<li>shaded and cool roots</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately this is not a common environment in urban areas. Redwoods that are under stress can come under attack from several fungal pathogens. You can take these steps to keep the tree healthy:</p>

<ul>
<li>enhance soil moisture by top dressing with rich compost twice a year, spring and fall, from a foot from the base of the trunk to the drip line to a depth of one quarter to a half inch.</li>
<li>if possible consider increasing the moisture by sloping adjacent ground so that rainwater goes towards the tree.  Do not change the grade around the tree.</li>
<li>do not prune the lower branches as they shade the roots unless they are dead or crossing each other</li>
<li>redwoods are surface rooted with most roots within twelve inches of the surface. Compaction of the soil from foot or vehicle traffic ""can be devastating"". Minimize traffic near the tree. If grass or other plants are growing under the tree remove them and replace with a mulch  (redwood bark is good, but ironic).</li>
</ul>

<p>To summarize from <a href=""http://www.ufei.org/files/pubs/Redwoods.pdf"">this publication</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Redwoods in the landscape appear to do best when their lower laterals
  are left intact, the lower branches and trunk are shaded and their
  root zones are mulched. When given these cultural advantages the trees
  can thrive even in hot inland valleys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, there is another matter to consider.  Redwoods live hundreds of years and get very tall.  Local weather conditions across North America are best described as changeable.  To have such a tall tree growing that close to your house when there is a chance of high winds could be trouble. What could the consequences be if the tree fell on your house?
You may wish to check with your house insurance if you are covered for this possibility and it definitely makes sense to ensure the health of your redwood.</p>

<p>Update: 
Climate - Wisconsin so colds and hots. Rocks do currently have landscape fabric down but it could easily be 20+ years.</p>

<p>I am looking for a very basic list of pros cons. A few things to get it started</p>

<li>Resistance to weeds </li>

<li>Aesthetic - home value? </li>
<li>Environmental Impact?</li>
<li>Benefits/Cons of having it close to foundation?</li>
</ol>
","<p>I'm not a fan of stone/gravel mulch. I use it in one spot for a specific reason but it's hard to keep it looking clean. Weeds will still grow in it or past it. Either because the landscape fabric underneath deteriorates or because organic material falls onto the gravel and collects in the spaces between the gravel and allows seeds to germinate.</p>

<p>If you want to clean it well you basically have to set up a sifting operation like an 1850's prospector. Since it doesn't decompose topping it off with fresh gravel just creates a deeper mulch bed. As the landscape fabric wears out the gravel can sink into the soil so when that happens I guess you can top off then.</p>

<p>It doesn't really suppress weeds as well as organic mulches. It's mostly the landscape fabric that does that. If you ever want to change it it's a giant PITA.</p>

<p>The microclimate around the gravel bed will be warmer and retain heat longer which may cause issues with some plants or require more frequent watering.</p>

<p>I'm not a big fan of generic <em>wood mulch</em> either. For wood mulch I prefer cedar mulch because that's one of the better choices available around me. The oils in it can repel insects such as termites, <a href=""http://blog.pennlive.com/gardening/2009/08/counterattacking_artillery_fun.html"" rel=""nofollow"">cedar mulch is less likely to harbor artillery fungus</a> (as does cypress and pine park mulch), it lasts a long time, I don't have to worry as much about scrap pressure treated wood or toxic paint winding up in the mulch and I like the smell when I put it down.</p>

<p>A 1/2 cubic foot bag of gravel costs about $4. For that same $4 I can get a high quality 3 cubic foot bag of cedar mulch. It's lighter, easier to work with, suppresses weeds when put on thick enough, breaks down to add nutrients to the soil. Insulates the soil and retains moisture and I like the way it looks. </p>

<p>You put on about 3"" the first year, then add about 1"" every year, or even every other year depending on your climate. After a month or so the color fades to grey. You can get died mulches but the color only lasts about a season and will need to be topped off to look new or you can get some mulch dyes to refresh the color.</p>

<p>Haven't had an issue with either washing away but the cedar mulch seems to hold better on slopes.</p>

<p>Aesthetics... when done properly stone mulch can have a very dramatic and high end look. When it starts to look like crap then it looks like crap. Organic mulches are easy to refresh and have looking like new by only topping off a bit every year.</p>

<p>Costs for a 100 square foot bed with 3"" of mulch:</p>

<p>Stone: Initial cost 50 bags * $4 = $200 though 50 bags is a lot to transport bulk pricing would be cheaper.</p>

<p>Cedar: Initial cost 9 bags * $4 = $36
Top off with 3 bags every year = $12 a year.
It would take over 12 years for the cedar mulch to cost as much as the stone. Are you sure you're not going to want to rearrange your landscape, want to change color scheme in mulch or will still like the same look for such a long period of time?</p>

<p>Spreading around some extra mulch on top of beds to me feels a lot easier than trying to clean gravel beds.</p>

","<p>First, check for red spider mite infestation, which sometimes causes these yellow spots - they are quite difficult to see. Spray with an appropriate pesticide spray if you find them. Second, these plants are said to be sensitive to fluoride in water, so if your tapwater is fluoridated and you've been using that, this might cause those brown tips, though usually the brown tips have a yellow band on the 'live' end so to speak.</p>

<p>The other possible cause of the yellow spots is poor drainage - do you leave the plant standing in any outer container which collects water? If so, ensure you empty the container 30 minutes after watering. Water only when the surface of the compost is slightly dry to the touch, but not so dry it's shrunken from the sides of the pot, and water thoroughly. Despite not liking sitting in water, these plants don't like to dry out and do like high humidity in the air - keep away from direct heat sources, and add a pebble tray if you think it's necessary. (Pebble tray - an outer tray larger than the pot, filled with pebbles, that you keep half full of water, so the bottom of the pot is on the pebbles but above the water - the water evaporates and keeps the air round the plant more humid). Keep the plant in an even temperature as far as possible, never below 65 deg F, and, as you've already done, out of direct sunlight.</p>

<p>Lastly, check whether its pot bound - I have one of these and mine's developed dry brown patches on the leaves, largely because I haven't repotted it and the pot's way too small, so it can't hang on to enough water.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>General yellowing of foliage may be symptomatic of waterlogging, especially on heavy clay soils. Roots subjected to waterlogging are usually a blue-black colour in cross section and fall apart when teased out. Damaged roots should be removed, top growth trimmed back and the box replanted.</p>

I would definitely avoid using cow manure, as it tends to make clay soils heavier still and even less free-draining; well-rotted horse manure, on the other hand, is very good at opening up the pore structure of heavy soils, which improves drainage and aeration.</p>

"What is a good method for transplanting an established gooseberry bush?","9776","","<p>My fiancee is moving in with me, and would like to bring her <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gooseberry"">gooseberry</a> bush along, since it makes excellent jam, and the melomel (mead) that we made with the gooseberries appears to be promising as well.</p>

<p>My thought is that we should wait until it has gone dormant for the winter, cut the branches back somewhat, and then dig it up, hoping that we've got a decent root mass to above-ground mass ratio.   I'm not totally comfortable with that, but the only other established plants that I have successfully transplanted (from the ground) are bulbs and groundcover, and I assume this will work somewhat differently.   Also, gooseberry bushes are somewhat thorny, so we'll have to contend with that somehow, as well.</p>

<p>In full foliage, the bush takes up probably 6 or 8 square feet of area in the yard.   It has been in that spot for 5-7 years.   My expectation is to get it back into the ground in its new location within a day of digging it up.</p>

<p>I believe you are on the right track, thought process. Below is how I would go about moving/transplanting a mature gooseberry bush...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, if you can wait until late Winter or very early Spring to dig it up and move it, that would be ideal.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, before digging it up, spend sometime choosing an appropriate location in your landscape and preparing that location.</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gooseberries grow normally in cooler climates, so heavy mulching of the base of these plants is desirable to keep roots cool. Some shade is permissible, but heavy shade is detrimental to growth and fruiting.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Seeing as your Summer's can be pretty (brutally) hot, I would be inclined to find a location that gets full morning sun, then offers some shade from 2 or 3 o'clock onwards.</p></li>
<li><p>If the soil in your chosen location isn't organically rich and/or has poor moisture retention, take the time to dig-in plenty of organic matter (eg compost, manure, shredded fall leaves). Taking the time to do this, if needed, will pay huge dividends once you come to transplant time.</p></li>
<li><p>Me, being me, I would use compost as the mulch layer. Using compost as a mulch has the added benefit of feeding plants naturally and slowly. Also if your soil is ""poor"" using a compost mulch layer will help improve the soil over time (as you add a ""fresh"" layer, once to twice a year).</p>

<ul>
<li>If you don't have access to homemade compost, locate a local resource and ensure you can have some on hand (enough for a 2 to 3inch / 50 to 75mm thick mulch layer) on the day you transplant.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Site Selection and Soil Preparation</strong></p>
  
  <p>Unlike most other fruit crops, currants and gooseberries tolerate partial shade and prefer a cool, moist growing area. Northern slopes with protection from direct sun are ideal. Planting along the side of a building or shady arbor is suitable as well.</p>
  
  <p>Avoid sites with poor air circulation, which increases the incidence of powdery mildew. Sloping ground alleviates this condition. Also avoid light-textured, sandy soils. Rich, well drained soils that have a high moisture holding capacity are best. Incorporate organic matter (compost, peat, or manure) to improve the soil, particularly if it is somewhat sandy. The ideal soil pH is about 6.5.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Transplant day</strong> (assuming later Winter or very early Spring)</p>

<ul>
<li>First, prune the gooseberry bush. Personally I would prune as heavily as I dare, make the physical size of the bush as small as possible, thus making manhandling of the bush as easy as possible...</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gooseberries produce fruit on 2-year-old canes, 3-year-old canes and older canes. New canes originate from the underground crown each season on vigorous plants. The younger canes are more productive, so it is desirable to remove the older, weaker canes by cutting them out at the soil line. This leaves a preponderance of the younger, more vigorous canes and encourages a continuous replacement of new canes. Young plants, therefore, require little pruning for the first three or four years.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You should prune established currant and gooseberry shrubs to encourage vigor and fruit production, improve sun penetration into the bush, and maintain good air circulation to minimize disease. During the first three years of growth, allow four or five canes to develop per year, removing only weak or damaged wood. Beginning in the fourth year, prune out the oldest wood annually in early spring before growth begins. In addition, remove any weak new growth. A mature bush should have 9 to 12 canes once pruning is completed. Fruit is produced on one-, two-, and three-year-old wood.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>After you've finished pruning, if the ground isn't wet, soak the soil around the bush.</p></li>
<li><p>Then dig all the way around the bush, dig as far out from the it as you can, you want to limit the damage as much as possible to the root system (which is shallow).</p></li>
<li><p>Work a tarp under and around the root-ball, this will help keep the root-ball encased in soil during the lifting and moving processes. Then when moving the bush, pick it up (manhandle it) via the tarp.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you haven't got a tarp, pick one up beforehand and have it ready to go.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Dig the new hole only as deep as you have to ie When you put the bush in its new location it shouldn't seat deeper in the soil than it did previously. Also dig the new hole twice as wide as the root-ball you managed to remove from the ground.</p></li>
<li><p>Back fill the hole with the material you dug out (the well prepared soil you had prepared months, weeks beforehand), making sure you heel it in well as you go.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the bush is in its new home in the ground, give it a long, slow drink, you really want to water it in well.</p></li>

"What are the advantages of hydroponics?","9732","","<p>From my understanding, hydroponics is essentially growing plants without soil. Instead of soil, the plant is placed in water.</p>

<p>Are there any advantages to growing plants hydroponically? </p>

<p>Are there instances where plants can grow faster if they are grown hydroponically?</p>
","<p>There are a few 'advantages' to growing plants via hydroponics.  It is mostly just a way to grow plants in a different environment (indoors, or in a non-native environment).  Just like growing vegetables in a greenhouse wouldn't per se be 'better' than growing them in a field.  There are advantages to both: a greenhouse allows you to grow things that aren't naturally suited to your environment, whereas a field would allow you to a much larger quantity of plants per cost.  Hydroponic is just another way to suit a person's tastes/needs in a growing environment.  </p>

<p>Here are a few things hydroponics can accomplish or accomplish easier than other methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>Control over nutrient uptake (can adjust in water supply)</li>
<li>Grow plants indoors without the use of natural light</li>
<li>No hassle with soil setup and testing</li>
<li>Generally weed free environment (if done indoors)</li>
<li>More plants can fit into a smaller space</li>
<li>Easier harvesting</li>
</ul>

<p>There is some debate as to growth speed and nutrient retention.  Generally, grow speed is faster in a hydroponic system.  This is somewhat due to the increased nutrients supplied in a water supply and the roots of a plant can directly absorb them.  However, in a soil based system, if a fertilizer or nutrient is applied regularly it can have the same effect so just because the system is hydroponic in nature, doesn't necessarily mean your yield will always be more.  </p>

<p>Here are a few disadvantages over more conventional growing methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>No soil buffer.  If the hydroponics system fails, plants will die much faster.</li>
<li>Increased energy cost (if using growth lights and air pumps)</li>
<li>Water-based pathogens can be easily introduced</li>
<li>More complex handling/tracking of nutrient solutions</li>
<li>Much higher cost to start up system compared to traditional methods (need to purchase nutrients and supplements to keep plants alive)</li>
</ul>

<p>Just a note: hydroponics isn't necessarily growing plants in water, a substrate may still used (such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlite"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">perlite</a> or fired clay pellets).  The difference is that the plant is not absorbing any nutrients from the substrate, it's getting it all from the water.</p>

","<h1>Bulbs</h1>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulb"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bulbs</a> are plant storage organs generally grown underground, consisting of a short stem (the basal plate), from which grow overlapping, swollen leaves or leaf bases. The top growth emerges from the bulb center. Here's an example:</p>

"How far apart do raspberries and blackberries need to be planted?","9642","","<p>Most horticultural guides I've read recommend not planting blackberries and raspberries near each other because they will spread diseases between each other. How far apart do they need to be to prevent contamination? Is the opposite side of the yard (e.g. 30 feet) enough? Or do I need to try to figure out a way to incorporate one of them into my front yard landscaping?</p>
","<p>The likelihood of disease is not more likely when planted in close quarters, but if one species contracts a disease, it will likely pass it on. To avoid this, planting them apart should do it, anywhere that no blown leaves/running soil will reach them. </p>

<p>Now I don't worry about it myself, I put everything together. Disease control in untreatable diseases just means having a fast cull reflex. :) </p>

<p>Now, another thing to consider is that blackberries (in my area) often spread by underground stems, and sucker all over the place. The raspberries don't. They are usually a bigger plant than raspberries, so might invade and outgrow them. Apparently this is the opposite of how they grow in the UK, if I read Bamboo's answer properly.</p>

"How are lilac cuttings taken?","9612","","<p>I have an old lilac bush that I would like to propagate. Suckers work, but I would like more control over amount, uniformity, and size. I had heard that they root readily from hardwood and semi-ripe cuttings, but after several failed attempts, I came here for some help. So, how are these cuttings taken?</p>
","<p>From this <a href=""http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/chiwonlee/plsc368/student/papers04/elizabethbruins/syringa.htm"">site</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Propagation by cuttings is one of the most popular ways to propagate
  lilacs. Cuttings should be taken when new green terminal shoots are
  produced. They should be four to six inches long, but should not be
  left out too long, because they will wilt easily and die. The cutting
  should be dipped in a rooting hormone like IBA (Indolebutyric acid)
  which aids the plant. The cuttings can be placed in a media with peat,
  vermiculite and perlite. Each cutting should contain 2-3 nodes, which
  are the growing points where the leaves are attached. The leaves aid
  in rooting by producing carbohydrates for the rooting plant. The
  cuttings should never be allowed to dry out and should be kept moist
  at all times. The cutting should root within 3-6 weeks. Once roots
  appear, you can place the plant outside in a desirable location.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What should be noted is that you need strong shoots that have a little bit of woodier stem and you need the strongest rooting hormone you can get.  It used to come in three strengths and I recommend the strongest.</p>

<p>Take cuttings in the spring.</p>

<p>Try various rooting mediums but constant moisture, higher humidity levels and bottom heat are required. The quote recommends an artificial soil-less mix but I would also try floral foam, glasses of water or even pure perlite.</p>

<p>The trick with cuttings is lots of humidity to compensate for the lack of roots, lots of light and air movement to prevent mould.  For many this means a greenhouse.</p>

"Why won't my pepper grow?","9603","","<p>For the past three years (since I started gardening) I've tried with no luck to grow peppers. Two years ago I was able to grow a few pepper plants (out of many) but the peppers did not get very big. I've tried almost every variety of both seed and the pre-grown variety you get from the nursery. I've tried every spot in my garden. </p>

<p>The seedlings always get about 3 inches tall and then die and the pre-grown plants always die. I think they are getting plenty of water. All my other plants (squash, tomatoes etc) do just fine.</p>

<p>What could I be doing wrong?</p>
","<p>It is difficult to come up with something that has a strong effect on peppers and not tomatoes. Don't expect your fruit to be as big as store-bought bell peppers. As with most fruit &amp; veg, most varieties simply do not get that big. (Other types like anaheims, jalapenos, etc. are more like the store varieties in size).</p>

<p>Peppers love the sun. Yes they need water but don't water log them. I give them lots of water but it is >100F outside as I type this (they dry out quickly). As for nutrients they want a well balanced fertilizer - comparable to tomatoes. I've just looked in Rosalind Creasy's ""Edible Pepper Garden"" and she says ""well balanced"" is the key. They particularly need calcium and phosphorus, but too much nitrogen will result in lots of foliage and premature pod drop (i.e. don't go overboard with the nitrogen).</p>

<p>Are there any particular symptoms such as yellow patterns on the leaves? That could be a symptom of Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV); or a particular kind of wilt/insect. The best solution for TMV is to keep all smokers away from your plants.</p>

<p>Most ailments that Creasy lists (eg. the various wilts and fungi) also affect tomatoes. Could you have a nematode problem?</p>

<p>If you think you do have a fungal or nematode problem (other than TMV), you could try growing them in a large pot. Peppers in pots generally don't do as well but you should get fruit, but make sure you fill it with store-bought compost and nothing from your garden. That should isolate them from anything that might be in your soil. You could sterilize the compost for good measure if you think you're being sold dodgy merchandise.</p>

<p>On average I find the plants generally do better than seeds, although there's less variety available. They have a head start and you don't have the random chance of germination.</p>

<p>Where are you getting your seed? My supplier must have well over a hundred different pepper varieties so ""<em>I've tried almost every variety of seed</em>"" is an exaggeration :-)  Could it be a bad supplier? Less likely with a specialist nursery, but more than likely with a grocers, and possible with the Lowes/Home Depot type place.</p>

<p>One final thought: Seedlings dieing within an inch or two could be ""damping off"", although usually it occurs before the first proper leaves come out. This is caused by fungi and oomycetes in the soil which thrive in dark, humid conditions. The solution is to use sterilized starting soil; start the seeds in a bright, well-ventilated place; and allow the soil surface to dry between waterings. Also delay fertilizing (actually I usually only fertilize once, after they've been transplanted).</p>
","719"
"Any benefit to watering whole plant (leaves and all) instead of just the soil/roots?","9586","","<p>A question I often wonder about when watering outdoor pots in the dead heat of summer. Should I just make sure the soil in the bed/pot is watered sufficiently, or is it necessary/advisable to also water the leaves and stem? My naivete makes me think that hitting the above ground plant will keep the plant cooler and reflects more of what happens when it rains, but I may be wrong.</p>
","<p>This depends. </p>

<p>If your humidity level inside is too low (often a problem is you run the Heat or AC) then plants do benefit from a misting of water around the plant to try to raise the humidity in that area of the room.</p>

<p>However, mostly you just want to water the soil beneath the plant rather than the whole thing. This is because water sitting on leaves of plants, or excess humidity around them (especially things like tomatoes) can actually lead to disease. It also provides little actual benefit to the plant.</p>

<p>Most places outdoor plants will have plenty of moisture in the air to be just fine. However, if you are in a desert or other very dry climate you may have to mist around your plant so that the humidity around the plant stays at the proper levels.</p>

<p>Is this normal? Is there something I could do to make them last more than one season?</p>
","<p>I don't have a lawn tractor, but presumably this is a lead acid battery? (i.e. similar to a car battery but smaller)</p>

<p>If so, when stored for long periods of time, they should be hooked up to a slow charger. Power requirements are minimal: what you need is more of a float charger to avoid self-discharge. (i.e. any lead acid battery charger will do, but set it to slow or float - do not use a fast charge setting)</p>

<p>A discharged lead acid battery will result in sulfur build up on the electrodes (in the form of lead sulfate). This is known as <strong>sulfation</strong>. Pulse conditioning is said to help. Also with wet batteries (i.e. not the various gel types), you can use de-sulfurization tablets in each cell which might work.  Either way, it is better to avoid <strong>sulfation</strong> in the first place. So take the battery out during winter, and keep it permanently connected to a lead acid charger.</p>

<p>Better battery sellers will keep their lead acid battery stock on a ""float charge"" like this, although they may have some on display which aren't. They will either rotate them periodically, or they are relying on stock turnover to avoid discharge problems.</p>

","<p>Palm trees don't <em>need</em> trimming, so any fronds you remove are simply to improve the aesthetics.</p>

<p>I like to cut out <em>all</em> of the older fronds all the way up to the newest, freshest growth from last year. It sounds severe, but palm trees are basically a type of grass, so it is really hard to hurt it unless you cut off the growing top, center-most shoots (don't do that).</p>

<p>For the old, woody fronds encircling the lower trunk, if you leave them, they will eventually fall off on their own. I tend to give them a good pull each year to see which are pretty much ready to come loose (I prefer the look of the bare trunk underneath), but they will come off easily in their own good time. If you want to cut them off sooner, it will not hurt the tree. Overall, Queen Palms pretty much take care of themselves.</p>

"What is the right time to water my lawn?","9513","","<p>I finally own my home and this is my first spring. I have a decent front lawn that I want to keep as green as possible. I've always been told not to water in the day as it can burn the grass (as a result of the sun). Is this true? Is it true all the time? It's a nice 75 degress out right now, will this hurt my grass if I water it now? What about when it's a hot 95?</p>

<p>Any insight or recommendations?</p>
","<p>Burning is open to debate (search this site for examples) but is probably more of an issue for delicate plants and buds, rather than tougher plants.</p>

<p>The big issue about daytime watering is that of evaporation. Here in Texas you will waste a large percentage of the water (especially if spraying) and it is against bylaws in summer in most cities.</p>

"Identifying the type of mint","9493","","<p>A friend gave me some mint, and didn't mention what type it is. How can I tell if it's spearmint, peppermint, apple mint, lemon mint, or some other variety?</p>

<p>I googled some pictures, but quite frankly, all the pictures look very similar -- four leaves growing from the center which a textured leaf and a rich, green colour.</p>

<p>Over-ground purplish stolon)</p>
","<p>Just to confuse the picture even more, there is a chocolate mint which has purplish stolons. There are, in fact, hundreds of varieties of mint, some of which are commercially grown for oil extraction or for leaf drying, and a lot of which haven't even been given names, being known as Mint 341, etc. There is a big difference in taste between spearmint and peppermint, but detecting the difference in other varieties is difficult for lots of people because it's subtle, so unless the appearance is different, it's hard to tell. I certainly can't detect any chocolate taste in chocolate mint, but then it may be called that because it has a chocolatey colour in parts. In the end, whether you use it for culinary purposes or not is down to personal taste, but all varieties are, in growth, extremely invasive plants in open ground.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Doesn't look like chocolate mint - the leaves are slightly longer and more pointed on that one, and often flushed with a brownish tinge near the leaf stalk. I note it does have dark stems though (top picture) and the leaves don't look shiny, so I'm assuming they're slightly fuzzy or hairy. Knowing what colour the flowers are might help with ID.</p>

"How do I fix an area of grass that was ruined using a vinegar/salt treatment of dandelions?","9492","","<p>Following some advice from the web, I boiled vinegar and salt and applied it to some dandelions in our lawn. I probably should have used less of it though - I poured 2-3 tablespoons on the dandelions. Now the grass has yellowed around each dandelion - about a 3-inch radius.</p>

<p>Will the grass come back in the future? Have I permanently ruined these spots? What's the best way to fix them up?</p>
","<p>Vinegar acts as a desiccant. It dissolves the protective coating on the leaves of the plant causing it to dry out and die if the temperatures are warm enough. It usually doesn't destroy the roots and sometimes the plant may come back if there is enough energy in the root system. Dandelions have a large taproot which makes them difficult to kill with something like vinegar. The effect of vinegar will not persist.</p>

<p>Salt is also a desiccant. It either binds moisture up in the soil, preventing the plant from getting it or it draws the moisture out of the roots when in the soil. Without water the plant will die. Salt will persist in the soil for a long time.</p>

<p>These are non-selective methods that will kill any plants that they are applied to. That includes not just the weeds but also any non-target plants, such as your grass, that come in contact with the application.</p>

<p>A better solution to remove dandelions from lawns is to use one of the weed pullers that are designed for weeds with long taproots such as dandelions. They're effective at pulling out the entire weed including the taproot and are easy to use. See my review of the <a href=""http://www.organiclawndiy.com/2009/10/new-weed-hound-elite-size-does-matter.html"">Weed Hound Elite</a> for an example.</p>

<p>As to restoring the dead grass.... I would dig out the affected area to try and get as much of the salted soil as possible removed down to a depth of 6"" and fill in the hole with a mix of top soil and good compost (about 1:1 mix) and water it thoroughly to try and flush whatever salt may be left down below the root zone. It takes about 6"" of water to reduce the salt content by 50%, 12"" for 80% and 24"" for 90% reduction according to this Colorado State Extionsion paper on <a href=""http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/crops/00503.html"">Managing Saline Soils</a>.

"Do I need to lay landscape fabric under ground-cover plants to prevent weeds growing?","9484","","<p>I have a large hillside area in Pennsylvania, where usually weeds are out of control. For the next year, I am thinking about using some kind of ground-cover plants such as English Ivy to cover the area. I would like to know if I need to lay landscape fabric before doing so. Can it prevent weeds from coming back next year?</p>
","<p>Think twice, no three times before planting English Ivy. It is considered an invasive species in the US, and on the ""noxious species"" list of 46 States. Basically, plant that stuff and you risk it becoming a much bigger problem than any weed problem you have at the moment! Garden centers should be shot for stocking that stuff.</p>

<p>Sorry, had to say that!  Ground cover is the best long term way of keeping weeds down. And it looks good too. Just choose something native.</p>

<p>Landscape fabric is all the rage at the moment and on another question I suggested it for strawberries, and I have used it under edging stones. However, I am not inclined to use it over large areas. First it does not rot down (or not quickly enough - our city used it under a retaining wall at the front here and it hasn't rotted after almost 10 years). Next, you have to poke holes in it for the roots. This might be fine for shrubs, but it would not work for ground cover that spreads (which is what you really want). So I would be inclined not to use it unless you can find a type that rots in, say, 3 years to give short term protection only.</p>

<p>What can you use instead? Aggressively weed first, including all roots that you can get. Weedkillers <em>might</em> be an option (I know a rainforest restoration project that starts with a treatment of Round-Up!). Plant your ground cover plants, and then mulch. Be aggressive with weed removal when you see them (invest in a hoe if necessary) - this is what I have done with my pepper beds and currently do with my xeriscape bed (we have an aggressive grass problem but one year of aggressive weeding complete with root removal and the second year is much easier).</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it now inedible because of the flowering?</li>
<li>How do I prevent the flowering at such a tiny stage in future?</li>
</ul>
","<p>It <em>may</em> be inedible, but it's worth giving a leaf a taste to see if it is not too bitter. If it doesn't taste too bad, harvest the whole lot and eat some baby spinach salads.</p>

<p>There may be some spinach varieties which are more resistant to bolting, but it's probably a better idea to simply let nature do what it's going to do. Some years are warm, and some crops (e.g. spinach) don't like warm weather. A few years ago it was very cold and wet in June here and everybody had trouble with strawberries and tomatoes; there's not much you can do about the weather.</p>

<p>Something you can try is to locate your spinach (and other cool-weather crops) in a microcliimate where it stays cooler: perhaps where there's shade from the midday sun, a low area that cools off quickly at night, or near water that helps to moderate the temperature. You could also try putting some shade over the rows of spinach, e.g. a lath screen <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21414/21414-h/21414-h.htm#Page_17"" rel=""nofollow"">as shown in this book</a>.</p>

<p>You can also hedge your bets: plant a variety of crops that are tolerant of different sorts of weather. For alternate greens, when you plant your spinach, start some lettuce (which still doesn't like heat, but is generally slower to bolt in my experience), and chard a couple of weeks later (which holds up really well to the summer heat).</p>

  <p>Freshly fallen needles, the type that are normally used as mulch, are
  slightly acidic when fresh, but within approximately three weeks of
  falling from the trees, leach a solution that is about the equivalent
  of rainwater</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does the answer depend on the local soil chemistry or the species of pine needles or something else?</p>
","<h3>No, in your lifetime, normal amounts of pine needles will not measurably acidify your soil.</h3>

<p>They are somewhat acidic, and acidify soil over long periods of time, unless the soil base is extremely alkaline. They don't acidify soil more than other deciduous tree leaves, and oak leaves in particular (they have a pH of 4.5 to 4.7). Rain does leach the acid out, but the amount that is contained in the leaves isn't that much in comparison to the amount of acid produced during the decomposition process. Basically, if the only source of OM is pine needles, yes, they will build an acidic soil (the topsoil in most old coniferous forests), but not more acidic than that which was created by a hardwood forest.</p>

<p>It usually takes a very concentrated acid to usefully change the pH of soil in garden beds. Pine needles just aren't that effective, and while they build the soil and make a great mulch, even for acid loving plants, they don't change the pH fast enough to be of any use to that end.</p>

<p>Also of note: My neighbor mulches his blueberries with lawn clippings, has been doing so for years, and has some of the healthiest blueberry plants in the area. </p>

<p>See <a href=""http://www.gardenmyths.com/pine-needles-acidify-your-soil/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a> (no scientific backup, but or the most part accurate)</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Are pine needles acidic?</h2>
  
  <p>It turns out that fresh pine needles taken from a tree are “acidic”. By the time a pine needle gets old and is ready to drop off the tree it is barely acidic. After a few days on the ground, it loses its acidity completely. The brown pine needles you will likely collect from the forest are not acidic<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
  
  <p>But, but , but, you say – surely over many years, the acidity must build up. This seems very reasonable and so some scientists tested this theory. They collected soil samples from underneath 50 year old pines. They also collected nearby soil samples where no pines had been growing during the same time period. They found that the pH of both soil samples were the same. The growing pines did NOT acidify the soil even after 50 years<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>
  
  <h2>Why does acid rain not acidify the soil?</h2>
  
  <p>Southern Ontario can be considered to be a large limestone rock. Our soil has been created over millions of years from this limestone. Limestone is alkaline and so our soil is also alkaline. Mine has pH of about 7.4.</p>
  
  <p>Consider this. Rain that has no pollution in it has a pH of 5.6. You might expect it to have a pH of 7.0 since that is the pH of pure water. However, as rain falls, it absorbs CO2 from the air. When you add CO2 to water you create a weak acid (carbonic acid) and that acid has a pH of about 5.6. Keep in mind that this is taking place without pollution. Add in the pollution and we get acid rain. The rain falling in central Ontario is about 4.5.</p>
  
  <p>For millions of years, Ontario has had rain fall with a pH of at 5.6. In all that time this amount of acid has not been enough to neutralize the alkalinity of our limestone rock. As the acidic rain hits the ground, it neutralizes (dissolves) a bit of limestone, but the amount is extremely small. It will take another billion or so years before it changes the soil pH.</p>
  
  <p>I have used Ontario as an example, because I know it best. The same principle applies to most soils. It takes huge amounts of acid to change the pH of soil.</p>
  
  <p>Before I close, let me say that adding pine needles to your garden is a good thing. They are organic and will help enrich your soil. They just won’t make it acidic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup>(1)</sup> Pine needles actually retain their acidity, but the misinformation does not detract from the message.</p>

<p><sup>(2)</sup> This is why almost any land that has been turned over to cultivation was initially heavily limed. It mostly started out acidic. There are exceptions, though.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://gardening.about.com/b/2011/03/30/do-pine-needles-acidify-soil.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some gardeners shy away from using pine needles as a mulch or in their compost. The needles have a relatively acidic pH and  we worry that they will alter the pH of the soil.  According to soil scientist Lee Reich, pine needles  will indeed  probably lower the pH, but only temporarily.  Soil pH may trend slightly acidic no matter what organic material is decomposing, but it eventually moves back into the neutral range, as the decomposition process completes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I entirely agree with the part 'soil pH may trend slightly acidic no matter what organic material is decomposing'. It's very true. Decomposition causes acidity, and most plant matter starts as acidic. It just takes far too much acid to cause a big change, that pine needles don't need to be treated as more acidic than other leaves.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://homeguides.sfgate.com/pine-needles-vs-peat-moss-33689.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although pine needles are very acidic, they do not necessarily lower soil pH. As noted in the Columbus Telegram, pine needles actually have very little effect on the pH levels of surrounding soil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.walterreeves.com/gardening-q-and-a/leavesneedles-dont-acidify-soil/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: I've heard that pine needles and oak leaves cause soil to be acid. Is this true?</strong></p>
  
  <p>A: This is a gardening myth that should be put to rest. While needles and leaves from all trees may be acidic initially, they do no acidify the soil as they break down. Soil has a natural ability to buffer changes in pH. Soil acidity might increase slightly for a few weeks after leaves fall but the acidity will go away after a few months. It’s true that pines can grow in poor soil, but they didn't make the soil poor to begin with. </p>

"How can I tell when a cutting has developed roots?","8766","","<p>Is there any way to tell if a cutting has put down roots?  I've had cuttings with healthy-looking green leaves that just never create roots (despite using root powder).  I'd like to discard cuttings that don't root, but I also don't want to break off young roots by tugging on the stems.  Is there any trick for this that won't injure the plant?</p>
","<p>I assume you're talking about rooting plants in soil.</p>

<p>I'll describe the system I like to use, and tell you how I generally decide when they have roots. I imagine the way to tell may differ slightly depending on your rooting system, which is why I'm explaining mine.</p>

<ol>
<li>I pot the cutting in fresh seed-starting mix. I add a granulated 7-7-7 fertilizer and rockdust to the soil before potting, since seed-starting mix has pretty much no nutritional value. Whatever you do, don't add a fertilizer with higher nitrogen than potassium and phosphorus: this will not help the cutting root. I normally use a large cutting (4-16"" long) as opposed to a tiny one (about 2""), although this should work for tiny ones, too. I usually put 3-4 inches of stem beneath the soil, but less has worked, too.</li>
<li>I water with water that has about a teaspoon of <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B004JD6MGK"">potassium sulfate</a> per gallon of water. I actually water liberally, although that might sound counterintuitive for a cutting, and you probably don't need to water it so much. I believe the potassium sulfate makes it safer to use more water.</li>
<li>Keep the cutting away from bright light for two days.</li>
<li>Put the cutting in bright light after two days, and keep it there.</li>
<li>When the plant starts growing very noticeably, it probably has roots. (Cuttings usually won't grow much without roots; correct me if I'm wrong, but that has always seemed to be the case in my experience.) Given the bright light, this should not take a really long time (at least for the kinds of plants I've been propagating: tomatoes, peppers, watermelon, tomatillos, cucumbers).</li>
</ol>

<p>If you don't use potassium sulfate you can certainly <em>expect</em> the cutting to wilt after two or three days. However, it should perk up again within a few more days, and by then it likely has roots. However, if you expose the cutting to bright light before two days have passed, it will likely wither fast and not recover, or else be stunted for a while.</p>

<p>I like to use cuttings from indoor plants to avoid outdoor pathogens and insects (like aphids).</p>

<p>The main obstacle I've found in rooting cuttings is damping off disease. This is why I use fresh seed-starting mix (to avoid the pathogens). I've heard sprinkling cinnamon on top of the soil helps, as an alternative to seed-starting mix, but I haven't tried this yet. I do know, however, that 2700k CFL bulbs help to ward off damping off, as does increased sunlight. So if you make sure some of the light you use on the third day is 2700k (not all of the light, though), it will probably increase your survival rates.</p>

<p>Removing lots of leaves from your cutting prior to potting is not necessary if you keep it out of bright light for two days. Otherwise, it's pretty much essential, so as to simulate a less bright environment.</p>

<p>So, with my method, you just tell if it has roots by whether it's growing or not. Also, the lack of damping off pathogens will greatly influence the odds of inevitable roots. Using my method above, I have never had damping off with my cuttings, and I have had a 100% success rate, so far, which I understand is remarkable. I don't guarantee you'll have a 100% success rate with this method. Without this method I have had maybe one out of twelve cuttings survive (including cuttings rooted in water, which also succumbed to damping off after potting, notwithstanding their elaborate roots), and then the only ones that survived had bright light on the soil to prevent damping off. Bright light on the soil may actually be all you need, but I would need to experiment with infected soil more to be sure, and it's perhaps a task to get bright light on the soil without getting it on the leaves the first two days. Maybe cinnamon would help there instead.</p>

<p>I would further note that <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B004JD6MGK"">potassium sulfate</a> will likely greatly increase your success rates, and rooting speed, too. I recommend it if you're into cuttings. I imagine it speeds root growth. It certainly makes plants stronger.</p>

<p>You do not need hormone rooting powder with this method (at least  for tomatoes, peppers, tomatillos, cucumbers and watermelons). You may or may not need it for other stuff.</p>

<p>As an alternative to this method, if you're taking cuttings of houseplants, like spider plants, golden pothos, aloe vera, ivy, creeping Charlie, wandering Jew, Christmas cactus, Easter cactus, and such, in my experience, rooting them in water and potting directly into potting soil afterward works reasonably well (at least it did when I was a teenager when I tried it last). When rooting in water you can see the roots to know they have roots, of course. Potting soil doesn't work so well with vegetables by comparison, probably due to the higher nitrogen content. I don't know if the potting soil I used as a teenager was pre-fertilized.</p>

<p>It should be noted that seed-starting mix and potting soil are not the same thing, even though they look pretty much the same.</p>

"Can I grow a dwarf avocado tree in my climate?","8652","","<p>I'm looking into getting some potted plants since I have a patio at my apartment; one plant I'm interested in is the avocado. However, I live in northeastern Ohio. It looks like bacon avocado trees can withstand frost well, but can it be dwarfed and still produce fruit? Would another variety work better? Should I give up and find another tree?</p>
","<p>The <a href=""http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/#"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">latest USDA zone map</a> places Ohio in a zone where the minimum temperature could be as low as -15 degrees F.  No avocado tree will take that so you would need to bring it indoors during  the winter which will limit how big a pot you can put it in and the maximum size you can let it grow. I'm just speculating here but anything taller than six feet and one hundred and fifty pounds could be classed as unmanageable to move indoors in the winter.</p>

<p>You can dwarf many trees but I have found that avocados resist growing multiple stems. See my answer <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/2172/is-it-too-late-to-pinch-back-my-avocado-plant"">here</a>. It is challenging to get more than one stem even on a plant three to four feet tall.  Repeated cutting back hard might work if you have a lot of light.</p>

<p>I found this <a href=""http://www.avocado.org/grow-your-own-tree/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">organization</a> which is just about avocados.  I note their statement that ""While it is true that you can grow a tree from an avocado seed, keep in mind that a tree grown from seed will be very different from its parent variety and may take 7-15 years to begin producing fruit. Fruit from a tree grown from seed tends to have different flavor characteristics than their parent variety.""</p>

<p>So yes, if you have patience, you can grow an avocado as a potted patio plant.  However it is likely it will take a long time to get any fruit.</p>

","<p>This looks to be <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracaena_fragrans"" rel=""nofollow"">Dracaena fragrans</a> 'Massangea' or the mass cane. It is a very popular tropical plant from Africa.  In the wild this plant reaches 15 m (49 ft) but specimens grown indoors can be easily kept at ceiling height (about 2 m or 6 to 8 ft).</p>

<p>Your plant has a red waxy substance on the end of the cane due to how it is grown.  A typical production cycle for this plant is for it to be grown outside in Central America, Costa Rica is a common origin.  The plant is allowed to grow to twenty or thirty feet and then chain sawed into various lengths.  The trunks are then shipped to Florida in containers and potted up. Growers will pack three or four trunks of varying lengths into one pot and a sealant is put on the end of each trunk to prevent rot.  </p>

<p>The mass cane has the ability to start new growth from the woody trunks so a grower can start from a trunk with no roots or leaves and have a saleable product in less than a year.</p>

<p>So....what does this have to do with caring for your plant?</p>

<ul>
<li>each trunk is competing with the others for limited growing area in the pot.  It is common for the smallest trunk to die after being outgrown by the others.  Good diffuse light, turning the pot regularly and even watering practices help.</li>
<li>if it is new your plant is likely to have a poorly developed root system in comparison to the amount of foliage.  Again, good watering practices help.  Water thoroughly and let the top third of the soil dry out, do not let it sit in standing water.</li>
<li>your plant can be rejuvenated or kept to a certain height by cutting back the foliage at the stem.  New buds will erupt from the stem when it is in good light.</li>
</ul>

<p>The most successful Mass Canes I maintained were over twenty years old in pots about 20 inches in diameter. They flowered, were firmly rooted and generally unkillable. The secret seemed to be that they had been re potted in a clay based soil which provided greater support and a more durable medium than the soil less potting mixes that are commonly used.</p>

"How to protect strawberries from ""predators""","8604","","<p>I'm starting to prepare my gardening year and I'm wondering what the most efficient and organic way is to protect strawberries from birds and slugs. </p>

<p>I'm not at all against sharing a part of my fruit with the wild-life in my garden, but last year it was more like they have shared some 20 per cent with me.</p>

<p>For birds I was thinking about some meshed-cover but I'm worried that this will stop insects from doing their job because they won't be able to see the flowers.</p>

<p>For slugs I had the impression that wood-ash was blocking them. I sprinkled some ash over the bed in April and the first slugs only appeared in June.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: It worked. I built a wooden frame over which I stretched a 1.5x1.5cm meshed net in a way that a bird should be able rebound - insect could get inside doing their job. </p>

<p>Regarding the slugs I tried to put large garden snails inside because I was told they are eating the eggs of slugs. Maybe works a little bit... Also I planted shallots between the - which seemed to have no effect.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>: The shallots have an impact which is that the slugs seems to prefer their leaves instead of the strawberry fruits.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1kBzim.jpg"" alt=""""></p>
","<p>Soft fruit can be protected with taut mesh nets. By stretching them over a wooden frame one can lift the whole contraption off the fruit and get to it for weeding or picking. The taut net can be big enough for any insect to get through as caterpillars from butterflies are not a problem here, but I found that birds would often get caught up in loose ones (draped over wire poles) and be found dead the next morning, which is quite disappointing for some young child to find. The net should be able to support a domestic cat in weight and allow birds that don't see the net to bounce off without getting tangled up.</p>

<p>As for slugs I use organic pellets based on ferric phosphate which is promoted by the organic farmers and the suggestions on the label. A few years ago I poisoned my cat with ordinary slug pellets when he ate a frog in the back garden. He did survive but it did make him very ill, so think what they do to wildlife. I've been told that one ordinary pellet can kill an elephant! I'm not sure if it's true but I wouldn't like to try it.</p>

<p>Commercial growers have been trying with off the ground techniques and grow them in an open drain pipe laid on its side, making it easier to pick and apparently water too. The added bonus is that the fruit is off the ground and no need for straw or chemicals for slugs etc. as they can't reach them! They also grow them in polytunnels so birds are not a problem either. That's the way the farmers grow them anyway.   </p>

"Should I Repot a Tall and Spindly Jade Plant?","8589","","<p>I have a Jade plant that was grown for me from a cutting about 5 years ago. Since that time, I've propagated another plant from a branch and I now have two healthy plants.</p>

<p>My concern is that my first plant is now starting to look pretty tall and top heavy. Which is not very aesthetically pleasing. There is a single trunk which grows up about 10"" with very few leaves left. Most of them have fallen off due to physical trauma (the plant has been moved a LOT). At 10"" the plant splits into several healthy branches, which are very attractive.  The plant needs to be repotted, and while I'm doing that, I'd like to try to address the aesthetics.  I'd like to try to save the top of the plant, but lower it down 5 or so inches so that it doesn't look quite so awkward.</p>

<p>I'm considering two different options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lopping off the top of the plant (the pretty part) and sticking the bottom inch or so of the barren trunk into new soil, in the hopes that it roots and starts a new plant.  Then my original plant will grow out new branches lower down, and I'll be left with two, more attractive looking jade plants. My major concern with this approach is that the roots will not grow quickly enough to support the top of the plant, and it will die.</li>
<li>Repotting the plant, but potting it about 2-3 inches further down into the soil, and letting roots grow out of the trunk, keeping only the main plant.</li>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Breaking off the 3-4 lower most leaves when repotting and trying to propagate them as new plants in the same pot. If they survive and fill out nicely, then it could make the whole thing look fairly attractive.</li>

","<p>That's a teeny tiny pot for that size jade. For true house bound plants, you want to incrementally increase the size of the pot each year so that the medium gets filled with feeder roots. If you just put a small plant in a big pot, the roots will grow outward, and then start growing round and round the pot, this leaves a huge amount of unused soil which is going to waste and not feeding your plant.</p>

<p>I'd leave the plant as is, but increase the pot size by 1 inch this year and continue to do so at the beginning of each new growing season (about now for the northern hemisphere). In addition, I would lop the top of the main stem to encourage branching. Your plant will pick up more nutrients and will start to branch out and fill out a bit more below.</p>

<p>Think of jades as kinda like basil in this manner, the more you prune the main stem, the more bushy it becomes, if you just trim leaves then it will grow tall and leggy.</p>

<li>they are attracted to the new growth. Avoid pruning live branches more than once a year, so that the cycles of growth are uniform and short. Once the leaves harden, the pest will not be able to mine the leaves. </li>
<li>Do not prune damaged leaves since undamaged areas of leaves continue to produce food. </li>
<li>Do not apply nitrogen fertilizer in summer and fall when leafminer populations are high and growth will be severely damaged.</li>
<li>Remove water sprouts that develop on branches and above the graft union on the trunk and might act as a site for the moths to lay eggs . Suckers should always be removed.
Chemical Control</li>
<li>Many insecticides registered for residential use do not effectively control citrus leafminer, because they have difficulty reaching the larvae inside the mines.</li>

"Mushrooms in the grass","8447","","<p>I live in Phoenix, AZ and had some grass (sod) laid in the yard 3 weeks ago. Now, each day, clumps of mushrooms are now popping up all over the lawn.</p>

<p>How did the mushrooms get in there?</p>

<p>How can I find out if these mushrooms are poisonous? I have small children who might eat them -- I don't want to try them. </p>

<p>[Thanks to everyone for your awesome answers, I wish I could mark them all as correct.]</p>
","<p>Are you sure that they are mushroom? How is their form and colour?
Cold you give any photo?</p>

<p>Mushrooms are thousands of types and form, shapes, colour and so on are fondamental to identificate them. The most visible fungi are <strong>symbiont with a tree</strong>, of which absorbs nutrients through the roots, providing in exchange nutrients and immune help. 
Sure you put some grass coming from the base of a tree, the hyphae of fungi were already inside the ground or tangled with the roots of grass.</p>

<p><strong>The only real way to recognize</strong> the good mushrooms from poisonous mushrooms <strong>is to know them</strong>. Can not do otherwise. Therefore, you should call your Mycological Office of Health and show them your mushrooms and ask for identification. Do not trust the friend who says he knows everything, ask the experts.</p>

<p>Before remove it, try to identify it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the mushrooms are small and white, with thin stems, do not run the risk of eating them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Langermania gigantea</strong> If they are round and white likes small balls, are ""vescie"" (typical of meadows), very good in the pan. Choose those perfectly white, inside and out. They are called mushrooms deer.

<li><p><strong>Coprinus disseminatus</strong> If they are small, with thin stems, and are made as semi-closed umbrella, of medium brown color, arranged in a scattered way, are ""coprini"", often highly poisonous.

<p>I leave here because I'm making assumptions, in groups of fungi that grow in the meadow, in layers of grass that we do not know where they come from.</p>

<p>I could put a series of photos, but there are thousands of species, would take too much space throughout the site.
It's definitely better get you a picture (well, many photos from many points of view, depending on the size and stage of development, and also opening up the land and showing hyphae).</p>

<p>There are very poisonous fungi and wonderful mushrooms and fine. First of harvesting all, you'll want to see if you have valuable mushrooms in your garden. Or a danger.</p>

<p>If we prove they are poisonous (meanwhile keep away dogs and children) you can sprinkle the lawn with an antifungal, maybe periodically until final disinfection.</p>

<p>Really you wouldn't wait a bit, and seeing if you have something of valuable? Then, why you plant fruit trees in your garden? </p>

<p><strong>You NEVER can be poisoned by touching</strong>, and how taste it without touching?
(But you <strong>NEVER TASTE</strong> what you don't know !!)</p>

<p>But yes, mistakens identifications are dangerous. That's why here in Italy, when we aren't sure, we have <strong>Mycological Centers in the Offices of Health</strong> that can help.</p>

<p>I know mushrooms perfectly. But always I ask a conferme to them, just for more surety. </p>

<p>But I do not ever deny the casual pleasure to find something good. Or just nice. Or just new. And, as an amateur herbalist, to make new discoveries for the sheer pleasure of discovering.</p>

"Getting gardening stakes in stony ground","8399","","<p>I need to get some stakes into the ground surrounding my garden, as my neighborhood has large populations of deer.  However, the ground is pretty stony, so just physically forcing the stakes down into the ground is nearly impossible, as I can't get deeper than 2 or 3 inches, which isn't deep enough to support the stakes.  </p>

<p>What techniques or tools can I use to get the stakes deep enough without brute physical force?</p>
","<p>First: have you tried using a post driver <a href=""http://amzn.com/B000QI3LD4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">like this one</a>? I've got really rocky ground too, and I know what you mean about getting a hammer on it. The post driver may help you get your force directed into the stake properly.</p>

<p>If you want less manual labor, you could see if you can rent a <a href=""http://www.northerntool.com/shop/tools/product_200398563_200398563"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">powered post driver like this</a>. I've never used one, but I'd guess you'll want to make sure you've got really heavy duty stakes.</p>

<p>Second: when I try to drive a stake, I usually have to make 2-4 attempts on each stake. Drive it, realize I've hit a really big rock, move 6"", try again. Sometimes I use <a href=""http://amzn.com/B000QI3LD4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a digging bar</a> as a probe to find a path where I can get a stake in. It's still brute force, though.</p>

<p>Third: sorry, but I think five foot stakes aren't going to help you in your battle with deer. Unless there are <em>lots</em> of other distractions in your neighborhood, they will easily jump a five foot fence to get whatever you're growing. Last year I had two strands of electric fence with the top strand at 7' high, and 5' welded wire on the bottom. They still got in... I had to add a second perimeter of electric fence 5' high about 6' outside the inner fence before they stopped getting in.</p>

"Aloe plant is browning and the leaves are thinning","8205","","<p>I have recently received a small Aloe plant that I wasn't able to identify past the genus. It does not look healthy, some leaves have become brownish, and their ends thin, as if squeezed out.</p>

<p>The plant is an offspring that has been separated and repotted in an IKEA substrate made of coir/coconut husk. <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/2601/why-are-there-kinks-in-my-aloe-vera-leaves"">This question</a> describes the thinning and the answers identify a possible culprit in the soil, which I plan to substitute with the mix suggested in the accepted answer <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/14675/what-is-the-proper-soil-type-for-aloe"">in this question</a>.</p>

<p>What I wasn't able to find an answer to is the browning. It is likely that after repotting, the plant has received little to no sunlight for a month. Currently it receives a half day of sunlight (as much as Denmark can offer, anyway). Could the browning be related to sunlight deficiency(or excess)? </p>

I try to water according to the accepted answer <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/2591/how-much-watering-does-aloe-require"">here</a>, but the soil type might be offsetting that.

","<p>I think a couple of things are going on here. I think your other two questions will solve most of your issue. I don't know if your aloe will recover or not from the pictures. From my experience with other plants, when that many leaves look that yellow, then chances are slim that it will survive. You do have a few good leaves at the bottom. </p>

<p>So the aloe is a succulent and is very similar to a cactus. If we think of it that way, then it needs high amounts of bright sun, like a desert. It'll also have a sandy soil, which means it drains quickly. It has a thick flesh that absorbs water quickly and stores it for later use.</p>

<p>The substrate you have it in now will hold water for a very long time and it's probably started rotting the roots. On top of that, you say it isn't getting very much light. If I were you, I'd repot it very soon, with any well draining mixture you choose. You don't want anything that will hold very much water. Then you'll want to purchase a light that replicates sunlight as best you can. These usually don't cost very much. Set it about 8"" above the plant and you can do it yourself or put a cheap timer on it to do about 8-10hrs of sunlight a day. When you water it, water it a lot, but then let it dry out and be dry for several day before watering again. In the desert, they have infrequent rainfall, so you mimic that. Dry soil and no rain, then a short downpour. I'd water it till it's coming out the bottom.</p>

<p>At first, I'd only let the soil be dry for a couple of days, then stretch it to maybe a week when the plant recovers. Keep in mind that at this point it has no reserves and little root to sustain it, so baby it. However, over watering it and keeping the soil moist all the time will kill whatever roots are left and finish it off. If you do this, I think there is a decent chance it will survive.</p>

<p>I'll tell you that plants can come back from drastic damage. I was propagating a Christmas cactus, which is somewhat similar, and didn't water it often enough. It dehydrated and looked like a skeleton with the veins standing out. I kept watering it and did so more frequently and it slowly puffed back out over time and is fine now. However, pouring a pint of water on it a day would probably have killed it. Good luck and I hope it recovers.</p>

"Do coffee grounds in gardens deter cats?","8182","","<p>There are several sites that suggest using coffee grounds in the garden, to keep out cats. I haven't tried it, but there are some beds on my property which could do without cats digging around and occasionally attacking plants (beats me why they do that). I guess the best way to find out is to try it myself, but before I go around sprinkling coffee grounds on the beds, does anyone here know:</p>

<p>Are coffee grounds really effective at deterring cats from living in garden beds?</p>
","<p>It <em>may</em> work but anecdotally I have watched my barn cats lay in the compost bin that has had bags of coffee shop grounds dumped atop it.  They don't seem to be deterred by the coffee grounds.</p>

<p>Cats can be a pain in the garden.  My one barn cat will think nothing of laying down on a bunch of seedlings if it is deemed a nice place to nap.  Mine don't attack plants directly but they also don't go out of their way to avoid them.</p>

","<p>I've recently moved into a house on heavy clay (Gloucestershire, UK) and have been working the soil for just over a year now.  We decided to turn the central lawn area into several raised beds (ideal for clay-y soils with poor drainage) for a kitchen garden and leave the established shrubby borders.  The first thing I did that was enormously helpful for cultivating the vegetable area was stripping the sod and then, using a garden fork to loosen the soil, turning the sod into a fork's depth of soil.  I did this in the fall and left large clods of clay to be broken down by the winter weather and frosts.  By the next spring, I found that the clods were breaking down nicely and the worms had been at work eating the grassy material that had been incorporated. I added some bought top soil and compost or manure to the raised beds which is slowly starting to help as it breaks down. </p>

<p>If you live in a frost-free zone, or aren't digging in your lawn, in general, the best way to start 'lightening' your clay is to add organic matter; well-rotted manure or rich, home-made compost are best for this.  While peat will also help to lighten your soil, I suggest NOT using it since the destruction of peatlands has severe ecological implications.  Other tips:  never cultivate your clay soil after rain / when it's wet; avoid regularly walking on areas in which you intend to dig or plant as this contributes to compacting the soil.</p>

<p>However, given that some of your courgettes are growing normally, and those that are rotting are very small, I think the problem is almost certainly caused by inadequate pollination:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No fruit, or fruit rotting when very small: This is a physiological problem, caused by the growing conditions, not a pest or disease. It is a problem when the weather in early summer is cool and this causes inadequate pollination. 
  Remedy: This is usually a temporary problem, and once the weather starts to improve, so will pollination. You can try to hand-pollinate plants yourself by removing a male flower (male flowers don’t have a swelling at their base) and brushing the central parts against the centre of a female flower (female flowers have a swelling at the base – this is the beginning of the fruit). But this is a bit of a hassle, and normally the plant will correct this problem itself.</p>

"Cucumber plants wilting in greenhouse, but fine indoors?","7959","","<p>I've been growing cucumber plants from seed this year and everything was going fine until I started trying to move them outside when they were about 8 inches tall. I was acclimating them to the outdoor conditions along with my tomato and pepper plants by placing them outside for a few hours each day, but I always found that the cucumbers wilted by such a large degree when they were outside that I got scared and moved them back indoors after an hour or so. The other plants were fine.</p>

<p>I ended up moving the cucumber plants straight into the greenhouse a few weeks ago, and since then they've gradually got worse and worse, with the leaves becoming very floppy and wilted, followed by the young fruit wilting, and now the entire stems are buckling and collapsing to the soil level. Meanwhile, I kept two plants indoors that were, up until that point, treated identically to the outside plants, and they're thriving (or, at least, not dying).</p>

<p>I'm fairly certain that they have had sufficient water, and the temperature hasn't dropped below about 5°C here since they've been outside, however I forgot to poke holes in the bottom of the plants' growbag, so they spent the first couple of weeks with no drainage. At no point did the soil appear to be saturated, though, and I've since cut some drainage holes about a week ago, but the plants have only got worse.</p>

","<p>You hear often that squash/cucumbers/melons/pumpkins don't like to be transplanted, for several reasons, one of which is that they are very delicate, in that they are very soft and vascular, if any of the vascular tissue gets pinched or stretched or broken, it can lead to dessication.

"Should there be a bottom on a raised flower bed?","7793","","<p>I am wondering if people usually fill a raised bed completely with soil, or make a ""bottom"" for the soil to sit on?  If a bottom is made, is it treated wood to avoid mold and deterioration?  And if drainage is necessary, how do I create that?</p>
","<p>What people ""usually do"" depends on specifics of local economics, climate, and availability of materials.</p>

<p>I have a friend who lives in the Denver area.  The soil there is awful and buying topsoil is very expensive.  He spent $2,000 on lumber to build a backyard full of raised gardens with benches, then spent another $1,000 for different gravels to fill most of the boxes.  Then there was $2,500 worth of topsoil brought in.  The mesh canopies were comparatively a bargain to protect all the produce from being smashed by the daily hail storms.</p>

<p>Here, in Oregon's Willamette Valley, we have great topsoil in most places, so here we usually just shovel it some from somewhere we don't need it to fill the planters.  Or if there is some otherwise unneeded concrete rubble or gravel, that would go loosely in the bottom to decrease the amount of soil needed to fill.  Every year new compost goes in, and those who don't test their planter soil seem to buy bags of amendments too.</p>

"Insect infestation on my pepper plant, what do I do?","7717","","<p>I have spotted that one - and only one - of my peppers plants has a number of small black flies of some type hanging around the soil. And while writing this I've <em>just</em> spotted that one (and only one!) of the leaves has what I guess might be aphids on the back of it. So I'm now even more concerned than I was.</p>

<p>I first spotted the bugs 2 or 3 days ago, and it's definitely the case that the black flies are living on, or around, the plant given their behaviour and location. They are most often walking around the soil or pot, occasionally sat on the lowest leaves.</p>

<p>The plant <em>seems</em> healthy at the moment (as much as my negligible experience can tell) and doesn't look like it's being eaten or anything, but I guess this might not last long.</p>

<p><strong>What should I do?</strong><br>

"When is it ok to prune an overgrown apple tree?","7666","","<p>I recently bought a new house and I'm trying to get the garden in order.  It has an apple tree which has lots of low branches and appears generally neglected.  Some of the leaves are silvery and look ill.</p>

<p>It blossomed in late May and, now in late June has started producing some pathetic looking fruit. Is it ok to start pruning now? If so, how much should I prune? Below is how the tree looked in May:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WJaPR.jpg"" alt=""Apple Tree in May""></p>

<p>I'd like to at least remove the low branches and ideally the high branch coming in from the left. Should I wait until winter or is it safe to do now/summer without damaging the tree? </p>
","<p>Summer is the time to remove vigorous growth and keep the tree to a manageable size.  Winter is the time to structurally prune and to stimulate lots of new growth.</p>

<p>Say, for instance, you have a tree with 5 branches.  In winter, the sap moves down out of the 5 branches.  Then you cut 3 of the branches away.  In spring, when the sap rises, it will be looking for those 3 branches, which aren't there, so the tree will send out lots of new growth.  If, instead, you remove the branches in summer, you're removing the sap with the branch; therefore, won't stimulate as much vigorous growth next spring.</p>

<p>-When pruning, be sure to use clean tools.  Apply bleach or some disinfectant to blades to kill fungi and bacteria.</p>

<p>-Be sure to cut correctly.  Cut limbs to the collar, but not into it.  Don't leave a stub to rot.</p>

<p>-Prune to a bud facing the direction you want a new limb to grow.</p>

<p>-Don't prune when rain is certain.  Wet conditions are conducive to disease.</p>

<p>Also, with apple trees, its important to thin the fruit in the first 6 weeks of fruit formation or there won't be much fruit the following year.  You should thin the fruit to 6 inches or so between apples.</p>

<p>Here is a video that will alleviate your fears of summer pruning fruit trees: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ6isBVPcpc"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ6isBVPcpc</a></p>

<p>Another video concerning winter vs summer pruning: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZQfbGlzz90"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZQfbGlzz90</a></p>

<p>Some kinds of tree you don't want to cut on in certain months and in certain areas of the country (world).  For instance I won't make cuts on pine trees when its warm enough for insects to be about for fear of the Southern Pine Borer, which could wipe out acres of pine trees.  I hate to cut an oak in summer for fear of attracting insects.  You should research the tree you want to prune and be aware of the insects in your area which could attack a wounded tree.  Additionally, fruit trees are cheap and easy to replace.  Large oak trees are not.</p>

"How should a long neglected grape-vine be pruned?","7632","","<p>Our recently purchased home has a lot of old fruit and vegetable plantings that were mostly left alone for the past few years. Among these is a set of three grape vines on a group of metal trellises. We've cleared out the weeds that were growing around the vines, as well as some competing climbing plants that had gotten up onto the trellis and intertwined themselves with the grape pretty badly and took over a big portion of the trellis.</p>

<p>So right now the grape trellises are pretty clean and the vines appear to be healthy, although they're very unevenly distributed over the structure. What should we do now to encourage future growth and get the vines to spread out? Are there any companion plants or other fertilization techniques we should look into. We'd like to avoid chemical fertilizers if possible.</p>
","<p>So you know, I do not have personal experience with this.</p>

<p>I did, however, find an excellent <a href=""http://web3.canr.msu.edu/vanburen/e-1935.htm"">website</a> which I suspect you'd really prefer to have me summarize. :)</p>

<p>It's year-old growth which produces flowers and then grapes. Two years or older wood does not produce fruit, and will have loose, shedding bark that the younger canes will not have.</p>

<p>Grape vines should be pruned while dormant. In general, pruning in late winter or early spring (before budding starts) allows the plant to handle winter stresses and losses better. </p>

<p>The plant will fail to ripen the grapes if you allow it to keep all of the 200-300 buds on the year-old canes. </p>

<p>In order to select which to keep, it's helpful to know that, within a given cultivar, darker colored canes indicate good light exposure during the previous growing season and greater bud fruitfulness. Buds from these canes will also be more winter hardy.  Small diameter -less than 1/4 inch - canes should not be kept because of their inferior productivity and bud hardiness.</p>

<p>I suspect that you will need to do pruning in order to get the vines to spread, based on the above guidelines.</p>

<p>As far as companion plants, according to <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/List_of_companion_plants"">Wikipedia</a>, grape vines like hyssop for stimulating growth, and geraniums attract pests away from them. More about grape companion planting is <a href=""http://www.ehow.com/facts_6100919_companion-planting-grapes.html"">here</a>.</p>

<p>It sounds like grape vines don't need much for fertilizer once established, especially if the pruned leaves and shoots are left to decompose. More information is available <a href=""http://www.articlealley.com/article_596721_27.html"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Hopefully this is a good starting place for you!</p>

"Is there a weedkiller I can use at the foot of hedges?","7616","","<p>I have mature hedging all round my garden, the hedging consisting of dozens of different plant species, but mostly blackthorn, holly, laurel (I think) and box (?).</p>

<p>Annually the foot of the hedge gets into a royal mess of nettles and brambles and some other tedious weeds. In previous years I've tried hand weeding but it's not all that successful. In the densest parts of the hedge the weeds can at best be decapitated (can't reach the roots), which is next to useless. </p>

<p>I want to tackle the weeds more aggressively. I'd like to blitz the foot of the hedge with weedkiller but obviously I don't want to harm the hedge. </p>

<p>Is that possible?</p>

<p>If recommending actual brands, UK brands please. I have in mind something like the broad-leaf herbicide which I currently use on pasture. Kills docks, nettles etc and leaves grass alone.</p>
","<p>I think your only option is physical removal or very careful spot treatment. Trees, brambles, and nettles are all going to be susceptible to the same kinds of weedkillers; although the trees are probably (but not necessarily) more resistant. A tree is typically larger so X amount of poison, proportion wise, is less damaging. Of course that is a big generalisation and some trees are going to be more sensitive than others.</p>

<p>Get the nettles before they flower or seed. They have big leaves, so I would think spot treatment of individual plants or patches should be fairly easy.</p>

<p>The bramble will be more difficult. If you are lucky, then spot treatment on the leaves will affect the whole plant. If not, you may have to cut it at ground level and paint a ""brush-b-gon"" type herbicide on the 'stump' (yes I know, a US brand, but it is a woody plant herbicide - eg. trees and shrubs)</p>

<p>I have a similar problem with ivy. Despite spot treatment on the ivy, I managed to kill a small elm tree/sapling. Strangely, the cacti in the area survived just fine!</p>

  <p>Within legume nodules, nitrogen gas from the atmosphere is converted into <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia"">ammonia</a>, which is then assimilated into <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"">amino acids</a> (the building blocks of proteins), <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"">nucleotides</a> (the building blocks of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"">DNA</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"">RNA</a> as well as the important energy molecule <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"">ATP</a>), and other cellular constituents such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"">vitamins</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavones"">flavones</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_hormone"">hormones</a>. Their ability to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation"">fix</a> gaseous nitrogen makes legumes an ideal agricultural organism as their requirement for nitrogen fertilizer is reduced. Indeed high nitrogen content blocks nodule development as there is no benefit for the plant of forming the symbiosis.

<p>But in a lawn, there isn't really a way to improve conditions (naturally) without amending the soil. Adding decomposed organic matter in bulk is the way to go. It takes years, but you can also go from barren land to lawn with the use of intensive green manuring, where nitrogen fixers and mass growers are grown and plowed under for the specific purpose of improving the soil. In good soil, rye (in winter) and buckwheat (in summer) will add biomass fast. Good nitrogen fixers will include vetch (in winter) and red clover or alfalfa (in summer). There are many, many more, but these are the reliable ones I've tried that come to mind right away.</p>

<p>So green manuring with balances of leguminous/non-leguminous plants is the most effective means of plants building soil. In nature, what you see as topsoil is darker than the subsoil because of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humus"">humus</a>, which is amorphous decomposed organic matter. You will not get much more than a very small fraction of an inch of new humus per year in nature. Topsoil took a very, very long time to form.   </p>

"Why do plants root when placed in water, but die in standing water","7476","","<p>A lot of plants need well drained soil. They're said to not like getting their feet wet. The explanation given is that the roots need oxygen; they will rot and die if they're in standing water for too long.</p>

<p>But a lot of the same plants will root if you take a cutting and place it in water for long enough.</p>

<p>An example of this is kiwi vines. They require well drained soil. But their cuttings will root if you put them in a cup of water for a few weeks. I'm doing this right now (for the first time); mine have just began growing roots.</p>

<p>I've also grown a sweet potato in a coffee cup filled with water.</p>

<p>So, why does this work? Why don't cuttings drown instead of grow roots? Why do the roots continue to grow instead of immediately rotting and dying, since they don't have any oxygen?</p>
","<p>The oxygen explanation regarding plants in standing water is too simplistic. When you root cuttings in plain water, there's nothing else in there compared to what's in soil. Your cuttings may take up to six weeks to root, and in that time, you may top up the water with more clean water occasionally to keep the base of the cutting in the water, while it frantically tries to create enough roots for itself to survive.</p>

<p>The soil, though, is full of bacteria, fungal organisms, decaying matter, and various other forms of life which are not visible to the naked eye, and some which are (worms for instance). If the soil in a pot is saturated, either because it has no drainage, or is left standing in a tray of water, not only is oxygen in short supply, but other gas exchange processes are changed, the bio diversity changes, and sulphurous compounds are usually produced in the soil, which is why it starts to smell bad. The bio diversity change is because some organisms die in those conditions, others, such as fungal organisms, may  thrive, so the balance of the eco system is out of whack. You could liken the results to the way the bacteria in your gut is altered by taking antibiotics, perhaps causing an overgrowth of thrush in the body. None of that happens in your rooting container of water.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generally, peach trees live from 10 to 20 years. According to a team of Texas A&amp;M University horticulturalists, peach trees begin producing fruit in their third season and continue producing a viable commercial crop for nine to 12 seasons, or until the trees reach age 12 to 15. Peach trees do not suddenly stop producing fruit once they reach old age, but produce gradually reduced harvests over a few years before production stops altogether and the trees die.</p>

"How low (and for how long) does the temperature need to be before I need to worry about covering my outdoor vegetable garden?","7055","","<p>I have an outdoor vegetable garden in South Florida. The garden consists of things like tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, peas, and squash. Everything was started from seed about 2 months ago. I don't have any veggies yet but plenty of tall stems with leaves all over the place.</p>

<p>It generally never gets below freezing here, but we do have several days during the winter with relatively low overnight lows, ranging from high 30s to low 40s ºF (or 0–5 ºC). Daytime highs after such evenings are typically in the 50s and 60s ºF (or 10–20 ºC).</p>

<p>I'm told I should cover my garden with some plastic or a sheet in order to protect it from the cold. At what point is the temperature low enough (and how long does it have to be expected to be that low) before I need to take the time to do so?</p>
","<p>Different vegetables have different temperature thresholds.</p>

<p>Peas, for example, are very hardy -- they can tolerate heavy frost. (But not the blossoms -- if these get frosted you probably won't get any pods.) Kale and spinach can be planted in fall and survive months under several feet of snow snow to be eaten in the spring (if the deer don't eat them first).</p>

<p>Some plants can tolerate barely-freezing (30F), but die if temps drop to 20-25F. You might see these described as ""semi hardy"".</p>

<p>The tender vegetables like peppers, tomatoes, and squash won't tolerate any frost. If you're expecting frost you should cover those plants. Failing to do so will likely be fatal to the plants. A week of extended overnight temperatures of 35-40F may injure your plants to the point where they stop producing. If it's only 60F during the day, they certainly won't thrive. If you can manage to cover your plants and hold them around 50F overnight you may be able to keep them healthy enough to continue producing.</p>

","<p>I can't tell from the photos whether the white on the leaves in the penultimate picure is a deposit on the leaf, or within the leaf tissue itself. In the last picture, it looks more as if dust or dirt has stuck to the leaf. If its a white, powdery deposit on the leaf, and it's not dust or dirt, its got mildew. As for the insect infestation, aphids love roses, and sometimes look like white dots on the foliage, but with webbing, not sure what other beasties you may commonly have where you live. Suggest you check the underside of the leaves and leaf joints for signs of aphids, larvae or eggs. Spider mite infestation springs to mind - this would also cause white mottling of the leaves, but I'm not sure whether that's an outdoor pest in your area or not.</p>

<p>I'd like to ask a few cultural questions, but instead, I'll dish out the cultural advice. Roses are high maintenance - they need spraying every fortnight from spring through to fall with a systemic fungicide/insecticide. They need feeding with a specialist rose food at least twice a year (usually spring and 6 weeks later, if a granular formulation) to supply everything they require on the nutrient front, in particular to enable them to fight off infection/infestation better. They prefer heavier soils, with plenty of sun, and need good pruning to aid airflow between the branches to reduce the risk of fungal infection.</p>

<p>Without a description of the flies you saw, they could have been anything from hoverflies to rose sawfly, hard to say. If you suspect spider mite, spray with an appropriate insecticide. That will take care of any aphids present too. If there's mildew present, you can try finding a combined fungicide/insecticide treatment which will cover all the bases, or you will need to spray with a fungicide separately. Or try the milk treatment (1 part milk, 9 parts water) sprayed till run off on top and beneath the leaves and on the stems.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Seen all the pics - that just looks like a fly, not a hoverfly or sawfly. If you were in the UK, I'd recommend Roseclear Ultra or Roseclear 3 combined systemic insectide/fungicide, but I've no idea what products are available in Toronto for this kind of thing. Guess you could check whether the product is available there - otherwise its a case of reading the boxes/bottles on products to see which one/s you need. Roses aren't particularly susceptible to damage from pesticide sprays, but always remember to spray after the sun has gone down, but obviously before its dark, when the bees and other pollinating insects have stopped working, and avoid spraying open flowers.</p>

<p>I think you've got a problem with leafhoppers and spider mite, so if you can't find a combined fungicide/insecticide, just get an insecticide and use that, preferably a systemic one that mentions those two pests on the list of things it treats. How often you need to use a Systemic insecticide varies depending on formulation, but the instructions should be on the bottle or box. Contact insecticide will only kill off what's currently present in terms of insects, and won't prevent repopulation, so you may find yourself having to use it very frequently.</p>

"What should I do to improve a lawn growing on a new construction lot?","7048","","<p>A builder built a new home for us last year (2013) and put sod in the front, and a seed blanket in the back.  The seed blanket came up somewhat patchy, so we bought a few bags of seed and a spreader, to put down some additional seed to help the lawn grow.  Also, we don't have a sprinkler system, but I did move a single hose/sprinkler around the yard to help it grow.</p>

<p>Fast forward to Spring 2014: the snow has melted, and the grass is starting to green.  The back yard still has lots of patches, and weeds are growing everywhere.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?  What would be the best way to help thicken the back yard as I would imagine this is the key to a weed free yard.   Should I pull weeds manually or use an herbicide? Should I fertilize?  Should I aerate early in the year?  Should I put down more seed?</p>

<p>Edit:  I wanted to include this wonderful article I found online as well: <a href=""http://www.richsoil.com/lawn-care.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.richsoil.com/lawn-care.jsp</a> (both for my reference as well as for other visitors).</p>
","<p>ground prep is crucial for a new lawn. I assume sod was used in the front for appearance and cost, but the new lawn in the back was a starter blanket for lack of ""street view"" and return on the cost. Nothing beats sod. Period. I worked installs for landscape construction for nearly 7 years and the ROI on the sod was a bit more upfront for less hassle &amp; chasing seed/weed/feed cycle in the years to come. </p>

<p>Here are some tips to help you out:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prep the PATCHY/SPOTTY areas again. (Not the WHOLE backyard). Rough up the soil where you want the seed to grow better. Give the soil a good scratching and lay down
the seed. Make sure the soil has a good nutrient base. Dirt stinks...
add compost or loam if you can. Don't over-seed in this step though as it will
chock itself out. Do that later once your seeds have started to germinate and the grass-area-to-be is visibly ""green"" from a distance.</li>
<li>Mulch it. We used ""<a href=""http://natseed.com/pennmulch-seed-accelerator.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Penn Mulch</a>"" (most likely
available at you local agway/landscape plant supplier... may not be a box
store product. Too much penn mulch will also choke out the seed. (there is a fetrilizer component in it as a starter solution) Don't use hay. It's pointless. It makes a mess with the smallest amount of wind and doesn't really provide much of an evaporation barrier.</li>
<li>WATER WATER WATER. If you don't germinate the grass won't grow. Make sure you continue to water thoroughly, but not so much you get rivers of water washing away the seed. Get enough to soak the surface and make the ground <em>moist</em>... not <strong>wet.</strong> And make sure you rotate the sprinklers to other areas as needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>There have been times where we have made a pre-germination batch of seed and soil. One of the best ""patch repair"" production steps we did to expedite the process. Depending on how much you need you may be able to do this in a wheelbarrow.</p>

<ul>
<li>Put 1-2 lbs of seed into a 1/2 full wheelbarrow of rich compost.</li>
<li>mix the seed into the soil by hand, or with a small trowel.</li>
<li>lightly water and keep moist in a shady area.</li>
<li>stir every day or so to mix the seed around within the compost.</li>
<li>after 5-6 days, add another 1-2 pounds of seed and another 1/4 wheelie of compost.</li>
<li>continue watering and stirring maintaining a decent moisture content.</li>
<li>when seeds have sprouts 1-2 inches long you can transfer the mix to the pre-scratched patch areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not ""pack"" down the soil as it will crush the new seeds. Rather spread it with a spade (shovel) and then use a spring rake to even out the areas. maintain water for the next few weeks until the patch area grows in.</p>

<p>I also have this old carpet just waiting to be thrown away.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about weed whacking the weeds and then laying the carpet over them to stop them coming back, then covering it with pine bark.</p>

<p>Long term, is this a good way to deal with weeds? </p>
","<p>It <em>might</em> be a good way to deal with weeds, depending on what plant you're dealing with, and what the carpet is made of.</p>

<p>Dealing with the carpet first:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the carpet is natural fiber, then it can do well as the bottom layer of a <a href=""http://www.agroforestry.net/pubs/Sheet_Mulching.html"">sheet mulch</a>, which is basically what you're proposing (you're talking about two layers instead of 4). In this case, make sure you cut the weeds as low as possible -- you don't want them to try to regrow once you've covered them. Since the carpet fibers are natural, they will break down over time. The pine bark will also slowly decompose. You will want to renew the upper layer regularly to keep weeds controlled.</li>
<li>If the carpet is petroleum based (e.g. plastic backing), think twice before putting it on your soil. It will take a long time to break down, and may contaminate your soil with chemicals that are hard to get rid of later on.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then thinking about plant type:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the weeds in question are ""simple"" annual or perennial weeds (e.g. dandelion, crabgrass) that spread by seed (i.e. they don't have spreading roots / ""creepers""), then this control strategy should work well.</li>
<li>But if they spread via the roots (e.g. creeping charlie, leafy spurge) then they will probably just spread underneath your barrier until they poke out one of the boundaries of the carpet. In this case, you will have <em>moved</em> the problem, which may be all you need -- to keep it away from your trees -- but it could cause other problems, depending on where the weeds migrate.</li>
</ul>

<p>So before you go to all the effort of laying down the carpet and spreading bark mulch, you should identify what kind of weeds you are dealing with.</p>

","<p>Fig trees unlike a lot of other trees out there do not mind being pruned a LOT.  What I mean by that is you should not be afraid to prune this type of tree.  If they have a really good root system they can withstand a harsh pruning (harsh in a good way :)).  Within the first year, provided that your fig tree has established itself is a prime time to prune.  You will want to select a few branches to keep as your fruit that can be picked for the time being, the rest can be pruned away.  </p>

<p><strong>Time</strong></p>

<p>The best time to prune the tree is in the winter season or late fall when the tree is not growing.  </p>

<p><strong>Pruning</strong></p>

<p>You have the right idea, get rid of the dead branches first as those do not serve any purpose at all, they may actually hinder the tree if they have any type of disease on the wood.  If you see any <a href=""http://meyerlemontree.com/pruninglemontree.html"">suckers</a> remove those from the tree as well.</p>

<p>After you've gotten rid of the dead branches and the suckers you will want to remove any branches that are very close to the main branch, these branches do not yield fruit or yield very little.</p>

<p>For larger fruit and better growth make sure you prune the rest of the branches about 1/4.  This is especially important for the upcoming season and will help yield more fruit for you.  It's probably one of the most simpliest trees to prune, because it can actually take a lot of pruning without any affects (as opposed to prunining rose bushes / trees).</p>

You can try spraying with potassium bicarbonate, *Bacillus subtilis, or 0.5% baking soda.
<ul>
<li>Powdery mildew shows up as powdery white spots.</li>
<li>Angular leaf spot shows up as <em>water-soaked spots that turn gray, die, and drop out</em>.</li>
<li>Scab may also show up as water-soaked spots, it <em>causes sunken brown spots with gummy ooze on fruit</em>.</li>
<li>Alternaria leaf blight shows up as <em>dark brown spots with concentric rings, usually appearing on older leaves first.</em></li>

It's the white flower not the green leafs that are turning black. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9lowA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>I can see some blackening at the edge of a couple of leaves too though, which often indicates a water problem, or being near a heat source. First, I don't know whether the blackening on the spathe is caused by a deposit of some sort that can be rubbed off, like a mould of some sort, but either way, it seems likely your plant is either being over watered, or is left sitting in water in some outer container or tray. Whilst these plants do like a fair amount of water, they don't like to be sitting in it, so if you're not emptying any tray or container after 30 minutes when you have watered, start doing that as soon as possible.</p>

<p>UPDATED ANSWER:</p>

<p>I would cut off the spathes, or even the whole flower stem at its base (more will arrive later anyway), trim off any damaged leaves, inspect the compost for signs of mould growth, and to see whether its waterlogged, check the drainage holes in the pot aren't blocked. If the compost is waterlogged, stand it on something which allows any excess to drip away freely (like a rack, or over the plughole in the sink, for a while). Once its dried out a bit, then keep it well watered, watering when the surface of the potting compost feels just slightly dry to the touch, and watering thoroughly each time, but allow it to drain properly, and tip away any water that collects in an outer container after 30 minutes, and check again a while later to make sure no more has collected.</p>

<p>I believe what you're seeing (and have heard Don Gardner say the exact same thing only a couple of weeks ago), <em>""leaves on my peach tree turn an orange-green shade""</em> is in direct response to the weather conditions you've been experiencing in Texas, and is a natural survival mode that the tree has gone into ie</p>

<ul>
<li>Tree starting to lose its leaves early than normal, so it can concentrate all its energy on surviving.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just in the past week here in Missouri I've started to notice tree leaves (even on mature tress) browning, changing colour and falling off. Missouri has experienced a very! hot and dry July and August, more so than normal.</p>

<p>If the tree isn't mulched, I would:</p>

<ul>
<li>Put down a 2inch (50mm) layer of compost, starting about 4inches (100mm) away from the trunk and work outward as far as you can (is practical to-do-so).</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd also:</p>

<ul>
<li>Follow Don Gardner's ""Watering Guidelines"".</li>

"Why are my indoor strawberry's leaves turning brown?","6786","","<p>There is a problem with my strawberry, see the photos</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7FgPv.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IPmDn.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>It's been growing in this container for about four months. It grows indoors. I have fed it recently, after that the leaves started to turn brown.</p>

<p>Is the plant sick? What can be done about it?</p>
","<p>You are overwatering. I can see a line on the pot, in the saucer, where the water level usually is. The soil also looks very wet. That is far too much water for a strawberry plant. The leaves are also showing signs of nitrogen burn. It may be too late, but you can give it another shot. </p>

<p>You should immediately dump out that saucer, and repot the plant as soon as possible. Remove the plant from the pot, and clean the roots well, trying not to damage them. Cut off any rotten/dead roots. Be thorough. There may not be many healthy roots left. I usually dust very lightly with a fungicide powder/rooting hormone to keep it from spreading, and promote regrowth. Then, cut off all leaves that have the brown rot on them. Dispose of all old soil and plant cuttings far from the plant, and its new soil and pot. </p>

<p>Time to repot. Use a high quality <em>unfertilized</em> potting mix (the plant isn't in good enough shape to handle the amount of n-p-k found in fertilized mix. I'd use a different, similarly sized pot (the old one may contain disease), and plant the plant in it, making sure the roots are spread well, not cramped together at all. Plant it a little higher than it is now (it's somewhat too low). The crown should emerge from the soil, almost as much as it sinks in. Then water, enough to get the potting soil moist, but not soaked. </p>

<p>Keep the soil slightly damp until the plant shows signs of recovery, if it does. This will be seen as new green leaves emerging from the crown. If you see this, change your watering schedule. You want to water until it runs from the pot, and then leave it until the top 1/4-1/2"" of mix has completely dried. Then repeat. Do not ever let it sit in a saucer of water. If you water, and there is a significant amount of water in the saucer, dump it out.</p>

<p>Only after the plant is starting to pick it up, and grow well, should you begin fertilizing again. Try giving it half strength solutions at first, every other week, until the plant is much stronger. Then you can feed as normal. It will eventually need a larger pot (that one isn't big enough for a full sized strawberry plant.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: I didn't notice an <a href=""/questions/tagged/indoors"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;indoors&#39;"" rel=""tag"">indoors</a> tag on the question (added now). This explains some other symptoms. Regular strawberry plants don't make the best houseplants. They like lots of light, and most kinds want a dormant rest period over winter. Yours is showing some signs of real etiolation. The stems are long, the leaves are small and pale. It needs more light. They depend on daylight length for the most part, to determine seasons. Now, indoors, they will need to have very bright supplemental lighting in order to be healthy. This will have to be set, or manually turned on at sunrise/off at sunset for the most natural growth.</p>

<p>Over winter, the plant will need to rest, or go dormant. Warm temperatures will confuse the plant, and it needs cold temperatures. Over winter, it shouldn't get much over 45 degrees Fahrenheit if possible. That's the biggest reason why they (as well as many other temperate perennials) make poor houseplants.</p>

"How can I prevent stones from rising to the soil surface each year?","6750","","<p>My allotment has a lot of flint stone (UK, Bucks area). I am preparing the beds for the first time, and have been reducing the amount of stone as much as possible by raking and removing stones as I can. I have been told that there is a virtually limitless amount of stone further down that rises up over winter (I guess when the soil is wet enough, the larger stone rises to the surface?).</p>

<p>How much truth is there in the rumour that they keep resurfacing? </p>

<p>Is there any where to reduce or stop them rising up? If I were to dig down a good way and put a weed membrane would it stop the stones, or is it likely to cause issues with the soil structure/roots etc?</p>

<p>Or do I need to just keep pulling stones out, and expect to repeat the exercise every year?</p>
","<p>Well, in my area, unless you add about 6"" of soil every year, the stones will rise to the surface each spring. Around here, we call it the 'crop'. I've heard it is frost action working on the stones in the subsoil, but I'm not sure that's the cause. In any case, it's a chore you can expect to have each spring, and eventually you'll get a system down to do it efficiently.</p>

<p>I am leery of putting a substantial amount of anything man-made into the soil, I wouldn't recommend doing the weed membrane thing. While it may help with the rocks, it may also do something you don't expect, and it will be a big pain to remove, even more so than to install. Around here, we have a ton of night crawlers that like going down a lot further than that, so it would seal a good bit of them under, and keep the rest shallow. </p>

<p>When you remove rocks, it leaves a void, which the soil refills. eventually, the soil level will be lower than it was before, by a good margin. To compensate, I always count how many barrow/trailer loads of rocks I'd raked out, and replace them with at least their weight in decomposed organic matter (compost). This is less dense, but will settle and pack down considerably overtime. This will keep the ground at least level, and improve the soil at the same time. It is better for a garden bed to be humped up, rather than inverted.</p>

"Bonsai losing leaves","6739","","<p>I'm a bonsai beginner; I purchased a 15-year-old tea tree 2 weeks ago. It began losing a few leaves each day since. I keep it by a window and keep the soil damp. Today I turned it 180 degrees and noticed the window-facing side looked much healthier. Small white flowers have been blossoming over the last 5 days.</p>

","<p>My father in law taught me there are three things a bonsai needs in order to be happy: sunlight, water and wind. The problem with keeping a bonsai indoors is that it suffers when it comes to those three things. </p>

<p>Peoples perception of bonsai are skewed because of the media where they see film or pictures of bonsai inside. Bonsai can be displayed inside, but this is usually done for a brief period of time. For example, when you have guests coming and you want to show off your plant, but then it should be moved outside again.</p>

<p>In terms of hardiness, my father in law's attitude was that if it couldn't take the scorching heat or survive in the snow the plant wasn't going to be hardy enough to last several lifetimes. You may be more cautious about looking after your plants, I know some people do winter their plants, but the approach is to place them inside a wintering box or greenhouse outdoors. Not to bring them indoors for the winter.</p>

<p>Secondary to environment issues, I would be concerned about the roots rotting, which can happen when bonsai are kept indoors because evaporation happens much slower indoors and the soil can stay damp for extended periods of time. Although, after two weeks I guess this is not the case here.</p>

<p>It looks like the plant has some flowers. This indicates to me that the plant was very healthy up until recently. Typically if the plant is in shock or dying it won't go to the effort to make flowers at the same time it is dropping leaves.</p>

<p>My suggestion is to move it outdoors where it is getting a reasonable amount of sunlight and follow a <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/1617/what-is-a-good-watering-routine-for-a-bonsai?rq=1"">good watering routine</a>. I suggest putting it somewhere partly shaded because you may scorch it going from being indoors to directly out in the sun.</p>

<p>Hopefully it will stop dropping leaves and settle in to its new position. I wouldn't expect it to start growing leaves again until early Fall. There are typically two growth spurts Spring and Fall and if a plant has gone into shock, they usually will not regrow a large number of leaves until one of these periods.</p>

"How do I start an oak tree from an acorn?","6672","","<p>I have a lot of acorns on my lawn from a red oak tree.

","<p>There are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Quercus_species#Section_Lobatae"">large number of different red oaks</a>, but, usually, when people say red oak they are referring to Northern red oak (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercus_rubra""><em>Quercus rubra</em></a> syn. <em>Q. borealis</em>). A Texan, however, might reasonably use the term to refer to Texas red oak (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercus_buckleyi""><em>Quercus buckleyi</em></a>), Southern red oak (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercus_falcata""><em>Quercus falcata</em></a>), or Shumard oak (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercus_shumardii""><em>Quercus shumardii</em></a>). Most of what follows is widely applicable, so we need not worry which tree we are dealing with.</p>

<p>Acorns should be collected promptly since many types start rotting, drying out or germinating shortly after falling from the tree. Any loose caps or twigs should be removed. The acorns should then be dumped into a bucket of water, and any acorns that float should be discarded.</p>

<p>Acorns do not store well. They quickly dry out and die. Hence if the acorns are being stored for any length of time, put them in a heavy duty sealed plastic bag (4-10 mils) and place in a refrigerator (1-3ºC).</p>

<p>The white oak group, the oaks with smooth lobed leaves, with only a couple exceptions (like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercus_macrocarpa""><em>Q. macrocarpa</em></a>), do not require a cooling period to germinate and will germinate in three to five weeks after planting. The black (red) oak group, the oaks with pointy lobed leaves, almost all require a cold period of 30 to 90 days before they will germinate. This can be done in a refrigerator. The acorns can be placed in a plastic bag containing moist sand and peat and then put in a refrigerator (1-5ºC) until the appropriate chill time is reached or the acorns start germinating. Shumard oak has a 30-45 day pre-chilling requirement. Both northern red oak and Southern red oak have a 30-90 day pre-chilling requirement.</p>

<p>The easiest way to germinate acorns, however, is to plant them outside during the fall in a seed bed 6-12"" (15-30 cm) apart covered with .25"" (0.5 cm) of soil. Members of the white oak group will germinate before winter while the those in the black (red) oak group will germinate in the spring. Both the roots and stems emerge from the pointy part of the acorn, so the most sensible orientation for planting an acorn is on its side.</p>

<p>There is some disagreement on whether to remove the seed coat, or <em>pericarp</em>, from Northern red oak (<em>Q. rubra</em>) before planting. Bonner and Vozzo recommend it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dormancy in <em>Q. rubra</em> has also been attributed to the pericarp by Jones
  and Brown (1966). They induced germination by removing or clipping the
  pericarp and concluded that dormancy was the result of inhibited cell
  expansion. Hopper and others (1985) also concluded that the pericarp
  was significantly involved in dormancy of <em>Q. rubra</em>, and Bonner (1968)
  found pericarps to inhibit germination of four red oak species.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Norman Deno investigated <em>Q. rubra</em> and explicitly disagrees:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Soaking seeds for a week, making a hole in the seed coat, or removing
  the seed coats did not increase the rate of gemination or the percent
  germination showing that impervious or semimpervious seed coats were
  not present nor was there any inhibitors in the seed coat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I would not bother. It is likely the pre-chilling required for Northern red oak is sufficient to neutralize any inhibitors present.</p>

","<p>Looks like herb robert to me (geranium family).  I remember it taking over parts of my parents' garden in NE USA and that it was a bit of a nuisance.  What to do about it depends on how you want to control it.  It's an annual/biennial, so individual plants shouldn't last more than two years, but it spreads like crazy via seed.  If you don't want to use chemicals, I suggest just keep pulling out plants (which have shallow root systems and are easy to pull), making sure you get any adults before they produce and disperse seed. Could take a few years doing it this way as there's probably a considerable seed bank.  Alternatively, look into safe herbicides for a faster result.    </p>

"How can I stop dead grass clippings from accumulating on top of the live grass, and clogging the mower?","6623","","<p>So, this has been my first year with a yard that I need to tend myself, and I have dutifully mowed it every Saturday morning. The problem I'm finding is that, while I've always heard it's better to just let the cut grass decompose into the yard, it's not decomposing fast enough, I wind up with pretty little lines of dead grass that clog up and try to choke out the mower the following week.</p>

<p>I'm not interested in having the greenest lawn on the block, and will probably never fertilize the grass unless it just gets horribly brown, so I'm hesitant to bag up the grass and remove the nutrients from the yard, but it's getting tougher and tougher to mow as the season goes on and the rows of dead grass grow.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a suggestion on how to handle this conundrum?</p>
","<p>What height are you cutting your lawn?  </p>

<p>Are you cutting it when it is damp?  </p>

<p>Has it been a mild summer in your neck of the woods?  </p>

<p>If you're cutting it less than 3"", it's too short.  The amount that gets clipped off should be just a small fraction of the overall height.</p>

<p>If you're cutting it when it is damp (like in the morning), it'll be prone to clump up, particularly if it is being mowed with a side-discharge mower.  I personally strive to avoid cutting the lawn until after the dew's dried off the grass.</p>

<p>If your mower can mulch - mine has a removable side-discharge piece and turns into a mulching mower - you should try using it.  That'll cut the grass into smaller pieces, which will break down more quickly. Again, don't cut the grass when it's wet.</p>

<p>I've been cutting grass week after week since the spring because the weather here in VA has been <em>considerably</em> cooler than in past summers. Normally I'd have to mow very little in August (since the hot weather slows down the growth) but not this year.   It can be a real challenge to keep it cut here on my farm.  Maybe the weather has been similar where you live.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> cut it and bag/rake all that off the lawn and start fresh - depending on your lawn size, that could be a workout.  Then, set the mower to <em>at least</em> 3"" in height and cut it only when the grass is dry (i.e., not first thing in the morning).  I've you've got a lot of dead grass on the lawn, I'd probably do that.  The goal is to only do this once and afterwards rely upon shorter clippings breaking down more quickly.</p>

"What should I do to rescue grass from a petrol spill?","6596","","<p>We had some less than stellar workmen do some work a few weeks ago, and one of them spilled a substantial amount of petrol onto our front lawn. There is now an area about 100cm in diameter where the grass is completely dead.</p>

<p>I was not able to do anything about it until now (about 3 weeks later), so I have dug up the entire dead area, down to about 30cm. This is as far as I can reasonably dig, because we live in a clay area (Sydney Australia - almost all of the west is just clay).</p>

<p>The clay still stinks of petrol though, as did all of the dirt and grass I dug up.</p>

<p>If I throw some fresh dirt from another part of the yard into the hole and plant new grass seeds, will the petrol that's in the clay just re-contaminate it? Or is that area going to be dead forever?</p>
","<p>You can dig out the soil and get rid of it but it's considered hazardous waste so you need to find a suitable place to dispose of it. For a fairly small area like this that's probably the best way to go though.</p>

<p>You're going to have a really hard time planting grass and keeping it alive (even sod) with the heat you're having. Wait until the fall to repair the grass.</p>

<p>You're probably going to leave some fuel behind though.</p>

<p>There are microorganisms in compost that break down petroleum hydrocarbons. See this publication from the US EPA on <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/compost/pubs/bioremed.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Bioremediation and Pollution Prevention</a> (pdf). One application metioned was of an Air Force Base. They used to haul off the contaminated dirt to be incinerated but then started to mix the contaminated soil with yard trimmings and turkey manure and then compost the whole mix. That got rid of the contamination and saved them a lot of money.</p>

<p>I would at least fill the hole up with either straight compost or a mix that's 50% of more compost and wait until temps are better for establishing grass.</p>

<p>I'm in Houston, Texas, and we've had temps north of 100 degrees for the last couple of weeks. I'm not sure if this is the cause, or something else. </p>

<p>I'm watering about 5 times a week. These beds have a drip system. The rest of the plants seems healthy and happy so it doesn't seem like it's over or under-watering.</p>

<p>We've had issues in these spots, though. We've gone through two sets of pyramid boxwoods in the same spots which exhibited similar issues.</p>

<p>Can anyone point me to what I should do, or look for, to diagnose the issue? </p>

<p>LOTS OF UPDATES:</p>

<p>Ok, I've done more investigation and watched how it's changing over time.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I noticed a section of leaves just starting to turn black:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0wqSE.jpg"" alt=""2""></p>

<p>Today, it looks worse:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/krMd8.jpg"" alt=""3""></p>

<p>And I also looked on the backside of the dying leaves and see small white spots. The stem by the leaves has also turned black:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gkJ9p.jpg"" alt=""4""></p>

<p>Also, in another spot I noticed a healthy branch that had a dead black branch attached to it:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aEZ6h.jpg"" alt=""5""></p>

<p>Hopefully these will be enough to help diagnose. I think the small white spots and black branch must be evidence of something - I just have no knowledge in this area.</p>

<p>UPDATE 2:
I just pruned off the dead branches. I noticed the other bush has a brown patch as well. I pruned it off and noticed the green leaves remaining on that branch had a TON of the small white things on it, with some slight cottony webbing/tent-like stuff on the leaves. It looks to me like some sort of larvae. </p>

<p>I was actually planning to spray the house perimeter for bugs tonight, so I've gone ahead and given the plants a good dousing with a Suspend SC suspension. We will see if that helps! </p>

<p>I just realized I never posted pictures of the latest discovery. Here:

<p>And zoomed in:

<p>The pattern appears to be that these bugs (whatever they are) appear on the backs of the leaves. The leaf begins to turn brown/black around the eggs (or whatever they are). Next the whole leaf, then the stem and turns brown/black. </p>
","<p>Ok, I took a snipping to a local nursery. The bugs are white aphids. They sold me a systemic pesticide to use to treat the infestation. Hopefully that will do the trick!</p>

Do not overdo the fertilizer as that will give these a head start over the turf. Keep your soil loose, as this species likes compacted soil. Maintaining a thick, vigorous lawn will discourage the grass from spreading. </p>

<p>Also, if you use  PGRs (plant growth regulator), such as <a href=""http://www.alanwood.net/pesticides/flurprimidol.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">flurprimidol</a> (a-(1-methylethyl)-a-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenyl]-5-pyrimidinemethanol) which slows the growth of the <em>Poa annua</em> more than the growth of the perennial turf grasses, it give these good grasses a head start, as well as drastically reducing the <em>Poa annua</em>'s ability to produce seed heads, which will lead to decreasing populations of this weed in lawns each year that this treatment is applied.</p>

"How can I stop an urban fox from using my garden as its toilet?","6509","","<p>I live in the UK, in an urban terraced street where all of the back gardens are next to each other with fairly low walls.</p>

<p>Recently what I believe to be an urban fox has started using our lawn as its own personal toilet (it's not a cat - the faeces are definitely non-feline). I've purchased some of the scented granules that are meant to prevent animals from visiting but they do nothing.</p>

<p>It's getting to the point where my lawn now has many bald patches as removing the very unpleasant piles involves yanking out a handful of grass to get rid of it all - and then the bare earth encourages cats to come and use it as <em>their</em> toilet.</p>

Whether you try this out is up to you... but bear in mind, wherever you put any urine (however you do that), it's rich in nitrogen, so any plants in the vicinity may well start growing bigger and stronger, and that's not something you want at this time of year, when the growing season is coming to an end, so its best to spread it around a bit and not concentrate in one area.</p>

","<p>If you want to keep henbit out of your lawn, you will need to apply a pre-emergent very early in the season (in the south, as early as February) to prevent it from germinating. An organic option may be ""corn gluten"" which also inhibits the germination of annual seeds.  </p>

<p>Many commonly used chemical lawn fertilizers already contain pre-emergents to fight annual weeds - they are called ""weed and feed"" products.  This may be why your neighbors are not having the same issues with the henbit that you are having - they may be using one of these. </p>

"How can I grow barley grass indoors?","6456","","<p>I watched <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25dw4_X-_nA"">this video</a> where
a man grows barley grass, then makes a juice from it.</p>

<p>I'd like to grow my own barley grass indoors in pots, so temperature is probably an important factor.</p>

<p>What else should I consider eg Variety, Soil, Watering, Timing, etc so that I can achieve maximum nutritional results from the indoor growing process?</p>
","<p>""Barley grass"" is just barley harvested for the tender young growth instead of letting it mature to grains. I haven't grown barley grass for juicing, but I have grown and started a lot of plants in pots using the technique below with excellent results.</p>

<p>Since you want to grow indoors, start with a sturdy tray at least 3"" deep. Make sure the tray has drainage holes so there will be no standing water.</p>

<p>Get your seeds -- you'll have to decide what variety to use based on whatever you're trying to achieve. I would look for varieties specifically promoted for use in growing barley grass; some barley cultivars have specific cultural requirements that would seem to make them poor choices for your application.</p>

<p>Create a soil mixture using:</p>

<ul>
<li>.5 gallon peat</li>
<li>1/4 cup pulverized lime
<ul>
<li><strong>mix thoroughly</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>.5 gallon perlite or vermiculite</li>
<li>.5 gallon finely sieved high-quality compost (1/4"" mesh sieve)
<ul>
<li><strong>mix thoroughly</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Reserve a small amount of the perlite to use for top dressing after planting.</p>

<p>(Adjust the quantities if you need more or less, but maintain the ratio.)</p>

<p>Add this mix to your pot to a depth of 2"". Water thoroughly -- <em>slowly</em> pour water evenly over the entire surface until water comes out the drain holes in your tray. Wait a while (maybe an hour or two) and then repeat this process. You want the potting mixture to be thoroughly wet.</p>

<p>(See note regarding chitting at the bottom of this post.)</p>

<p>Broadcast your seed across the surface of the soil. As you saw in the video, it should be planted rather thickly, but you don't want it so thick that there's a layer of seeds on the surface -- the plants need a little bit of space to breathe. Your experimentation and experience will be the best teacher here. (Or see the reference at the bottom of this post.)</p>

<p>Sprinkle the top with about 1/4"" of the reserved perlite.</p>

<p>Set the tray in a cool, dark place.</p>

<p>Some people would tell you to cover the tray with plastic wrap at this point -- I don't like to do this because it creates the potential for problems with mold/fungus. It does have the advantage of holding moisture in, which the germinating seeds need.</p>

<p>During germination keep the soil moist -- mist lightly with water 1-2x daily. <em>Don't let it dry out during germination!</em> You should see sprouts within 1-3 days.</p>

<p>As soon as you see sprouts, move the tray to the light. Most of the time ""a sunny window"" is not sufficient. I would use fluorescent lights -- position the lamp 1"" above the surface of the soil, and raise the light as the plants grow so that they stay 1-2"" from the lamp. If you have a sheltered spot outside that gets <em>all day</em> sunlight, you can grow outside. (This will dry out the soil faster, adjust your watering accordingly.) It's harder to get sunshine all day indoors, but if you think you can provide it, give it a try.</p>

<p>Do not over water, but don't let the soil get dried out either. How often you will need to water depends somewhat on the environment you provide. (See notes above regarding outdoor sunshine vs indoors vs lights.)</p>

<p>Within a couple of weeks it should be ready to harvest at 6"" or higher. You may be able to get a couple of cuttings if you maintain the light and water.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>As I got to the end of writing/researching this post, I stumbled across <a href=""http://www.sproutpeople.com/seed/print/barleygrass.html"">this reference on growing barley grass</a>, which confirms for the most part the advice I've given above. They have different recommendations regarding growing medium -- try both approaches and see which works better for you. They also have recommendations for amount of seed to use in terms of density. And they claim chitting (pre-sprouting) is <em>required</em>, but I'm skeptical about the need -- try it both ways to see whether one way is more work or provides more yield.</p>

<p>I'd recommend taking a look around their website -- especially <a href=""http://sproutpeople.org/seeds/grass.html"">this note on barley grass</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many folks have been seduced by advertising, into thinking that Barley is the way to go.

<p>In doing research for this post, I'd have to agree with their skepticism on the outcome you can expect from barley grass juice. The research does not seem to have confirmed much in terms of benefits.</p>

","<p>Here is a diagnostic tree for brown spots on leaves.  They can have many sources, sometimes more than one at a time:</p>

<ul>
<li>spots are on every leaf, newer and older: 
<ul>
<li>check for sunken spots or dead areas showing rings of growth => advanced virus/bacteria/fungus</li>
<li>can be an outside factor like pesticide spray, chlorine heavy misting</li>
</ul></li>
<li>spots only on older growth
<ul>
<li>can be over watering, check to see if dead areas are still moist</li>
<li>can be under watering, dead areas usually occur on tips and area is dry</li>
<li>can also be a virus/bacteria/fungus that is just getting started</li>
<li>can be physical damage from crushing or freezing</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This plant looks very healthy.  I would not worry about the dead spots unless the whole leaf dies off.  Check that your watering is following best practices.  Let the top half inch (1 centimetre) dry out and then water thoroughly until water runs out the bottom of the pot.  Do not water again until the top part of the soil is dry.</p>

<p>Edit: I looked at your second photo. It does not look like physical damage. Remove the leaf and watch for further occurrences.  Watering practices are a common cause of virus/fungi/bacteria. Consider letting the plant dry out before watering again as indicated in the previous paragraph.</p>

I've placed it in my office so that it receives some sunshine, but not directly - I've put it behind a plastic plant (on the right on the photo). The blinds are often closed in the office, particularly in the morning.</p>

<p>I've been watering it with half a glass of water every week, or every two weeks. Currently the ground is a little bit moist.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KbTWWl.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>If the leaves - particularly the lower ones - are turning yellow before falling (rather than black, which is usually a a sign of over-watering), the problem is almost certainly caused by <strong>insufficient light</strong>. Although Schefflera can adapt to a wide range of light levels, it prefers fairly bright light, away from sunshine, especially the variegated variety. The position it is in, behind your plastic plant, probably doesn't receive enough light to meet its needs, particularly as the blinds are often closed.</p>

<p>Half a glass of water every week or fortnight doesn't sound enough and, although Schefflera is fairly drought-tolerant, and the leaves are not turning brown and wrinkling, <strong>dryness</strong> is probably a factor in the leaf fall. I would water the pot more thoroughly (until water drains out of the bottom or, if the compost has shrunk away from the sides and the water is running straight through, you could stand it in a small bucket for ten or fifteen minutes), but drain the pot well and make sure it is not sitting in any water. Water liberally in spring and summer, as soon as the soil becomes almost dry, and sparingly in winter. Schefflera prefers moist - but not wet! - soil.
Thorough watering is also important to prevent the plant from surface-rooting in search of water and becoming stressed.</p>

Watering the plant seemed to help; but I'm not sure if there is a causal link there.  The season was a particularly dry and hot season.  What is the cause of this droop?</p>
","<p>Mulch the soil around the plant.  This greatly reduces moisture loss, and (with some materials) also reduces weeds.  Opinions vary on best materials.  See <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/355/whats-the-best-mulch-material-for-a-vegetable-garden"">this post</a>.
For myself, I don't use -cides on my lawn, and I bag the clippings and use some of them on the garden.  You need to make sure to not put too much on at one time, especially when damp, because it can burn from too much nitrogen - just like leaving piles of clippings on the lawn can make yellow spots.  Of course, this brings some weed seeds in with it, but it's not a big problem.</p>

<p>If your soil drains quickly, you should increase the humus content, one way or another.  Composted cow-manure, dried and bagged from your local home-improvement box store or garden center, is an easy, high-quality fix.  I use both that (in the spring, as needed) and winter rye, a tall annual grass that I broadcast in the fall, and then fork into the soil a few weeks before pea-planting.  I've had problems with compost from my own bins, and now only apply it in the fall to the vegetable garden, forking it in.  The compost usually has woody material left in it that, if left on the surface, harbors earwigs and other critters that sometimes eat the leaves off young plants.</p>

<p>Mulch and humus should get you to where, even on days in the nineties, you don't need to water more often than once every day or two.</p>

<p>When you water, water thoroughly, then <em>try</em> to not water till the top quarter-to-half-inch is dry.  This will encourage deeper root growth, making plants more tolerant of hot days.  When a hot day is predicted, be sure to water if you think it will wilt before you can water it again, regardless.  </p>

<p>For squash in particular, beware of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_vine_borer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">squash vine borer</a>.  If your plants wilt and then outright <em>fail</em>, it's a likely cause.  If you ever see something that looks like a handsome bright red and black wasp around the squash, usually in May or June, that's the bugger.  It lays eggs on the stem at bottom of the young plant, which bore in and live inside the stem, growing into a big fat ugly grub.  The most obvious telltale is some sawdust-like ""frass"" that it leaves around the base.  You can also often see the holes, especially late in the season.

","<p>You don't.</p>

<p>At least that's one person's opinion.</p>

<p>So, I've seen ""microgreen mixes"" for sale before but here's the deal - they are just a variety of seeds that are commonly used for growing sprouts.  I believe this is all a convenience thing, but I'm not a ""microgreen expert"" and <em>perhaps</em> there's a legitimate reason one would need to buy a special mix.</p>

<p>But I doubt this seriously.</p>

<p>Sprouts are just that - the sprouts of plants that, if given time, would grow into a mature plant, whether that plant is arugula, beet greens, peas, lettuce, tatsoi, endive or a variety of other plants, spinach for instance.</p>

<p>Personally, for the sake of convenience, I'd grab a Mesclun mix.  They're tasty (in my opinion) and will all generally sprout at the same time, making it very convenient.</p>

<p>But again, I think there's nothing ""special"" about the mixes, except that they tend to contain greens that work well.  </p>

<p>One other thing - I like the idea of growing mesclun or baby greens because you can generally do the ""cut and come again"" thing with them.  Sprouts, once you snip them off, which I believe is the way this is generally done, will not grow back.

","<p>Looks like spider mites or a deficiency.  Here's how to tell them apart:</p>

<ul>
<li>look on the underside of the leaf.  Spider mites are visible to the eye but a magnifying glass will help.  If you see whitish blobs clustered around the veins of the plant you have a small problem.  If I'm right you have an extensive infestation and will see them all over the underside of the leaf.  You might even see webbing between the axils of the leaf.</li>
<li>on the top of the leaf you won't see much except for pinhole sized light spots where the spiders have sucked the plant juices out from the underside</li>
<li>if it is a deficiency it is more common to see dark veins and light leaf material or spotting but you will not see webs or anything on the leaf. See <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/1116/what-is-my-citrus-deficiency-based-on-leaf-appearance-and-how-to-treat"">this post</a> for some pictures of citrus with a deficiency.</li>
</ul>

<p>Control of spider mites on citrus is challenging in warm climates. Mix one teaspoon of soap to a quart of water, get a cloth and wipe the underside of each leaf. Rinse or spray with fresh water.  Repeat at least twice at five day intervals to get the eggs.</p>

<p>Supposing that there is no harmful residue of the previous content in it:
It is rusting a bit on the inside, so the water doesn't look that clean. Is the iron oxide actually harmful for vegetables? We are using it to irrigate plants such as peppers, salad, strawberries and some herbs.</p>
","<p>Rust is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_oxide"" rel=""nofollow"">iron oxide,</a> which does not harm plants in moderate amounts, because it is not water soluble unless the soil ph is very low. In fact, oxidized iron is what <a href=""http://www.kurdishscientist.com/ironoxides.html"" rel=""nofollow"">gives most red subsoils their color</a>. </p>

<p>Watering your plants with this water will not harm them at all. If you suppose there was nothing environmentally harmful in it before (which is NOT a good idea if you really don't know, because many things stored in steel barrels are not good for soil, and rust is very absorbent), then go ahead and use it. I would ask your friend if he/she wouldn't mind finding out what the barrel was used for.   </p>

"Can an aloe plant that's completely rotten at the base be cured?","6087","","<p>I had a potted aloe plant that looked like a set of leaves coming out of a single spot at ground level.

Leaves otherwise look alive - they are just damaged at the end where they were connected to the root.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/1566/can-i-save-my-damaged-aloe-vera-plant/1567#1567"">this answer</a> aloe plant leaves can be planted on their own and can perhaps start growing as separate plants.

","<p>If your leaves have rotted at the base, there is nothing practical you can do to save the plant.

"Can I give sugar (or something similar) to flowering plants?","6072","","<p>I was wondering if it's possible/advisable to give a flowering plant or any plant for that matter, sugar (or something similar) in addition to plant food?</p>
","<p>Well you could in solution, but I wouldn't advise it. If your plants are growing well anyway, sugar might just kill them. Sugar molecules don't pass directly into the plant, so will build up in the soil in the pot, and cause problems later if you always add sugar. Sugar also directly feeds microbes in the soil - some of these may be beneficial, but some may not be, and sugar doesn't discriminate. Sugar solution can also cause reverse osmosis, meaning water or fluid, rather than being taken up  and then utilized by the plant, is instead expelled, causing the plant to die.</p>

<p>I'd recommend you fertilise with a standard, proprietary fertiliser at the recommended rate on the product and forget about adding sugar.</p>

"What is the best way to sharpen a lawn mower blade?","6052","","<p>One of those ""I really must get around to..."" questions, but what is the best way to sharpen a lawn mower?</p>

<p>My own lawn mower is a fan blade (i.e. flat blade on a vertical axis), but for maximum usefulness an answer should also include the cylindrical blade types (i.e. traditional transverse axis cutter with helix segment blades wrapped in a cylinder) and any other common types as well.</p>
","<p>First let me say, I'm no expert when it comes to sharpening lawnmower blades, I've done it on the odd occasion -- only on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawn_mower#Rotary_mowers_2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rotary mower</a> blades, never on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawn_mower#Cylinder_or_Reel_mowers"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cylinder or reel mower</a> blades.</p>

<p>I do sharpen my own hand-tools, things like wood chisels, plane blades, etc and use sharpening stones to do those, but when it comes to lawnmower blades I've personally found it's more cost effect to pay a ""professional"" to do it...</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/G1rB6.png"" alt=""Reel mower"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5x3X5.png"" alt=""NaturCut Classic mower""></p>

<p>For cylinder or reel mower blades it's my understanding (and experience) it makes the most sense to take them in and get them sharpened by a ""professional"" who specialises in lawn tools.</p>

<p>I mainly say the above because even my dad who was a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundry"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">foundryman</a> by trade and done everything himself around the home, would spend his money to get his cylinder lawnmower blades sharpened once a year. Then through the course of the lawn cutting season he would regularly <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honing_%28metalworking%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hone</a> the blades himself via a combination of fine <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_%28tool%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">metalwork files</a> and sandpaper.</p>

<p>Via a web search I see you can buy reel mower sharpening kits, I honestly have no experience with them (nor do I know anyone who has used such a kit), therefore I can't comment on how good or bad they might be.</p>

<p>I have no affiliation with the below links, am just posting them as examples of what I found on the web:</p>

<p>For rotary mower blades you have a number of ways (tools) you can choose to sharpen those blades. Which method you use pretty much comes down to personal choice, each method has pluses and negatives associated with them...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fine <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_%28tool%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">metalwork files</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandpaper"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sandpaper</a> (old school).</p>

<ul>
<li>Personally I think this method is best used for regular honing ie Keeping the blade edge sharp through the lawn cutting season.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Handheld <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpening_stone"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sharpening stones</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Again probably best used for regular honing...</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Handheld <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_grinder"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">angle grinder</a> and a fine metalwork file (for removing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr_%28metal%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">burrs</a>).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Takes a steady hand and more experience (skill, a light touch) than other methods to achieve good results -- mainly because it's very easy to remove too much material quickly...</p></li>
<li><p>Personally I think this method is best reserved for blades that have (large) nicks in them, use the grinder to remove those nicks, then finish the job, hone the blade edge, with a fine metalwork file (or handheld sharpening stone) and sandpaper.</p></li>
<li><p>Also keep in mind, the heat generated by the action of the grinding disc can have a negative effect on the blade itself...</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_grinder"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bench-top grinder</a> and a fine metalwork file (for removing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr_%28metal%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">burrs</a>).</p>

<ul>
<li>Very similar to the above handheld angle grinder method in its pros and cons. That said, I believe it's the chosen method used by most ""professionals"" that offer lawn blade sharpening services.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Specialist lawnmower blade sharpening attachments, available for a variety of different power-tools eg (I have no affiliation with the below links...)</p>

<ul>

<ul>
<li><p>These specialist sharpening attachments probably offer the best (easiest) method for the ""average"" person who wishes to sharpen their own lawnmower blade.</p></li>
<li><p>After using such a specialist sharpening attachment I'd still recommend getting a fine metalworking file out and use it to remove any burrs that might be present, even if it only takes a couple of strokes with the file to-do-so.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Recommended (safety) equipment if doing it yourself</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sharpening tools from from one of the above methods (or from a method I haven't listed above).</p></li>
<li><p>A scrap piece of 2""x4"" (50x100) timber, used for wedging the blade in place when removing it from the lawnmower.</p></li>
<li><p>Suitably sized <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socket_wrench"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">socket rachet</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrench"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">spanner</a> ie Correct size to remove bolt(s) holding the blade on.</p>

<li>Optional -- correct size spark-plug socket.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Bench-top <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vise"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vise</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Or a suitable <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clamp_%28tool%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">clamp</a> (eg <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-clamp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">G-clamp</a>) you can use to clamp the blade to a flat work surface.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Blade balancer (basically a small <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cone</a>) or a large nail/screw driven &#8532; (fixed securely) into a wall.</p></li>
<li><p>Heavy-duty work gloves.</p></li>

<li><p>Handheld (stiff) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_brush"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wire brush</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Some sort of cleaning cloth/rag.</p></li>
<li><p>Can of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone#Lubricants"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">silicon based spray</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>General lawnmower blade sharpening procedure</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Remove the wire from the spark-plug. Some recommend then removing the spark-plug, personally I don't think it's required to-do-so, but if you want to play it extra safe, remove the spark-plug as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Now the lawnmower needs to be ""laid on its side"" so the blade can be removed. The trick I use (prevents petrol/gas from leaking out of the tank), is to tilt the lawnmower backwards and place a heavy toolbox on the handle to prevent the lawnmower from coming back down. See below image <em>(click to enlarge)...</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VzimR.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VzimRm.png"" alt=""Lawnmower titled backwards""></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Put on the heavy-duty work gloves.</p></li>
<li><p>With the lawnmower ""laid on its side"" or tilted back, wedge the scrap piece of timber in between the blade and the cutting deck so the blade is unable to spin.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the bolt(s) holding the blade on.</p></li>
<li><p>Put on the safety glasses.</p></li>
<li><p>With the handheld (stiff) wire brush clean off as much bits and pieces (gunk) as you can. Then take the cleaning cloth and wipe off the blade.</p></li>
<li><p>Securely clamp the blade in the bench-top vise or clamp it down to a flat work surface using an appropriate clamp.</p>

<ul>
<li>Obviously the above step isn't required if using the bench-top grinder method of sharpening.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Sharpen the blade using your chosen sharpening method. Take your time, remove as little material as possible, do your very best to sharpen the blade to the manufactured angle.</p></li>
<li><p>Take the fine metalwork file and remove any burrs that might be present on the backside of the blade.</p></li>
<li><p>When you've finished sharpening the blade (both ends), remove from the vise (or clamp).</p></li>
<li><p>Before putting the blade back on the lawnmower you need to ""balance"" it. If the blade isn't balanced:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You will get an uneven cut.</p></li>
<li><p>Vibration of the blade will put excessive wear and tear on your lawnmower.</p></li>
<li><p>Also a blade that is vibrating is a serious accident waiting to happen.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To ""balance"" the blade, ether place it on the blade balancer or hang it on the large nail/screw, via the bolt hole in the middle of the blade.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the blade is balanced it will not tip one-way or the other.</p></li>
<li><p>If the blade isn't balanced it will tip down on one side (the heavy side), that side of the blade needs to have a little bit of material removed.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Back to your chosen sharpening method to remove a little bit of material from the heavy side.</p></li>
<li><p>Recheck the blade to see if it's balanced...</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Once the blade is balanced, lightly spray the whole blade with the silicon based spray, then wipe off any excess with the cleaning cloth.</p></li>
<li><p>Bolt the blade back in place, making sure you put the blade back the correct way up.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't forget to reconnect the spark-plug (or put it back in if you took it out).</p></li>

"How can I find sprinkler valves buried in my yard?","6026","","<p>I had a lightning storm hit my house and my sprinkler system stopped working.  I replaced the <a href=""http://www.sprinklerwarehouse.com/Irritrol-Sprinkler-Irrigation-Controller-p/kd9-int.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Irritrol KD9</a> controller. The controller powers on and I have ~25 AC V on the line according to my multimeter (touching com/vc and zone 1).  None of the zones will come on.

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/L8NPr.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>It's common for all the valves to be in a single valve box somewhere near the controller. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dXBZK.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In some installations valves may be dispersed throughout the property and I believe that's the case based on your photos.</p>

<p>The round valve box on the bottom appears to be used as a junction box for the control wires. Eight wire nuts indicate you have 4 zones and should therefor have 4 zone valves with solenoids.</p>

<p>It looks like there are 3 cables. (maybe 2, the picture is cut off) One comes from the controller and the other two (or 1) should split off to valve boxes. </p>

<p>The second photo of the rectangular box appears to have a single valve in it. There's too much contrast in the photo to really be certain. If you can take a picture with the contents of the box more evenly illuminated it would help. I think I see a valve body but not sure I see a solenoid and not sure what those tan components might be. I can't make out any wires either.</p>

<p>Best bet is from the round box on the bottom of your post, dig out the cables a little to try to determine which direction they may be going. Follow that path and you should hopefully find the other valve boxes. They may be round or rectangular.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that just because you have an irritrol controller does not necessarily mean you have irritrol valves.</p>

","<p>This is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_plant"">jade plant</a> or Crassula ovata.  The one in the picture you have has been grown in low light and has stretched out and dropped the older leaves which is why it looks so thin.</p>

<p>The leaves are plump and there are some yellow leaves so it does look to have been slightly over watered.</p>

<p>The wikipedia entry noted above agrees with my experience with them</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>they require a normal watering when the soil is dry in the summer, and
  very little watering in the winter. Overwatering will cause them to
  lose their leaves (it is easy to identify overwatering by the
  characteristic crinkling look that the fallen leaves have) and
  eventually the stem will rot away. Though jades can survive
  overwatering, it is best to keep them on a 10 - 20 day cycle in the
  summer, and even less (up to a month dry) in the winter. Letting the
  soil dry between waterings is essential for a healthy jade.<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_plant"">1</a></p>
  
  <p>They will grow in full sun to light shade. However, they do not
  tolerate extreme heat or overexposure to direct sun very well, showing
  damage ranging from scorched leaves to loss of foliage and rotting
  stems. Most of the common species will tolerate a limited degree of
  frost but overexposure to cold weather will kill them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The intense summer sun where you live can scorch a jade plant so do not put this plant in full sun.  It appears to need more light so an unobstructed eastern or north facing window should be just fine.</p>

<p>I recommend cutting it back to encourage new growth and give it a bushier look but that is just personal preference.</p>

<p>Cuttings can be rooted in the same pot or can start a new plant by letting the cut end dry or callous.  Place it in bright light for a few days and then push into the soil.</p>

"Is it beneficial to put plastic or landscaping fabric under mulch?","5938","","<p>I am planning on completely re-doing the landscaping around my house and I would like to replace the rock pebbles with mulch. Should I put down a layer of plastic or landscaping fabric before adding mulch? What are the pros/cons of doing this?</p>
","<p>Definitely not plastic - landscape fabric needs to be water/air permeable. The reason fabric's used is to reduce or stop weed germination, particularly when stones are laid over the top. Even that's not a permanent fix though - over time, particles of soil gather in the stones and eventually weed germination can take place in that top layer of stones.</p>

<p>If you're going to use organic origin mulches instead, a layer 2-3 inches deep is necessary to hold back weed germination if you don't use landscape fabric, less if you do. But, adding organic mulches straight onto soil is beneficial in other ways - the mulch will break down over time and enrich the soil beneath, and retain moisture in the soil, but will need topping up probably yearly. It's also easier to hoe over to remove anything which has germinated in the mulch or soil without fabric present. Plus there's the advantage that any perennial plants or bulbs present will be able to increase their size/width in the soil because they're not restricted by being planted through a hole in landscape fabric. Laid over fabric, a mulch will still need topping up, but if you used, say, chunky bark chips, it will last longer. So it really depends on what plants you're growing and why you're using the mulch - if the main reason is to improve the soil (without digging) and retain moisture, then you don't need the fabric. But for weed suppression, fabric works better, although you should be aware that, even with fabric laid, weed seedlings are perfectly capable of germinating in the organic mulch layer on top of the fabric, and obviously harder to remove because you'd need to do it by hand so as not to disrupt the fabric beneath.</p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> How long do they normally take to to begin blooming?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> It has been almost three more years, and I didn't yet get one flower.</p>
","<p>First, I honestly don't know how long it takes a mock-orange shrub to establish and start flowering, but that said, I would expect (educated guess) a healthy one to starting flowering by year 3 to 4...</p>

<p>Below are some reasons why you might not have seen flowers by now:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mock-oranges prefer full sun, therefore the location it's in could be a little too shady, thus slowing/hindering flower production.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Q.</strong> Is the valley and the shrub's location within, adding too the shade? </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A lot of foliage growth and no flowers is generally a sign of element(s), nutrient(s), imbalance in the soil eg High <a href=""http://www.ncagr.gov/cyber/kidswrld/plant/nutrient.htm#Nitrogen"" rel=""nofollow"">Nitrogen</a>, low <a href=""http://www.ncagr.gov/cyber/kidswrld/plant/nutrient.htm#Phosphorus"" rel=""nofollow"">Phosphorus</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>I'd recommend mixing some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_meal"" rel=""nofollow"">Bone Meal</a> into the soil around the base of the shrub.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Fluctuating moisture in the soil ie Prolong wetness or dryness (drought) or constantly going between the two is stressful for the shrub and can result in lack of blooms.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mock-oranges prefer constant moisture in a well drained soil.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Flowers appear on previous year's (one year old) growth, therefore it's best to prune immediately after flowering in the Spring, early Summer.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>By pruning in the Winter you may have inadvertently removed growth that was going to flower in the Spring.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't prune this Winter, instead leave alone and see if you get flowers next Spring. Then if you do get flowers, prune immediately after flowering, removing the stems the flowers were on and any obvious old or dead material.</p></li>
<li><p>Mock-oranges can take a pretty heavy pruning, seeing as they grow fairly quickly. A yearly pruning after flowering will help keep the shrub healthy and vigorous.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>One final thing to keep in mind, depending on the exact variety you have, some Mock-oranges only flower for 2 to 3 weeks maximum, therefore if the shrub isn't in an area you see regularly, you may have missed the blooms.</p>

"Are tar based products really useful in treating tree wounds?","5887","","<p>There are a lot of articles on the web ranked highly in searches that advocate the use of tar/tar based products to seal tree wounds such as pruning cuts. For example — <a href=""http://www.ehow.com/way_5825783_homemade-tree-wounds.html"">""Homemade tree wounds""</a>. However, this is really an outdated practice and the use of such products only seals in the bacteria and fungus, further worsening the situation and accelerating the decay.</p>

I'd appreciate detailed answers with links so that this post can quell any disinformation floating around on the internet.</p>
","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Shigo"">Alex Shigo</a> pioneered the research which has shown that anything that covers a pruning cut works against the natural habits trees have to wall off injury.

L., 1982 Tree Health in the Journal of Arboriculture 8 (12)</a> and <a href=""http://shigoandtrees.com/index.php?_a=viewProd&amp;productId=3"">a New Tree Biology 1986</a> helped to show arborists a more effective way to prune.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that trees seal off injuries, they do not heal like we do.  If there is damage they build a wall of tissue around it and carry on growing.  When you apply tar, or aloe gel or pectin to a tree wound you are sealing in moisture and preventing the wall of tissue from forming.  Some of the ingredients can serve as a food source for pathogens and none of them will stop rot.  </p>

"What could be causing my blueberries to have a funny taste?","5883","","<p>I have just harvested some of the ripest berries from a row of 6 blueberries of different varieties. They all have a slightly odd taste that I have never detected in store bought blueberries. It is difficult to describe. My wife suggested it almost tastes like a hint of basil, or some similar 'grassy' note. I have read they can taste sour if you pick them too soon, but I wouldn't call this a sour taste.</p>

<p>Is this possibly just what these varieties taste like? Unfortunately I don't have the exact names of them.</p>

<p>What could cause blueberries to taste like this? Could this be a soil, watering or fertilising issue?</p>
","<p>Blueberries do have slightly varying tastes depending on the variety, but you seem to be suggesting you have several different varieties anyway. The other thing that happens, as they get very ripe, is the taste develops and changes slightly. I'd ask you to collect some of the others which are ripe, but perhaps not quite as ripe as the ones you've already picked, just to see if they taste different. Your question contains no information about growing conditions, soil emendment, feeding regime, amount of sun/water, etc., but given you've grown them successfully, I'm assuming they get enough sun/water, the soil ph is correct and they do have a cold period, or you'd be reporting problems with the plants generally.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that the ones you buy in the store have usually not been picked when bordering on over ripe; if they have been, they're often quite mushy compared to ones picked a little sooner. They can be picked when blue and when they come off the bush easily, so try a few which fit this description; they do not continue to ripen after picking (although legend has it that placing under ripe ones in a bag with a ripe apple will work).</p>

"How long do tomatoes live for?","5871","","<p>How long do tomatoes live for under ideal conditions?</p>

<p>Do different varietals have vastly different lifespans? </p>
","<p>Sue encouraged me to turn my comments into an answer. So, I'll try to make them meet the criteria.</p>

<p>I've only ever heard of tomatoes living a few to several years at the most. Ecnerwal's answer sounds pretty apt. However, I think it's possible for them to live much longer. That's me, though. Whatever the case, vigorous indeterminate tomatoes will probably live the longest. Determinate ones will probably die after they fruit unless you take cuttings of them or something. Indeterminate ones are supposed to grow and fruit indefinitely (until it frosts, if there is frost). Indefinitely is a long time, however. In reality, most indeterminate tomatoes will probably live until they get too diseased or run out of root room for too long, or run out of nutrients, or something. Pruning may or may not help. I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Ideal conditions would require an absence of disease-spreading bugs (e.g. aphids and whiteflies). In some areas, that means indoors. They need plenty of light, plenty of soil, fertilizer, enough calcium and temperature regulation. I find that tomatoes are actually easier to grow indoors in the fall/winter/spring than in summer (it's too consistently hot indoors then, in my main growing environment, but they still do reasonably well in the kitchen windowsill). Frost will kill tomatoes, normally, although some might survive a light frost.</p>

<p>Also, realize that you can take tomato cuttings. So, if it's really old and you want to keep the same plant going, that's one way to rejuvenate it, so-to-speak. It should work for both indeterminate and determinate tomatoes.</p>

"Improving water retention in potted plants","5863","","<p>I live in a temperate climate zone. I have plants on a west facing balcony- they get full  sun from about midday till sunset.

<p>The soil is ""light"" and the water passes through it quickly.</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p><strong>I am having trouble keeping them watered through dry spells, winter or summer. What can I do to make the soil retain more water?</strong> </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3XFmd.jpg"" alt=""lillypilly""></p>
","<p>One good thing you can do is to increase organic matter.  Organics, such as compost, act as sponges to absorb and hold moisture.  Organics do break down over time, so you will have to monitor the level of OM in your soil and replenish as necessary.</p>

<p>Another thing you can do is to add clay.  Clay is the very small particles in soil that is responsible for the dust you see when you drive on a gravelly road.  Clay particles are so small, that the surface area of the combined amount of clay is huge.  And surface area holds water.</p>

<p>See <a href=""http://www.soilandhealth.org/03sov/0302hsted/030201/03020100frame.html"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>here</strong></a> for a full explanation and some charts, as well as advice on dry-gardening in general.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Soil is capable of holding on to quite a bit of water, mostly by adhesion. For example, I'm sure that at one time or another you have picked up a wet stone from a river or by the sea. A thin film of water clings to its surface. This is adhesion. The more surface area there is, the greater the amount of moisture that can be held by adhesion. If we crushed that stone into dust, we would greatly increase the amount of water that could adhere to the original material. Clay particles, it should be noted, are so small that clay's ability to hold water is not as great as its mathematically computed surface area would indicate.</p>
  
  <p>This direct relationship between particle size, surface area, and water-holding capacity is so essential to understanding plant growth that the surface areas presented by various sizes of soil particles have been calculated. Soils are not composed of a single size of particle. If the mix is primarily sand, we call it a sandy soil. If the mix is primarily clay, we call it a clay soil. If the soil is a relatively equal mix of all three, containing no more than 35 percent clay, we call it a loam.</p>
  
  <p>Clayey soil can provide plants with three times as much available water as sand, six times as much as a very coarse sandy soil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The downside of clay is it can restrict the amount of oxygen to the roots, so careful adding too much clay.</p>

<p>Another type of clay, apart from the dusty stuff blowing around, is vermiculite.  Vermiculite will soak up water like a sponge.  Here is a fairly good article on verminculite vs perlite in potting soil: <a href=""http://worldseedsupply.org/blog/?p=113"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worldseedsupply.org/blog/?p=113</a></p>

<p>Vermiculite is some pretty good stuff.  It's exceeded only by humus in holding onto plant nutrients in the soil. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#Cation_exchange_capacity_.28CEC.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#Cation_exchange_capacity_.28CEC.29</a></p>

"What actually occurs for manure to become considered ""well-rotted""?","5836","","<p>I know that you shouldn't use raw manure on plants because it's bad for them, but I don't understand <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>I know you should stack manure before using it (i.e. literally stack it into a big cone), and wait until it no longer smells. How long would this process normally take? Is it different depending on the type of manure, e.g. chicken vs. cow vs. bat etc.</p>

<p>What is the mechanism in play that makes raw (or not well rotted) manure a bad thing for plants?</p>
","<p>There are multiple reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you use raw manure next to leafy plants or on root crops, you risk bacteria moving from the manure onto your food. E. coli isn't something you want on your food.</p></li>
<li><p>Chicken and bat manures are high in nitrogen. It's intense enough to burn your plants.</p></li>
<li><p>It can stink. If you dump a bunch of raw cow manure into a flower garden under your front window, your living room or front porch aren't going to be pleasant places to hang out.</p></li>
<li><p>The rotting/composting process allows a variety of little organisms to convert the nutrients in the manure into forms that are usable by the plants.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It's not really a blanket prohibition against using raw manures on <em>any</em> plants. I mix regular garden and kitchen wastes into my horse manure piles, and the cucumber and pumpkin volunteers from the kitchen waste thrive in the not-very-well-rotted manure. So I'm guessing that dumping a little semi-raw horse manure on those plants won't hurt.</p>

<p>As for length of time, it depends on several things:</p>

<ul>
<li>the animal (different animal manures have different carbon-to-nitrogen ratios)</li>
<li>bedding (which alters the C:N ratio)</li>
<li>size of pile</li>
<li>whether the pile is aerated regularly</li>
<li>whether the pile is wet or dry</li>
</ul>

<p>It's basically a composting process, so these are the same considerations you'd have for a compost pile.</p>

<p>I turn my horse manure piles regularly (I'm a compulsive composter) and they're pretty well cured within about 6 months. Unturned it can take a year or more. If we used different stall bedding it might take more or less time. If I wasn't mixing in chicken manure it would probably take longer (chicken manure adds more nitrogen and speeds things up). But if it was just a big pile of chicken manure, the chemistry works against you: too much nitrogen. Adding some carbon (leaves, wood chips, etc) would balance it out.</p>

"Bay Leaf Tree (Laurus Nobilis) with severe scale","5822","","<p>I'm new to gardening as I have just bought my first house.  I inherited a very large (about 6m tall) Bay tree that is severely sick.  I took a sample to my local garden center and I was told that it is infested with Aphids/Scale (I think they mean Scale as I don't see anything that looks like an aphid) and they are producing honeydew, which has also caused the tree to be covered with a sooty mould.  New leaves coming out are fine, but they soon succumb to the sickness.  I am carrying out the garden center's recommendations but just wanted to ask here to see if they are in line with what you would do in my situation.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I gave it a drench treatment of Thiamethoxam (following the directions for a 10m conifer) dissolved in 2 liters of water, as a systemic insecticide to hopefully kill the bugs feeding on it.  </p></li>
<li><p>Using a hand saw, I am now in the process of VERY aggressively pruning it back to basically just a pair of 3m high trunks with some main branches(as the tree is far too large anyway).  I will then scrub the sooty mould off with soap and water.  </p></li>
<li><p>I also bought an oil insecticide which I plan to apply to any leaves that are left.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is very severe and is infecting other trees in the neighbourhood, so it is important that I sort it out quickly.  I think my Bay is the epicenter as apparently Bay trees are very susceptible to scale.  </p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other advice for how to treat a 6m Bay tree for severe scale?  Is it OK to aggressively prune it back, as it is far too large?  Is there anything else I should know about taking care of my Bay?</strong></p>

<p>If it is important, I live in Cape Town, South Africa.  We are in Spring, going in to Summer.  The soil is sandy to loamy and we have already had most of our rain - our summers are dry and hot and our winters cold and wet.  </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  As requested, here are a few pics of my tree.  Hope this is sufficient to identify the species, I'm not sure what to look at.  I was told it is a Bay leaf tree (the kind you can use in curries).  It is aromatic when you cut it.  The tree has a silvery brown bark with some nodules and lots of scarring where the trunks have been damaged and pruned.  The fresh leaves are oval-shaped and bright green, older leaves seem to be a dark green but there are no older parts that are not severely infected.  At a guess I'd say the tree is between 30 and 100 years old (the houses here are about 100 years old) and the tree is well loved by my neighbours (and me) so I definitely want it to survive.  On the advice of the garden center I have got stuck in with a saw but I'm postponing doing any more pruning until I hear more from this forum.</p>

","<p>The problem with a large tree like this is that trying to spray it requires professional equipment.  Even with a pressurized sprayer you will get whatever you are spraying drifting onto to neighbors or public property.</p>

<p>In North America you would be opening yourself up for possible legal action by doing this.  As you will not get complete coverage and scale that has not hatched yet may not be affected by the spray you will have to spray at least three times at five to seven day intervals.</p>

Please note, I'm not saying ""Milorganite"" is a bad product, or there aren't other good ""organic"" lawn fertilizers on the market for homeowners to buy, it's just that I've settled on those four products for my lawn fertilizer needs/requirements...</p>

<p>Below is based on personal experience (I'm not a dog owner), a friends experience (dog owner), and I don't have any real science to back-up my thoughts.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>My friend uses a non-organic (chemical) fertilizer on this lawn, it's the only thing we really disagree on when it comes to lawn care.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He applies the fertilizer (with some kind of added <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbicides"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">herbicide</a>) per the instructions on the bag.</p></li>
<li><p>He then keeps his dog locked indoors for 3 days after applying the fertilizer, not ""normal"" for him to-do-so seeing as his dog is generally outside most of the day. The perimeter of his garden is installed with a buried electrical fence and the dog has a special attachment fixed to his collar that works with the electrical fence ie The dog stays within the confines of the garden without the need of a physical barrier (fenced in garden).</p></li>
<li><p>After 3 days, the dog is allowed to do as he pleases ie He's back outside enjoying the outdoors.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I apply the ""organic"" Bradfield and Ringer fertilizers per the instructions on the bags.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I tell my neighbours I've done so and suggest they may wish to keep their children and pets of my lawn for a day (24 hours).</p></li>
<li><p>I don't let my two boys on the lawn for a day.</p></li>
<li><p>After a day I really don't care who or what is on my lawn -- not quite true ""Get off my lawn"".</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>One thing we both agree on (when it comes to lawn fertilizers), there's no way on earth we would let one of those <em>well known</em> national (or local) lawn care companies apply anything to our lawns.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Allowing them to <strong>only</strong> apply fertilizer carries low to medium risk, even the ""super"" strength chemical fertilizers (not available over the counter to the average homeowner) they are licensed to use/apply.</p></li>
<li><p>The trouble is, they ""normally"" don't want to <strong>only</strong> apply fertilizer, instead they ""usually"" want to apply a fertilizer with some kind of added <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pesticide</a>. Now the risk is high to off the charts.</p></li>
<li><p>As far as I'm aware, most local authorities require such lawn care companies to ""flag"" gardens (place small flags in the ground) they have treated ie Warn people the garden has been treated with some kind of chemical lawn treatment. Without being an alarmist or conspiracy type person, I honestly don't think that can be a good thing -- think about, they are required to warn the passing public they have put down some kind of chemical lawn treatment...</p></li>
<li><p>When I take my daily evening walk, I can tell the lawn care companies have been out before I see any ""flags"". <strong>How?</strong> By the (unbelievably) strong ""chemical"" smell in the air.</p></li>
<li><p>My friend with the dog is the same, plus he has to take his dog on zig-zag walks (switching back and forth across the street) to avoid those treated gardens. He does this, as he and his dog learnt the hard-way -- one time the dog burnt his paws on one of those treated lawn, which resulted in a visit to the vet and sore paws for a week or two...</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summing up:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>""Organic"" lawn fertilizers carry zero to low risk.</p></li>
<li><p>""Organic"" lawn fertilizers with added <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pesticides</a> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbicides"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">herbicides</a>) carry zero to low risk.</p></li>

"How should I properly prepare a raised bed vegetable garden?","5806","","<p>When building a raised bed for a vegetable garden, what do I need to do to properly prepare the soil? It is going to be mixed with different types of vegetables and herbs that I will rotate out all year long. </p>

<p>Should I buy the more expensive garden soil? Or use essentially use top soil and add the necessary fertilizers?</p>
","<p>I don't know about ""properly"", but what we have done on three beds (and it seems to work) is:</p>

<p>Start with roughly 50/50 mix of cheap topsoil bags (tend to be very sandy) and the more expensive garden soil/compost. This will settle to perhaps 50–60% of the alleged contents of the bags. So keep topping up over the next few years when the beds are empty.</p>

<p>Although I might occasionally add the cheap topsoil bags to a young bed that requires a lot of topping-up, I usually top up with ""Shrub compost"" (Lowes sell it in big bags intended for trees and shrubs, but it seems to work very well for peppers and tomatoes); our home-made compost; and ""used"" potting compost (i.e. from pots which have had plants in them).</p>

"Restoring overwatered rosemary","5802","","<p>I have several rosemary bushes in the backyard; I live in San Francisco and rosemary thrives here.</p>

<p>However, the landlord overwatered one of the bushes for several months.  It's now got some kind of fungus or root-rot which causes it to look unhealthy and the leaves on some branches to turn yellow.  Since then, I've removed the soaker hose he put there, and have been letting it dry out.  It doesn't seem to be getting better though.</p>

<p>My question is: is there a way I can rescue this rosemary bush?  Should I expect it to recover with mostly dry soil and infrequent watering?  Or is it doomed at this point and I should rip it out and plant another one?</p>
","<p>I'm actually going to answer my own question, because it turned out that the answer above was not correct.  I got some offline advice, and what I did instead was:</p>

<ol>
<li>Aggressively prune back the rosemary, cutting off all the yellowed branches.</li>
<li>Water it infrequently for the next month, allowing it to dry out between waterings.</li>

"What are the pros and cons of rubber vs wood mulches?","5754","","<p>This question is just concerning the realm of landscaping for flowers around a house.  We need to add mulch again this year, as the previous mulch has broken down enough that there are some thin spots and some spots not covered at all.</p>

<p>We noticed that every place now carries rubber mulch.  Would this also be good to use in our various flower boxes around the house?  What would be the benefits and drawbacks?  If rubber mulch lasts indefinitely, how long does it keep its color?</p>
","<p>Rubber mulch is a better insulator which may be important in very hot or very cold climates. It also doesn't absorb or retain water which helps keep it weed free since weed seeds won't germinate in it like they can in some other types of mulches. It will last a long time. Different agencies and labs have tested the use of rubber mulch in playgrounds and found it to be safe to people and the environment. I have seen some sources state that rubber mulch used approved for playgrounds may be safer but I'm not sure. </p>

<p>It will eventually break down in 20, 30 maybe more years. When/as it breaks down the stuff the tires are made from I guess would wind up in the soil which I can't imagine is good. Also, some chemicals used by some tire manufacturers may leach into the soil. </p>

<p>I did find this one account of <a href=""http://grilloservices.com/grillo-blog/buying-or-have-rubber-mulch-learn-the-dangers-of-this-seemingly-innocent-product/"">health issues from rubber mulch</a> along with this <a href=""http://www.ehhi.org/reports/turf/"">linked report</a>. This other well-referenced document discusses some <a href=""http://www.natureswayresources.com/DocsPdfs/RubberMulch.pdf"">issues with rubber mulch</a>.</p>

<p>It's still fairly new and I wonder if people are pushing it because they don't know what to do with all these used tires. </p>

<p>Natural mulches feed the soil and increase biodiversity. That's one of the main reasons I use it. I didn't use mulch in the past and I notice a big difference in the soil now compared to years ago.</p>

<p>Some people have an issue with <a href=""http://personal.psu.edu/faculty/d/d/ddd2/"">shotgun fungus</a> (aka artillery fungus) with wood mulch. It appears to be more of a problem with wood instead of bark mulches and cedar, redwood and cypress do not appear to be affected because they decompose slower. I believe licorice root mulch is also less prone to shotgun fungus.</p>

<p>I like to use cedar mulch. It's a little more expensive but I like the look and smell plus it lasts longer Every spring I fluff it up and spread it out evenly. Every 2 or 3 years I may need to add a little more. After the first season it turns grey. I don't mind the color but I've been thinking about using mulch dyes.</p>

<p>I really want to switch to compost as mulch Looks like black dyed mulch (which I like) and is even better for the soil. I'm not quite making enough compost to use in the garden yet and have left over for mulch. I might have to buy the initial compost and then hopefully be able to replenish it with what I make.</p>

" Is it a good idea to build a paver patio near a large established tree?","5739","","<p>I would like to build a paver patio next to a large tree that has a 3"" wide root at ground level.  I do not want to damage the roots of the tree, so it seems like my only option is to build a raised paver patio.  If I do build a raised paver patio what material should be used for the perimeter? I assume the roots will be a problem when building the perimeter, for instance if I need to bury the perimeter 4"" deep how do I deal with roots that may only be 1"" deep?  Am I putting the tree at risk by burying the surface roots under a patio?  I've considered building a raised deck instead, but I would really prefer a paver patio.  Are there any other options for dealing with a situation like this?</p>

<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>Edit: I believe the tree is a New Zealand Christmas tree.  It's 20'-25' tall.  The patio would be about 5' away from the trunk.</p>
","<p>Established trees like things just the way they are.  I killed a tree by doing just what you are planning.  The reason that trees don't take well to grade changes is that most of their roots are within 6"" of the surface.  An substantial amount of gas and water exchange goes on in the soil near the surface.</p>

<p>If you build over the roots it is like putting a blanket on someone's face.  The tree roots cannot breathe.</p>

<p>Roots will grow out as least as far as the drip line of the branch farthest from the trunk. If you still want to build a patio you should not cover more than one third of the total area under the drip line of the tree. The roots will die in this area but will regrow.</p>

"Plants to dry out a soggy lawn","5733","","<p>I live in the north of England (where it's fairly wet) and have a section of lawn near a fence that is quite mossy and boggy. </p>

<p>I cannot put any drainage pipe in, because the only place to run the water would be into the next door neighbour's driveway ... the run-off water already heads that way but to put in deliberate pipes would not be a good idea.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that I plant a line of shrubs or bushes along the fence line to help dry out the soil. </p>

<p>I have talked to the local gardening stores (who were not very informative) and searched on Google (but I don't know the right search terms).</p>

<p>What I am looking for is a plant that grows no more than 6ft high, preferably 3-4ft and likes water. The current suggestion is a large number of different colored heather (which so far is looking possible).</p>

<p>Update: The site is along a fence line. Width is anything up to 18in or so. It gets the sun from early morning till late afternoon. Not sure about the soil acidity at the moment. It can be built up if needed. I would classify the soil as very soft and damp for most of the year.</p>

<p>Update #2: Width could be wider if I can get a better looking border. The reason the lawn is wet is that any rain (and we tend to get a reasonable amount) falls on the patch of grass outside my fence (public land) which then flows down onto my lawn and then off to the neighbour's. My lawn is flatter and hence the water pools there. The sewers and fresh water supply pipes are far enough away from the wet patches and should be fine, I have recently had the plans from the council detailing where they are. The area does begin to dry out if we have several hot days in a row, so I think that if we actually get a summer it might dry out completely.</p>
","<p>Odd suggestion, Heathers - both Calluna and Erica like open, sunny situations, in well drained soil, but which isn't drought prone. That's not the same thing as a permanently wet and boggy situation, so I wouldn't recommend either family of heathers for this situation.</p>

<p>I don't know whether you can make a border along there, and if you can, how deep it could be from front to back, but as you've got this nice, wet, boggy area, I'd suggest you use plants which love that and create a mixed border with them.</p>

<p>Suggestions include: Gaultheria and Andromeda (both shrubs) but the latter can only be used if the soil is lime free, or acidic in nature. Perennials which would do well in such a situation are: Ligularia; Astilbe; Darmera; Gunnera (gets really large); Hosta; Persicaria; Rodgersia; Trollius; Zantedeschia aethiopica 'Crowborough' (this one's hardy outside, unlike other varieties of this plant); Filipendula; Cimicifuga; Lythrum; Primula; Lysimachia; Caltha. Some of the sedge type grasses will work there too, have a look at Carex and Cyperus varieties. Also 3 ferns will like that situation: Matteuccia; Onoclea; Osmunda.</p>

<p>Some of these will require more sun or shade than others, so bear that in mind when considering choices. There are some smaller Salix (willow) varieties that will grow well there, but most of them tend to spread rapidly below ground, so it may not be a good idea to use any of them if the border isn't large.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I see your comment says 18 inches depth to the area - that makes an attractive, varied height mixed border difficult to achieve because all the plants will be in a row, so would be useful if you could widen the border along there. Salix (willows) soak up a lot of water - but all would need much more space than that because of their rapidly increasing roots. </p>

<p>I'm wondering why that area is so wet - if it's lower than the rest of the garden, then maybe that's why, but is it possible you've got a leak from a supply pipe, or from the sewer system, or it's sitting over a spring of some kind. If you've not done so already, might be worth investigating why that area is so troublesome, if it's the only spot where this happens.</p>

"Why is there concrete buried across my entire backyard?","5711","","<p>As I was planting a few fruit trees last weekend, I discovered an odd and very annoying phenomenon. About 6"" down from ground level, I ran across a 2"" layer of really crumbly concrete/gravel mixture. Beneath that was clay for as far as I dug. The dirt above the concrete layer was slightly better quality topsoil.</p>

<p>I found this in every one of the holes I dug for the trees, which spanned a length over 60' about 10' away from my privacy fence. (The trees were dwarf fruit trees, hence the closer spacing. The recommended separation between trees was 15'.)</p>

<p>At first I thought I discovered some sort of massive French drain covering the entire backyard. But when I looked closer, I realized it wasn't just gravel - it was actually crumbly concrete. Does anyone have any idea why this was in my backyard? And will it significantly affect the trees I just planted?</p>
","<p>Who knows? There could be lots of reasons. It <em>might</em> have been to help drainage (although proper rounded gravel probably does this better), but it might be just builder's fill - and a bulldozer leveled it out before the final top soil was added.</p>

<p>A large number (majority?) of urban backyards in the US are made of varying degrees of builder's fill. All they are doing is leveling it out with whatever is lying around, what was dug out, demolished, etc. Older houses tend to fare better (but have the most 'history' from previous owners instead) - newer houses tend to be worse.</p>

When the plants are as far along as yours are, flowers not opening can be a sign of stress. Sometimes it happens when you have a squash vine borer, but in your case, I think it is because the plants are much too close together. I plant my zucchini in raised beds, and each plant gets a 3' x 3' area to itself. They are huge plants and need space. </p>

<p>If they are closed still, they are not yet mature. They will open, and once they do you will notice them open during the day. </p>

<p>Your first flowers are likely to all be male flowers, so you will not get any fruit from them. After a flush of all male flowers, you'll start noticing a mix of male flowers and female flowers. The female flowers will have a small bulge in the stem at the base of the flower. This bulge will become the fruit once the flower is pollinated.</p>

","<p>My opinion* is you should grow as high as you can reach without the runners affecting other plants. If they want grow higher, trim them. Above all, don't do anything that would cause you to miss picking ripe pods!</p>

<p>The point of growing beans is to harvest as many pods as possible, with the possible secondary purpose of putting nitrogen back into the soil as part of a rotation (but that's not relevant to plant height). Thus the principal <strong>downsides to allowing the beans to grow too high</strong> are:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can’t reach the beans (especially if you're petite) and so you don't pick them promptly causing the plant to decide it's fulfilled its biological purpose and shutdown.</li>
<li>Energy is unnecessarily expended in growing more infrastructure (runners) rather than flowers that would become beans. &lt; <em>EDIT: This is wrong. See comment.</em></li>
<li>If you did, instead, trim the plant at the top, it would make more lateral branches and so fill in usable space at the top of the trellis where reachable beans would grow.</li>

<p>The <strong>downsides to allowing your beans to grow on to another plant</strong> when you already have separate trellising:</p>

<ol>
<li>The beans are more difficult to pick, increasing the risk of missing a ripe pod, causing the same problem of the plant deciding to shut down.</li>
<li>The runners could damage the other plant when they entwine around it.</li>

I have moved it into a much larger 14"" pot and am wondering if there is anything I need to do to promote fruiting in the plant. It seems to be thriving rather nicely.</p>

<p>Blossoms appear to be beginning to form, but I am wondering if there is anything special I need to do to encourage fruit or have I done everything I need to do?</p>
","<p>Here are a few things you can do to promote fruiting in your tomato plant.</p>

<h3>1. Remove the suckers</h3>

<p>Suckers are the small offshoots that rise from between the central stem and a leaf node (see image). Suckers need to be removed periodically (aas soon as you see them), as they only suck essential nutrients from the plant, which could otherwise have been used to produce a bigger fruit. </p>

<p>You can easily remove these suckers by pinching with your fingers and shaking them loose. You don't need a blade or pruning shears to remove it (and it is recommended that you don't cut the sucker flat, close to the base as that wound takes longer to heal than a wound at the node).</p>

<p>You'll find that the suckers closer to the top are tiny and easier to pinch off than the ones in the bottom. If, by chance, you haven't tended to them by now and if your suckers are <em>really</em> strong, there is a technique called <em>Missouri pruning</em>, in which you only pinch off the tips of the suckers. The drawback is that you'll have to keep tending to suckers that shoot off from these. You can read more about pruning tomatoes <a href=""http://www.finegardening.com/how-to/articles/pruning-tomatoes.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. The image is also from that website, however I couldn't find a direct link to it.</p>

<h3>2. Remove leaves close to the ground &amp; ones in the shade.</h3>

<p>The primary purpose of a leaf is photosynthesis. It needs to produce energy for the rest of the plant. If your leaves are in the shade, there is net energy loss (i.e., they consume more than they produce). It is a good idea to remove these leaves so that the energy is directed upward towards the fruits.</p>

<p>As shown in the picture, some people advocate pruning the plant below the first fruiting cluster, so as to promote airflow and provide it space to grow. I have never done this and my plants have been doing fine. However, I do plan on trying this out with my plants this summer.</p>

<h3>3. Provide adequate support.</h3>

<p>I cannot emphasize this enough. Tomato plants are easily damaged either by winds knocking down unrestrained plants or snapping due to the weight of the fruits. As such, you'll need to provide good support for them either by enclosing them in a cage (see related questions: [<a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/895/do-i-need-to-manage-my-tomato-cage"">1</a>, <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/122/what-are-inexpensive-materials-for-homemade-tomato-cages"">2</a>]) or by using a stake. The article linked above also has some good tips on securing tomato plants (the following figure is also from the same page). In brief, you tie the plants to 1) train them and 2) to secure them. In training, you need to tie the leader to the support loosely so as to guide it upwards. Once you have a fruiting cluster, you need to support it by looping the tie around the fruiting vine.</p>

"Can  jalapeños be grown from pickled jalapeño seeds?","5579","","<p>I bought a bottle of pickled jalapeno today, and I see there are seeds inside them.</p>

<p>It is hard for my local area to acquire jalapeno seeds, so I am wondering if it is possible to grow jalapenos from these seeds in the pickled jalapenos.</p>

<p>The juice is made with water, salt and acidity regulator.</p>
","<p>Most likely no.</p>

<p>The pickling process typically boils the bottles to a point that kills any organisms in order to prevent spoilage -- this includes the seeds.</p>

<p>(I say ""most likely"" because some pickling processes are done cold and use a more natural sort of fermentation. But unless you got your pickled peppers at a very traditional sort of shop or from an old-school farmer at a farmers' market, they've been boiled and the seeds will not grow.)</p>

<p>Beyond the processing issue, even if the seeds were viable, if your peppers happen to be a hybrid variety, you won't get plants that produce the same fruit.</p>

<p>Considering that you can get 100 viable jalapeno seeds for under US$2, it's really not worth bothering trying to salvage the debris off the bottom of the pickle jar...</p>

"How can I safely transplant blueberry bushes planted in the spring before the winter hits?","5578","","<p>If all goes according to plan, I will be moving this winter to another location.  I currently have two blueberry bushes I planted last spring, purchased from Gurney's.  I'm wondering what the procedure might be to transplant a plant like this given that it was only planted a few months ago.  Is it better to leave the young plants and get new ones next season?</p>

<p>My only concern is whether the plant has a good chance of surviving the transplanting.  I've considered moving them into pots now before the freezes come in southeastern PA.  Is that recommended with it so close to frost?</p>
","<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when transplanting blueberries.</p>

<ol>
<li>Blueberries like slightly acidic soil. So if it's growing well now, it sure does like the soil. When you transplant it to a pot and later to your new place, you should ensure that the pH levels are about the same so that the plant doesn't suffer a shock over and above that from regular transplanting.</li>
<li>Blueberries don't have very deep roots. They have a crazy mess of shallow fibrous roots which can easily get damaged when the frost hits especially if it's not established.</li>
</ol>

<p>That said, if you can ensure that the plant gets the same pH at your new place and if you dig enough around the plant to not really disturb the roots all that much, I think you have a shot at transplanting the plant. Also, since blueberry season is generally in July-August, the plant should be able to shake off the shocks (if you keep it to a minimum by being careful) and establish itself by then. Blueberries typically bear fruit year after year till it grows very old. Hence if properly done, transplanting shouldn't affect fruit production (maybe slightly decreased the first year). </p>

<p>Transplanting is a bigger problem with berries that produce fruit only on year old canes, as the shock can reset the plant's internal clock. When I transplanted my established year old blackberry plant a little over a year ago, it went into severe shock and lost all the canes it had produced and shriveled back to just a little stub and stayed that way till spring. This year should've been its second (fruit producing), but instead it started putting out new canes vigorously (now I understand why it's a weed in some places...). So although the clock was reset, the plant is still very healthy and will (hopefully) fruit next year.</p>

<p>All this said, I second bstpierre's pragmatic answer. Sometimes the trouble of waiting and going through the hassle twice (once to the pot and then to the ground) might just not be worth it. But if I were you, I would get a new one <em>and</em> transplant the old one, just to experiment with it and see if it works or not; that sure is a good way to learn and you'll have first hand experience at transplanting and also first hand knowledge of what happens to doubly transplanted blueberry bushes!</p>

"Why is my pear tree dying around the blossoms?","5569","","<p>Shortly after the blossoms fell on my pear, areas around the blossoms started to turn black and die. This is spreading. Although the dead areas tend to be on the end of the branches, there are exceptions where a branch may have 2 or 3 dead zones along the length of the branch. Each is centered on a blossom. The dead zones do not have fruit - not all of the blossom locations are dead, and some have small fruit starting to form. However over half are dead.</p>

<p>Location: North Texas. We had a mild winter with relatively few proper frosts, and it cannot have gone below the mid-25s.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dwmAI.jpg"" alt=""Detail view of some of the branches, showing the dead spots""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UYmzr.jpg"" alt=""Overall view, showing the mean dead spots throughout the tree""></p>
","<p>This is <strong>Fire Blight</strong>, a bacterial infection commonly spread by bees and other 
pollinators. Hence the infection usually starts at the blossoms. It typically extends 
into the branches and twigs, but is often localized. It can, however spread into the 
tree (especially a weakened tree). Death is inevitable if the infection reaches the 
roots.</p>

<p>Pears are especially susceptible, but it can also infect apples and roses. Infections of 
hawthorns, cotoneaster, and mountain ash are also not unknown.</p>

<p>The bacteria (<em>Erwinia amylovora</em>) turns dormant or dies with frost, so outbreaks 
tend to be more severe after a mild winter.</p>

<p>Treatment with antibiotics only works before infection, and is strongly discouraged due to 
the evolution of disease resistance.</p>

<p>Copper sprays may also have some effectiveness if applied as blossoms open out. These are ineffective against existing infections.</p>

<p>Instead, treatment should be by removing the infected branches. Shears should be dipped 
in bleach between each cut in order to disinfect them and to avoid spreading the infection 
further. Cuts should be a few inches back from the visible infection. Typically the 
core of a branch will be infected below the visible damage.</p>

I have a neighbor below me and don't want any water dripping down on her patio. </p>

<p>Are there any suggestions that you can make to efficiently water my plants? I have some saucers but I feel like they don't always allow for adequate drainage. Would an earth box or a DIY version of that be a better system? Perhaps raising my plants on something to get them off the ground? </p>

<p>Curious if anyone else has any suggestions.</p>
","<p>It's not easy - I also have a balcony with 3 others beneath. Frankly, I don't worry about it too much, I just water and let it run, but I am careful to water only in the evening, preferably just before dusk, when its unlikely anyone else will be on their balconies. I'm also careful with the amount - if the pot is very large and bone dry, I'll water with 2 litres, then come back half and hour later and give it more, so that water does not flood straight out of the bottom but actually gets retained in the compost. If its not bone dry, it'll get about 2.5 litres, but that's for a pot 2 feet deep and 12 inches wide containing a couple of climbers.</p>

<p>I do use trays underneath pots, particularly in summer when smaller pots dry out so quickly in hot sunshine, but I don't have anything beneath the very large pots or troughs. The bore with trays is you have to go back and empty them out after 30 minutes, and remember that they will collect water when the weather is cool and wet, and very few plants like standing in water. Standing pots on earth trays isn't a good idea - the roots of any plant in the pots will go through the bottom and root into the earth tray. Equally, standing them on something to raise them off the ground will not prevent water running out.</p>

"Will my lime tree recover from cold shock?","5536","","<p>This is my first attempt to grow something and it hasn't started off well. During the last winter, my Persian lime tree wasn't protected well enough from a cold front. All the leaves fell off, and the bark became brittle. I assumed it had died and was planning to uproot it in the spring. </p>

<p>When spring came around, I noticed at the very base, almost even with the soil, new leaves began to sprout. Today, even though there are 5-6 new branches forming,they are only at the base, and there is no sign of life on the rest of the tree.</p>

I had a person tell me that could happen, but I can't find any evidence to back that claim. If there is a possibility, then with the plant being so young, I might be better off starting over.

<p>Persian limes are are sterile triploids, hence no seeds. What that means is the tree itself is a hybrid which was grafted onto the rootstock of a completely different citrus variety.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor: Get out your loppers, close your eyes, and give the remains a proper burial (but don't really close your eyes as that would be very dangerous). If you're essentially starting from scratch anyway, at least start out with a healthy, new tree. You may even consider looking into a variety that is just a bit more cold tolerant for your area.</p>

"Get rid of weeds from my raised garden bed - without pesticides","5533","","<p>I bought a house that came with a rather large (8' x 50') raised (well, raised only 4"") garden bed. It is infested with weeds. Last summer I planted some vegetables in it but spent most of the time pulling out weeds. I dumped a bunch of woodchips over the soil to try to help with managing the weeds, and only spread the parts where I was planting my veggies and then covered up around them when they grew taller. It worked somewhat, but I have much more success keeping my used car tire planters, that have fresh soil, weed free.</p>

<p>Assuming that I am not interested in eating chemicals, what is the best way to move forward? My wife wants me to get rid of the tires since they are an eye sore. Should I remove all the existing soil and get new soil? Or should I get more woodchips? Are there any tricks of the trade here? I'm ok starting with a fresh slate and replanting anew.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>IMPE, the main problem with hand-weeding an 8 foot by 50 foot bed (I did a 5x50 myself once) is that there's way too much in one bed - and the middle is hard to reach. I have re-bedded and shrunk my bed size twice since then.</p>

<p>I'd start with digging 18-24"" wide right down the middle, and put in a path there. Now you have two 3 or 3-1/2 foot by 50 foot beds, and you can actually reach the middle of the beds from the paths. Next, divide each 50 foot long bed into 8 to 12 beds - you can just use ""lawn edging plastic"" if you want to keep the maximum amount of dirt, or you can break it up more with additional cross-paths, or take over more total area but add paths to break it up more but maintain the planting area too.</p>

<p>NOW you have beds of a manageable size, 3-1/2 x 8 feet at the biggest, and you can go out and weed ONE of those, <strong>completely</strong>, in a reasonable time. Just keep doing that. So long as you keep weeding and never leave a bed so long that the weeds can go to seed, this will work. The more you do it, the faster it gets, because there will be fewer and smaller weeds each time.</p>

<p>I found that I could NOT work a huge bed the same way, precisely because it's huge. Having a defined area with hard edges makes a huge difference.</p>

<p>It's also easier to do things like ""solarizing"" a bed (cover with plastic to cook pernicious weeds) if it's not the whole garden at once.</p>

<p>Car tire planters have the advantage (per my findings) of having limited area. However, if your wife considers them an immutable eyesore, that's clearly not going to fly. I recall people painting them, and cutting one sidewall/bead, then turning the tire inside out, either or both being considered ""a appearance improvement"" by people offended by black tires with the tread showing. Your wife may not be convinced, but it might be worth a try.</p>

<p>Quite curious about how hardy this plant is. How long can it really last without water?</p>
","<p>There is no ""exact"" answer to this question, but it appears you already know the minimum it can last without water by your own unintended experiment. Though not a perfect answer, I hope the following can help you out. </p>

<p><strong>Succulents need water</strong> - it's commonly known (almost to the point of being an exaggerated myth) that succulents and cacti need very little water. This is true, but all plants need water. The amount and frequency, especially for succulents and cacti, depend on a wide variety of factors including light exposure, medium and substrates, soil, drainage. Regardless, they need to be watered occasionally.</p>

<p><strong>But think about their natural habitat</strong> - Consider the natural habitat of succulents. Dry and arid, these environments often go weeks, months, and (very rarely) years without a good watering. But when it rains, it pours and saturates the soil, allowing a replenishing of the succulent's stores of water. </p>

<p><strong>So...</strong> As imperfect as it is, I would propose that <em>the duration a succulent can last without water is positively correlated with soil saturation and inversely correlated with drainage and evaporation rate</em>. I never water my succulents or aloe, and they're perfectly healthy. The rainfall, which has recently been rare in drought-stricken California, soaks the soil periodically and since mine are in partial shade that moisture stays. </p>

","<p>Pothos or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epipremnum_aureum"" rel=""noreferrer"">Epripremium aureum</a> is a fascinating plant and a reliable house plant. Botanists could not believe the difference between the mature form, a vine over sixty feet tall that climbs up trees, and the juvenile form which is a weak climber that never flowers and might reach six feet.</p>

<p>If these plants are well established it is normal for them to loose older leaves on the stem.  You will only find the larger leaves up to six inches across in humid conditions with bright diffuse light.</p>

<p>They are not frost hardy and should not be exposed to temperatures less than about fifteen degrees Celsius. (perhaps as low as five degrees in a sheltered location).</p>

<p>@Geek asks about getting pothos to climb.  Many Florida growers are now offering pothos which has been grown up a split log or other surface.  You can do this to if you provide the right conditions.  Pothos naturally grows roots from the nodal points of each stem.

<p>There is a lot of misinformation concerning blueberries.  Blueberries don't like Nitrates, as in Ammonium Nitrate.  Blueberries prefer the Ammonium, but the Nitrate can kill fine roots.  Blueberries should always be fertilized with Ammonium Sulfate.  Many garden supply shops will recommend Aluminum Sulphate because it makes the soil acid.  Do NOT use Aluminum anything on anything you want to live!  Especially blueberries, which are sensitive to all sort of things (salt, moisture levels, ph due to iron availability).</p>

<p>Read <a href=""http://pubs.cas.psu.edu/freepubs/pdfs/AGRS097h.pdf"">http://pubs.cas.psu.edu/freepubs/pdfs/AGRS097h.pdf</a> for more info.</p>

<p>Here is another article I thought applicable:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s the conspiracy: how have they (whoever they are) managed to hide the knowledge that Calcium is such an important element in all living things? In plants, animals and humans, adequate Calcium is absolutely essential for life. But just about the only mention Calcium gets in soil science is as a pH modifier. If you think your lawn or garden grows better after you lime it because you changed the pH, I have a newsflash for you: Calcium is the single biggest growth stimulant in plants. <strong>pH is a measure of free Hydrogen ions in water. It measures Hydrogen ion concentration, H+ and OH-, and that’s all it does. One can change the soil pH with any acid or alkali. You can raise the pH with sodium hydroxide, which is lye, drain cleaner, or lower it with hydrochloric acid, for instance, but they aren’t going to give you much growth stimulus.</strong> They will probably kill the plant. A slightly acid pH of about 6 or 6.5 is ideal, because it gives just the right amount of electrical conductivity in the soil, but plants aren’t nearly as finicky about pH as they are about having the right balance of soil minerals.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Rhododendrons, for instance, are supposed to require an acid soil. What they really prefer is a high Magnesium soil.</strong> Experimenters in Scotland raised the pH of soil from 5.0 to nearly 8.0 with Magnesium Carbonate, and the rhodies grew better and better as the soil pH went up because the Magnesium level was going up. <strong>pH had little to do with it.</strong></p>
  
  <p>So, this is a good thing to know if you are trying to grow rhododendrons in New Mexico, for instance, where the soil is frequently alkaline to start with, although there you would want to use an acid form of Magnesium like Magnesium sulfate, <strong>Epsom salts.</strong> But your garden, your farm crops and your fruits and berries wouldn’t necessarily like it (except the <strong>blueberries</strong>). High levels of Magnesium in relation to Calcium are common in Organic gardening and farming, though, because people are told to lime their soils with dolomite lime, which is high in Magnesium.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.soilminerals.com/AgricolaII.htm"">http://www.soilminerals.com/AgricolaII.htm</a></p>

<p>Ph is an indication of a proper nutrient balance, not the cause of it.  There is only one proper nutrient combination, but there are many ways to change soil ph.</p>

<p>The main difference between raspberries and blueberries (nutritionally) is that blueberries prefer a little more magnesium in relation to potassium than raspberries.  Otherwise, the N, P, Ca levels are the same between the two.  If you should happen to splash some epsom salt or ammonium sulfate mix onto the raspberries, I'm sure it wouldn't hurt them.</p>

<p>Now if you start asking about pear and blueberry combinations, then we'll have a problem.  Pear requires significantly more Ca than blueberry and the two just wouldn't get along.  Your pears would taste like cardboard.  Even the deer wouldn't eat them.  And the pear trees would be very unhealthy, possibly having fire blight.  Ask me how I know this :)</p>

How hot it can get depends on your set up and climate and other variables, but managing it is a pretty active and important aspect of the process.</p>

<p><a href=""http://whatcom.wsu.edu/ag/compost/fundamentals/needs_temperature.htm"">From some information from Washington State University-</a></p>

<p>I am not sure if you are <em>worried</em> about the temperature, however in terms of safety bear in mind the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eggs of parasites, cysts and flies have survived in compost stacks for days when the temperature in the interior of the stack is around 135° F. Since a higher temperature can be readily maintained during a large part of the active composting period, all the material should be subjected to a temperature of at least 150° F for safety.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In terms of the temperature dynamics of the compost:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Experience shows that turning to release the heat of compost piles, which have become so hot (170°-180° F.) that bacterial activity is inhibited, is not very effective. When the material is actively decomposing, the temperature, which falls slightly during turning, will return to the previous level in two or three hours. Also, it is impossible to bring about any significant drop in temperature by watering the material without water logging the mass... Variations in moisture content between 30% and 75% have little effect on the maximum temperature in the interior of the pile. The initial temperature rises a little more rapidly when the moisture content is 30% to 50% than when it is 70%... Deeper piles caused higher temperatures and better temperature distribution, and subject more material to a high temperature at any one time. Hence, <a href=""http://whatcom.wsu.edu/ag/compost/fundamentals/needs_carbon_nitrogen.htm"">the actual mass of the material evolving heat is important in providing adequately high temperatures*</a>.</p>

<li>training starts when you plant the tree. The first three years are a critical time to establish the overall shape. When you first plant a whip or young tree cut it back to two to three feet tall. This helps ensure a smaller mature height.</li>
<li>one of the goals of pruning is to have less fruit that is larger. Look to thin branches at the top to let more light in the centre</li>
<li>prune well before flowering to promote growth. Mid winter pruning works well in USDA zone 4. Thanks to Michelle for pointing out that if you do not want new growth then prune in mid to late summer.</li>
<li>winter or spring pruning includes removing broken branches, crossing or branches that rub together.  </li>
<li><a href=""http://cesonoma.ucdavis.edu/files/27164.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this publication</a> has an excellent summary of how to shape growth by pruning. In summary:

"What is a 'Perched Water Table'?","5357","","<p>In gardening, especially container gardening, you will run into the phenomenon called a 'Perched Water Table' (PWT). What is a perched water table, and how does it work?</p>
","<p>Well, basically, the perched table is the saturation point, where the capillary action in the soil is canceled out by the force of gravity. Every type of growing media has a different perched table. Capillary action will pull water up from a certain point, and below that point, gravity keeps the water from moving up. The size of the container does not affect the height at which the perched table occurs. See the figure below.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PnhHC.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.pwk.resteddoginn.ca/soilmix.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is, in every pot, what is called a ""perched water table"" (PWT). This is water that occupies a layer of soil that is always saturated and will not drain at the bottom of the pot. It can evaporate or be used by the plant, but physical forces will not allow it to drain. It is there because the capillary pull of the soil at some point will equal the GFP; therefore, the water does not drain, it is ""perched"".</p>
  
  <p>If we fill five cylinders of varying heights and diameters with the same soil mix and provide each cylinder with a drainage hole, the PWT will be exactly the same height in each container. This is the area of the pot where roots seldom penetrate &amp; where root problems begin due to a lack of aeration. From this we can draw the conclusion that tall growing containers are a superior choice over squat containers when using the same soil mix. The reason: the level of the PWT will be the same in each container, with the taller container providing more usable, air holding soil above the PWT.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href=""http://oregonstate.edu/dept/nursery-weeds/feature_articles/physical_properties/physical_properties.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Water is not distributed evenly throughout the container.  Adhesion, cohesion, and capillary action attract water to particles and resist gravity.  The ability of media to ‘hold’ water through adhesion and cohesion is referred to as matric potential.  Matric potential is the same throughout the container.  Gravity pulls water down through the container and out of the drainage holes.  While gravity is constant throughout the container, gravitational potential is greater at the top of the container and lower at the bottom.  Because of this gradual decrease in gravitational potential towards the container bottom, matric potential is higher at the container bottom and media particles are able to hold more water.  This causes water to form a perched water table at the container bottom.  The perched water table is a layer of saturation on the container bottom.  </p>
  
  <p>Container height affects the relative amount of water versus air.  With the same media, the perched water table occurs at the same height, regardless of the container size.  Short containers will have the same perched water table as large containers, thus a greater percentage of container volume is filled with water.  This explains why a 5-gallon container hold less water than a 5-gallon squat container.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Should you use gravel at the bottom of a plant's pot?</p>

<p>Not usually. Soil is like a sponge, and won't drip down into most gravel unless it becomes fully saturated. That doesn't mean that there is no air space in the soil, it means that as it is, the soil can't hold more water without it running out. </p>

<p>I only occasionally use gravel, but I use small pea gravel in a thin layer, to keep the drainage hole from getting clogged, in large planters (in my case they were 6x6', you shouldn't use it in small pots/planters) that will not be disturbed for a while. Generally, the growing media will drain better without any gravel.</p>

Remember that this is by weight, so shredding the leaves will help make it easier to measure. Of course the condition of the material can change the ratio, but it is always safer to put in too much carbon than too much nitrogen.

<p>Update:
The choices I'm looking at right now are hardwood, cedar, and cypress (all available from my local Lowes/Home Depot/etc and are pretty cheap.  Also, my city has a program that gathers wood that people are throwing away and shreds them into mulch.  It's free to take some and they'll fill up the back of your truck for you as many times as you want.  You end up with a random collection of wood...not sure if this really matters though.</p>
","<p>I know that I <em>should</em> be mulching some of my veggies.  But in practice I never have.  Here are some alternatives to mulching that have (mostly) worked well for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plant the crops much closer than you normally would.  Their own leaves will shade the ground (protecting moisture) and they'll crowd out weeds.</li>
<li>Companion plant a ground cover crop with a taller crop.  Two examples: I grow oregano around the base of my peppers, and ""three sisters"" uses squash as ""mulch"" for the beans and corn.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use a plain old black trash bag or a tarp or a burlap bag.  Some of these materials are water permeable, but some are not.  Either way you need to be <em>very</em> diligent about getting water into the soil, because rain will behave differently on these than on bare soil or straw or wood mulch.  The upside is that it a black covering will also warm the soil (for the plants that like that sort of thing).</p>

"Is it safe to change the entire soil surrounding the roots?","5257","","<p>Usually when you buy plants from the store, the soil type might not be suitable to them. Is it safe to change the soil completely? I mean to remove all the soil around most of the roots, then put it into a pot with new soil. I can think of 2 disadvantages: </p>

<ol>
<li>The roots cannot hold on to new soil</li>
<li>The roots wouldn't have adapted to new environment.</li>
</ol>

<p>Would it help if I only changed the soil away from the roots? Are there certain plants more tolerant to such changes and others that aren't?</p>
","<p>Generally speaking, plants bought from a store or nursery are grown in compost (potting soil) that suits their needs, otherwise they wouldn't grow well and wouldn't sell. Unless the plant is unhealthy or pot-bound (the pot is so full of roots that a mass of them encircles the soil-ball), there is no need to disturb it, in fact changing the compost <em>is likely to do more harm than good</em>. </p>

<p>If the plant is pot-bound (if so, you can often see roots growing through the drainage holes, or water runs straight through the compost, without really wetting it), it will have to be moved into a slightly larger pot. Water the plant very thoroughly, place the base of the plant between your fingers, turn the pot upside down or on its side and give it a sharp tap. Gently remove the plant and tease apart the roots that are encircling the root-ball, but <em>without disturbing its overall structure</em>; the aim is to keep the root-ball intact. You can then transfer the plant to its new pot, using a compost that contains some of the ingredients in the old one, e.g. if the original compost is peat-based, and the new one you are using is soil-based, add a little peat, so as to ease the transition and encourage the plant to grow into the new medium. Just place enough of the compost at the bottom of the new pot and fill the gap around root-ball, again without disturbing  it, and then water thoroughly.</p>

"How can I determine when to pick a spiny cucumber, without touching it?","5252","","<p>We have a friend who occasionally brings us vegetable plants, as she has her own garden/farm thing where she cultivates plants to sell to restaurants. This time around, she brought us some tiny red and yellow tomatoes as well as some cucumbers. The tomatoes were easy to work with, the cucumbers less so. We're currently at the point where we're trying to figure out when it's time to pick them. Unlike <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/1642/do-peppers-change-color-when-left-on-the-plant"">store-bought plants we've dealt with in the past</a>, our friend did not leave us any seed cards or other kind of information that could help us.</p>

<p>The problem is that they're particularly prickly. The largest one, on the left, is probably ready by size alone. The picture on the right is one of several smaller ones. You can probably see a fair amount of spines, mostly near the bottom, but the entire fruits are positively covered in shiny barbs. It's not limited to the fruits themselves, though. The stalks and the leaves of the plant are also covered in coarse hairs that can even puncture our gardening gloves. If there was such thing as a cactus cucumber these may very well be it, haha, but I've actually heard of spiny cucumbers for a long time. Mom says these are worse than dealing with rosebushes.</p>

<p>A quick search online has shown up mostly ways of checking if a cucumber is ready to pick is by the firmness of grasp. This is decidedly not an option as I enjoy my hands being relatively smooth and hole-free, and thicker gloves mean I won't even be able to feel the fruit. Resources I've found on dealing with spiny cucumbers all seem to be about how to cook and peel them, not how to harvest them off the plant in the first place. So I ask, how might I ascertain that a cucumber is ready if it is too spiny to feel? With touch out of the question (lest there's a means to touch them without needle death), what means can we use to check on them and decide to snip them off the plant for eventual cookery?</p>

Some amount of spines are normal on all cucumbers, but this one looks especially spiny.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Color: they should be medium to dark green. this depends on the cultivar though, some of them will be different colors. from the looks of it, the medium to dark green color is a good test here.</p></li>
<li><p>Length: This is sort of up to preference, the article I linked above suggests 5-6"" but some folks let them grow a lot longer (like 10-12""), they will continue to grow longer if you do not pick them. At this point the one in the first photo should be plenty ready to pick and use (it's already on the longer side). </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Overall a combination of these three methods (squeeze, if you can find a good spot, the color, and the length) should give you a good idea of when to pick it. But I think if you can't manage to squeeze it relying on color and size should be a pretty good indicator.</p>

<p>First, you'll end up leaching a lot of the nutrients from the soil.  </p>

<p>Second, you'll make the soil conditions inhospitable to your plants.</p>

<p>Given they're not fully hardy, the best thing to do is not to cut them at all, other than deadheading if you like, and allow dead leaves to collect in the remains of the stems which will give a bit more protection to the roots. If you don't like an untidy look in winter, you could cut them right down and mulch heavily over the top, a good couple of inches or more, with something like garden compost, bark chips, whatever, again for added protection.

","<p>Herbs are generally very easy to grow, as long as you don't forget to water them regularly and provide a well drained environment with sunlight at least 8 hours of the day. What you should grow largely depends on your culinary tastes (and what's expensive in your area). </p>

<p>I must stress one point though: <strong>only plant herbs that you will use regularly</strong>. The reason is that the flavorful herbs as we know it are the young leaves of the plant. At this stage in the plant's life, its sole purpose is to grow and as such, the leaves are wider, lush, tender and rich in the aromatic stuff that we love. Once plants reach maturity, it's focus is to reproduce and die. So the new sets of leaves it produces are a lot thinner and in general, less aromatic (sometimes gets bitter). No other herb illustrates this better than cilantro. If you've grown cilantro and let it take its own course, you'll know what I'm talking about. This also happened to me with dill and thyme. </p>

<p>So if you use these regularly, you'll be automatically trimming the plant, keeping it forever young. If you must plant something that you don't use often (or if you find that your plant produces more than you need), you must trim them often (give the excess to a friend) and not let them flower (pinch the flowers). Speaking of pinching flowers, one herb for which this is very important is basil. <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/81/best-conditions-for-basil/154#154"">This was addressed</a> in a different question <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/81/best-conditions-for-basil"">on the best conditions for growing basil</a></p>

","<p>This plant is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaucarnea_recurvata"">Beaucarnea recurvata</a>, the ponytail palm.  Despite the name it is not related to the palms.  These are great indoor plants if you have good or high light conditions.  I have never had a lot of problems with them. Things to note include:</p>

<ul>
<li>in indoor environments it can be too dry ( Less than 30% relative humidity) and the tips tend to brown.  Once you cut the tip back to living tissue it too can die back so you get in an endless round of scissor work.  Better to leave the dead ends.</li>
<li>most common cause of death is over watering. The plant stores water in the bulb at the base of the plant. Just checking to see if the soil is dry will not be an accurate reflection of whether the plant needs more water. Best solution is to place in a high light area so it uses more water and water less frequently.  (For example, every two weeks in high light).</li>
<li>The most common pest is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealybug"">mealybug</a> which will hide in the central axil where all new growth comes from. I have never successfully controlled mealybug on these plants with soap and water because you cannot get the soap where the eggs are hiding.</li>

"Is staking young trees helpful or harmful?","5184","","<p>I frequently see small trees staked with some support twine or rope, presumably to aid against strong winds.</p>

<p>However, I've heard or read somewhere that staking small trees can actually be harmful, preventing them from building a natural resistance to the wind (in trunk strength, root development, etc.).</p>

<p>There are many guides that explain ""proper"" tree staking. Here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.gardeningblog.net/2009/05/20/how-to-stake-a-tree/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How to Stake a Tree</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.daytonnursery.com/tips/Tree_Staking.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Staking Trees</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It seems, from aggregating information in such guides, that staking is sometimes necessary, but that people often do it wrong.</p>

<p>The question then, is how do you determine when to stake a tree (if at all)? Are there lots of oddly bent or fallen trees somewhere from <em>lack</em> of staking? I've never seen one.</p>
","<p>Below are a few things I've picked up over the years:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Location.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It's generally recommended to stake trees planted on slopes and/or windy locations.</p></li>
<li><p>If a tree is planted in a well protected area (and on flat ground) staking shouldn't be necessary and is in fact discouraged ie Let the tree develop naturally.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Staking should not hold a tree so rigid that it can't ""sway"" a little bit.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Swaying encourages a thicker trunk and a stronger root system.</p></li>
<li><p>Which ever method is used to stake a tree, it should not cut into the trunk. Any sign of such behaviour should be immediately corrected.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Staking is not needed or should be removed once a tree trunk is approximately 3inches (75mm) in diameter.</p></li>

"How to know how much weight I need in a lawn roller?","5175","","<p>I purchased a new home this year and the yard maintenance of the previous owner was almost non-existent. As such the lawn has many small bumps and is ""lumpy"". I have looked into using a lawn roller but found there are many different types and sizes (hand or tractor pulled and all assorted weight capacities). </p>

<p>I do not own a tractor so I would be using a hand model. Obviously I can only use up to weight I can pull physically by myself. My question is how do I know if this will be enough weight to smooth out the lawn?</p>
","<p>A lawn roller is not intended to be used for flattening out a bumpy lawn - I quote directly here from D. G. Hessayon's The Lawn Expert ""the purpose of a roller is to firm the surface of an already smooth lawn. It is totally wrong to use it to iron out bumps - it usually makes matters worse by depressing the hollows even further, and compacting the soil"". Its intended use on an already smooth lawn is after winter, when some of the turf may have been lifted by hard frosts, and the roller on the back of an ordinary cylinder mower will do this job.</p>

<p>Since your description of the bumps and hollows suggests they are fairly minor in nature, probably the easiest solution is to broadcast finely sifted soil over the area, raking it over to fill in the hollows. For deeper hollows, the soil should be added in stages rather than all at once, unless you want to seed on top of it.</p>

<p>The tree is on the south side of the house; photo looks northwest.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4ANb5.jpg"" alt=""Picture of peach tree and house""></p>
","<p><strong>Edit</strong>: after the information from David that the tree produced heavily this year, renovation may be a practical course of action.</p>

<p><strike>
You may get a better answer from someone else, but I'd suggest that you should <strong>cut it down and plant a new tree</strong>. Peach trees are not long-lived -- a 20-25 year old tree is ready for retirement. Production typically drops off at that point. You <em>might</em> be able to prune this over a couple of years and have it produce some fruit, but I find it unlikely that you'll be paid back for your time and effort.</p>

<p>Even if you could renovate the old tree and get a few more years of crops from it, a new tree will begin producing within a year or two, will have a longer productive life, and you would expect larger crops than the old tree within just a few years.
</strike></p>

<p>See <a href=""http://eap.mcgill.ca/MagRack/COG/COG_H_93_03.htm"">this article on fruit tree pruning</a>, especially:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You will seldom have to resort to serious renovation pruning on peaches, nectarines, sweet cherries and Japanese plums. These and most apricots seldom live long enough to need renovation. A peach at 25 is old.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A major renovation will take a couple of years -- you don't want to remove too much at once. Start by removing dead/diseased branches and then stop. If that doesn't remove much material, remove branches that are crossing, growing the wrong direction, etc. But stop before you remove too much. Then take a look at what happens next year.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that fruit forms on this year's wood. So if you want fruit next year, make sure you leave some of this year's growth.</p>

<p>If you have the tools, and you can do the job safely, and you want to reduce the height (for ease of picking and/or more pleasing shape): in the second year, you may consider removing some of the upper branches. But it would really be worth calling a local arborist with experience handling fruit trees to do this kind of work -- both you and the tree may end up healthier.</p>

<p>Normally you'd prune while the tree is dormant (in winter), but you may want to think about a summer pruning since heavy pruning during winter dormancy can stimulate vigorous growth at the expense of fruit production. And vigorous new growth isn't what you want.</p>

<p>Also, if you do figure out how to keep the squirrels away, make sure you thin the fruit to avoid breaking branches.</p>

"Why have my tomato leaves started yellowing at the base?","5107","","<p>One of my tomato plants (Better Boys if that matters) has a few leaves that have started yellowing on the lower branches. Not sure if they aren't getting enough water, or if they are diseased or what. </p>

<p>What is causing this? If it's a disease how can I prevent it from spreading to the rest of my plants?</p>
","<p>You probably can pinch the lower branches off, and actually help the growth of the plant.  Your plant can grow pretty big (4 feet) so to encourage tall growth (and keep the leaves away from the dirt, which probably caused the yellowing) pull them out.</p>

<p>If it goes on, pull the plant out (don't compost it) and be thankful it is early in the year.  </p>

<p>It's probably not the water,  unless you're watering directly on top of the plant and causing them to get muddy.  Try watering at the base and making a little dirt moat around the plant so that the water goes into the ground and the roots have to grow down to get it. </p>

"Should I remove the tree roots coming from the neighbouring garden?","5077","","<p>When I was digging out* a patch to grow veggies earlier in the spring I found big roots in the soil unconnected to anything in our garden. It looks like they're coming from some kind of palm trees planted right at the edge of our neighbour's yard. They were so thick I couldn't break them with the spade so they're just lying there underneath the patch for now.</p>

<p>Now this spot where the neighbouring roots are is the spot that's best suited (with regard to sunlight and airflow) to growing veggies and herbs. Can I just claim the soil for our plants and chop away the neighbouring roots or would that be bad form? What would you do and why?</p>

<p>Now, if the neighbour's tree was something nice like a lemon tree I wouldn't even think of doing this, which suggests that the answer is not straightforward at all.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> We have not met this particular neighbour because their yard backs on to ours rather than being beside ours. Obviously part of the answer might be to talk to that neighbour, but I am looking for a gardening-informed answer rather than the political one!</p>

<p>(*) Our soil is very poor in every way, so this is a process I go through, square metre by square metre, adding compost, mulch and a little organic fertiliser - in order to grow anything at all.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Adding pictures (click to enlarge) so you can see how precariously close not just the vege patch but a nectarine tree I planted at the end of winter and a few years old citrus are to the neighbouring palms (which by the way are towering at approx 5m+ high).</p>

","<p>While I'm a big fan of raised beds in general, I don't think they're any kind of a solution here - the roots will just come up into the beds.  </p>

<p>From what I've read, landscape fabric and cardboard don't stop tree roots.  </p>

<p>We have Norway Maples ""near"" (40 feet from) our raised beds, and I have to dig a line around the outside of the beds down six inches with a pickax (and pruning saw) every year or two to keep them from taking over.  And they do take over.  Nothing grows well when they're in the garden.  Norway Maples are pretty notorious for this - palms may be not as bad - or worse, for all I know.  </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I just saw the pictures.  I'd check the neighbor's yard, if possible, to make sure that it isn't something like a sea of concrete with islands of soil for the palms.  Make sure the palms are likely to have lots of other area for roots.</p>

<p>There's nothing in the picture for scale, but it looks like the roots are well less than an inch.  If so, I'd have no worries whatever about cutting them - especially if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>cut them when you're likely to have rain for the next few months</li>
<li>cut them over multiple seasons if there are a really large number coming from one tree.  Limit how much you cut to something like 4 to 6 square inches of root cross-section per tree.  (That's <em>not</em> scientific - I'm just trying to communicate my musings.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Caveat</strong>.  I've never gardened in your climate, your soil, or with palms.</p>

<p>You might want to call <a href=""http://www.growthtech.com.au/CONTENT/ROOT_CONTROL_and_WEED_PREVENTION.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">these folks</a> and see if they have anything useful to say or sell.

"Plant suggestions for a rockery in a dry, shaded position","4990","","<p>I am planning to make a rockery down the end of my garden. The position is directly underneath two tall Leylandii. The soil there is poor and any moisture very quickly sucked out by the Leylandii. </p>

<p>The spot receives no direct sunlight - it is north facing (UK), and in the corner between two fence panels. </p>

<p>What plants can you recommend that would be suitable for a rockery in this position?</p>
","<p>Sorry, Nicholas, but the answer is not good - rockery plants, if you mean a proper rockery rather than just a bed with a few rocks dotted about, are usually alpines. Alpines grow in dry, rocky/scree, open situations, with full exposure to sunlight, and none of them will do well in a shaded area. That then means you're stuck with plants which only do well in dry shade - so one or two ferns, maybe some Lamium varieties, Vinca, Hypericum calycinum, none of which are 'rockery' plants as we know them. The latter three are, or can be, invasive, so if you were going to use those, you'd not particularly want them where you can't reduce or weed them out.</p>

<p>There is also the question of how close to the leylandii you wanted this rockery to be - the soil level which currently exists around the base of the trunks should be kept the same, so any piling up of soil/rocks will need to be done further away from those.</p>

<p>If three feet away is not an option either, loose lay a few slabs and stand pots on them and plant into those with whatever you want - summer bedding in summer (lobelia, fuchsia, busy lizzy, begonia, pansy all tolerate shade well) or use much larger pots and put the plants mentoned in the update section in those instead. Means you have to water regularly though.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Anything you plant should be a minimum of 3 feet away from the base of the trees - have a look at Mahonia aquifolium, Ruscus, Prunus Otto Luyken, Lamium maculatum White Nancy or Beacon Silver, the latter two for ground cover. All will  need watering till established though, particularly the shrubs mentioned.</p>

","<p>Its because you put the plant straight outside and the plant is not used to the harsh light outside so it gets 'sunburned'. To avoid this in the future you should harden it off by moving it out gradually over about a week:</p>

<ol>

<li>the whole day out but in at night</li>
<li>Now it can be outside all the time.</li>
</ol>

<p>It does not have to be exactly like this, but the idea is you let the plant get used to the environment outside slowly. I know it can be difficult to do this while having a full time job so you can make variations where you leave it longer in the evening where the light is less harsh and stretch it out over a longer period than a week. or you can put fleece over it and leave it out a bit longer as well.

We water if it doesn't rain probably every other day. Can't recall the mulch. Leaves turn more like gray/green instead of yellow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I think it could be either:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The clay layer under the top 6 inches (150 mm) of top soil is holding too much water, thus the Lilac's roots are constantly sitting in water, which isn't a good thing for nearly all plants/shrubs/trees...</p></li>
<li><p>Your watering too frequently, but not giving the Lilac enough water.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What can you do (assuming I have the above correct)?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dig a hole 12 inches (300 mm) deep ""near"" the Lilac and examine how wet the soil is at that depth.</p></li>
<li><p>If it appears to be ""too wet"" you will need to improve the drainage of the soil under and around the Lilac. How?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wait until early Autumn (Fall), beginning of September is normally a perfect time for doing something like this.</p></li>
<li><p>Carefully dig around the Lilac (you want to limit root damage as best as you can), then carefully get under the root ball, lift gently out of the ground and put to one-side.</p></li>
<li><p>If the excavated root ball contains a lot of clay, very carefully remove as much of it as you can (without damaging the root system). Also remove all the ""dead"" leaves and prune out any ""dead"" branches (otherwise I wouldn't prune at this time of year). Basically just tidy up the plant.</p></li>
<li><p>Now widen the hole as much as is practical (the wider the better) and dig down to a minimum of 12 inchs (30 0mm), 18 to 24 inches (450 to 60 0mm) would be better (IMHO).</p></li>
<li><p>Fill the hole with enough 50/50 mix of top quality (sieved) top soil and high quality (sieved) compost, so that when you put the Lilac back in the hole the top of the root ball sits level with the surrounding soil ie don't plant low in the hole. If you have to put more than a 4 inch (100 mm) thick layer of 50/50 mix in the hole to get back up to planting level, ""lightly"" tamp down each layer.</p></li>

"Why are my aloe leaves turning white and brown?","4914","","<p>I have had this plant of aloe for years, and it has always given me great satisfaction. Easy to take care of, I had separated it into different pots but now decided to keep it all together into a large one - and it has been a great idea. </p>

<p>It withstood changes in the position too: from a south-facing window sill, when I put it all together it was placed outside on the western porch, receiving a lot of light and it sprouted even more. I brought it in for the winter, and placed it in a well-lit area and it was fine.</p>

<p>However, one day I had the terrible idea of putting it outside in the winter for some sunlight (we had an unusually warm winter) and obviously I forgot to taking it back in at night and obviously it turned out to be the coldest night of the year. </p>

<p>The leaves turned white almost immediately, but the damage was very limited. I thought it was just the cold, so I kept it inside, placed it where it gets a lot of light but no direct sunlight and waited to see if it could get some color back.</p>

<p>It turned worse, as you can see in the pictures.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://www.aloeplant.info/aloe-vera-and-sun/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> where they say it could be sunburnt. However I don't know how that's possible, it's been in almost direct sunlight in August and it didn't turn out like this.
And I know from <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/17646/how-do-i-make-my-aloe-plant-beautiful-again"">this question</a> that the damaged brown leaves will have to be cut. </p>

<p>So finally my question(s):</p>

<p><strong>Is it a sunburnt aloe as the article states? Is the damage recoverable?</strong></p>
","<p>First, here is what sunburn looks like on an aloe leaf:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uz00p.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uz00p.jpg"" height=""200"" /></a></p>

<p>And here is what <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/14668/419"">etiolation</a> looks like on an aloe (this one's actually mine :o):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GO02T.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GO02T.jpg"" height=""200"" /></a></p>

<p>Mine is etiolated because it's in the basement under fluorescent lighting, which is on 24/7. That plus the warm temperatures are confusing to the plant. Mine responded by trying to grow (although I haven't watered it since September of 2014). It stays outside during the summer. Most of mine I treat better than this one.</p>

<p>Here's how to avoid etiolation. If the aloe is kept outdoors over the no frost months (highly recommended), and you don't have an indoor location with several hours of direct sun, the best method of overwintering is to make the plant go dormant. You don't want the plant to grow while dormant, as that growth will not be as robust as summer growth, but will be permanent nonetheless. </p>

<p>Place it in an area that stays between 40 and 60 degrees F., ideally around 50 - 55. Give it bright light for 10 hours a day. That is a very short day and helps the plant 'winterize' naturally. Let the soil just about dry out. Watering will cause growth. You don't want it all as dry as dust, but you're gonna get pretty dang close. Do not fertilize. </p>

<p>You can usually keep the plant healthy in these conditions for at least 4 months, which is enough in most areas to get them through the winter. When moving them outdoors, you will have to harden them off carefully, so as not to sunburn them. </p>

<p>If you have an area indoors with direct sunlight several hours a day, you can keep the aloe there year round, growing constantly. Putting it outdoors for a time (much brighter) and then bringing it back in will throw it off, and can cause etiolation. </p>

<p>I didn't use a drill to make the holes, since a. I did not have one, b. I declined the offer from a shop assistant in the store where I was buying them, as I thought hard drill on cold plastic may cause cracks.</p>

<p>I used a soldering iron with a sharp tip, plugged it in and inserted it into where ever I wanted to make the holes. To enlarge them a bit, I moved the iron in the hole circularly so that it'd melt down more of the area. I then detached the extra bits of melt plastic while it hadn't completely cooled down.</p>

"Why do all my chilli plants stop growing?","4804","","<p>I have been growing chilli plants for the last couple if years. In the first year I always get a decent amount of fruit considering the size of the plants. However, fairly consistently my chilli plants stop growing after their first season. They get to a certain height and just seem to stop. Some give up all together and just turn into sticks, others make it through the winter but then don't ever seem to get any bigger. I have seen chilli plants get quite large, a metre high or more, so I'm curious as to why mine are stunted.</p>

<p>I'm reasonably confident they are getting all the food they need and they always get plenty of water. So I'm wandering, what is the trick to getting large and plentiful chilli plants?!</p>
","<p>I don't think there's anything that unusual here.</p>

<p>Although technically perennials, most people grow peppers (and tomatoes) as annuals. I've grown quite a few peppers for about ten years now, and rarely manage to over-winter them. We have frosts, so I can only overwinter those that I can bring inside. Then I think they are susceptible to low light, aphids, disease, etc when they are relatively dormant.</p>

<p>If they are making it through winter (and sometimes when I try, I do manage it), I always pot them out into a bed, and usually get excellent growth. Even if most of the plant died back to 3-4"" of stem, the roots are still good, and in that soil with good water &amp; sun, off they go!
You don't say if you are growing in pots or not, but if you are, then I think this is the reason:  They are probably pot bound and also need some fresh compost. </p>

<p>re. metre high peppers: I don't get them quite that big, but they definitely can grow quite bushy and large. As well as conditions, it does vary a lot by variety. For example, I've had Gypsy (a Bell), Big Jim (an Anaheim/Hatch), and Sweet Paprika grow large - but never any of the <em>C.frutescens</em> cultivars (Tabasco, Twilight, etc).</p>

","<p>Spring and fall are excellent times to over seed with new grass seed. You can improve the success by top dressing with 1/4"" to 1/2"" of compost or good weed free soil.</p>

<li>less watering is required in spring and fall as the temperatures are cooler</li>

I bought a can of <a href=""http://www.acehardwareoutlet.com/productDetails.aspx?SKU=11337"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">boiled linseed oil</a> and coated the tools with it (helps prevent rust).  </p>

<p>Now, everything is covered in boiled linseed oil.  What on earth am I supposed to do with these tools now that they're all goopey? Do I just have to leave them hanging till I want to use them again?  Would I need to recoat them if I go and use them?  And do some tools need multiple coats of oil? </p>
","<p>I've done my fair share of woodworking and carpentry that I've used oils to both treat/finish wood and to maintain tools and am familiar with the hazards of not disposing it off properly.</p>

<p>As for using boiled linseed oil which dries <em>quickly</em> (actual linseed oil can take ages) to maintain your tools, just dip a rag (cotton wool or a cloth) in them and coat a <em>thin layer</em> of oil on the metallic parts. Make sure to cover evenly and leave no spot untouched. This will provide a layer of protection against rust formation. The principle behind this is very simple - by coating with a thin layer of oil, you're cutting off oxygen supply, hence preventing the iron from oxidizing and rusting.</p>

<p>However, <strong>do not</strong> be tempted to add multiple coats or a thick layer of oil. Thicker layers take longer to dry and often, do not dry to form a hard surface (i.e., it requires exposure to air to dry and thick coats will remain <em>soft</em> underneath the surface). This can be quite deceptive, meaning it gives an appearance of having dried, but really it hasn't. Multiple layers of thin coats are also not a good idea, because they become prone to being removed when scratched i.e., the layers will peel off more easily when thick than when thin.</p>

<p>You may start using the tool once it has dried (you can try gently running your fingers on it. If your fingers don't have an oily smudge or very little of it, it has dried). You do not have to coat it after every use. It would be better for the tool if you had a maintenance schedule. However, if your use is very sporadic (i.e., use today then 3 months later), then it would be worth your while to coat it each time.</p>

<p>The rags you use should <strong>never</strong> be disposed as is. The are combustible and could result in fire damage. Treat this as a general advice for any rags containing mineral oils/paint thinners/acetone/etc and for wood dust/wood shavings from previously finished wood. Piling them on will cause an exothermic reaction (heat releasing) and eventually result in spontaneous combustion. You can wash them under running water several times until it's ""free"" of it, while at the same time collecting the water + oil mix in a bucket. Later, take the ""hazardous waste"" to your local collection center. If they charge you by volume, then instead of running water, you can wash it in still water (however, I'm not a big fan of this, as it only leads to more messiness).</p>

They've started to root and sprout, but I noticed one of them is developing mold. What's the best way to fix this problem?  Should I scrape the mold off of the bulb and hope it doesn't come back?  I would need to move the bulb to do so, and I'm afraid I could damage the delicate roots in the process.</p>

<p>Other notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I had been trying to keep the water level covering the bottom 1/4"" to 1/2"" of the bulbs, but now that they're putting down roots, I'm aiming for just up to the bottom of the bulbs.</p></li>
<li><p>The bulbs are in a fairly sunny spot on our dining room table. The room has two walls of windows (South and West facing) that we usually keep the blinds open on.</p></li>
<li><p>The temperature in the house has been between 70°-75°F for the most part. Possible a bit lower at night, since we really haven't started running the heat here yet.</p></li>

<p>Having the bulbs themselves constantly sitting in the water, even such a small amount is the most likely cause of the mold (IMHO).</p>

<p>If it was me, I would:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Very! carefully remove the bulbs, then clean the mold off of them, again very! carefully.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use an toothbrush or small nail brush and clean water.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Allow the bulbs to dry naturally for a few days.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use glasses (or some plastic containers) that are large enough for the bulbs to sit on top of and allows their roots to dangle down into them. Fill the glasses with enough water so the roots sit in the water but the bulbs themselves don't touch the water.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>While the bulbs are drying, empty the water from the glass vase and take out the stones.</p></li>
<li><p>Then clean the glass vase and stones with a mild bleach solution (5% maximum). Rinse thoroughly with clean water afterwards. Dry with paper-towels, then allow to air dry.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the bulbs have been allowed to dry for a few days (while their roots sit in water), put the stones back into the glass vase. Carefully put the bulbs back on top of the stones, ensuring their roots go as deep as possible into the stones, then fill the vase with clean water -- making sure finished water level does not touch any part of the bulbs, keep the water level about &#188; to &#189;inch (6.25 to 12.5mm) below the underside of the bulbs.</p>

<ul>
<li>Check the bulbs are sitting firmly in place once you've got everything set-up, back in place...</li>

"What is an effective organic pesticide to use against aphids or cabbage loopers?","4673","","<p>I have a vegetable garden that bugs just love. Since my family is going to eat these vegetables (and I'd prefer that the bugs do not), what organic pesticide is most effective?

","<p>I'm having good results with Bt (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_thuringiensis"">Bacillus thuringiensis</a>), but I don't think aphids are listed on the label as being controlled by it. The main problem I'm solving with Bt is cabbage loopers.</p>

<p>Aphids are order Hemiptera, so it doesn't look like Bt will work on them. I have heard of using tomato leaf or garlic oil spray to control aphids, but haven't had to try either.

"Aerating with a garden fork: is it making the problem worse?","4653","","<p>I would like to aerate my lawn but do not poses a lawn aerator. Would spiking the lawn with a garden fork be sufficient in aerating the soil or is it simply going to <em>further</em> compact the soil around the holes it creates? </p>
","<p>For once I have to disagree with Bamboo!  Poking tines in the ground actually compresses soil further.  Proper aeration is only done by REMOVING cores of soil and allowing these cores to disintegrate on top of the lawn.  Very inexpensive to go rent one of these machines and usually works out well if you talk to your neighbors and share the machine.  All lawns need aeration at least once per year.  Think about it...push something down in the soil and the soil surrounding justs gets tighter.  Pulling plugs of soil out of the lawn albeit only 3 or 4 inches deep is all that is necessary seeing roots of lawns are only 3-4 inches in depth.  Those that have trained their lawns with proper watering will have roots down 6"" but not necessary to reach that far.  This breaks up lawn debris and congested roots.  Gives air to bacteria necessary for breaking down debris.  If your lawn is used more than normal ie) volley ball, lots of kids, big parties it would behove one to do twice a year aeration!!  Got this info from master gardeners over and over again but I am sure it is out there on the internet.  Maybe I should go find a site and post it here, huh?  Sigh and grins!</p>

"What house plants or flowers act like a dehumidifier","4652","","<p>I live in a wet climate and the house I currently reside in gathers a lot of moisture on the windows, this is due to no ventilation on the windows among other factors. We are only renting so I'm looking for an alternative. I know I could just buy a dehumidifier, but what fun would that be?  </p>

<p>What I'm looking for is a plant or flower, anything, that acts like a natural dehumidifier. What I want to achieve is to reduce the moisture by putting plants on the windows or around.</p>
","<p>With plants, you would be doing yourself a disservice. </p>

<p>The average potted plant takes up moisture (water, salts and other substances from the soil) from the soil with their roots and a significant part of this water is expelled by the leaves and <em>evaporates</em>. In short, the plant acts like a <strong>humidifier</strong>. This is why we water our plants.</p>

<p>How much water a plant will bring into the air depends on the plant, which has adapted to its natural habitat via evolution - where a cactus will do its best to minimize evaporation, my <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosera"" rel=""noreferrer"">sundews</a> literally ""pump"" water from their boggy pots into the ""dew"".</p>

<p>There are plants that don't show this mechanism, because they don't have such roots, e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillandsia"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tillandsiae</a> and some orchids. But even they can not simply draw water from the surrounding air, they rely on regular dew or rainfall for their water needs.</p>

Either find a way to vent your rooms or buy a dehumidifier.</p>

"Is it too late to add sulfur to my vegetable garden soil?","4640","","<p>My soil test from my local county extension office says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your pH is 7.4 ... You should incorporate sulfur to a depth of 6"" at a rate of ½ lb per 100 sq. feet at least 6 weeks before planting in the spring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm about 2-3 weeks from the historical last freeze in my area (Wichita, KS, Zone 6A), and I'd rather not wait ""at least 6 weeks"" from now before transplanting anything.</p>

<p>So is it too late to add sulfur now?  Or should I take any special precautions when applying it now?</p>
","<p>They are suggesting incorporating sulfur to lower the ph of the soil.  The sulfur will become sulfuric acid in the presence of water.  If the soil had a ph of over 8 or you were a commercial farmer this would be a viable solution but would have to be done yearly.</p>

<p>Your soil ph of 7.4 is not extremely alkaline. Although most vegetables prefer a ph of 5.5 to 6.5 these vegetables will do well in your soil:</p>

<li>broccoli</li>
<li>cabbage</li>
<li>brussel sprouts</li>

<p>Refer to this <a href=""http://www.eutechinst.com/tips/ph/15_soil_ph.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">pdf</a> which has a detailed list of what likes what.  You will see that with your soil ph these vegetables will not do as well:</p>

<li>lettuce</li>
<li>carrots</li>
<li>corn</li>
<li>potato</li>
<li>peanuts</li>
<li>watermelon</li>
</ul>

<p>Your best investment which would help your garden in many ways and moderate your soil ph would be to add organic matter.</p>

<p>To grow the vegetables that like a lower ph you could consider a raised bed with large quantities of composted manure mixed with top soil.  In my area they have a ""triple mix"" of composted manure, top soil and peat moss.  If you have six to eight inches of a soil high in organic matter and you top dress it every spring with more organic matter then you will not need to use sulfer.</p>

<p>Edit:  Yes, I am suggesting that  you would be better off with a raised bed of your favourite mix of compost and top soil and grow the ph sensitive vegetables there.  Skip the sulfur...</p>

"Why are we instructed not to use manure before planting carrots?","4624","","<p>It's said that we shouldn't use manure when preparing ground intended for carrots. Is it that carrots don't thrive on manure, or is it that they fork and splinter too much?</p>

","<p>The root cause (no pun intended) is that excess nitrogen will make the roots fork. I've heard two different theories as to why:</p>

<ol>
<li>""Hot"" fertilizer like fresh manure burns off the fresh roots and makes them fork.</li>
<li>A lot of nitrogen in shallow soil fails to encourage the plant to scavenge deep in the soil for nutrients, and they send out roots sideways instead.</li>

<p>My question is this: Will spraying herbicides (such as RoundUp) ""kill"" the sticker seed pods and prevent them from germinating in addition to killing the plant they are attached to?</p>
","<p>Round Up is a herbicide which kill 'through the green'. The best time to apply is when the plant is growing strongly, the soil is damp, and the weather reasonably fair and not windy. Spray all stems till run off. Repeat applications might be necessary, but if you treat the plant before it flowers and sets seed, then it won't flower and set seed. Once the seeds are formed, Round up will not have any effect on them. </p>

<p>A word about Round Up - try to find glyphosate instead. This is the active ingredient in Round Up without the other surfactants and ingredients which have an impact on the environment. Glyphosate bought as a generic is cheaper, and when mixing it with water to spray or apply by can, adding a dash of washing up liquid helps it to penetrate plant tissues.</p>

"What do people mean when they talk about soil going sour?","4611","","<p>I've read a couple answers that have mentioned soil going sour. I've gathered that it's a bad thing, but what does it mean when soil goes sour? What causes it to sour?</p>
","<p>Sour and sweet are different words for acid and alkaline, respectively. Going sour is usually a bad thing, but some plants (such as azaleas, blueberries, most conifers, etc) prefer sour soil. </p>

<p>Some people also refer to soil as sour when it lies unused and gets a putrid, or fishy smell, often caused by too much water and rotting organic matter, but can happen in simply unused soil that stays damp.</p>

<p><a href=""http://encap.net/why-does-soil-become-acidic/"">From here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over time, soil pH is naturally lowered for a variety of reasons. Rainfall naturally leaches Calcium out of the soil, lowering the pH, and increasing the soil acidity. This is especially true with acid rain, particularly in the Midwest and Northeastern United States, because the acid rain adds Hydrogen to the soil, lowering soil pH, and increasing soil acidity.</p>
  
  <p>Soil acidity is also increased from fertilizer applications. Though it might sound strange, the main ingredients in fertilizer are acidic by nature, and can aid in lowering soil pH.</p>
  
  <p>Even without rain or fertilizer applications, soil acidity naturally increases over time due to the decomposition of organic matter. Because soil is a living environment, it is constantly breaking down organic matter, naturally adding acid to the soil. So, whether you’ve got the most beautiful lawn on the block, or you’ve let your front yard become a field, unless you live in the desert, your soil is becoming more acidic all the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Btw, the acid from decomposing organic matter is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humic_acid"">humic acid</a>, which causes a big drop in pH especially in potting soil, which is often mostly comprised of organic matter. So even if your garden is on a chalk bed, and isn't likely to go sour, the soil in your pots may still drop in pH.</p>

"Separating plants with entwined roots","4505","","<p>Let's pretend that I, hypothetically, planted a couple of seedlings in a fairly small pot and waited too long with transplanting them to a larger one so that their roots were now completely entwined.</p>

<p>If I wanted to give each plant more room, would there be there a way to do so without killing them off? How careful would one have to be with the roots?</p>

<p>If the species matter for the discussion, let's say they were tomato plants.</p>
","<p>Which plant you're talking about definitely makes a difference. How careful you have to be with the roots depends on the species. Some are very sensitive and some are not.</p>

<p>With tomatoes, if your plants are healthy and are not tiny, you can just pull one of them up like a weed and repot it. (Tomatoes are very lenient with their roots.) Then water the old one and make sure soil is covering its roots. They should both live and be fine. They should develop new roots quickly. I've done this a fair amount. It works with tomatillos, too. It may stunt peppers for a while, but that can be overcome with the right nutrients and growing conditions. Potassium sulfate is an example helpful nutrient. Bright light (after the plant has adjusted a little, and not before) is an example helpful growing condition.</p>

<p>I'm not saying pulling it up like a weed and repotting it is the ideal and best way to do this, but it certainly works with tomatoes and tomatillos. If you don't have potassium sulfate and you want to be extra careful, you can put the one you separate out in water for a couple days. This will help the roots to grow out and recover a little, and the transplant shock shouldn't be as bad.</p>

<p>You might think this is a lot like taking a cutting, but your success rates will be higher here than with a cutting, even if there's damping off in the soil and there are hardly any roots on the plant. (This information comes from my experience. I'm not sure why this is true, though. I guess broken roots are different than a snipped stem without roots.) Nevertheless, I would avoid the damping off pathogens to be safe, if you can.</p>

<p>Other plants may not be so forgiving as tomatoes, tomatillos and peppers. Tomatoes, tomatillos and peppers all grow roots all along their stems (not just at the leaf nodes). They have a big advantage. So, replant them deeper, unless they're grafts. You don't want the portion above the rootstock under the soil or else it may defeat the purpose of using a disease resistant rootstock.</p>

<p>Now for somewhat trickier plants, I would guess (and for now, this is just an educated guess based on what I've seen with less tricky plants in various situations) that the following would help: after separating your plants, soak both of their roots in water for a couple days and repot them afterward. If they survive in water for two days (which they just might in water, more easily than they would survive in soil directly after being disturbed), they'll likely survive the transplant afterward. Give them potassium sulfate (maybe even in the water while soaking, too). It reduces transplant shock.</p>

<p>If you separate them and you don't soak them in water, make sure to keep them out of bright light for one or two days (and put them back in bright light afterward, if that kind of plant likes bright light). If you do soak them in water, they may not be as bothered by light, but watch for wilting just in case. When light makes a plant wilt, that's very bad. Take the plant out of the light ASAP.</p>

<p>I can't guarantee this would work for trickier plants, but I would try it if I could afford the risk. In fact, I'm going to. I've got some eggplant, ground cherry and litchi tomato plants that are in this situation. None of them seem to grow root nodules along the stem in humid conditions like tomatoes do, and I've heard some of them (litchi tomatoes and ground cherries) are difficult to transplant. After my soil amendments arrive (worm castings, mycorrhizae and more potassium sulfate), I can try it out. Rather than repotting after soaking, I want to plant them outside, since I'm low on space, soil, containers, and time. They'll probably be covered with milk jugs afterward (so hardening off shouldn't be a huge deal). I try to avoid hardening off where possible, but I'm not saying you should. Anyway, I should be able to add more to my answer in a week or two. Feel free to remind me in a comment if I forget.</p>

<p>For much trickier plants, or if you just want to know for sure that you'll save one plant, you might be better off snipping one off and treating it as a cutting. The other one should be fine, in this case. However, for the one you cut off, I would personally try to cut it off so low that you get at least a root or two. Then your odds of success with that 'cutting' will be much better.</p>

<p>Alternately, you could just leave both plants together forever.</p>

<p>My question is what kind of light is best or which lamps should I use? I don't have any experience with indoor-growing moss yet.</p>
","<p>You can use just about any light source but each has it's consequences for your design:</p>

<ul>
<li>fluorescent lights are cheap, have a long life, tubes are available to mimic sunlight and they don't generate a lot of heat in comparison to halogens. The output decreases as the bulbs age and I found replacing them every five thousand hours worked best. With the ballast and housing they need they are normally a bit bulky for the kind of setup in the picture.</li>
<li>halogen lights are much smaller, have a longer life, offer a strong white light.  They run really hot, like burn your fingers hot.  The bulbs cannot be touched with your fingers as oils cause premature lamp failure. This much heat causes a big temperature difference and consequent humidity.  Unless you circulate air from outside the vivarium into the vivarium you could cook everything inside.</li>
<li>HID, high intensity discharge are sometimes known as Xenon, generate a lot of white spectrum. They are said to generate less heat than halogen but the ones I have will still burn your finger if you touch the exterior glass. They are expensive in comparison to fluorescent but are compact.  Lifespan ranges from eight thousand to twenty thousand hours without the lumen output decreasing. They can be dimmed unlike halogens. You would still need to have a fan circulating air inside the vivarium and some kind of humidity control.</li>
</ul>

<p>With any indoor container the following issues will arise:</p>

<ul>
<li>if it's warmer inside than outside you will get condensation on the interior surface which makes it hard to see inside</li>
<li>you need air circulation but success lies in keeping the humidity higher on the inside than the outside</li>
<li>you need to have the lights and fans on a timer.  With the multiple lights and at least one fan you may have to wire your own connection or buy a huge power bar.</li>
</ul>

"How to prevent my Ficus plant from growing new branches low?","4498","","<p>I have a Ficus plant that I bought some time ago. After a while, all of its leaves fell off (I think this might have been due to too much fertilizer). Now it seems to be recovering, however, instead of leaves growing on the higher existing branches which are leafless, it started growing new green branches with leaves near the root.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to stimulate it to grow leaves on the old branches?</p>
","<p>On a ficus plant, leaves and new branches can grow out of the side of virtually any live wood surface; even from older, ""hardened"" wood. New growth from the bottom is normal, particularly after any kind of shock which will cause all sorts of new growth. But if that top part is alive, you should be seeing new growth coming from the top, too.</p>

<p>Check the tips of the top branches. You should see small, green, needle-like buds that are the growing tips of those branches. If they look brown or are absent, those top branches may be dead. You can check by cutting a branch or scraping with your fingernail the outer layer of a small branch to see if you can detect any green. If there's no green, it's dead. If it's dead, it will become brittle soon enough.</p>

<p>Assuming the top branches are still alive, there's nothing you can really do to favor new growth up there. Just maintain favorable growing conditions to promote good general growth overall.</p>

<p>If those branches <em>have</em> died, you basically now have a ficus <em>bush.</em> Don't panic. It will probably do fine. It will just have a different growth habit (In Southern Florida, it's actually quite common to see thick, lush Ficus hedges). </p>

<p>If you want to encourage a more ""tree-like"" growth from what you have left, pick a few of the strongest, most upright branches coming from the bottom of the tree and cut off the rest. Given enough time and growth, you'll eventually end up with an attractive, now-multi-trunk tree again. As those multi-trunks become thicker and thicker, they'll actually start merging together, which is actually a rather attractive. </p>

<p><strong>Just as a side note,</strong> ficus trees will drop leaves for a bazillion apparently-innocuous reasons. The leaves of a ficus tree are non-phototropic, meaning they can't turn towards the light. So, if you move or turn the plant, it has to drop leaves and regrow them to adjust. If the temperature changes, they'll drop leaves. If watering conditions change, they'll drop leaves. Draft? Drop leaves. Kick the side of the pot, they'll drop leaves. It's nothing to worry about; This is completely normal. </p>

<p>Don't panic and water more when leaves start dropping. That's the opposite of what you want. Always water thoroughly but only after the surface has completely dried out. Light on the fertilizer and only when leaves are actively growing.</p>

","<p>I can see some sort of insect on your plant, small tan coloured objects which may be citrus scale. Scale produces honeydew, which is likely what the sticky fluid droplets are; this often leads to the secondary condition, Sooty Mould, though that is more likely outdoors than in. Check the whole plant, including backs of leaves, stems and woody parts, to confirm, and then treat for the problem. If you can get neem oil spray where you are, that should do it, though you may need to repeat the treatment more than once. Even if you decide it's not scale but some other infestation, neem oil should treat for it, but the commonest infestations in these plants are mealybug, scale and aphids. More info in the link below - it's a blogspot, but does contain a useful photograph of brown soft scale, and information as to how to deal with it, you'll need to scroll down a bit, it's not at the top of the page</p>

<p>It's probably worth checking your other plants from top to bottom as well, to make sure they haven't acquired an early infestation of the same problem. If you cannot find a suitable oil spray, you will need to check for insecticides which say they will deal with this problem - but if you're expecting to eat any fruit produced by your plant, you must choose a treatment which is safe to for use on edible plants.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xtmtf.jpg"" alt=""Choice of 3 fertilizers made by Happy Frog""></p>
","<p>The best fertilizer for potatoes in the choices listed above is the tomato and vegetable fertilizer. Generally, you should have the most phosphorous, then nitrogen, and the least potassium in the ratio. Potatoes are an underground crop, which means they need lots of phosphorous. In a container, they will require more nitrogen than in the ground, because it washes away easily during waterings, and most growing mixes do not contain much.</p>

<p>Too much nitrogen is harmful to potatoes, causing lush top growth at the expense of tubers. In the above question, the tomato and vegetable fertilizer appears to have the closest to ideal ratio, because you have the plants in a tub. </p>

<p>If you were growing them in the ground, the ideal ratio would be different, and it would also differ according to soil makeup and existing nutrient levels. Where I am, the best fertilizer seems to be a slow-release 6-3-8 potato fertilizer. I don't have the best soil around, but I average 2 1/2 lbs. of harvest per foot of row. That's quite good, actually.</p>

<p>Your plants look as if they have gone without fertilizer for a long time. You should start fertilizing now if you want them to produce. Put on 1 1/2 times the rate which is instructed, because the plants are crowded. This will help them catch up a little. </p>

<p>I find them very ugly and want to trim them off. The question is, should I trim off the half yellow, half green leaves from plants in general?</p>
","<p>The answer depends on the size of the leaf in question. For e.g., if you have large leaves, then the stalk is going to be wider and so the cut (where you trim the leaf) is going to take longer to heal and <em>could</em> possibly get infected. On the other hand, for plants with moderate to small leaves (e.g., roses), there is no harm in trimming off a half yellowed leaf. </p>

<p>I usually give such leaves a slight tug and see if it snaps off itself. If it does, well and good and if it doesn't, I wait for a couple of days and try it again. If it looks really ugly, I take the scissors to it.  </p>

"How do I change the color of my hydrangea flowers?","4433","","<p>So, I've heard that people sometimes mix a bit of lemon juice in when they water blue hydrangeas, they say it keeps them blue if the soil is lacking in acid. I was wondering, I have a pink indoor hydrangea plant; would it be possible to alter the color by putting the lemon juice in? Would it possibly make it blue in time, or purple? </p>
","<p>It really depends on the specific species of hydrangea that you have. It's mostly <em>Hydrangea macrophylla</em>, also called ""big leaf"" hydrangea (that's the Latin name literally!) that changes colour depending on the pH level of the soil. </p>

<p>In acidic soils (pH less than 7), the flowers are blue in colour (see pic 1), in neutral soils (pH = 7), it is very pale pinkish to nearly whitish (or light cream) and in alkaline soils (pH greater than 7), it is a bright pink or sometimes purple in colour (although, I've never managed to get it to turn purple). <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrangea#Colors_and_acidity"">Wikipedia</a> gives the following as the reason for the change in colour:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The change in color with acidity] is caused by a color change of the flower pigments in the presence of aluminium ions which can be taken up into hyperaccumulating plants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually, people throw their coffee grounds in the soil next to a hydrangea plant to increase the acidity and get it to turn blue. However, I've never heard of anyone using lemon juice to achieve this effect. Note that lemon juice has a higher acidity than coffee grounds (and I guess stronger than what hydrangeas would prefer) and I'm afraid you might actually damage the roots. If you <em>must</em> use lemon juice, then you might have to dilute it before feeding it to the plant.</p>

<p>If you'd like to play it safe, most gardening centers sell mixes to turn hydrangeas either blue or pink and you could get one of those and feed your plant. It really is worth trying it and a garden with multiple hydrangea plants, each a different shade is very beautiful.</p>

"Is there an easier way to aerate my compost besides turning it?","4378","","<p>I want to be a good composter, but turning my pile is backbreaking work.  </p>

<p>I was looking through a gardening magazine today and I saw a contraption that was basically a three foot long pole that had 6"" arms that fold in along the side when pushing in, and then expanding out when you pulled it out.  The idea is that you just plunge it in and pull it out a bunch of times and blammo - aeration.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6b1az.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><sub>From <a href=""http://www.woodlanddirect.com/Outdoor/Compost-Tools-and-Accessories/Double-Winged-Compost-Aerator?gdftrk=gdfV23673_a_7c1677_a_7c8224_a_7c2910409&amp;gclid=CIKU2-Cikq0CFaQbQgodiwFQnw"" rel=""noreferrer"">Double Winged Compost Aerator</a></sub></p>

<p>Do these types of things actually work, or do I just need to stop being lazy if I want to aerate my pile?</p>
","<p>The point of aerating your pile is to get oxygen to the microbes that break down the organic matter.</p>

<p>I haven't used those compost aerators, but the theory seems sound -- it will ""fluff"" up the pile, undoing any compaction that has happened and letting the microbes breathe.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you've already got a pitchfork and you're willing to do a <em>little</em> work, you may not need the aerator. When I'm feeling too lazy to turn the pile all the way, I just shove the fork in, lever it up and down, and work my way around the pile.</p>

<p>In terms of ""an easier way"": I've seen designs for bins/piles that incorporate perforated pipe into the bottom of the pile. Basically you run a piece of perf-pipe along the ground so that both ends stick out of the base of the pile, and a second pipe vertically, then build your compost pile on top of the bottom pipe and around the vertical pipe. The idea is that the pipes will carry air into the center of the pile. I've tried it and didn't see much benefit -- but I don't know if my execution was flawed or if the idea is flawed.</p>

<p>Another approach would be to layer a few long sticks horizontally across the pile as you build it up, crisscrossing the sticks as you build it. The idea is that instead of turning the pile, you can just grab the end of the sticks and jiggle them to fluff up the pile and get some air in.</p>

<p>And: it's not for everybody, but when my pile gets too big to turn by hand, I push it with the tractor. (You could also attack a big pile with a plow on the front of your truck...)</p>

<p>But: attacking a pile with a snowblower doesn't work very well. The compost is just too heavy and bogs down the machine too much, even at a slow speed. (It was an idea I had to try...)</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that turning the pile is an opportunity to add moisture. (My piles tend to dry out quickly.) When I turn the pile, I will often add water to the middle of the new pile about halfway through turning.</p>

<p>Lastly, if I'm <em>really</em> feeling lazy, I don't bother turning it at all. The pile will still break down, it will just take longer and/or the decomposition won't be as complete.</p>

"How do I choose a good tiller (cultivator) for a 1000 sq. ft. garden?","4373","","<p>I'm getting ready to till about 1,000 square feet, but the problem is I have no experience buying <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_tiller"" rel=""nofollow"">tillers</a>. However, I don't know much about buying them. What should one look for in a garden tiller that's appropriate for the size of my garden?</p>
","<p>It depends on how you plan to use it. Are you going to till every spring? fall? Are you going to use it for cultivation (weed control) of paths? What's your soil like? Are you going to use it to incorporate soil amendments? green manures?</p>

<p>Where I'm coming from:</p>

<ul>
<li>I use a ~35 year old (hand-me-down) tiller to maintain about 3000 sqft of vegetable garden, and a handful of smaller flower gardens.</li>
<li>A couple of years ago I borrowed a brand-new tiller to work one of the flower gardens (to compare performance to my old clunker).</li>
<li>I primarily use the tiller for breaking in new beds -- it hardly sees any use in mature planting areas.</li>
<li>In mature gardens, I manually work in amendments in the spring with a fork -- it takes less time and effort than using a tiller would.</li>
<li>We have <em>very</em> rocky soil (it would be more accurate to describe it as ""gravel with a little dirt"").</li>
</ul>

<p>Given this, my perspective on what to look for:</p>

<ul>
<li>rear tines (mine is front, and it's much harder to control, much more effort)</li>
<li>self-propelled (mine is not, and again it's hard work to shove it around the planting area)</li>
<li>a reverser (without this, when rocks get stuck in the tines, you have to shut off the machine and bang them out with a hammer; you may not care if you don't have rocks)</li>
<li>4-cycle engine (more power and IMO easier to maintain)</li>
<li>get a heavy machine (I haven't used the little 2-cycle machines, but I can't see how they can possibly break up heavy soil to any depth. When prepping new beds in my garden they'd just bounce around on the rocks.)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you just want a tiller for cultivation / weed control, you might look at some of the inexpensive little 2-cycle machines that puree the top inch or two of soil.</p>

<p>Finally, the reason I'm using such an old beast of a machine is that I can't justify the expense of a new one. As Mike Perry mentioned in his answer, definitely consider renting. In a normal year I use mine maybe 10 hours; most of that work would be done in a day or weekend. At around $1000 new, over the next decade I'd be better off renting a machine for $100 each spring (and not having to bother with storage and maintenance). Of course, your other alternative is to look for a used machine -- especially if you are handy with maintenance, you may be able to find a good deal on something that just needs belts and a spark plug.</p>

<p><strong>Today</strong></p>

<p>Looking at it now, it's in a sorry state. The dandelions are back. I removed thirty a couple of weeks back, and there are probably twice as many left, if not more. There are large patches of clover, and another weed that produce rather nice and very tiny purple flowers. Where there is grass, most of it is dead (brown and straw-like), or it's twice the height of everything else.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<p>I accept that I will probably have to start over, but before I do that, I would like to know what I can do to reduce the chance of this happening again.</p>

<p>I read somewhere that weeds tend to grow in places where grasses find it hard to grow. Does that mean my soil needs treatment? If so, with what?</p>

<p>When I dig up the soil, in places there's about 5cm of soil, and then nothing but sand. Is that a problem?</p>

<p>Note: I'm only interested in non-chemicals/organic solutions, though please feel free to explain that option as it might be useful for others :)</p>

Only a few, but as you can imagine, the mower takes them right off. Also, there are patches where what looks like grass grows really fast, while the rest stagnates.</p>

<p>When I laid the turf I actually pulled up the old turf as well - it was a lot of work.</p>
","<p>Let's start at the beginning.</p>

<blockquote>

  dandelions, tap-root and all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sounds like the ground wasn't properly prepped. New sod should go onto a freshly worked bed of topsoil, with no living plant matter in it (this interferes with the new roots, and sometimes weeds will grow through the new sod, causing problems. As you wouldn't want to use an herbicide, you would have had to peel (or cut/dig, if there wasn't a good root system) off the existing lawn, leaving as much topsoil as possible on the ground. Or you can use an organic herbicide, however, these are expensive and most have mixed reviews. More than 1 application may be necessary.</p>

<p>After that, you would want to work the ground, using a hand tool (spade or garden fork), or to save time and your back, a tiller. You should be able to rent one if you don't own one already.</p>

<p>You want to break up the top layer of ground very well, but not go too deep, because you are going to be walking on the new sod, and you don't want footprints or uneven settling. </p>

<p>If all you did was remove dandelions, that explains why the sod did poorly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are large patches of clover, and another weed that produce rather nice and very tiny purple flowers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clover will only outcompete grass where there is a lack of nitrogen. In a healthy lawn, clover may come up, but even in a patch of it, there will be more grass than clover. This is because clover produces it's own nitrogen, and can fill out in the weakened grass.</p>

<p>If the ""weed that produce rather nice and very tiny purple flowers."" looks like <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/4118/what-is-this-purple-flowering-ground-cover/4131#4131"">this,</a> it is creeping charlie, which signifies too low of a PH.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where there is grass, most of it is dead (brown and straw-like), or it's twice the height of everything else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this occurred within 4 months of laying out the sod, it was from improper ground prep and/or watering, or from low mowing in dry weather. Lawn grass actually prefers higher to lower in mowing height. If some of the grass is twice the height of the other plants in your lawn, this suggests too infrequent of mowing. You should mow whenever the grass gets over 2 inches higher than your blades are set, for best results.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I accept that I will probably have to start over, but before I do that, I would like to know what I can do to reduce the
  chance of this happening again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are going to do this without chemicals, you should expect to put lots of time and effort into your lawn. To reduce the chance of this happening again, you will have to provide conditions in which the grass will thrive.</p>

<p>If you are going to re-lay sod, you have to prep the ground as described above. Make sure there are no rocks larger than 2"" across on the surface of the ground. Do not prep if the ground is wet enough to clump together. Even the ground out, so there are no dips where water could puddle. </p>

<p>When you roll out the sod, do not stretch it. Place the strips as close as possible to each other, but don't cause ripples. Once the sod is all laid, take a hose and water in the seams until the soil underneath becomes soft mud. Tamp firmly (but not violently) along the seams, so that the edges mesh together, and there are no air pockets under the sod. </p>

<p>Then you should water down the rest of the sod, but don't make this quite so wet. Only enough that the sod will establish a full contact with the soil beneath, without air pockets. The entire lawn should then be pressed down, either by rolling (preferable), or by light tamping.</p>

<p>The lawn should not be allowed to dry after this, until the sod has rooted and took off growing. Foot traffic should be kept to a minimum, and if the grass grows before well rooted, mow carefully with the lightest weight lawn mower you have access to.</p>

<p>You will also want to use some type of fertilizer, if you don't want the weeds to take over. The best high-nitrogen fertilizer for an all-natural lawn is blood meal. You can start applying this when the sod has rooted. </p>

<p>Also, in the future you will want to water your lawn whenever it gets dry, <em>before</em> it turns brown/yellow. Mow your lawn frequently, and set the deck high. This reduces plant shock, and drought resistance. The roots mirror what the top-growth is doing, so a very short lawn = very short roots. </p>

<p>You will also want to add soil helpers to the ground before laying sod. More on that under the next heading.</p>

<p>Grass also performs best at a ph of between 6.5 and 7. Get your soil tested, and add lime to sweeten the soil to right level.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I read somewhere that weeds tend to grow in places where grasses find it hard to grow. Does that mean my soil needs treatment?
  If so, with what?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is correct. A thriving lawn will out-compete most weeds. If your soil is really shallow and sandy, you will want to add to it for best results. You have a couple of options here. You can:</p>

<ol>
<li>get some high-quality topsoil dumped on your lawn, to create a suitable layer (at least 6"") for the grass-this includes the existing topsoil in your yard</li>
<li>try to build on the soil you have-buy lots of compost or similar product with a high organic matter content and dig them in, to a depth of at least 6"" </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I dig up the soil, in places there's about 5cm of soil, and then nothing but sand. Is that a problem?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that is a big problem. You cannot grow a lawn on that shallow of soil. Also, sand is drying, and the lawn will constantly dry. Also, fertilizer will wash out quickly, before the grass can utilize it. You should have at least 6"" of good topsoil on there, and 8-10 would be even closer to ideal. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm only interested in non-chemicals/organic solutions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will make a good lawn difficult, but not impossible. The main difficulty will be weed control. Even If the lawn is very healthy, you will almost inevitably find dandelions, clover, and other weeds in your lawn, and you will have do remove them the best you can by hand.</p>

<p>Fertilizing is another factor you can't miss. With your sand subsoil, nutrients will leach quickly, and you will have to fertilize often. There are many nutrients lawns need to thrive, but their biggest one is nitrogen. blood meal is a fast acting high nitrogen organic fertilizer, and hoof and horn meal is a slow acting high nitrogen fertilizer.</p>

<p>You may want to consider using one of the many pre-mixed, balanced all-natural lawn fertilizers available on the market today.</p>

<p>Note: I only used this method on lawns which were either extremely sloped, or got washed out easily, or there is going to be foot traffic from pets/wildlife. Sod discourages digging. Generally I will use seed under straw mats.</p>

<p><strong>Update in response to updated question:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't mow that often because our lawn mower isn't adjustable, and tends to cut quite short. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You will not be able to grow a vigorous, healthy lawn with a lawn mower like that. I would be surprised if there is really no way to raise the deck, but if that is the case, I would highly recommend looking for a new mower. </p>

<p>Also, letting the lawn go for a while, then mowing short, is very hard on even a healthy lawn. Short term, I would be better for the grass to be kept too short, rather than growing out in between.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moreover, when I laid the turf I ended up with bumps. Only a few, but as you can imagine, the mower takes them right off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A properly prepped lawn will not be lumpy after the sod is laid. If you level out the ground properly, you should not have this problem. Here's one thing you can try. After working the ground/adding topsoil, but before laying sod, you can use a lawn roller to roll out lumps. Then it will be easier to see the low spots/ high spots, and these can be corrected with a garden rake. roll a second time, and then rake the surface lightly to loosen up the surface soil.</p>

<p>Is your lawnmower a one blade walk-behind/push mower? If so, you can push down on the handlebar, to raise the deck slightly as you approach a lump/high spot. Or if you are able, you can do this over your entire lawn. From what I can see, this isn't a very large lawn. If you are using a riding mower, you will have to put up with a damaged lawn until you can get a new mower. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, there are patches where what looks like grass grows really fast, while the rest stagnates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This could be caused by several factors, but the most common one is inconsistent soil depth, or fertility. It is also much more common in close-mowed lawns, because these grow much faster than higher lawns, and slight differences in the soil will cause big differences in growth. Areas of sod which did not root well originally will often grow poorly for a long time. Different types of lawn grass will grow at different rates as well. </p>

<p>Again, if you can find a way to mow higher, and if you fertilize properly, this symptom will go away. </p>

<p><strong>Update in response to comments:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When is the best time to add topsoil?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should add the topsoil soon before you lay the sod, so it doesn't get rained on. The best time to sod is in the spring after the frost is mostly out. It can be done in fall, but the results are not as good as fall-sown seed.</p>

<p>If you add the topsoil, and it rains, you will have to wait until the ground dries, and then work the ground up a little, and re-level.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I remove the current ""grass"" first, or just dump it on top?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are putting on more than 2 inches (5cm) of topsoil, you do not necessarily have to remove the existing ""lawn"". However, If you don't remove the existing vegetation and work the ground a little before adding new topsoil, weeds growing through the new sod will be a little more of an issue.</p>

<p>If you have a string trimmer, 'trimming' the grass into the ground before adding new soil will help.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it the same process for re-seeding?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The process for reseeding is very similar, regarding soil requirements. Neither one will do as well in soil worked extremely deeply, because this causes issues when settling, and later, when mowing or walking across the ground. New grass wants a firm soil, but which is loosened in the top 1-2 inches (about 2-5cm). This can be done with a garden rake after rolling.</p>

<p><strong>Your lawn is going to be a challenge, but you can definitely do it, and well at that. All it takes is patience, energy, time, and some $$. :)</strong> </p>

"Should trees be staked when they are planted?","4341","","<p>Horticultural practices do change and research can be a driving force.  It wasn't too long ago that standard practice to stake a new tree was a six foot T bar and and a strand of wire.</p>

<ul>
<li>Should all trees be staked when they are planted?  </li>
<li>How should they be staked, and for how long?</li>
</ul>

<p>I am looking for answers that quote references from universities, professional journals or government agencies.</p>
","<h1>Should all trees be staked when  they are planted?</h1>

<p>First, you have to find out <strong><em>Why</em></strong> people stake trees. What benefits are there to staking young trees? In nature, trees can germinate, grow, and mature without being staked. Here are some reasons why young trees are often staked:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Promoted wind resistance:</strong> <a href=""http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/gardennotes/634.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Anchor staking</a> is useful in newly planted trees, especially tall or heavy trees transplanted by <a href=""http://evergreensforsale.com/ball-and-burlap-trees/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ball &amp; burlap</a>, potted trees, or even large bareroot trees, to keep them from rocking in the new hole.</li>
<li><strong>Crown support:</strong> This is a common cause for staking, when a tree cannot hold the  trunk straight on its own, especially in <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/16215/what-does-standard-mean-when-referring-to-shrubs-and-vines"">standardized shrubs/vines</a> and <a href=""http://umaine.edu/fruit/growing-fruit-trees-in-maine/rootstocks-and-dwarf-fruit-trees/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dwarf fruit trees</a>.

<blockquote>
  <p>If the tree has a floppy trunk that is not self-supporting, support staking will be needed. <sup><em><a href=""http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/gardennotes/634.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Colorado State University</a></em></sup></p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>These are legitimate reasons for staking trees, but there are some less beneficial side effects. These <a href=""https://www.extension.iastate.edu/forestry/tree_planting/stake.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">can include</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>may be damaged by rubbing and girdling from stakes and ties</p></li>
  <li><p>the trunk will grow and bend away from the stake</p></li>
  <li><p>the trunk will be stressed more at the point of stake attachment and subject to increased breakage</p></li>
  <li><p>provide more wind resistance because the top of the tree is not allowed to move as much.</p></li>
  <li><p>develop weak wood from the staked position down towards the base of the tree; trunk movement is required for optimum strength of wood during development and growth.</p></li>
  <li><p>produce less roots.</p></li>
  <li><p>reduce stem taper which means less strength of the bole or trunk of the staked tree.</p></li>
  <li><p>height growth may be increased.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Therefore, trees should only be staked if necessary, and only for the time period necessary</strong>. </p>

<p>As I mentioned before, some trees require permanent staking. In those cases, most of these side effects are non-issues, as they will not compromise the tree in future years, under the permanent staking conditions. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is true that there are situations when a young tree is thankful for some mechanical aid, but not as often as many gardeners imagine. Furthermore, even when staking is beneficial to a newly planted tree, it usually remains so for only a short period of time.  <sup><em><a href=""http://www.finegardening.com/stake-or-not-stake"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fine Gardening</a></em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not all trees should be staked. If they can support themselves well, and can handle the stress load from wind in your locality, the side effects of staking will do more harm than good. One must use good judgment when planting a tree, when deciding whether or not to stake. Additionally, if you decide staking will be beneficial, proper monitoring is required, to watch for girdling/damage to the bark, and for root establishment (once the roots get a foothold in the new environment, the staking is no longer helpful).</p>

<h1>How should they be staked, and for how long?</h1>

<p>You want the staking job to support the tree, but not hold it tight. You will have much better development in the trunk if you allow some play. Two stakes is usually good for this, providing much more balanced support than a single stake, while allowing more play than triple. Using three is good only where necessary, to keep trees from rocking or working loose in heavy winds. <a href=""http://www.daytonnursery.com/tips/Tree_Staking.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here</a> is what I do:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Choose two strong stakes, hardwood or softwood, Pine or Hemlock will last longer.  These stakes should be at least 6 feet tall, about 2 inches square and pointed on one end to easily penetrate the ground.</p></li>
  <li><p>Determine the direction of the prevailing wind and insert the stakes exactly opposite one another, about 2 feet from the stem, in line with the wind.  For example: if the wind direction is westerly, then place the stakes North &amp; South.</p></li>
  <li><p>Drive the stakes vertically at least 2 feet into the ground.  Try to bury the stakes so they are the same height above ground.  When finished, stakes should stand upright at about 4 feet. <sup><em>(I personally find that depth overkill in my location, 2 feet is about the maximum depth I put stakes)</em></sup></p></li>
  <li><p>Cut 2 pieces of flexible wire, each measuring at least 5 feet long.  Also, cut up an old garden hose into 2 eighteen-inch lengths.  Then, slip the hose over the wire, and wrap the hose around the tree to protect the trunk from the wire.  Pull equal lengths of the wire parallel to the ground and attach to the top of the stake.</p></li>
  <li><p>Twist the wires together on the outside of the stake to make the wire taut and nip off any excess.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WYu5e.gif"" /></p>

<p>You can do the same thing if 3 stakes are necessary, simply use 3 stakes instead of 2, spaced evenly around the tree. </p>

<p><strong>About how long to leave them staked:</strong> </p>

<p>Short answer: As short a duration as possible. Ideally, stakes are a quick aid in the establishment of the tree, and have no part in long term support. From <a href=""http://www.finegardening.com/stake-or-not-stake"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Staking a tree that does not need it can do more harm than good. Movement of the trunk helps strengthen it by thickening it and giving it taper from bottom to top. Trunk movement also stimulates root growth. So although staked trees might grow taller faster than their unstaked counterparts, their trunks are weaker and their root systems are less developed.</p>
  
  <p>When done incorrectly, staking further compounds a young tree’s problems. If a tree is tied to a stake too tightly, girdling can occur, weakening and even possibly killing the tree unless the problem is addressed in time. Movement of a tree above where it is tied too tightly to a stake, like movement of an unstaked trunk, results in a thicker trunk above the tie. This difference in thickness upsets smooth travel of water and nutrients up and down the developing trunk. Too tight a tie coupled with too rigid a stake can anchor a plant so firmly below the tie that a strong wind can actually blow off the top of the tree. Tying a tree too loosely to a stake also causes problems. The bark is continuously rubbed, resulting in wounds that may never heal properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Leave the tree staked until the root system becomes established - usually one year</h3>

<p>It can take longer, though, if you have very hard soil, and the tree takes more than one year to anchor into it.</p>

<h1>Permanent staking</h1>

<p>As mentioned before, some trees, like standardised shrubs and vines, and dwarf fruit trees, need permanent staking. From <a href=""http://www.orangepippintrees.co.uk/articles/staking-fruit-trees"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A permanent stake is usually a thick treated wooden post, about 2m - 2.5m / 6ft - 8ft in height (or more), which is banged into the ground vertically beside the tree. (In fact usually the stake is planted before the tree). Permanent stakes can also be made of metal. In commercial orchards the stakes may be thinner but in turn supported on a strong wire trellis. In all cases the permanent stake forms a rigid inflexible support for the tree.</p>
  
  <p>A permanent stake has a very different role to a temporary stake. Whereas a temporary stake is there to encourage the growing tree to thicken its stem and eventually become self-supporting, the permanent stake is designed to take-over most of the load-bearing role of the main stem of the tree. This means the tree puts less of its energy into growing a thick trunk to support itself, which means more energy for fruit production. The stake has to be permanent because if it is removed the tree will simply collapse.</p>
  
  <p>Permanent stakes or some other permanent support are always needed for trees grafted on dwarf rootstocks, because these rootstocks are generally too small to support the tree in windy conditions.</p>
  
  <p>Permanent stakes are a standard feature of most commercial orchards, and are particularly effective when the tree is trained with the central leader retained (and tied on to the stake). This form (often known as a spindle-bush) is very productive, and allows light to enter the tree which enhances fruit quality, as well as encouraging the tree to start fruiting much earlier in its life. The benefits of the permanent stake and the central-leader tree forms are equally applicable to the garden situation, especially for apple trees and pear trees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The stake must be strong (with the ability to support hundreds of pounds of fruit), and long lasting. Galvanised steel is a good alternative for treated wood, so you can avoid chemical contamination of the soil around your fruit tree. </p>

<p><strong>If the stake goes down, your dwarf fruit tree goes with it</strong></p>

<p>Permanent staking ensures a weak trunk. That's why it's so imperative for a permanent stake to be able to handle the workload. Make it overkill. </p>

<p>Another viable method to support these trees is <a href=""http://extension.psu.edu/plants/gardening/fphg/pome/pruning/pruning-and-training-to-a-trellis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>trellising</strong></a></p>

<p>About standardised ornamental shrubs and vines, you want them to support as much weight as possible on their own, even though they are not capable of handling their entire weight. Be minimalistic. One rod, like 1/2"" rebar, pounded into the ground right by the trunk and attached via elastic bands, is good enough for small ones. </p>

<p>With a bigger tree (over 3"" diameter), you need something heavier. </p>

"What is the best shade tree to shade the front of my house?","4340","","<p>What type of tree(s) should I plant to provide the best shade on a two-story house?</p>

<p>I would like to provide as much shade as possible on the red square below:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BVFcU.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The part I'm most concerned about is the window area.  That is my office and, in the afternoon, outdoor temps that go over 85 turn that square area into a small oven. Even with the A/C blasting; there's only so much it and insulation will do.</p>

<p>The place to plant the tree is key too.  Here is an overhead view of my house:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NMOsZ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Do you see what the evil sun is doing every afternoon from 2-5?  He wants to bake me.</p>

<p>I understand this task will require a bit of patience so anything that would provide shade in the next 5 to ten years would be fine.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Update</h1>

<p>Based on an answer and some comments, let me refine what ""best"" means:</p>

<p><em>How much should it grow per year?</em></p>

<p>Anywhere between 2-4 feet. </p>

<p><em>How long should it live?</em></p>

<p>I don't know the average life expectancy of trees, but something that would last at least 30 years should be fine.</p>

<p><em>Provide the most shade?</em></p>

<p>Oh yeah!!!  Much-o important-o!  Especially in that little window area in the red box since that is where I work.</p>

<p><em>Should it be easy to maintain?</em></p>

<p>YES!!!  Anything that requires work on the ground (e.g. raking) not a huge deal, but I don't want to climb ladders and trim limbs every season.</p>

<p><em>How big should the tree be to start with?</em></p>

<p>Small enough to fit in the Minivan you see in the garage or that would fit on a small tow trailer.</p>

<p><em>Ideal for your climate?</em></p>

<p>Yes, obviously, but it would help if I listed climate:  Alabama.
I should also mention we get awful tornado weather every year so I would not want to plant something that would blow over and destroy the house.</p>
","<p>A problem is that any tree you plant will take a few years to grow sufficiently to give a second story room much shade. A tree large enough to help you within the next few years will be quite costly, and well beyond your limits for a self-planted tree.</p>

<p>There are some trees like a Leyland Cypress that grow incredibly quickly. However Leylands are not supposed to be good in hot climates, and they have a shallow root system, so storms will be an issue. There are good, fast growing trees you can find for your area.</p>

<p>So you might try planting a second tree that will grow eventually into that hole to block the sun. Don't put it too near the house or driveway though. Any tree that large will be a problem otherwise. Anyway your existing tree will gradually fill out to provide more shade, IF you don't stunt its growth by having another tree next to it. You may do as well by just making sure that existing tree is well watered and has sufficient fertilizer to grow as rapidly as it can over the next few years. So add some drip irrigation around the tree you already have.</p>

<p>I'd save that money on a new tree, and instead look at improving the quality of your insulation. Replace that window with a triple glazed one, with the proper coatings designed to reduce the cooling load. Then I'd look to add an inner layer of insulation on the wall. Go for 2-3 inches extra on those walls the sun bears down on. The nice thing is both of these fixes will give you immediate relief, instead of waiting for 5-10 years for a tree to grow enough to be of help.</p>

<p>A final trick that may help is to cool the garage underneath. Add a fan to vent the air out of the garage when it gets too hot. This will reduce the heat infiltration through the floor of the room above. You may also look at insulating the garage ceiling.</p>

"Resloping Around Foundation With Mulch Bed","4301","","<p>I am getting small amounts of water in my basement after large quantities of rain.  I think the issue is related to a slight negative slope around part of the foundation where water is seeping in.  I want to try to build the slope up around this area that has a mulch bed about 25'x5'.  Should I dig out the old mulch before trying to regrade with a few yards of soil? I'd estimate a few inches of mulch in the area at question.</p>
","<p>I think you should, because the mulch is going to let water pass right through it.  It will be better if you remove the mulch, regrade the soil so that you have at least a 1/4"" per foot drop moving away from the house and pack the soil to encourage the water to deflect away from the house.

"Will dumping paint destroy a nearby tree?","4292","","<p>One of my neighbors complained that another neighbor killed a tree in front of her home by dumping paint in the soil. (Never mind that his trees are fine and there seems no way the paint could be transported from in front of his house to the soil under her tree. She's one of <em>those</em> neighbors.)  </p>

<p>At any rate, I've ""dumped"" leftover paint (from cleaning water-based paint off of brushes and such) near trees from time to time and this got me wondering what sort of damage I might be doing to my trees.</p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> I know it's probably a bad idea, but will it kill my trees over time?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Normally I send the runoff down the drain. My solvents and oil-based waste go directly to the recycling center.</p>
","<p>I'd say it depends on how much paint and what type.</p>

<p>Water-based paint such as latex shouldn't hurt anything if it's sufficiently diluted and in small quantities. I've repainted every room in my house since moving in last year, and I washed out all my brushes, paint trays, etc. in the same spot in my backyard. The grass there hasn't shown any ill effects, and the tree that's about 15' away is completely healthy and unaffected.</p>

<p>However, if you're dumping a half-gallon or so of left-over paint, I'd advise against it. Why not keep the paint in case you have to touch-up your project in the future? Even if you're moving, I'm sure the next owners of your house would appreciate having the matching paint for any touch-ups they may need to make.</p>

"Is there a way I can deter geese from visiting my yard and pond?","4289","","<p>Has anyone had success with any form of goose deterrent? I currently have a small flock of about 10 geese that like to leave their scat all over my driveway and lawn.</p>

<p>I have about 2 acres of lawn and a half acre pond on the property.</p>
","<p>Luckily it sounds like you just have to make your yard/pond less attractive than the other yards/ponds nearby. It's a fairly common problem for people with water features such as ponds on their property, and as such there are several different ways that people have discovered to discourage geese from visiting. Your mileage may vary with these methods, and some of them might not even be an option for you. So use your discretion to choose which method you think will work for you.</p>

<p><strong>Discourage access to water</strong></p>

<p>Geese are lazy, and prefer to walk into the water from the shore rather than fly in and out like ducks do. So if you're mowing to the edge of your pond, you might want to consider doing some landscaping to make it less convenient for them to visit your pond, than the other ponds.</p>

<p>How you landscape the area by the water is up to you, but the goal is that the geese won't easily be able to walk into the water from the land. It could be something like not mowing the area at all and letting the area by the water grow unchecked, or you could even plant some decorative plants or grasses by the water if the unkempt grass sounds like it would be an eyesore, even large decorative rocks that would be difficult for geese to walk across could do the trick.</p>

<p>Other options that might not be as attractive, I think, are: Making the slope to the water steeper, as that would also make it more difficult for geese to access. Or, you could run a wire around the pond, about 6 inches off the ground, right by the water's edge. That acts as a fence of sorts that makes it inconvenient for the geese to get in and out of the water.</p>

<p>If the other ponds are easier to access than your pond, the geese will most likely visit those ponds instead.</p>

<p><strong>Don't feed them</strong></p>

<p>Definitely stop feeding them directly if you are doing so. Offering handouts is a good way to get geese to return for more. But there are also ways you might be offering geese easy meals on your property.</p>

<p>Geese like to eat the short, manicured grass, along with the new shoots that come with it. An easy way to make your lawn less palatable to geese is to keep your lawn at a higher length than normal. I would say you should try to avoid mowing it shorter than 3-4 inches minimum. That should help keep the grass mature and tougher than the geese will prefer.</p>

<p>You might also want to consider cutting out using fertilizer for a while, to make your grass less nutritious than they need as well.</p>

<p>There are some grasses that attract geese as well. Kentucky Bluegrass is a well loved favorite of geese. I've heard that they don't like Fescue, but I don't know if that's true or not.</p>

<p>I don't know much about it as I haven't had any desire to use it, but I've heard that Methyl anthranilate is effective. All it is is a bitter flavoring that you would sprinkle in your yard and it would make it taste bad. There was <a href=""http://extension.arizona.edu/sites/extension.arizona.edu/files/pubs/az1252-1a.pdf"">a study</a> done on it's effectiveness though.</p>

<p><strong>Scare the geese away</strong></p>

<p>First, be sure not to do the scaring yourself, as geese are ornery creatures.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Decoys:</p>

<p>Sometimes a good old scarecrow and/or strips of mylar tape can be enough to do the trick. Part of the problem with geese being such large birds, is that they aren't scared of the usual decoys you might normally use for pests, such as owls, and might not be so scared of humans either (especially ones that don't really move).</p>

<p>One decoy that might work depending on where you live, is a <a href=""http://smile.amazon.com/Alligator-Decoy-Reflective-Canada-Control/dp/B00550XX68/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407459611&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=alligator%20head"">floating gator decoy</a>. It's simply a decoy that you can float in your pond, and it's meant to keep away larger birds such as geese or herons that might be a hindrance to ponds with fish in them.</p>

<p>Another option might be <a href=""http://smile.amazon.com/Flambeau-5889LO-Floating-Swan-2-Pack/dp/B00JFJ7RPS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407460049&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=swan%20decoy"">swan decoys</a>. This is give or take I think. Swans are more aggressive and territorial than geese, so having swans in your pond could deter geese from visiting just so they can avoid the possible confrontation. The problem is that the geese could take it to mean that your pond has a good source of food since there are swans there, and be attracted to it. I've seen it go both ways.</p>

<p>Otherwise I would suggest a <a href=""http://smile.amazon.com/Edge-Innovative-Hunting-Coyote-Decoy/dp/B0016SCIJ6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407460560&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=coyote%20decoy"">coyote decoy</a>, as coyotes would be the most common natural predator of geese, and should make any of them uneasy being in your yard.</p></li>
<li><p>Chasing:</p>

<p>Other people have devised more hands-on methods of scaring the geese away like the <a href=""http://www.goosinator.com/get-rid-of-geese.html"">goosinator</a>. Which really any model airplane or remote control car should be effective enough to chase the geese away.</p>

<p>If you have a medium to large sized dogs, it might be worth letting it loose to chase the geese for you. Herding dogs work best, as geese get put off by the herding methods. Sometimes you can hire goose-herding services depending on where you live.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Don't let them sleep</strong></p>

<p>The geese will want to sleep in or around the pond at night. The best thing you can do here is to make your pond the one that they can't sleep in, and they'll be more likely to move on to a neighboring pond to spend their time.</p>

<p>There are a couple different ways to do this, the most common is placing a flashing light in an around the water. The ones you can find on <a href=""http://www.awaywithgeese.com/products/"">AwayWithGeese.Com</a> are pretty pricey, but they give you an idea of what you would want. A couple lights in the yard, and some on buoys in the ponds.</p>

<p>In combination with lights, or just an alternative to, would be something that makes noise at certain intervals throughout the night. Just something that doesn't allow the geese to get a good night's sleep while they're staying on your property.</p>

Yes, plants do filter air but only when their metabolism is going at full speed, that means lots of light, lots of air circulation.</p>

<p>Outside light levels in the tropics are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight"">hundreds to thousands of times more intense</a> than anything inside your car.  Light in your car or inside a house can be as low as 100 lux whereas outside light levels can be 120,000 lux.</p>

<p>A plant in your car behind glass will not be working at full speed.  It will be just getting by or coasting on stored food reserves.</p>

<p>The original study link quoted above also mentions Grady Player's point that more of the filtering seemed to involve the soil.  Even plants without leaves can filter air when in sealed containers with high light.</p>

<p>If you want to actively filter the air in your car it would be effective to get an upgraded carbon filter for the car.  <a href=""http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/a99/1272511/"">Most cars have two or three cabin air</a> filters and upgraded after market filters are available.</p>

"Should we add gravel to the cacti soil mix for succulent?","4231","","<p>I made a custom cacti soil mix for succulent, which is 1:2:1:1 of potting soil, pumice/perlite, coir and fine vermiculite.</p>

<p>I think it should be quite loose, should I add gravel?</p>
","<p>Soil mixes are a topic that has many opinions. Some common tips are not as good for a plant as you might think.</p>

<ul>
<li>Putting gravel in the bottom of a pot to <a href=""http://www.gardenmyths.com/gravel-pot-drainage/"" rel=""nofollow"">improve drainage</a> is a <a href=""http://www.todayshomeowner.com/garden-myth-putting-gravel-in-pots-and-containers/"" rel=""nofollow"">long time practice that does not benefit the plant</a>. Gravel reduces the amount of soil in the pot and acts as a barrier to drainage until the soil is saturated.</li>
<li>A clay pot to provide some weight for potentially top heavy plants is a good idea. A clay shard over the drain hole prevents fine soil particles from washing out but does not improve drainage either. You could put a piece of landscape fabric or nothing.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the soil mix you mention the components that degrade are the potting soil, which is probably peat based, the coir which slowly breaks down and the vermiculite. If you do not intend to repot the plants on a regular basis a soil mix that would last longer could incorporate some portion of a clay based soil. <a href=""http://www.uri.edu/ce/factsheets/sheets/cacti.html"" rel=""nofollow"">One recipe</a> calls for:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1 part garden soil 1 part coarse builder’s sand 1 part peat moss</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice the use of sand, usually clean sharp washed sand to improve drainage.  Your mix uses perlite and vermiculite to improve drainage.</p>

<p>Try your mix out and see which plants do better in it but don't bother with gravel or clay shards.</p>

"If it's possible to overwater a plant, then how do plants grow hydroponically?","4199","","<p>This is confusing me since I am new to the idea of hydroponics. I have read that it is possible to damage a plant by overwatering it, so how can plants live with their roots submerged in pure water? Is it only possible to grow specific plants using hydroponics? Or is there a large misunderstanding regarding overwatering?</p>
","<p>Given the previous answer, which covers hydroponic growing, I'll just add an explanation of how it's possible to over water a plant which is growing in potting compost, and thereby cause plant death or disease.</p>

<p>The key is in the word 'clean' - hydroponics requires clean water, principally. When a plant has its roots in soil or compost, this isn't clean in the same way. The planting medium is full of bacteria, fungal spores and a wealth of other micro organisms and bio diversity, most of which are supportive of the plant's growth. If you leave this pot with its plant sitting in water permanently, the conditions in the soil change, usually from life supporting to toxic in some way. Gas exchanges are affected, some bacteria multiply and others simply die, and fungal spores may overgrow, thus providing a very toxic environment for the plant trying to survive with its roots in that soil. This is not true of all plants - some grow very well in soggy, wet soil, but the vast majority do not.</p>

"Will my basil plant regrow without leaves?","4184","","<p>I received a potted basil plant a bit over a year ago as thanks for some computer work. Not knowing how exactly to grow it, I kind of let it overgrow, including not nipping it in the bud at first. It started getting sickly and spindly, and its roots had basically filled the pot. So I took a cutting and replanted it in the pot, planting the rest out in my front yard to see how it would do.</p>

<p>The outside plant withered and died (we had some weather fluctuations, but the inside one was sprouting pretty nicely) and then, recently, my wife decided to make a dish and removed <em>all</em> of the leaves. The remaining stem has stayed green, but there's been no sign of regrowth of leaves in the week or so after. </p>

<p>Is it likely to recover? Or should I just start over from scratch?</p>

<p><em>Later edit</em>: I ended up tossing the remaining stem, but I kept most of the soil for a transplanted tomato plant from work. Much to my surprise, a circle of basil sprouts have popped up. I am guessing that, at some point, a flower fell and reseeded, and these sprouted once the main plant was no longer giving them the ""hold"" signals.</p>
","<p>Unlikely to recover - not impossible, but unlikely, and waiting to see if there's any regrowth will take some time. Given you might want some basil between now and Christmas, its probably best to get another plant. And instruct your wife to always leave some leaves on the plant next time... or buy two plants so its easier to leave some leaves in place and still have enough for culinary use.</p>

"Does water temperature affect vegetable plant growth?","4142","","<p>Generally speaking, when watering a vegetable garden, are there any benefits to using cold water vs warm or vice versa? </p>

<p>I'm in Wisconsin, so 90+°F is about as hot as it gets around here. Typically the temps are in the 80s during summer months. I'm mainly comparing water that has been sitting in a brown rain barrel in the sun (warm) vs water from a hose (generally cold).</p>
","<p>It depends -- but it probably doesn't matter.</p>

<p>Steve Solomon discusses correlations between watering and temperature in ""Gardening When It Counts"" (p123), though he doesn't exactly cover your question. Watering <em>lowers the soil temperature</em> because evaporation is a cooling process. I'm not sure whether hot or cold water will cause more temperature loss (seems like that's a question for Physics.SE). I suspect (but the physics people would know better) that there's not much real difference at the end of the day <em>if you're watering the soil and not the foliage</em>.</p>

<p>When you think about it, you're going to put down say 1"" of water and expect it to soak into the top 12"" or so of soil, then you're mixing each unit volume of hot water with 12x the volume of soil. The temperature delta between the soil and the water isn't <em>that</em> big, so you're really not going to modify the soil temperature in a significant way. (And then you'll lose some temperature to evaporation anyway.)</p>

<p>If you're wetting the foliage, water above a certain temperature is going to cause leaf damage. I don't know what that point is, and I suspect it would be different for different plants. So I'd recommend <em>not</em> using the hot water for foliar feeding.</p>

I have seen many trees near new house construction slowly killed by this kind of work.</p>

<p>Another solution is to raise the grade slowly.  By adding two or three inches a year you can achieve what you want in three years.</p>

<p>Another solution is more intensive and involves using 4-inch perforated plastic pipe arranged in 5 to 6 horizontal lines radiating from the tree well like spokes in a wheel to a point beyond the branch spread. This allows air exchange and can be covered with soil.</p>

<ul>

","<p>Trees are generally not pruned a lot in their first year. This means they are usually just unbranched sticks (whips) at the end of their first year. In the second year, the whip's tip is pruned to force it to start branching.  The next year, the three to five best branches from what has grown in year two are selected as the main scaffolding branches for the developing tree.  Everything else above and below the height desired for the scaffold is pruned off, and in that way new growth is directed out to the young main branches for the duration.  </p>

<p>Pomegranates are generally bushes and not trees, and I believe they fruit on 2 year old wood.  So your pruning for shape on that could probably begin now if you wanted it to, but be aware that if you don't let some of the branches become mature it will take longer for it to begin fruiting. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, there isn't a good source of carbon in my mostly-lawn garden. What is the best thing I can do to increase the carbon content in my compost? The cheaper the better!</p>
","<p>If you're using mostly grass clippings you are nitrogen heavy and need to add more <strong>carbon</strong>. Lawn clippings are an excellent source of nitrogen.</p>

<p>Cheap/free sources of carbon:</p>

<ul>
<li>autumn leaves -- mixing these with grass clippings makes great compost</li>
<li>newspapers (sticking with black &amp; white newsprint is safest)</li>
<li>corrugated cardboard (uncoated/unprinted is safest) -- shredding will compost better</li>
<li>straw (if you can get it cheap/free locally)</li>
<li>wood chips (""arborist chips"", which are available free from some municipalities)</li>
<li>sawdust (cheap/free as a waste product from a nearby sawmill)</li>
</ul>

<p>Just don't add too much wood -- it will eat quite a bit of nitrogen as it breaks down. IMO, leaves are the best: they're natural, abundant, renewable, bulky, and free.</p>

<p>Additionally, you could <em>grow your own</em> carbon. If you can afford to convert an area of the lawn into a garden bed, you could grow:</p>

<ul>
<li>oats, which are easy to grow and produce seed (for next year's crop) and straw (which is high carbon). (Other straw-producing crops like wheat or barley would also be possible; I have had good experience with oats.)</li>
<li>sunflowers, which are nice to look at and have woody stalks that contain a lot of carbon (chop them up before adding to the pile  so they break down in less then a decade!)</li>
<li>timothy or other ""hay"" crop (perennial); cut after it's 2' high or so during dry weather before seed heads form and allow to dry for a couple of days. If you add the undried cuttings to your compost pile, you'll just be adding a bunch of nitrogen.</li>

"Can trees be propagated from cuttings without roots or leaves?","4084","","<p>It's well known that many tree species can be propagated by taking stem cuttings.</p>

<p>It's also well known that many tree species can grow new stems and leaves after having the trunk cut.</p>

<p>My question is: can a tree be propagated by cutting a section from the trunk? This would effectively be planting a rootless, leafless cylinder using standard cutting propagation techniques.</p>

<p>I understand this would have a few challenges - notably, the water absorption challenges of a rootless cutting.  I'm looking for strong documented sources saying it can't be done, or for anecdotal successes.</p>
","<p>The type of cutting you are talking about is mostly likely called a truncheon. Some trees will grow from this kind of cutting VERY well. Others not so well or not at all.</p>

<p>A truncheon is <em>usually</em> a 3 foot long stem or branch as thick as your forearm. You denude the truncheon, then let is season for a day or two in the shade so the ends dry out (necessary to prevent the tree from feeding well from the cut) and plant it upright 2 ft deep so that 1 ft remains above the soil.</p>

<p>The best time of year to do this is in the fall. This gives the truncheon a chance to callous and throw roots without trying to push out foliage, and develop some strength during the spring months. This method won't work if you try it in the spring or summer. The truncheon will try, but will ultimately die from heat exhaustion no matter how much water you give it.</p>

<p>Trees that grow well from truncheons are mulberries and locusts (probably other acacia and psuedo-acacia as well).</p>

<p>Trees that will not make it are the conifers, and the hard hard woods like walnuts and oaks.</p>

Gotta see the insect itself, really to suggest how to treat.  Is this plant outdoors or indoors?  Please send pictures of the undersides of the leaves.  Some leaf miners actually live IN the leaf. If you could turn the leaf over, look for slight bumps. Use a razor blade and carefully cut the bump to shave leaf and see if you can find insect.  It'll probably look like a tiny worm...investigate while leaves are warmed from the sun and also while night.  If you can't see anymore damage happening it might be because the insect has matured and flown away leaving eggs inside the leaf.  Just use leaves that are new and undamaged for now.</p>

Hey 'Natural' can be VERY TOXIC. I've used NEEM and it works very well on ornamentals but I wouldn't use it on my basil!!  Heck, take nicotine!  Very natural, but it has got one of the most toxic LD50 (lethal dose for half the population so lower the number, higher the lethality)!!  When did you first see this damage?  Using garden soil in pots is a possible reason your plant got this insect.  Big no-no!  Always use sterilized potting soil (infused with bacteria and mycorrhizae) to plant anything in pots!  Basil is an annual and does have a very short useable life.  Next batch scrub those pots and use potting soil.  No rocks or gravel in the bottom...actually inhibits drainage!!

"Sansevieria leaves wrinkling and browning","4036","","<p>First time with sansevieria in the home. Got them primarily because of the low water needs and put them in rooms that aren't frequently accessed. </p>

<p>How should I water them? What I've read online suggest anything from every 2-3 days to once a month. Have one in a dimly lit basement room with slightly higher humidity and warmer than the rest of the home and it seems to be doing fine. Another was in a brighter, drier room which isn't doing too well. A couple of the leaves have what look like dry tips, and one or too that have wrinkled, darkened and feel dry and thin. One of them has also become limp.</p>

<p>I've barely watered them. The soil they're in is very fast draining. As soon as I pour water over the top it starts to drain out the bottom. It looks like some bark, perlite and maybe a little peatmoss but it's mostly large particles. The next day after watering the top bark looks dry. Keeping a moisture meter in it and by the next day after watering the needle goes down to dry. </p>

<p>How do I keep these plants healthy and will the damaged leaves recover at all or do they need to be pruned?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yvCDZ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Suu9V.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>'I've barely watered them' gives the clue as to why the leaves are shrivelled. Signs of underwatering include leaves which bend over and leaf shrivelling. These plants need less water during winter, maybe every 1-2 months depending on their environment, without wetting the heart of the plant, if they're growing in reasonable potting compost. From spring through to autumn, though, they should be watered moderately whenever the surface of the compost feels dry to the touch. They need average warmth - minimum 50deg F in winter, and will tolerate shade, but prefer bright light with a little sun (beginning or end of day only in hotter regions).</p>

<p>Regarding the soil they're in, either the soil is too light and free draining, meaning it doesn't retain water at all well, or the planting medium is so dry that any water poured in immediately runs through the holes at the bottom without penetrating the soil at all. Given you think there's perlite and peat moss in the mix, its possible its completely dried out and now needs to be soaked to take up water again, so I suggest you pour in water and leave the plant to sit in it in an outer container for an hour, then check and see if there's any water still sitting outside the pot - if there is, tip it away. Cut off severely affected leaves at their bases, and improve your watering regime for the future, particularly for those situated in brighter, warmer situations. Do this by touching the growing medium beneath the bark chips - how dry they are or not isn't really a good guide if they're just sitting on the top, it's the dryness of the soil within that's important.</p>

<p>If you think the bark chips are mixed right through the planting medium, it should still be retaining some moisture because of the peat and perlite - perhaps your moisture meter reads dry within a day after watering because the plant is gasping and has immediately taken up all the moisture provided the previous day, being so dry to start with. Alternatively, change the potting medium, though you still need something that's relatively free draining.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<ol>
<li>0.08"" is commonly available, and might be cheaper (by the foot) in some areas.</li>
<li>Thicker line should be more durable; so if it's about the same price, but it lasts longer, it would be generally more economical.</li>
<li>Trying will not cause the weedeater to explode.</li>
<li>knowing whether or not it can use a different string will be handy
for future reference (it's better to test it at your convenience
than when your options are limited).</li>
</ol>

<p>Cons</p>

<ol>
<li>Thicker line might require more power to move/cut through weeds.</li>
<li>Thicker line will be shorter on the spool (in other words, you might
get 6 ft of 0.065"" line on the spool vs. 4 ft of 0.08"".</li>
<li>Feeding thicker line though the hole (especially during operation)
might be a problem, causing snarls.</li>
<li>Heavier line might cause vibrations (which can lead to a bent rod).</li>

","<p>This is similar to what I did a few years ago.  I needed dirt for the back of a building foundation I was constructing, so I dug up the hard clay from 10ft down and used it to level the foundation which sat on a bit of a hill.  At the end, I was left with a fairly steep slope of ground on which nothing would grow except some ragweed, pokeweed, and some briars.  So I dug out holes like what you're suggesting and filled them with decent soil, then planted strawberries.  I didn't use any pipes.  Its been 3 years and the strawberries are doing great.  On the eastern side, the strawberries have completely filled in with dense vegetation.  On the south and western sides, not as much, but they are spreading some.  I'm not sure if there is a difference in the dirt from the east to the south or if the strawberries like morning sun rather than evening sun.</p>

<p>So, I think what you're doing is a great idea, but I don't see much need for the pipes.  If you want to measure drainage, you could dig the 40cm hole then fill with water and see how fast it drains.  I think you'd be surprised.  I think 40cm is a good depth, but I would make the diameter a little larger.</p>

If the cracks or splits are deep enough to penetrate the tree's circulation, which is in the wood just under the bark, then its easy for bacteria to enter the wound and cause infection.

  <p>Q. Can I change the conditions to suit the mondo grass more than the pennywort and give it a better chance?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>A.</strong> Mondo grass (is an Ornamental grass, this is important for the herbicide part of the answer), prefers a moist soil. Pennywort thrives in wet soils. Therefore if you can reduce the moisture level in your soil you will (to some extent) hit negatively the Pennywort and improve the conditions for the Mondo grass.</p>

<ul>
<li>Improve drainage by amending the soil appropriately. Example, usually that involves adding organic matter to your soil - stuff like compost, finely shredded Autumn ""Fall"" leaves, well rotted farmyard manure, etc. If your soil is more like clay, adding some coarse sand and fine crushed rock can be worthwhile (along with the organic matter)..</li>
<li>Water less (obviously you can't turn off the rain).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q. I don't mind using a herbicide if required. I'm not much of a gardener so any help is appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> From what I have read (links below), an ""imazaquin"" based selective herbicide can be used around some Ornamental grasses to help control/fight Pennywort.

"How do I prune the roots of a rootbound plant?","3871","","<p>This <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/1907/99"">answer</a> talks about pruning the roots of a plant when it has become rootbound. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IJekV.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>How easy is it and how do you go about it?</p>
","<p>Root pruning is typically done when the roots of the plant are all entangled and have begun growing around in circles. Pruning is necessary for the continued growth and health of the plant. </p>

<p>Pruning approaches can vary wildly, depending on how badly the plant is root bound, but the essential goal in each case is the same: free the roots! I'll describe two ways of doing it, depending on the severity of root boundedness.</p>

<h3>1. Mild – moderately root bound</h3>

<p>Here (see examples below), the plant is just starting to get root bound and the roots outside are mostly whitish (new roots) or thin. This is perhaps the best stage to diagnose root boundedness and do the pruning, as most of the roots can be retained without very heavy pruning.</p>

<p>You can start by gently trying to separate out the roots. Try to squeeze and separate or use a tool to shake the soil off. You can also use your fingers to tickle the soil out of the gaps and free the roots. You might not be able to separate individual fibers in the left image, and that's ok. For the picture on the right, you might be able to separate out each of the root fibers.</p>

<p>Snip away any tips of the roots that are bunched up together and cannot be untangled. You needn't try to save each and every fiber. The plant can take some pruning and that's perfectly fine. Usually, these spots are around where the pot has protrusions/ridges (see bottom of both images). </p>

<p><a href=""http://containergardening.about.com/od/containergardening101/f/Rootpruning.htm"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TwSgfm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>

<h3>2. Heavily root bound</h3>

<p>The picture in the question and the following examples fall under this category. If not pruned immediately, the plant will have serious issues.</p>

<p>In these cases, the pruning is generally harsher, as the goal is to first free the plant from being suffocated. For the plant in the question and the first one in the right image, I would take a sharp knife and make several vertical slits (every quarter or an eighth around the base) to cut out the roots that bind it from the outside and be able to pry it open. This is necessary, because the roots have become extremely tangled and have begun going in circles.</p>

<p>Once you do that and start freeing up the roots, you'd actually be amazed to see that some of them are a foot to a foot-and-a-half long! After you've freed them and dislodged the soil, take a pruning scissors and go to town on the roots. Trim them down by cutting off the excess length from the mature, thick roots and keeping as much as possible, of the newer roots (these won't be that long, and you can trim the ends). Do this till you bring the root clump down to a reasonable size, with free roots, ready to be transplanted.</p>

<h3>Some observations:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Although you aren't explicitly cutting the roots in the first approach, as you do in the second, you <em>will</em> hear the thin, young, white roots snap as you pry the root ball open. Do not worry about this; it's bound to happen and the plant will be fine. Remember, some roots <em>have</em> to be sacrificed for the rest of them and the plant to survive.</li>
<li>While you can prune the roots aggressively in the second case, do not over do it. In other words, do not leave a plant with just 2 roots fibers, when it had 30 to start with. </li>
<li>Scheduled root pruning (to maintain the size) is best done in the dormant season. However, if a plant is failing because of the roots, then it's best done immediately (except perhaps, in the harsh winter).</li>

<p>Note that our winter has been unusually harsh. We've had long cold spells, and a lot of moisture, mostly in the form of snow, which only melted a few weeks ago. </p>

<p>What's wrong with my rhododendron? How should I proceed in order to help it thrive? </p>

<p>Update-
My bush has been diagnosed with an infestation of Black Vine Weevil. See answer below for information. </p>
","<p>I wonder whether you've had a very wet winter, or an usually cold one. I'm assuming this shrub was formerly healthy for some years, so this isn't a simple case of chlorosis - it looks, unfortunately, as if its got a fungal infection, probably at the root, causing the symptoms and die back at the top. You can try cutting it right back, in particular removing dead parts, but check the stems first, looking for any cankers that might be present. If you don't find anything and you do cut back, spraying with copper sulphate after flowering, or at least when it should have flowered, and probably again another couple of times, might help, but if its phytophthera infection, you may lose the shrub and it may spread to the others. </p>

<p>I believe you have (in the States) something called a local Cooperative Extension Office - it might be best to contact them so you can get a proper diagnosis from a professional, and a treatment plan, or at least a recommendation to remove any of your rhododendrons so affected.</p>

<p>UPDATED ANSWER;</p>

<p>Cankers usually look like sort of corky or knobbly swellings on the stems, often black, but not always, sometimes weeping, not always, occasionally they just look like black splits or lesions - the presence of these might indicate a particular form of phytophthera.</p>

<p>The fact your winter was very cold could explain the chlorotic appearance and possibly the dieback - but lots of wet weather will encourage root rots (usually a different variety of phytophthera), to which these plants are susceptible, so its quite hard to be sure what exactly is going on.</p>

"How can I correct a nutrient excess in soil?","3857","","<p>The soil sample I took last fall from my vegetable garden came back from the lab with this result:</p>

<pre>

<p>Fortunately the pH is 6.5, which is about where I want it. However, all the lime and manure I've added over the past few years has kind of thrown things out of whack...</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/hort/consumer/quickref/fertilizer/nutri_def.html"">According to this handy chart</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Too much potassium ""Causes N[itrogen] deficiency in plant and may affect the uptake of other positive ions such as Mg and Ca"".</li>
<li>Excess phosphorus ""shows up as micronutrient deficiency of Zn, Fe, or Co"".</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, I don't need to add fertilizer except for nitrogen.</p>

<p>Is this something I should try to balance out? How?</p>
","<p>This is an interesting question. I have studied the chart you mention and, besides all the deficiency/ toxicity symptoms that it states may result from an excess of these nutrients, I would add that in the long term (1) excess calcium can increase the pore space in the soil to as much as 50%, as a result of which the soil dries out too quickly, water uptake is severely reduced and this leads to disease and/or low yields, and (2) excess potassium can contribute to the proliferation of pathogenic organisms and bacteria.</p>

<p>If your soil is rich enough in humus, you can avoid adding any more manure or standard fertilizer, and it should slowly normalize. For nitrogen, I would use a product such as blood meal (12% nitrogen, but only 1% phosphorus and 0.6% potassium). This is ideal for nitrogen-hungry greens, although perhaps not for cabbages, as it produces a mildly acidic soil reaction; nor, of course, for beans and peas, which have root nodules which fix atmospheric nitrogen.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in soils like yours, where the phosphorus level is between 150 to 350 ppm, it can take from 3 to 5 years for the phosphorus balance to return to normal.</p>

<p>You may be under-watering - it's somewhat hard to diagnose over the internet, but both looking crispy and your comment of trying not to get the soil too moist lean that way. I water mine until water comes out the bottom of the pot, and if it's hot I'll leave some in the saucer. My original white ginger (much expanded from a ""soil-free inspected plant in a baggie at the airport in Hawaii"", and split quite a few times) is now 25 years old, and has never had issues with root-rot or the like.

<li>Are the ants all over the plant a bad thing, and, if so, how can I get rid of them without harming the plant?</li>

Scale and aphids both secret a sugar that ants harvest.  You haven't seen a real scale infestation until you walk under an indoor tree and notice that your shoes stick to the carpet.</p>

<p>In the picture above the oldest adults are dark brown and the youngsters are light brown. They move out up and down the leaf vein where the flow of sap is the strongest.</p>

<p>Scale are difficult to eradicate as the hard shell protects them from soap and water.  However a soft tooth brush dipped in soap and water would be effective in removing the adults.  Use the toothbrush once and then wipe the leaves and stems, top and bottom, with a cloth or paper towel soaked in soap and water at five to seven day intervals to catch the eggs and stragglers.</p>

<p>High nitrogen levels will attract scale but the most likely source is that they came with the plant from the grower.  If the grower only had them under control and not eradicated the scale will return as they can hide in the axils of the leaves.</p>

<p>Thanks to GradyPlayer for pointing out that the two are related.  Even with their different lifestyles they are both hard to control on houseplants.  As a former licensed pesticide applicator I found that if soap and water doesn't remove them then pyrethrums, neem oil or registered pesticides are not 100% guaranteed either.  It's not what you use, it's the coverage.  Can you get your choice of control agent to cover the entire surface of the plant and can you get the same coverage when you repeat the treatment at five to seven day intervals?</p>

<li><p>Are the ants all over the plant a bad thing, and, if so, how can I get rid of them without harming the plant?  The ants are there for the plant sugars the scales excrete. Remove the scales and the ants will go away.  They are farming the scale and are not directly harming the plant.</p></li>

"How do I propagate sunflowers?","3802","","<p>I have a sunflower plant growing flowers, and I want to grow more sunflowers in my garden.</p>

<p>How do I grow more sunflowers from the current plant?</p>
","<p>A sunflower should produce seeds in the middle of the flower, so don't cut off all spent flowerheads. When they are ripe, the seeds can be easily removed or will fall off. The seeds may vary in colour, depending on the breed, but will most likely be in the grey-to-brown range, some may have stripes, some will be solid.</p>

<p>If birds eat the seeds right from the head before you can get them, you might want to protect one head with either a thin netting or a thin piece of cloth, but make sure it can ripen and dry undisturbed. Don't use plastic or you are risking mold.</p>

<p>This is the head I used a few days ago for this year's seeds:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7uume.jpg"" alt=""Seeds""></p>

<p>Good seeds should be plump and large. A flower head will yield many seeds, so choose the largest and plumpest for planting.</p>

<p>Just plant the seeds as you would with other plants, at a depth of ca. 1-2 cm and keep the soil humid, but not wet. Some background on your climate and growing seasons might be helpful - if your winters are cold, you should plant the seeds in spring after the last frost date right where you want them to grow. Or you can start  them indoors in small pots, transplanting later after the last frost. This may also be helpful if you have many slugs or other animals that may eat the seedlings as larger plants are often less attractive. If planting indoors, make sure to have good lighting and harden them off by putting them outside on mild days (first a few hours in semi shade, gradually increasing to longer time and more sun) before planting outside.</p>

<p>This year, the seeds I planted took only a few days to germinate and are already pushing up through the soil:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8gy3H.jpg"" alt=""seedlings""></p>

<p>If your sunflower really likes the place in your garden, fallen seeds might even germinate on their own, establishing a small colony.</p>

<p>This is most likely a seedling from last winter's bird seed, containing sunflowers. I doubt that it will mature though, we are not past the last frost date, the slugs are are closing in and it's in a bad spot...:</p>

<p>For 2 out of the 3 trees it was very simple to plant the tree as the soil was very good and to this day both are living very well and growing very well.  The third one I planted was very difficult to plant; not only was there a LOT of clay but there was a TON of poured cement / crushed concrete.  It appears (since this was a newly built house) that the builder just dumped either crushed concrete or concrete itself in this one area and covered it up with some dirt / clay / soil.  I tried as best I could to dig a hole and was so tired in doing so I finally got enough dug to place the tree in the hole.  This tree was always much weaker then the other two trees and eventually this year died.</p>

<p>So because of the design of these three trees this is the first one in a row that has died.  So just taking it out and growing grass would look really odd as I am missing the first out of three trees.  So I have to replant one...so I dug this one out and have been using a huge pick to pick as much concrete out of this hole but it appears I am surronded by this crushed concrete.</p>

<p>I guess my question is how far deep or along the sides do I need to keep digging in order to plant this tree correctly? I do not want to end up with the same mistake the first time of my tree dying again.  Is there some sort of limit in depth or width I need to go before I can say stop then plant the tree and surround it with good dirt?</p>

"Can I put a compost pile under a tree?","3773","","<p>The most convenient spot for my new compost pile happens to be under a young apple tree. I would put it there, but I have a few questions first.</p>

<ul>
<li>Will I be able to make successful compost in heavy shade?</li>
<li>Will the tree's roots be bothered by (or bother) the compost pile?</li>
<li>Will the decomposing plant matter promote disease in the tree or it's fruit?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Yes, heavy shade is fine.  In fact, it may be better, because the pile will dry out slower.</p>

<p>The compost and its leachates will be good for the tree.  I don't know about apples in particular, but the tree will grow roots up into the compost, and you'll need to keep cutting them. On balance, it still should be good for the tree.  It's a minor nuisance.  Don't let the roots get deep into the compost (say, 2-3 years without turning) and then cut all at once - that <em>will</em> stress the tree.</p>

<p>I don't know if it will promote disease in the fruit.  If concerned, you might avoid turning the compost while fruit is ripening, to avoid throwing up lots of mold spores.</p>

","<p>I would take basil by pinching whole stems off. The new growth is the best tasting and the plant will sprout multiple new stems from the old one.

"Why did my orange bell pepper smell of ammonia?","3726","","<p>A week ago I harvested an orange Bell pepper from my garden. It was still halfway green, so I put it on our kitchen counter to ripen. When I finally cut it open for a salad after a week of ripening, it had a horrible ammonia smell, unlike anything I've ever experienced from a vegetable. Visually, there was nothing wrong with it, but the smell was a clear sign that something was rotten.</p>

<p>What can cause an ammonia smell from a pepper?</p>
","<p>I don't frequently have peppers from the garden sit around more than 3-4 days. The time sitting on the counter may have been sufficient for that particular pepper to go bad. Unless the plant appears to be producing rotted produce, I would chalk this one up to a statistical anomaly / too much time on the counter. That said, ammonia is an odd smell to get from a rotting pepper; though not uncommon with other foods (e.g. mushrooms). </p>

<p>I don't know if too much nitrogen might be to blame for the ammonia smell (i.e. there is nitrogen in ammonia, thus ammonia smell is from too much nitrogen; but that's an inversion of a <a href=""http://www.fallacyfiles.org/afthecon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">logical fallacy</a>). Still, it seems to be the likeliest first step in a more detailed diagnosis if the plant continues to produce fruit that smell like ammonia when they ripen. Are you sure ripenening color was appropriate to the cultivar of the pepper? If you picked it too young the resultant bitterness, then ripening could have forced some odd, under-ripe flavors.</p>

<p>Were you having any sinus issues when this occurred? Do you suffer from post nasal drip, acid reflux? Or, did you have independent confirmation of the ammonia smell? Sorry for the health questions, but I'm curious and trying to approach this from a different angle. If you have independent confirmation, nevermind; but if you suffer from these things occasionally, there may have been something that caused a flare up and resulted in these things stimulating an ammonia-y experience. </p>

"Options for an edible privacy ""fence""?","3720","","<p>I live on a corner lot, with neighbors' fencing on two sides of my back yard, the house on a third, and an open street on the fourth.</p>

<p>Rather than installing a fence myself, to provide privacy in the back yard, I had the idea of planting some shrubs or bushes along about a 30-40 foot (9-12 meters) length along the road.  I'm wondering if there might be any food-bearing plants that might do the job nicely.</p>

<p>So my criteria, in order of highest to lowest priority, would be something that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Will grow thick, and at least 4-5 feet tall, but taller would be nice (Clearly a 4-foot shrub wouldn't provide a lot of privacy, but it would keep wandering neighborhood children from drowning in the hot tub, which is the main concern)<sup>*</sup></li>
<li>Grows well in my area (mid-Kansas, Zone 6A) and in moderate sunlight</li>
<li>Will make for at least a semi-attractive shrub row</li>
<li>Will produce a small food crop</li>
</ul>

<p><sup>*Note I may opt to have a (probably wire) fence in addition to the shrub row, depending on how thick the shrubbery turns out to be, for the purpose of keeping pets in, and children out. But if possible, such a fence will be mostly hidden by the greenery.  I'll also provably put a locked gate near the house (between the red line and side of the house in the photo)</sup></p>

<p>I would be happy to consider a combination of plants.  Particularly because I suspect a 40-foot harvest of any single crop will be more than I can eat or give away, whenever the crop ripens.</p>

<p>Secondarily, I had the thought that a combination of shrubs, planted right by the road, and (dwarf?) fruit trees planted a few feet into the yard, might help with privacy more than just one or the other.</p>

<p>Here's an image of my yard, taken from Google's satellite view:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z10CP.jpg"" alt=""Satellite view of my yard""></p>

<p>The red line indicates where I want the privacy wall to go.  The southern end is in direct sunlight practically all day, and the northern end is in direct sunlight all afternoon. (The image must have been taken mid-morning, judging by the shadow positions.)</p>
","<p>These are some ideas but ultimately your decision will have to be made on what is available at your local plant nurseries:
In no particular order of preference:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corylus_avellana"">Corylus avellana</a>: Hazelnut: six feet tall and wide, yellow fall colour, edible nut, likes moist to wet soil, for sun to half shade</li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubus_idaeus"">Raspberry species</a>:  Red Raspberry, black Raspberry: three to four feet tall with prickly stems, sun to half shade (named cultivars might be better for production)</li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambucus_canadensis"">Elderberry</a>: to nine feet, full sun, large white flowers, dark berries</li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viburnum_trilobum"">Highbush Cranberry</a>:twelve to sixteen feet (smaller with pruning), white flowers, bright berries, red fall colour</li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jostaberry"">Jostaberry</a>: to four feet, narrow, tangy sweet fruit</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these has their ups and downs.  The raspberries will need more cutting back.  I have seen elderberries with ugly powdery mildew but that may  be local. The Highbush cranberry is a personal favourite but the berries are only edible by those who are extremely hungry (tart!).</p>

<p>Your chances of getting a crop of any of these shrubs seems kind of slim if you have any wildlife in your area.  Planting Hazelnuts will make you a friend to all the squirrels within five miles of your house.  Berry plants are favoured by birds.  Netting and standing guard around harvest time might be in order if you want a crop instead of a handful.</p>

","<p>You may be watering too much if your soil is wet all the time.  The top inch of soil should be allowed to dry out before you water your plants again, and the pot should be allowed to drain freely in between and not sit constantly in water.  Constantly wet soil for most plants means you will get rotted roots. Rotting roots below will produce brown leaves above, because the rotten roots can't properly take up water and nutrients for the foliage and the plant eventually has to start cutting back on how many leaves it can support. </p>

","<p>The trees that you have seen planted in the ground are not bonsais. The actual word bonsai means ""tree in pot."" There are a lot of beautiful Japanese gardens in the Pacific Northwest. The trees in the ground that you are admiring do not technically have a name. They are simply trees that have been trained and pruned using the same techniques as that for a bonsai in a pot. The training that it takes to do this is very technical. It also requires special tools and varying sizes of copper wire. </p>

<p>This would be an excellent ongoing hobby for an individual interested in learning the art of bonsai. Because this type of gardening is popular in the Pacific Northwest, I'm sure that there is a bonsai society or club near you. I would contact them and ask to join or ask about bonsai classes they may be teaching. </p>

<p>As you may know, a bonsai is a type of pruning, not a specific variety of tree. Many types of trees can be used as material for bonsais. Some trees to think about using are: </p>

"How to tell a nectarine tree from a peach tree?","3713","","<p>Nectarines are actually peaches with an active recessive gene (e.g. similar genetics to red hair in humans). Commercial nectarines are cultivars with this gene. </p>

<p>Although it is relatively rare, in the case of peaches this means a peach stone can produce a nectarine tree, and peach trees can produce nectarine sports (I assume this is from a graft but I don't know the details).</p>

<p>Is it possible to identify a nectarine tree (or branch sport) before it produces fruit?</p>
","<p>Mike is correct here. From whatever I've been able to find on the subject, the two are different only in the texture of the skin of the fruit (and nutritional values). Nectarines might be slightly more susceptible to brown rot disease, but that's not something you can identify a plant with.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.michiganpeach.org/facts/nectar.htm"">this site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A peach and a nectarine are very similar.  Genetically, there is not much difference between the two.  The main difference is that a peach has fuzz on its skin while a nectarine does not. </p>
  
  <p>Nectarines are a bit more likely to be affected by diseases such as brown rot and bacterial spot.  Many nectarine varieties have a spicy ""zing"" to their taste. The nectarine is thought to have originated as a mutant of the peach.</p>

This year I'm having a problem with the mulching mower not mulching. The grass is clumping up and clogging whatever you call the 'chamber' where the blade spins and is supposed to chop up the grass.</p>

<p>It sounds like it's running high or faster, based on what I did last year with the throttle/governor spring. Could this have anything to do with it?</p>

<p>I've had the blade sharpened and balanced recently by a friend and it is plenty sharp. But I think he only sharpened the front main edge. Are there edges on the back edge where it's turned up that also need to be sharpened? Does this actually cut, or just force the cuttings up so they can be chopped up more?</p>

<p>I generally mow when it's dry.</p>

<p>I usually cut it pretty long, on the 2nd or 3rd highest setting, going by those notches and ridges where you manually change the height of the mower near the wheels. I've read you're only supposed to cut 1/3 of the height. I'm not out there measuring it, but sometimes it's been longer with all the rain we've had.</p>
","<p>I think the 1/3 cutting rule is mainly for the health of the <em>grass</em>, not the proper function of the mower. If you let the grass grow long it may choke up the mower even if you are only cutting 1/3. Try setting the deck on a higher setting to see if it goes better.</p>

<p>Also are you moving the mower too quickly? Not sure if yours is a push mower or has an adjustable speed. If the grass is long you may need to take time to work through it.</p>

  <p>The plant needs light but filtered sunlight through a window is usually sufficient. When the plant is brought home from the nursery, it will likely need repotting. The plant needs moderately moist soil. The soil should be fertilized with either regular liquid fertilizing or fertilizer pellets or spiky spikes.

<p>The box will be cedar (non-treated). Underneath the boxes will be a few inches of open air, then concrete.</p>

","<p>That looks good and of a decent size.  If you're growing herbs depending on what type e.g. Mediterranean requiring good drainage I would expect to have about 12"" depth of planter or thereabouts. That can give space for about 2-3"" of good sharp drainage. Less drainage can be used if growing herbs that require a more moisture retaining soil.  The container can also be used for small alpine plants as its deep enough to not dry out too quickly.  The drainage holes about 9"" apart across the bottom, but avoid where you think the supports will be placed, and approx 3/4"" in diameter. 
The screen at the bottom? What is this going to be made from? Marine ply perhaps? If this is to be a mesh of some description make it a fine one so that the drainage doesn't drop through and get wasted.  </p>

","<p>Assuming this cherry tree is not a Japanese species, for these are rarely attacked, this looks like Cherry Blackfly. Its a sap feeding aphid, Myzus cerasi, which overwinters as eggs on fruiting cherries and some ornamental species such as Prunus avium and P. padus. Fruiting trees used to be sprayed with a tar oil wash in winter to control the eggs, but a lot of these have been withdrawn from the market - check in your area to see whether they're still available. In combination with a winter wash, new spring growth on the tree should be inspected, and sprayed with an appropriate pesticide as soon as infestation is seen, preferably before the leaf curling stage - permethrin based ones may still be available. Note that systemic insecticides may damage flowering (ornamental) cherry foliage, so a contact insecticide is probably best for those. (Source: RHS Pests &amp; Diseases Library)

I did everything the nursery worker told me to while transplanting it:</p>

<ul>
<li>I dug a hole twice as wide as the plastic tub it came in.</li>
<li>I removed it from the plastic tub and sliced the edges of the attached roots/soil with a box cutter every 90°.</li>
<li>I used a mix of 50% soil from digging out the hole, 30% good topsoil, and 20% mulch to fill in around the roots.</li>
<li>Before planting, I tilled a circle of about 10' in diameter around where I planted the tree.</li>
<li>I mulched the tilled area, and made sure not to pile up mulch around the trunk of the tree.</li>
<li>I've been watering the surrounding area well once a week for two weeks now.</li>
</ul>

<p>The tree had plenty of green leaves and looked very healthy when I planted it. However, the leaves turned brown, shriveled up and fell off this week. They didn't turn the bright red that they're supposed to. Other trees in the area are just barely starting to lose leaves - most of them are still in the process of changing color. Should I be worried that my tree is dying, or am I just paranoid?</p>
","<p>This is just classic 'transplant shock'. While undesirable, it is also unavoidable when transplanting plants/trees from a nursery to your home. From what you've described, you've taken the right steps to reduce shock. However, there are external factors beyond your control, such as the humidity and environment in the area where the sapling was grown (if it has a 1.5"" thick trunk, it's at least 1-2 years old), its feeding and watering schedule there, etc. </p>

<p>For now, I would suggest that you water more regularly. While it's true that trees (established) require deep watering once a week, younger trees and saplings require a slightly more frequent schedule. I'd recommend at least twice a week at your current watering level, or thrice a week if you can reduce the amount of water (Perhaps someone who has grown maples can chime in on this and suggest something more appropriate if this isn't).</p>

<p>After you've taken steps to minimize the shock, the only other thing that you can do now is to wait. Have patience; sometimes trees take a lot longer to recover and you just have to wait it out. The critical thing right now is to realize that your sapling might not produce any more fresh leaves, but this doesn't necessarily mean it is dead. It just had a very abrupt and short Fall. </p>

<p>Since it's already into Fall now, do not try to fertilize it or try to boost new growth or prune it. For all you know, it could've just dropped its leaves early and started hibernating. If you prod it to produce fresh growth, it won't be ready for the winter, which is much worse than transplant shock.</p>

<p>The leaves are long and sharp, the example shown below is about 30cm high and the leaves are 8-12cm long. I haven't seen a flower or anything for 8 months and the temperature has varied from -3 to 35 C over this period (including rainy and dry times) and the plant hasn't died yet.</p>

","<p>I believe it's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphorbia_lathyris"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Euphorbia Lathyris</a>, commonly known as Mole Purge or Gopher Purge.  Here's another <a href=""http://www.mountainvalleygrowers.com/euplathyrus.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> with a better picture.</p>

<p>If I've identified it correctly, the spike will grow to about 120cm (4 feet) and the flowers will be uninteresting (small and green).  It spreads, but not aggressively; I'm familiar with it from a friend that grows it as a <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/155/26"">repellent for moles</a> and it hasn't taken over his yard, though I know he's had it for several years.  It's easily controlled too; seedlings in the lawn just get mowed down, and in flower or vegetable beds they pull up easily by hand when they're small.  (At 30cm, yours are probably starting to develop a proper root system, so may not be quite so easy to pull.)</p>

<p>The sap is an irritant, so if you've got children or pets, you might want to remove the plants for safety; be sure to wear gloves if you do.</p>

"Why do small fruit fall off chilli plants?","3648","","<p>My chilli plants are flowering and producing fruit now.</p>

<p>However, some of the very young fruit regularly fall off. They are not very big, probably no more than 2mm in diameter. But they definitely taste of chillies.</p>

<p>On some plants the rate of successful fruit out number the rate of failed fruit, on other plants it's the other way around.</p>

<p>Is there something that can be done to improve the rate of successful fruit?</p>

<p>Or is this just the way of chilli plants?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>So here are pictures I took this morning. all my plants sit on the balcony, but the glass on the railing is tinted. I can get ull sun light by moving my plants back from the railing.</p>

<p>I've actually done some comparisons and it seems like the tint filters out enough light, that if I move my plants into full sun, they can get sunburnt.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dfw6v.jpg"" alt=""Plants on balcony""></p>

<p>Here's a slightly yellow stem. This will probably fall off in the next few days. The stem will detach from the plant. There's a tiny little nub of a chilli in there.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OPypA.jpg"" alt=""Slightly yellow stem""></p>

<p>I'm in Sydney and the weather is pretty crazy at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong></p>

<p>I have been hand pollinating and just seeing how things progress. More flowers started turning into fruit but I also had more tiny buds drop off. Then there was a huge storm and the temperature dropped quite drastically for a couple of days and there was a lot of yellowing of leaves.</p>

<p>At this stage I think it's the temperature fluctuations giving me issues.</p>
","<p>Excessive nitrogen, heat stress, insufficient or fluctuating water availability are the usual causes. If you know your plants haven't been subjected to fluctuation in temperatures, and you're not feeding excessively with nitrogen rich fertiliser, look at your watering regime. Water supplies should be regular and sufficient to the plant's needs when its forming fruit, or some fruits will drop. It may be that some of your plants simply aren't getting as much water as the others, which would explain why some of them lose more fruit than they produce.</p>

<p>One other thing to check - examine the bottom end of the fallen fruitlet, not where it was attached to the plant, but the other end, just to make sure there isn't a problem with blossom end rot - if its that, you should see a brown discoloration there. Usual cause of this is, again, irregular or insufficient water supply disabling the plant from taking up sufficient calcium.</p>

<p>You haven't said whether the plants are in pots, indoors or out, or in the ground, so its a little difficult to suggest how to water more appropriately, if that's the issue.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I note the extra information added to your question - you say the weather's been 'crazy' but that's a bit non specific! Chilis don't want overnight temperatures  below 12 deg C, and do better if that temperature remains about 15 deg C. As for daytime temperatures, they do not like anything above 30deg C - this can reduce yields. I still reckon it's a water problem though... when you water, soak the pots thoroughly, then empty out the trays they're standing in after 30 minutes, and again 30 minutes later if necessary. You want them well watered but not waterlogged.</p>

"How to prevent Sempervivum tectorum (Common Houseleek)  from growing in length and not width?","3622","","<p>I have torn a part of this plant twice at my hometown, brought it to where I live now and then planted it. On both occasions, the plant started growing fine at first, but at some point, it started extending its stem and growing in order to reach the sun as much as possible (the top level entirely left the pot). What happened next in both occasions is that the old leaves at the stem started falling off and eventually the stem rotted, dividing the healthy top of the plant from the root.</p>

<p>I've tried replanting the leftover in the first case, but it eventually died off. Currently, I have the leftover of the 2nd plant which I tried replanting, but don't know what will happen yet.</p>

<p>I'm keeping it inside my office. It's facing east. During the morning it's very sunny, but in the afternoon it's not. I water it once per week, or once per 2 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What do I do with this plant once it starts growing in length rather than in width and how can I prevent that? Is the problem that I have it inside the apartment instead of outside?</p>

<p>I'm trying to get it to grow and look like the picture on the left, but mine looks like the one on the right.</p>

","<p>Disclaimer: I've never planted a Sempervivum. This is just my guess.</p>

<p>From the information about Sempervivum on this <a href=""http://www.greenzonelife.com/alpine-and-rock-garden/sempervivum.html"" rel=""nofollow"">page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The hens will die after flowering, but
  by that time they will have produced
  numerous chicks or chickens to take
  their place. Reproduction is normally
  vegetative by cutting the numerous
  stolons growing near the main
  rosettes. To propagate, simply split
  off the chickens from the parent plant
  and transplant them. Providing contact
  with the soil should be sufficient for
  transplanting, since sempervivum root
  readily. The powdery seeds are used to
  produce particular hybrids.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From your 2nd picture, I can see it is flowering. Flowering may weaken the plant, as it consumes a lot of nutrients (this is true of most flowering plants). You may want to make sure that you don't water it too much, as this will only make it weaker. </p>

<p>According to this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sempervivum can be grown in a place
  with full sun to partial shade and in
  well-drained soil, so is the perfect
  plant for hot, dry, sunny locations.
  Though they can adapt to a variety of
  soil types, they will do best in
  gritty soil. No particular care is
  required, but the plant will grow too
  much, making it weak and subject to
  rotting, if there is excessive
  watering or use of fertiliser. They
  suffer in hot summer weather,
  especially if there is much humidity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you search Google images for ""Sempervivum flowering"", you will a lot of pictures similar to yours, but their flower stalk is upright. However, yours is creeping, and I might consider this is an indicator of bad health. May be it's not getting enough sunshine. Can you move it outside? Good luck.</p>

"How often should I harvest herbs?","3588","","<p>I have a few herbs growing hydroponically (basil, chives, cilantro) that are about 4 weeks old.  Right now they are about 4-5"" tall and have a health glow and smell to them.  The herbs are being held at a continuous temperature, light, and nutrient level indoors, so essentially the ""season"" never changes for them. </p>

<p>Assuming that I always have a need for fresh herbs and therefore want to keep my plants alive as long as possible for continuous harvesting, when is it OK to start harvesting them and how often should I?  Is there a certain height/number of leaves recommendation (harvest a quarter of the leaves at a time, half the leaves at a time, etc.)?  Is there a general rule for most leafy herbs that apply for harvesting? </p>
","<p>Herbs (and leaf vegetables in general) must be harvested <em>regularly</em> and not left to mature too much or too soon. Here are a few tips to harvesting herbs — mostly paraphrased from <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/1389/109"">these</a> <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/587/109"">two</a> answers of mine — that'll help you keep a good availability of herbs for most of the year.</p>

<h3>Harvest the young leaves</h3>

<p>There's a reason why grocery stores only sell the young leaves of herbs — the flavorful herbs as we know it are the young leaves of the plant. At this stage in the plant's life, its sole purpose is to grow and as such, the leaves are wider, lush, tender and rich in the aromatic stuff that we love. Once you have a bunch of young leaves (or when the plant is 6"" high), you can start harvesting it a few stalks at a time. </p>

<p>When the plants reach maturity, its focus is to reproduce and die. So the new sets of leaves it produces are a lot thinner and in general, less aromatic (sometimes gets bitter). This is very commonly seen in cilantro, parseley and mint (and less so in rosemary and thyme).</p>

<h3>If you need more, plant more!</h3>

<p>If your culinary needs require larger amounts of cilantro, don't chop off the entire bunch or a lot of leaves at once, because the plant needs its leaves to photosynthesize and grow. My rule of thumb is that no more than 1/6th of the plant should be harvested at a time. Instead, have two plants and take off a 1/6th from each. You can scale this up and plant more as per your needs.</p>

<p>If you follow such a cycling scheme between sets of plants, you'll automatically be trimming the plant, keeping it forever young and by the time you've reached the last plant in your set, the first will be ready to harvest — this way, no plant is overworked.</p>

<h3>Prevent bolting at all costs — pinch the flowers!</h3>

<p>If you notice any flowers growing/flower buds, pinch them off. Remember that a plant's ""mission"" is to reproduce before it dies, to ensure the survival of its species (producing flowers is the first step). If you let it go to flower (also called bolting), the plant, satisfied that it has successfully produced a flower, might decide to stop growing and focus instead on developing that flower into a fruit and eventually a seed.</p>

<p>However, when you remove the flowers you're sort of ""tricking"" the plant into thinking that its previous mission has failed (i.e., it hasn't produced a flower to ensure its survival). This in turn encourages the plant to produce even more leaves for food production (and flowers). However, this will only prolong the life of the plant by a few months.</p>

<p>Basil and cilantro are notorious for ""bolting"" and <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/154/109"">this answer of mine</a> shows how to remove the flowers (it's really easy). Typical indicators of a plant that has bolted or is in advanced stages, is the presence of flowers, <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/q/1906/109"">woody stalks</a> and thin, possibly bitter leaves. At this point, its better to let it go to seed and harvest the seeds for spice (in the case of cilantro) or simply start a fresh one while this dies.</p>

<h3>Plant only what you know you'll use</h3>

<p>I know, it's tempting to be able to grow all possible herbs so that you can use it whenever you need them. However, if you're not prepared to use them up (or share with friends/neighbours) at the same speed as they grow — i.e., if you use them sparingly — it might be a better idea to not plant them in the first place. They'll simply die without being used and most likely, you might end up only needing it when it is at a mature stage, hence spoiling your experience with the out-of-flavour leaves.</p>

","<p>Well it looks like adult vine weevil damage. The adults cause these holes by eating on the plants at night, but its the grubs that cause the most damage. They particularly like pots, so assuming these two plants (looks like Euonymus in the last picture) aren't in pots, then you may have an infestation in pots elsewhere. They do also live in soil though. </p>

<p>Treatment is difficult - pots can be treated successfully with a nematode solution (ordered online, google Nemesys and select vine weevil nematodes) or a chemical drench, but nematode solutions do not work well on open ground which is heavy or dry, and must be applied when the temperature and time of year is right. Thiacloprid is a chemical which can be applied as a drench to soil in containers, but is not suitable for use in open ground. Two treatments which contain this and which are used as a drench are Scotts Bugclear Vine Weevil Killer, or there's a Bayer one too.</p>

<p>Note that the adults don't usually kill plants - the larvae in the soil, though, will eat through roots and kill pot plants particularly. The only 'organic' way of tackling the adult beetles is to go outside at night with a torch and a bucket of water, shake the stems and catch the beetles, or pick them off by hand.
This assumes that you're not seeing slug or snail trails all over the ivy though - I don't see any in the pictures. If you are, slug/snail damage might be the problem, given the very wet weather we've all been having this year and the resulting explosion in the population of these creatures.</p>

<p><strong>What's wrong with this plant? Why so many weird things are happening?</strong></p>
","<p>I don't know what planting medium you've used, but it looks like mud rather than good potting compost, number one, and number two, it would appear the pot you've used has no drainage hole in the bottom. I'm assuming that because you have it standing on the floor in the house without any kind of receptacle outside to catch water when the pot drains down.</p>

<p>Find another pot with a drainage hole, either one large one or several small ones, stand that inside an outer pot or tray, empty the outer container 30 minutes after watering the plant, to make sure its not sitting in water. Use some good potting compost to repot with, which should mean it drains down better. When you repot, try not to leave soil inside the bottom of the leaves.</p>

<p>These two things are likely to be the cause of the problems you've been having.</p>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<p>You say there is a drainage hole, and  you previously had a different plant growing in the same soil that's in the pot. Turn the plant out of its pot, wash and sterilize the pot (doesn't look like that's going to be easy, since it appears to be rough clay or concrete) wash off as much soil as you can without damaging the plant, repot in new, proper potting compost, water in well, allow it to drain freely for 30 minutes or so.</p>

"Control aphids on a linden tree","3544","","<p>We have a  30 year old <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilia_cordata"" rel=""nofollow"">Little leaf linden (Tilia cordata)</a> on the north side of the property.  Although it is apparently healthy every year it gets galls on the leaves and aphids.</p>

<p>The aphids secrete a sticky sap which covers the car from June through September and attracts wasps and flies.</p>

<p>A few years I have tried a dormant oil spray in late winter to try and control the aphid eggs which are probably in the bark of the tree.  My results were mixed as my hand sprayer will not reach to the top of the tree which is now around 30 feet (10 M) tall.</p>

<p>Are there any other methods to control or reduce the aphid population on the tree?</p>

<p>Edit: The situation got worse every year. Yellow jackets were attracted to the sap or the aphids.  They established a nest in the siding of the house.  There were so many they were flying into the car or the house when the doors were opened. An exterminator got rid of the wasps but new ones moved in to feed on the sap.<br>
Solution:  we had the tree removed and stumped.  The rooms were brighter, I don't have to clean out the gutters every year and other shrubs and flowers are doing much better.</p>
","<p>The most effective and safest solution would be to call a tree service. They will have the equipment to reach and cover the tree in its entirety which is essential for proper control.</p>

<p>Otherwise you need to get yourself higher (ladder or get on the roof) or find a more powerful sprayer.</p>

<p>My Ortho Dial-N-Spray sprays farther than my pump sprayer but I don't think that will be high enough. I can get about 12-15' with it. </p>

<p>If you have a pressure washer you can pick up a an injector for it and that might be able to give you a little more reach. That still might not be enough but in combination with a ladder might do the trick.</p>

<p>Alternately, have you considered purchasing and releasing <a href=""http://cagardenweb.ucdavis.edu/?blogpost=10411&amp;blogasset=42184"" rel=""nofollow"">lady bugs</a> as a biological aphid control? Sounds like they'd love that tree.</p>

<p>One more option I haven't used myself but claims to reach 30' high is a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d49GSS0YC1U"" rel=""nofollow"">trombone sprayer</a>. They cost around $60+.</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>Most of my direct experience with tree spraying was for adelgid but I had to look into the same types of dormant and horticultural oils as well as insecticidal soaps.</p>

<p>Your biggest issue seems to be not getting total coverage with the dormant oil. It sounds like the trombone sprayer will be the best option and costs less than a single visit from a tree service in my area. </p>

<p>Once the weather gets warmer, if you still have an issue you can use an insecticidal soap/horticultural oil or just regularly spray with a hose to knock the aphids off.</p>

<p>You said the honeydew gets on the car so I would think that would mean the tree is close to your home. If you can have someone throw a hose up at you while you're at an upstairs window (if you have one near the tree) you might be able to cover a decent amount. Either that or get on the roof or prop a ladder up near the garage wall. That's the cheapest, least toxic way to deal with it but you have to be careful.</p>

<p>In the past I used Volck Oil. Depending on the dilution it can be used as either a dormant or horticultural oil. The next year I still had some adelgid and I switched to this combination Neem/potassium fatty acid spray that is no longer made. It worked just as well as did plain neem oil but things weren't as bad by that point. I haven't sprayed in a few years. I just hose down the tree from time to time with water and haven't noticed a reinfestation.</p>

<p>The most important thing when spraying with a horticultural oil is to mind the weather and do a small test to make sure it won't damage the tree. I used to get up before the sun on a day that was supposed to be cloudy. A day when it's supposed to rain is great since the oil/soap kills instantly so it doesn't matter if it gets washed off after spraying. If you have an infestation and a heat wave I would just spray as much of the tree as possible with plain water in the early morning. At least over the car.</p>

"How do I take care of a Port Jackson fig bonsai?","3539","","<p>A few years ago (4ish, I think) my girlfriend at the time brought me a small bonsai, a Port Jackson Fig (if I remember right!).</p>

<p>I have managed to keep it going so far. At this point, it is more a ""small tree in a pot"" than a bonsai. It hasn't really even been shaped, and I enjoy it looking normal.</p>

<p>I'm going to be honest - over the last 5 months it has been left totally unloved. My watering was random, often with large gaps in between and when I did water, it was normally too much water. So now it's looking very sad. It only has about 4 leafs left on it, they look healthy but there are very few!</p>

<p>I'd like to know how to get it back on track. I haven't changed the soil in ages, so I assume that's step one. What next?</p>

<p>Also should a fig bonsai be inside or outside? Full sun or shade? Even through I've had it for 4 years now, I feel like a bad dad and I'm asking for your help with a crash course in bonsai love.</p>

<p>Any help would be amazing. I've had this thing for so long, that I would hate for it to die because of me! </p>
","<p>Your bonsai is suited to be outside, but where it sits in your yard / balcony depends on your climate. If you've had it inside next to a window etc. you will just as likely kill it by sticking it outside in full sun.</p>

<p>As your bonsai is a tree it prefers sunlight, water and fresh air. If you've ever visited a place with plenty of bonsai you will notice they elevate them on pedestal or on benches so that they can catch the breeze and are in a position where they can get access to regular sun.</p>

<p>The problem with having a plant in sunlight most of the day is you need to have a <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/1617/what-is-a-good-watering-routine-for-a-bonsai"">good watering routine</a>.</p>

<p>If you've had it for 4 years and it is in a small container there is a good chance that it is root bound and the roots need to be trimmed. There is also a good chance the nutrients have been sucked out of the soil. Most nurseries will sell a bonsai potting mix. If you take the plant out of the container and there are way too many roots in there you are going to have to do something about it...</p>

<p>But wait! If your plant is near death, the worst thing you can do right now is go and hack off a third of the roots. What I would do is get a bigger pot, even if it is one of those ugly black plastic things and transplant the poor thing into something where it can recuperate. I wouldn't even remove the remaining dirt from the plant, just tease out the roots and plant it in a larger tub with more dirt, add a little extra dirt on the top layer and add some slow release fertilizer.</p>

<p>At least a year later when your tree has grown a full head of hair then it is time to think about moving it back into a smaller pot. If there is still a problem of too many roots you can, now that it is healthy enough to survive, cut back the roots of the plant so that it has room in the smaller container. Make sure you leave a good mix of feeder roots and established roots and I would suggest not cutting more than a third of the roots.</p>

<p>So the process should be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get a good bonsai soil mix</li>
<li>Get some slow release fertilizer</li>
<li>Transplant to a larger tub</li>
<li>Move it to a position where it can get enough sunlight and fresh air</li>
<li>Leave it for a year to recover</li>
<li>Once healthy and you want to move it to a smaller container consider trimming the roots</li>
<li>Establish a better feeding / watering / pruning cycle</li>

<p>If I try to use organic produce from the grocery store to start different varieties of plants which of them would create quality offspring?</p>

<p>Any vegetables that still have their roots intact like scallions or watercress? </p>

<p>By the way, I am not asking if it is a good idea. I am not planning on starting a garden this way, I am more interested from an educational perspective.</p>
","<p>You're better off buying seeds from the rack in the front of the store.</p>

<ul>
<li>Potatoes are often treated to prevent sprouting.</li>
<li>If you buy organic potatoes, they may sprout, but they may also be carrying diseases. Normally you'd want to buy certified disease-free ""seed"" potatoes.</li>
<li>Garlic might also be treated to prevent sprouting, but planting the cloves might work. You'd probably be better off to purchase a variety that is known to do well in your area.</li>
<li>Onions, carrots, and beets are all biennial. You'd have to store them overwinter, plant the root back in the ground in the spring, and harvest seed. If the vegetable you purchased was a hybrid (they probably are), then the seeds you'd get from this method will not be true to the parent.</li>
<li>I don't know about the seeds (flax, etc). If they haven't been heat-treated (e.g. to kill bugs), then you may be able to plant them. Again you may have the hybrid issue.</li>
<li>As far as ""other"" seeds, I might mention dry beans, again with the heat treatment and hybrid caveats.</li>
<li>Tree fruit (apples, pears, stone fruit, etc) are normally propagated vegetatively. The seed may be viable, and would grow into a tree, but it is unlikely to produce fruit that tastes like the parent (and, I've heard, is unlikely to be worth eating at all).</li>
<li>Vegetables that are really fruit (e.g. tomato) and are sold mature (e.g. pumpkin and other winter squash -- not zucchini and other summer squash), and are truly ""heirloom"" will probably contain seeds that will viably produce another generation. The issue you may run into here is that the vegetables were produced without paying attention to the things that are important for seed saving: roguing, maintaining genetic diversity, and avoiding cross-pollination. Some plants (squashes) cross very easily, so you may get odd results if your heirloom pumpkins were grown nearby some other squash family plant. Most producers selling at market will probably have a large enough population to maintain genetic diversity, but if you don't then the plants that you grow may be weak. Finally, the producers aren't roguing off-types, so your plants may have undesirable genetic variations.</li>

<p>I have successfully propagated and kept these plants at size by any one of these:</p>

<ul>
<li>cutting the stems where they are still green and propagating them in water or even just sticking them in a soil less mix.</li>
<li>cutting all the side shoots off the main brown woody stem.  The main stem will produce new buds and, eventually, leaves.  Keep the plant in strong diffuse sunlight and reduce watering until new growth appears if you do this.</li>
<li>you could cut the main woody trunk back but this has the most stored energy and will bud out new growth readily</li>
<li>the stems that flower will continue to grow after the flower has died back.  You can cut or twist the flower off at any time and the stem will resume growth out of a bud from the top</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that all the above methods require a viable main stem.  Mass canes have the unfortunate habit of dying from over watering from the roots up. You can verify that your plant is healthy by holding the trunk in your hand.  If the bark is firm you are good to go.  If the bark has separated from the trunk then your only option is to cut the stems at the top where they are still green and pot them or root them.</p>

<p>Edit:Linda L asks if cutting the thick woody stem back works.  I have done this. All you need is a sharp pruning saw.  Cut one of the stems back at a time and wait until it buds out before doing the next. There is no need to seal the end with wax as indoor humidity is much lower.  But....this should only be done with a well established plant that has a good root system.  It can take three to six weeks to bud out.</p>

","<p>Artichokes are large and grow fast.  It appears in your photo that there are more than one plant in a pot? Are these just side shoots from one plant?</p>

<p>They can grow fine in a 10 gallon pot as an annual. If you live a zone (8-11 USDA) where the temperature never goes below 14 degrees F during the winter you can grow them out in the garden as a perennial.  The first year, you won't get buds. For winter cut them off a foot above ground and cover with organic mulch. To be extra careful, place an inverted basket over the top and more mulch...even a little blanket of burlap would work with mulch below and above it.</p>

<p>The first year, grown as a perennial they don't usually produce any buds.  The second you'll see buds in late summer and fall. They'll grow to 4' and be 5-6' wide and last up to 5 years.</p>

<p>In colder regions zones 5-7 and sometimes 4, you can get artichokes to make buds the first year by giving them 'the cold treatment'.  (Or find Imperial Star made to be grown as an annual in these zones)...</p>

<p>When your plants are around 6 weeks old, keep them between 35 degrees F to 50 degrees F for at least 250 continuous hours or 10 1/2 days.  If you can't keep below 50 degrees on some days just continue the cold treatment for 4-6 more weeks. It is easier to put them out in a cold frame, at least 6 weeks before last frost, opening the top during the day.
If the soil temperatures are 60 degrees and all chance of frost is past they should be planted out in the garden...minimum of 2' apart, best is 4' apart. </p>

<p>Your soil should be rich with decomposed organic matter.  Use a balanced fertilizer such as 10-10-10. I continually top dress with decomposed organic matter (compost), use fish fertilizer about once a month.  I never allow my plants to dry out too much between watering. </p>

<p>As soon as a bud (usually the main terminal bud) is ready to eat, cut it off with a knife at the base.  This encourages other buds to form and/or ripen.  Keep harvesting as soon as a bud is ready to eat.  Artichokes can produce up to 5 years as a perennial.</p>

<p>They require lots of water, soil that drains very well, a slightly more alkaline pH 6.5 - 8.0, regular applications of organic fertilizer, lots of room to grow, protection during the winters and vigilant harvesting for a good crop (4-7 buds is good).  I like to allow the last bud to flower before the first frost...stunning purple-blue flower that is great as a cut flower, too.</p>

What is the best way to eliminate the weeds and prepare the soil for spring planting?</p>
","<p>I have converted parts of my backyard from lush lawn to lush vegetable patch.  Here is what I tried in ascending order of work involved.  The first two are the approaches that have given me good results so far.</p>

<ul>
<li>With a shovel overturn the patch, i.e. dig up a peice of lawn and put it back turned upside down; I went down about 1 shovel depth.  Cover this with weed control cloth (black material, permiable to air and water, you can probably find it at your local department store) and/or large flat stones.  Leave the patch alone throughout winter.  This should kill most of what was growing in that patch of dirt.  In spring remove the stones and cloth, add manure, compost, plant desired plants.</li>
<li>If you don't want to wait half a year, pull out all the weeds and grass, try and keep the dirt you already have.  Amend this with compost, manure, then plant.</li>
<li>This approach is similar to double-digging.  Dig out the first shovel depth of patch, put aside.  Dig another shovel depth, or two, or more.  Put the first dug layer at the bottom, add compost, manure, dug up dirt.  Keep layering these till you run out of dirt.  Cover with weed control cloth and stones.  Leave patch alone for a winter.  This should kill what was growing there originally plus give you a deep layer of rich soil for the plants you want to plant.  Add compost and manure the next spring before planting.  This is a controversial approach, see <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/q/3595/746"">here</a>, but I suspect it will give me really good results for deep rooting plants like corn, sunflowers, maybe even tomatoes (I will be using this patch for the first time this season).</li>

","<p>It will help to find what variety you have, as some varieties need much wider spacing than others.</p>

<p>Here is an idea of what you are looking for via spacing:</p>

<ul>
<li>2-3' tall matured: Space 10-14"" apart</li>
<li>3-4' tall matured: Space 12-18"" apart</li>
<li>4-6' tall matured: Space 14-24"" apart</li>
<li>6-8' tall matured: Space 16-30"" apart</li>
<li>8-12' tall matured: Space 20-36"" apart</li>
<li>12'-up: Space at least 30"" apart</li>
</ul>

<p>The wider spacings are better for branching varieties. Sunflowers can be grown tighter, but the result may be unnaturally small heads, on top of very long stems. The wider you space, the shorter the stems you will get, and also larger heads. </p>

<p>You can thin them anytime at this point, but I often wait until the plants are 4-6 inches tall, so that I can be more sure of the vigor levels of the young plants. When you are thinning the seedlings that are very close, place a finger on each side of the seedling you wish to keep, to hold the soil in place while you pull the surrounding plants with your other hand. This may not be necessary, but safe is always better than sorry.</p>

<p>The burgundy color on a sunflower stalk, if it is surrounded by normal green sunflower plants, usually indicates a reddish tinged to full dark purple flower. However, some yellow flowered specimens have a burgundy stalk. If you didn't plant a blend, and are looking for uniform color, you may want to cull these. If this is from a blend, try to leave as many different growth types as you can. This is easier when the plants are a little older.</p>

","<p>I suggest you wait and see - the other risk with brushing a cement sand mix onto grass is the sand itself might be high in salts, particularly if it wasn't washed sand. If it is a salt problem, that will sit in the soil for a while, possibly some months depending on quantity, until there's been sufficient rain to flush it all away. Given the type of work you've had done though, its unlikely there's a large amount of salt in the soil; even so any attempt at reseeding won't work till the salt's disappeared, so wait and see for a while seems to be the best option. YOu might even find the grass recovers on its own eventually.</p>

"Why is my Dracaena fragrans wrinkling?","3472","","<p>I have a <em>Dracaena fragrans</em> (corn plant) which is dying. I originally purchased it just over a year ago, when a similar plant I had (<em>Yucca elephantisis</em>) died in a similar manner. Basically, what happens is that the new growth on the cane starts to turn brown and dry out from the bottom upward. I originally had 3 canes, and now I'm down to a single cane with a healthy growth on it. I just saw yesterday that the growth is now starting to turn brown at the base, which indicates it will soon exhibit the same signs and dry out/die.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what I'm doing incorrectly. At first, I thought I was over-watering the plants. I watered it about once every other week, with enough water to saturate the soil. I then made sure that it could drain by adding a bit of sand to the base of the pot, and putting fresh soil over this, which I did last summer (July, I think), so it was last re-potted in July of 2011.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong with this plant... I can't seem to keep it alive! Could you help me figure out what I'm doing wrong?</p>
","<p>Ed has correctly diagnosed the symptoms.  Other facts about the Mass Cane are that it dies from the roots upwards.  New growth is the last to go when the roots are dead.  Your problem may be buying a poorly rooted plant.</p>

<p>This plant is commonly grown in Costa Rica.  When a tree reaches twenty or thirty feet tall it is cut into lengths with a chain saw.  These are shipped to Florida, potted up and then sold to you anywhere from three months to a year later.</p>

<p>If you buy a new plant where the canes are loose in the soil then you are buying a poor risk.  The roots are probably no more than a few inches long.  Another growing practice that affects health and you cannot see is the number of months under shade cloth and how much shade cloth.</p>

<p>The faster a grower can get a plant to market the more money in their pocket.  Yet a plant grown outside in Florida adapts poorly to the light levels in northern climates. Growers should move plants from high light levels to lower light levels to adapt them.  How much they do is not guaranteed.</p>

<p>To keep a plant alive buy good quality stock: </p>

<ul>
<li>well rooted</li>
<li>free from spider mites</li>
<li>and grow it in a brightly lit area</li>

<p>The gauge of wire depends on the strength of the branch you want to train. Give the branch a bit of a bend and note how much force you need, then bend the wire you have. If it takes more force to bend the wire than the branch you have the right gauge wire.</p>

<pre><code>Branch &gt; Wire = Bad

Branch &lt; Wire = Good

"Is it bad practice to leave dead roots in soil?","3459","","<p>Is leaving them in there better or worse than taking them out?</p>

<p>What about for indoor vs outdoor? Is it okay to leave roots in a pot you plan to re-use soil for?</p>

<p>In my mind I am mostly considering harvestable plants like peppers, carrots, lettuce, etc though I am curious about the outliers as well.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Is leaving them in there better or worse than taking them out?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a pot, definitely take them out if you can. They will put out chemicals while decomposing (usually) that slow down the new plants (a kind of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allelopathy"">allelopathy</a>). In a garden bed, usually this process only takes a couple weeks. Also, in a pot, the roots have the potential to mess with water movement, and wick it in odd ways, so that some areas dry faster than others. </p>

<p>So I'd say, in a pot, use fresh mix if possible, and in a garden bed, let the material decompose. It enhances the soil. You can also add retired potting mix to a garden bed. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What about for indoor vs outdoor? Is it okay to leave roots in a pot you plan to re-use soil for?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similar to what I said above, indoors you are growing in pots, and you get best results if you use fresh mix each time. If you're going to reuse the mix, try to get as many roots out as possible. If the last occupant was root bound, you may not be able to separate the mix from the roots well. You <em>can</em> leave the roots in, and plant in the pot anyway, and I've seen some of those with decent results, but it's not ideal. Leaving the roots in works best in large pots/planters, and not so well in smaller pots. Especially down to cell pot size.</p>

<p>Outdoors, in the ground, leaving the roots is better, because the soil microbes will digest the roots quickly, improving the soil. </p>

"Should I compact topsoil before laying turf?","3454","","<p>We're about to order topsoil and turf.  Should topsoil be compacted first, or just leave it loose?</p>
","<p>Well the answer depends on exactly what preparation you've already done to the turf bed. If you dug the area over and removed all weeds, especially perennial ones, that should then be raked level and left to settle. If you're then adding topsoil, spread it over, then walk all over it closely, using your heels, to find any soft spots, then relevel with a rake or a long board dragged over the area, so that you know its flat all over. It's not a good idea to use a heavy roller, you don't want to compress the soil deeply, you just need to make sure the soil is even and flat, without dips and hollows. This is necessary not only for good, complete contact in terms of the roots of each turf, but also for having a flat, even lawn over time.</p>

<p>If you can, wait a few days between spreading the topsoil and actually turfing,so ordering the turf to arrive a few days later would be best. The reason for this is that it gives the area a chance to settle and consolidate; any weed seeds or pieces present in the topsoil should produce growth quite quickly at this time of year, and you'll be able to remove those before turfing. Topsoil often contains quite a few largeish stones and pebbles, and they will need removing prior to laying turf - small or tiny bits of stone are okay. When your turf is delivered, you need to lay it pretty quickly, preferably within 24 hours, but certainly within 2 days, so having time to screen and spread the topsoil without the pressure of a pile of turf sitting waiting to go down makes things easier and you'll do a better job of it. If you can't get it down within two days, you need to unroll the turves and keep them watered till you're able to finish.</p>

<p>The top two inches of the turf bed should be friable and relatively loose, to enable the turf roots to penetrate easily, so rake it up just before laying - it should also be damp, not dust dry, and given the weather we have in the UK at the moment, should it continue, that might mean you have to water it before laying the turf.</p>

I planted it in the biggest container that IKEA sold, 20 inches wide, 2 feet deep. I drilled many holes on the bottom and ensured that water drains out. While the nighttime temperature was below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, I kept the guava inside near a south facing porch door. When the nighttime temperature stabilized to 50 degrees, I moved it outside so that it would get 10 hours of sunlight everyday. Daytime temperatures are averaging 75 degrees. The lower leaves have been slowly becoming yellow. The yellow leaves are dropping slowly at the rate of 2 per week. There are no pests above ground level.

","<p>Okay, you say it was in a smaller pot and the roots hadn't filled that pot. I'm afraid putting it in a much larger pot was the worst thing you could have done if you wanted to keep the tree small. If the rootball that was present originally hadn't completely filled the pot, it would have been best to leave it in that pot until it actually needed repotting, then potted up one size, and again the following year until it ends up in the biggest pot you could find. Plants don't cope well in a pot that's much too large for them - the unoccupied planting medium tends to sour and the plant doesn't do well.</p>

<p>I think I'd be inclined to turn it out of the pot and check the roots, see how they're progressing and if its possible, repot into something more appropriately sized. The trouble is, you may find it now has fewer, longer roots all over the place, so you'll have to see. I'd also not use that bark topping if its encouraging fungus gnats or whatever you've got going on with the insects. Take the mulch out of the equation altogether - this will also mean the plant gets a chance to dry out a bit between waterings - they like to be well watered, but do like to dry out between waterings, not such that the compost shrinks from the side of the pot, but it should feel a bit dry to the touch when it wants watering again, and when you do water, water thoroughly.</p>

<p>If you repot into something smaller, I'd cut it back by a quarter or third to encourage new growth lower down the stems. As an aside, I had no idea IKEA is in the States, we have the same pots out front here in the UK - but I think you're going to need a larger one later on, at least 3 feet deep.</p>

"Am I meeting the light requirements for indoor dwarf citrus trees?","3383","","<p>I've recently purchased 3 dwarf citrus trees that we plan to keep indoors for ~9 months of the year. We are in zone 6 so we can only reliably move the trees to the porch for June, July and August with time moving in and out in the spring and fall for acclimation.</p>

<p>The trees will be kept in 3 different rooms, all of which we regularly use. The individual trees are Dwarf Meyer Lemon, Dwarf Venous Orange and a Dwarf Key Lime.</p>

<p>Current available lights are 6 300 watt max can/spring lights that mostly have 100w equivalent 1600 lumen leds on the 5000K spectrum and then I purchased 3 200w Comp Fluorescent lights that initially will be running 6400k 200w lights that, on the safe side, we will estimate at 13,000 lumens. These lights will all be custom mounted on an adjustable bar and kept a little less than a foot from the top of the trees as they grow and be put on timers for 14-16 hours a day. Combined this calculates out to ~58,000 lux per tree given a 3'x3' area, using 2 can lights and the 1 compact fluorescent. </p>

<p>There will be very little window light access, maybe only a few hours a day from a southern facing window. I'm loath to do anything extra special on the color spectrum, since these are rooms we regularly use like the kitchen/bedroom/hallway. While I can direct the lights so that they are not at risk of shining directly in people's eyes, creating such a bright room that we would not want to sit near it without sunglasses isn't optimal either. </p>

<p>Questions:
Is my current plan sufficient for light? If it is not, what is the most cost effective way of making it sufficient?
Do any of the 3 have greater light requirements than the others?</p>
","<p>I don't know the specific requirements for those trees. However, that should be way more than enough for a nice leafy citrus tree if my 20-year-or-so old grapefruit tree is an indicator. We usually just give it as much light as the houseplants get, and it does well. However, it is rather slow growing on that light, but it's still nice and green and looks great. It's never been spindly, no matter how much light it's gotten. Light mostly seems important for growth rate, with my tree. I think it would just stop growing at all rather than get spindly, if the light were that low. It has gone probably weeks to months without growing before, but it tends to grow more when it gets more attention.</p>

<p>I gave my grapefruit tree somewhat more light a few months ago (because I put grow lights in for my garden plants). It's in my room a few to several feet away from some lamps (no shades) that have 23 watt CFLs in them (three bulbs; two 6500k and one 2700k). The tree is growing much, much faster. The light mostly hits the top of the tree. Technically, there are several CFLs lower down, but the mylar blocks most of the light from those (not all, of course). There's a bit of sunlight coming through the window, but not much. Your setup has a lot more light. You should have thriving trees in no time, if all you want is leaves, unless your citrus trees are different than mine. I grew mine from a seed from a grapefruit that I ate in the 1990's.</p>

<p>If you want flowers and fruit, too, I recommend giving your trees more red light. That means, lower color temperatures. Blue (which is found more in higher color temperatures) is great for leaves. I've never given my grapefruit tree much red light. That may be why it's never produced flowers or fruit. You may also want to give them more potassium and phosphorus, if you want fruit. Typically, my tree has probably only received 24-8-16 fertilizer, and only rarely. I'm trying out other stuff, though. I gave it some potassium sulfate a few weeks ago.

"Will leveling uneven lawns with extra sand kill future lawns?","3375","","<p>I just removed my old front stoop: it was a wall of field stone, filled with a layer of pea stone and 2x8x8 cubic feet of sand, and finally covered by slate. I want to level my very uneven lawn with this sand. My lawn is terrible and I plan to sod or bring in top soil and reseed next spring (I should have done it in the fall but I couldn't get it done in time). </p>

<p>The lawn is less than a quarter acre.</p>

<ol>
<li>Will putting thick layers (up to 5 inches in some places) of sand throughout the yard hurt future lawns? </li>
<li>If I plan on putting a layer of top soil on top of everything, is it ok if I don't mix the sand with top soil (some answers to other similar questions suggest 50/50 mixes)?</li>
<li>If I plan on growing a lawn on top of this sand, do I need to weed before I pour the sand on top?</li>

</blockquote>

<p>If you want to use up some of that sand, here is what I would do (rightly or wrongly), <strong>assuming sod is going to be laid</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Now, Autumn/Fall 2011:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Remove as many of the weeds as I could via hand-pulling.</p></li>
<li><p>Fill the low spots with no more than a 2inch (50mm) thick layer of sand.</p></li>
<li><p>Bring in enough fill material (see below for recommendation) to level out the lawn area.</p>

<ul>
<li>By volume mix 10% to 20% (maximum) of the sand into the fill material.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spread this fill material over the lawn, getting the lawn area as level as I can (doesn't have to be perfect at this stage).</p></li>
<li><p>Walk away and let the fill material overwinter on the lawn area.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Early to mid Spring 2012:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>With a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rake_%28tool%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">heavy-duty metal garden rake</a> work the fill material layer to level it out and break up the surface a little. Remove any large stones, vegetation (including roots, wood, etc) and foreign objects I come across.</p>

<ul>
<li>A (sharp) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoe_%28tool%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hoe</a> would be handy to have, will make short work of removing any weeds (vegetation) that have popped their heads above the surface.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Bring in enough fill material (see below for recommendation) to put down a final 2inch (50mm) thick (sod-bed) layer.</p>

<ul>
<li>By volume mix 10% to 20% (maximum) of the sand into the fill material.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spread this fill material over the complete lawn area.</p>

<ul>
<li>With a heavy-duty metal garden rake level this fill material layer to final grade.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Lay the sod (instant lawn), when doing so, staggering the joints as if I were building a brick wall, also taking my time to ensure I get nice tight joints.</p></li>
<li><p>Lay a scaffold-board over the top of the sod. Shuffle along the board a few times, this will ensure good contact between the sod and the soil underneath is achieved. Move the board over the width of the board, repeat ""shuffle"" process. Repeat, repeat... until the complete area has been tamped down.</p></li>
<li><p>Bring in enough ""high quality"" compost to put down a &#189;inch (12.5mm) thick layer over the newly installed sod.</p>

<ul>
<li>By volume mix 10% to 20% (maximum) of the sand into the compost.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spread this compost/sand mixture over the complete lawn area.</p></li>
<li><p>Lightly water the newly laid lawn, do this daily for the first couple of weeks (assuming no rain). After that, water lightly every 2 to 3 days. Basically you don't want the sod drying out (contracting and gaps appearing along the sod joint lines).</p></li>
<li><p>A month after installing the sod, revert to your ""normal"" watering schedule (or follow the recommended watering requirements for the chosen grass type).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fill material:</strong> Personally I would use a 50-50 mix of ""high quality"" screened (&#188;inch/6.25mm sieved) top soil &amp; compost for filling in low spots in a lawn.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>""High quality"" = Make your own from compost and soil (materials) you control, or buy from a local independently owned garden nursery, or if you're lucky enough to have access to a local (free) community composting facility that is known to output good quality material.</p>

<ul>
<li>Basically you want to reduce the risk as much as possible of bringing in lots! of weed seeds into your environment.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>And do not add sand to garden soil! Again, when one takes clay soil, gravel, lime, gypsum, water and then rotate what does one get? Concrete. Sand is right in there. Does nothing for the soil. The only way to improve any soil is the addition of decomposed organic material. Period. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I usually add some sand to my soil. I did a few granulometric analysis, which show that my soil has high percentages both of clay and of silt (so very low in sand). On a figure (which now I don't find anymore), I saw that more sand will help to keep more water in soil (with IIRC a sweet point around 30% of sand. Much more sand will make water flow away).</p>

<p>Really I add sand only when planting trees, on sub-soil, and few sand on seedlings, not to have mould.</p>

<p>So, is it bad to add sand? Why?</p>
","<p>This reference says that you need to add prohibitive amounts of sand to remediate clay soils. And if you don't get it right, you get a soil like concrete</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problems occur when sand and clay are mixed in incorrect proportions. An ideal soil has 50% pore 
  space (with the remainder consisting of minerals and organic matter). The pore spaces in a clay soil are 
  all small, while those in a sandy soil are all large. When one mixes a sandy and a clay soil together, the 
  large pore spaces of the sandy soil are filled with the smaller clay particles. This results in a heavier, 
  denser soil with less total pore space than either the sandy or the clay soil alone. (A good analogy is the 
  manufacture of concrete, which entails mixing sand with cement - a fine particle substance. The results 
  are obvious.) A soil must consist of nearly 50% sand by total volume before it takes on the 
  characteristics of a sandy soil. For most sites, it would be prohibitively expensive to remove half the 
  existing soil and add an equal volume of sand and then till it to the necessary 18-24"". Mineral 
  amendments of large particle size, such as perlite, may provide some benefit but can also be costly 
  depending on the size of the site. (Reducing this task to amending only the planting hole is a recipe for 
  plant failure and perhaps will be addressed in a separate column.)</p>

<p>If you're going to add organic matter to your clay soil, make sure it's evenly distributed and not just in one area.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The wrong thing to do is to dig planting holes and fill them with organic soil amendment since that creates pockets of soggy ground that fill up with water and rot roots. Also roots will think they are in a container and go around and around inside the amended plant hole and never get out into the surrounding soil.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sULwn.jpg"" alt=""Top view of Brussels Sprouts""></p>
","<p>Purpling on brassicas can be caused by several common occurrences, and thus this is a common problem. It can be caused by soil acidity, so liming might be a good idea, but I think it is probably one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Potassium Deficiency.</strong> This is a common problem in light or sandy soils, and in poor soil. The plant cannot gather enough potassium in the soil, and it causes a purple color on the leaves, buds, stems, or a combination of these. Also, some plants, including some brassicas, are inefficient at taking up potassium during cold weather. Thus, many plants become purplish in cold weather.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Variety.</strong> Different varieties of Brussels Sprouts were developed to have purple coloring, and it is not uncommon for some sprouts that were meant to be green to develop some purple coloring. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these things really affect the flavor of the sprouts, so you do not have to worry about that. It is a good idea to keep your soil in good health by maintaining a good amount of organic matter in the soil, which is best accomplished by adding plenty of compost each year, and keeping your plants mulched. Also, if your soil becomes too sour, you can add lime.</p>

","<p>I'd never use Orthene (or any organophosphate insecticide) where children play.  But I've never had to deal with anything as nasty as fire ants, either.</p>

<p>Here are some thoughts, based on <a href=""http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/chatham/ag/SustAg/fireants.html"">reading</a>.  See especially the links at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>It sounds like you didn't get down to the queen with orthene, which suggests that a different treatment mode might be in order - either bait or a drench.  Because you're working around tree roots, I suspect it may be difficult to get thorough coverage of the base of the mound with a drench.</p>

<p>Consider using a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinosad"">spinosad</a>-based bait.  It can be used as a mound treatment and/or as a wide-area broadcast bait.  If I understand your situation, use it as a mound treatment - broadcasting will kill off other insects, especially other ants that compete with fire ants.  (If you've got fire ants all over, then broadcasting is the way to go, with heavy dosing on the mounds as well.)  It has to be used when the weather is dry - otherwise, it turns rancid.</p>

","<p>Yellowing leaves are almost certain to indicate root problems. The only exception that is likely to occur is chlorosis, which is an iron deficiency and is identified by yellow tissue riddled with green veins. This is not your pattern.</p>

<p>The most common root problem and likely your problem is root anoxia - the roots are not getting enough oxygen. In other words, you are probably watering too much and the roots are drowning. The remedy is to not water so much. </p>

<p>Don't water if you wipe your finger tip across the soil surface and soil sticks to your finger. Dig down into the soil with your finger. Don't water if it feels soggy/mucky - wait until it feels loose and barely damp. </p>

<p>You can substitute a chop stick for your finger. Plunge it deeply into the pot and use it like the dip stick used for checking the oil in the engine of your automobile. Pull it out occasionally and check if the chopstick is wet. If it is, don't water.</p>

<p>If you were to stop watering altogether, your plant likely will begin to turn green and then it would eventually lose turgidity, meaning the stems will droop. If you then water, turgidity will return in a matter of a few minutes to a few hours.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is the possibility that your plant has root rot (a Phytophthora infection). If so, your plant will not perk when you stop watering. Then I suggest you get some 3% hydrogen peroxide at your local pharmacy; put 2 tablespoons of peroxide in a quart of water and drench the roots with the solution (i.e., pour it on the soil surface so that it will drain through all of the soil; make more if a quart isn't enough). Then resume not watering until you absolutely know it needs watering.</p>

<p>Such as inducing a predator insect to attack the beetle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Encourage beneficial insects. Several generalist predators feed on viburnum leaf beetle larvae including lady beetle adults and larvae, lacewing larvae and spined soldier bugs nymphs. The lady beetle adults and spined soldier bug adults also eat adult viburnum leaf beetles. Encourage these and other beneficial insects by avoiding broad-spectrum insecticides and maintaining diverse species of plants for beneficial insect habitat near viburnums. Initial investigations by Cornell researchers on these biological control options also indicate that augmenting natural populations of these predators may dramatically limit viburnum leaf beetle damage. Researcher continues in this area, check back later for more information.</p>

While it hasn't yet been tested, it is likely that putting a sticky barrier such as Tanglefoot tree pest barrier around the base of the shrub could keep larvae from reaching the soil to pupate. </p>

"Can reel mowers be used to cut wet grass?","3323","","<p>So, I picked up a reel mower, and thinking about cutting wet grass with it. When I think about the reasons why I couldn't cut wet grass with a power mower, none of them seemed to apply (There is no deck for wet grass to clump up on a reel mower, and gas mowers push clippings through a hole that is a fraction of the size of the total cutting area of the mower, which is not the case with reel mowers).</p>

<p>So, I probably won't be mowing during any downpours, but can I get away with cutting wetter grass with a reel mower than I could with a power mower?</p>
","<p>Working in Landscape Maintenance in the Northwest US with lots and lots of rain, well, rain and wet couldn't come between my crews and their routes.  We used hydro static gas mowers for traction more than anything. Mowers that aren't hydro static will spin their wheels and dig up/ruin the grass. A reel mower would be less intrusive to the environment being light and propelled by human feet.  If the grass is not too long, the soil not so mushy that you leave deep imprints and most importantly the blades are super sharp there should be no problem mowing in the rain.  Another rule to always be using is to change your pattern of mowing EVERY SINGLE TIME you mow!!!  Otherwise, mowing in wet conditions will quickly make grooves that are not condusive for a healthy, even lawn.  Mow a different pattern each time you mow even in great, dry weather.  Try using an angle versus parallel to the house or walk!  A continuous circle, a diagonal!  I'd easily take a day off mowing if I was not committed to a route.  Always mow once or more per week. Especially with a reel mower that doesn't bag clippings.  The more often you mow the less you have to remove from the top of your lawn and the finer cut will be your clippings.  Finer chopped clippings will decompose quickly.  I would fertilize with fertilizer that incorporates bacteria necessary for decomposing these clippings.  Dr. Earth Lawn Fertilizer is one example.  Also, make SURE you aerate with an aerator that pulls 2-3"" plugs out of the lawn.  Leave the plugs where they are!!  They decompose/break up quickly and help to include soil, bacteria, organic matter to the top of the lawn and thatch beginnings.  </p>

<p>Keep your grass height NO SHORTER THAN 3"".  Grass growth slows down at this height and will be more erect/stiffened than new and faster growth from mowing too short.  You'll take of less.  Weed seeds won't be able to get enough sun to germinate.  Less water will evaporate.  Most importantly 'cool season' grasses NEED to have at least 3"" of topgrowth to FEED its roots by photosynthesis.  Fertilizer IS NOT FOOD.  Plants make their own food and if you want healthy grass you've got to hold to the 3"" minimum!</p>

<p>I have also on super wet days used my gas blower to 'stand' the grass blades up by blowing off the excess water holding the blades down below the blades of my mower.  Or after I mow the first pass, then I used the blower and that would pop up the 'MOHAWKS' of grass that didn't get cut.  Mowing twice or three times (on smaller lawns) was not abnormal.  Gas powered mowers have a 'sucking' or a vacuum action sucking the grass blades UP to be available to be cut.  I always trimmed edges first so that my mower could 'vacuum' up the clippings/leaves. Reel mowers don't really do that.  If you have a smallish lawn, a reel mower IS best!  Just keep those blades super sharp, mow OFTEN (twice per week) to ensure the clippings are small enough to decompose, aerate once per year and find fertilizer that adds thatch decomposing bacteria.  Change your 'pattern' each time you mow!!</p>

"How do I grow root vegetables hydroponically?","3302","","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics"">Hydroponics</a> is the method of growing plants in a soil-less medium.  I've always wondered, how does someone grow a mainly root/bulb-based vegetable (potato, turnip, onion, etc) in a hydroponic environment?</p>
","<p>""Soil-less"" doesn't necessarily mean ""liquid"", though I often think liquid when I hear hydroponics.</p>

<p>See, for example, <a href=""http://www.ehow.com/how_5642856_grow-hydroponic-carrots.html"">this page</a> on growing hydroponic carrots:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Medium hydroponics systems require a physical substance for the vegetables to grow in (in this instance, perlite), whereas solution hydroponics systems only require a liquid nutrient solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially you just use perlite or some other soil-less medium in order to support the roots.</p>

"Which tomatoes grow the best in high temperatures?","3295","","<p>Which tomato varieties have the most heat tolerance?</p>

<p>I live in a dry area (technically considered desert, but you might not think that) where the daytime highs are usually 89° F. or above in summer (up to about 116° F. at the most; temperatures that high are infrequent, but it's not uncommon for it to be over 100° F. for extended periods), and occasionally (such as now), the highs are a little cooler than 89° F. We're starting to get tomatoes on more plants, now. The night-time lows are usually 30+° F. cooler than the daytime highs.</p>

<p>Many new tomato varieties I'm using this year don't seem to set fruit during certain parts of the year, although I had thought the ones I formerly used from local stores were typical of tomatoes (apparently, most of them have some heat tolerance, it seems).</p>

<p>So, I was wondering, which tomatoes tend to be the most heat tolerant?</p>

<p>Also, I'm having the same problem with eggplant, although I'm only growing two varieties (I'm growing about 30 varieties of tomatoes). Feel free to comment there, too.</p>

<p>It should be noted that I'm only asking this question to answer it, because I just made a long list of reportedly heat-tolerant tomatoes, and I wanted to share it with the community. Nevertheless, if you have an answer, please feel free to give it. :) Please excuse the fact that I refer to myself as if I were someone else in my answer. I know there are other lists online, but most of them only list a few heat-tolerant varieties (and often the same ones as many of the other sites).</p>
","<p>Let me preface this answer by saying that due to my experience in 2016 contrasted with my 2015 experience, I personally think soil conditions and composition, kinds of light and light levels, and how you water your tomatoes may have a profound affect on heat-tolerance.</p>

<p>Since the temperature in your area fluctuates so much between day and night, <a href=""http://homeguides.sfgate.com/night-temperature-tomatoes-76197.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the rules are a little bit different</a>. I know the daytime highs in your area might get well into the hundreds, even for extended periods, but it's also important to know that the lows can sometimes be so low that it's actually too cold for many tomatoes to set fruit. For instance, if the temperature drops 35 degrees at night and the daytime high was 89° F., then the low would be 54° F., which may be too cold for many tomatoes (ideal night-time temperatures are supposed to be between 59 to 68° F. or so). Therefore, it stands to reason that not only will heat-tolerant tomatoes be more productive, but that cold-tolerant ones will be, too.</p>

<hr>

<p>However, it's important to note that your area is dry. Some tomatoes do better in wet heat than dry heat, and vice versa.</p>

<p>In my own personal experience, the following tomato varieties produce well in the conditions you described:</p>

<ul>
<li>Black plum (sets fruit in both sun and partial shade)</li>
<li>Early Girl</li>
<li>Galapagos Island (Solanum cheesmaniae)</li>
<li>Husky Cherry Red F1</li>
<li>Lemon Boy F1</li>
<li>Pruden's Purple</li>
<li>Red Pear</li>
<li>Roma</li>
<li>Yellow Pear</li>
</ul>

<p>Partially heat-tolerant (in my own experience):</p>

<ul>
<li>Market Wonder (mostly not heat-tolerant, but I got at least one tomato in the heat, and the plants grew very well in heat, drought and poor soil conditions; my seeds came free from wintersown.org)</li>
<li>Sugar Lump (got two tomatoes in the heat; plants much prefer cooler conditions; the plants did not grow well in heat, drought and poor soil conditions; my seeds probably came from a dollar store.)</li>
<li>Texas Wild Cherry (The plant grew fine in heat, drought, and poor soil conditions, but I wasn't as impressed as I was led to believe I would be. It didn't set fruit in as hot of conditions as most heat-tolerant tomatoes, but it did set fruit in hotter conditions than regular tomatoes. My seeds came free from wintersown.org)</li>
</ul>

<p>It should be noted that people sometimes just get around the problem of summer heat by growing early tomatoes that start producing fruit before it gets very hot.</p>

<p>Another tip is to save your own seeds every year to plant the next. I read that if you get the plants used to your climate for generations, it's supposed to help improve yields and things. I'm trying it. We'll see how it goes. Ask me about it in several years.</p>

<p>I've also read that grafting can help with the heat tolerance. I assume this means that if you graft a tomato that isn't heat tolerant onto a heat tolerant one, perhaps the result may be more heat tolerant. If you try it, let us know if it works.</p>

<p>Also, look for all-weather tomatoes, and those that are said to produce all season.</p>

<p>Okay, so I compiled a list of tomatoes that people have claimed have heat tolerance. The level of heat tolerance isn't specified. So, take this with a grain of salt, and do your own investigation on varieties that perk your interest. My sources include such as customer reviews on varieties at online vendors (such as rareseeds.com) or reviews at gardening websites (such as davesgarden.com), cuke.hort.ncsu.edu, and tomatoes I found via random sites on a search engine, as well as a few varieties I know from personal experience. If a tomato is under one category, that does not necessarily mean it doesn't belong in the other category, too. It's possible that some tomatoes on the list that aren't labeled as hybrids actually are hybrids, too, but most of them should be the sort to breed true. This list is not exhaustive, and I do plan to add to it, in future.</p>

<li>Cherokee Purple (potentially disputed; need to test more)</li>
<li>Kellogg's Breakfast: This needs to be tested more to be sure, but from my observations of growing it, I didn't detect particular heat-tolerance.</li>
<li>Martino's Roma: It's about as heat tolerant (to dry heat) as Paul Robeson is (maybe a little less), in my experience</li>
<li>Paul Robeson: It probably has above-average heat tolerance in dry heat, but in my area the flowers didn't set viable fruit until it cooled down somewhat, whereas varieties like Black Plum and Pruden's Purple set quite a while beforehand. However, it did set a lot of fruit when it cooled down (but my plant was grown indoors to a good age before being planted outdoors in the spring). This variety is definitely drought tolerant in containers indoors, however.</li>

<p>Some varieties are parthenocarpic. This means they don't need pollen to produce fruit. Those might, in theory, do well whether it's hot or cold. It's well established that they can do well in the cold, but some people say they don't necessarily do well in the heat. Here are some:</p>

"Placing eggshells on top of potted plants?","3291","","<p>In general, is there any benefit (growth, soil quality, etc) if I place eggshells on top of my potted plants? </p>

<p>My mother often does it to provide it organic material. She's not much of a scientist. I always ask why she does it. She explains that just does it because she's been advised to by others with more experience and swears by it.</p>

<p>Thus my other question: If there is a benefit of egg shells, what is it? Why is it helpful to do this?</p>
","<p>In addition to acidity (probably not a problem), and very slow calcium release, I'm going to offer a hypothesis as to why she does it...</p>

<p>Crushed eggshells are sometimes used as organic methods of deterring certain pests, especially gastropods such as snails and slugs (see <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/928/what-is-the-best-organic-way-to-defeat-slugs"">this question</a>). Gastropods are unlikely to be a problem in indoor pots, but perhaps she saw someone do this outside around plants in a bed, and copied it? Or even an ancestor did this, and it has been passed down through the generations from village gardening in beds to modern city gardening in pots?</p>

<p>Similarly, it might have been done to help with calcium deficiency in beds, although digging the shells in and crushing them would be much more effective.</p>

"Starting seeds in egg cartons","3286","","<p>I'm in my second year of trying a vegetable garden, and last year I started planting way too late.  This year, I want to start some plants indoors so that I can transplant them outdoors earlier.  I've saved some styrofoam egg cartons and read a bunch on how to start the seeds in them.  But now I'm reading that a lot of people only start them in egg cartons until they sprout leaves, and then move them to bigger indoor containers before moving them outdoors.  We're getting close to outdoor planting season here. Do I really need to move them multiple times, or can I just start them in the egg cartons and them move them out into the garden?  </p>
","<p>No, you need to move them into pots before putting outside, and they should be moved once they develop 2-4 sets of true leaves (not counting the first set, the cotyledons) at the latest. The plug of soil in your egg carton won't be big enough for proper root formation, and any plant is only as good as its roots. Move into small pots, grow them on a bit, then harden them off before planting outdoors in your prepared area. It's one of the tedious bits about growing from seed indoors, the need to pot on I'm afraid, and it's not a step you can omit. Starting with larger containers doesn't help for individual seeds, they're better started off in something shallow (your egg boxes or seed trays, peat starters, whatever) then transplanted as seedlings into something larger.</p>

<p>Depending where you are and what vegetables you've chosen, some seeds can be planted straight into the ground a bit later on, into a prepared area with friable soil.</p>

"What is causing my lavender's leaves to turn grey and wizen?","3283","","<p>I am trying to grow a lavender plant on the windowsill of my apartment in Brooklyn. I got this more succulent lavender after some more delicate french lavender had died on the same sill. This plant has lasted longer, but some of the leaves have gone silver and wizened.</p>

<p>I am trying to water it quite infrequently, as I believe the last lavenders died from overwatering. We've oscillated between very hot dry weather and cooler damp weather in Brooklyn over the past month.</p>

","<p>First of all, this is definitely not a lavender, but the related <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perovskia_atriplicifolia"" rel=""nofollow"">Russian Sage, <em>Perovskia atriplicifolia</em></a> secondly, this is a cold-hardy perennial plant, not suitable for growing indoors.

"How often should I water my vegetable garden in Arizona in the summer","3273","","<p><strong>Question:</strong> 
I have an above ground garden that I recently built. <strong>I live in Arizona and currently temperatures rise to 100-110 degrees.</strong> I need to know how often and how long to water it.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Above Ground</strong> Just in case this pertains, I picked this because I have a 6 month black lab puppy who loves to dig. That and we live in a rental property and I really don't want to have to uproot a garden when/if we move.</p>

<p><strong>Soil:</strong>
50/50 mix of Miracle-Gro Potting Mix and omni. I did not use any AZ soil.</p>

<p><strong>sunlight:</strong>
Garden sits along west wall of backyard so it gets about 6-8 hours of sunlight and that tan shade is drawn over it at all times during the summer.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2z4DL.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>The simple answer is to water when the garden needs it. Make a small investment in a soil moisture probe. Check the moisture level in the morning. If the soil is dry, run the water. If there's enough moisture, leave it alone.</p>

<p>Checking the soil surface isn't good enough: the surface can appear dry but there's still moisture deeper down where the roots are. That's why you need a probe.</p>

"How to make a Snake Plant Potting mix in three category: Perfect, Good, and okay","3227","","<p>I think title is clear. By graphic instructions, I mean pics of soil/sand/gravel and potting mix. If this question is weird and off-topic, I will delete it.</p>
","<p>The copy below is taken directly from the International Sansevieria Society's website at <a href=""http://www.sansevieria-international.org/cultivation.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sansevieria-international.org/cultivation.htm</a>, hence, I would say this falls into your ""perfect"" category. As it indicates below, Snake Plants are highly adaptable so long as their soil drains quickly.</p>

<p>Sansevierias are succulent plants and so need a well-drained compost and moderate watering. In the summer months they can be watered frequently and appreciate this, as long as the soil does not remain water-logged, but in the cooler months they are best left dry. A minimum winter temperature of 10°C is recommended. Short periods of lower temperatures may however be tolerated as long as the plants are dry.</p>

<p>Sansevierias will grow in many positions but appreciate good light and dappled sun to grow naturally and produce good leaf shape and colouration. Long green leaves, often produced in low light situations, and admired my some collectors and growers, are not normal and the leaves tend to be weak and featureless.</p>

<p><strong>The soil used for Sansevierias can be adapted to suit whatever materials are available locally. The main constituent needs to be a material which anchors the plant in the ground but at the same time keeps the compost open to allow for excess water to drain through quickly. This could be pumice or lava or any other neutral material. To this needs to be added in about equal proportions some kind of material containing humus and fertilizer. Again almost anything will be suitable, peat or coir based composts or even orchid composts with a slow release fertilizer added.</strong></p>

<p>Sansevierias are difficult to keep in captivity as they always try to escape! Most spread through underground rhizomes. These are very strong and can split a plastic pot or shatter a ceramic one! Many species also send new shoots down vertically. In open ground these go so far and then turn upwards ensuring the new growth is not too close to the mother plant when it emerges from the soil. In a pot of course this habit has the effect of pushing the whole plant and soil out of the pot! The only solution is to repot into something deeper to allow the shoot to reach bottom and turn back upwards. Once the new growth has emerged and produced leaves it can be removed and potted separately if so desired. Potting in hanging baskets is another way to facilitate off-setting.</p>

<p>Propagation is by division as described above. Most plants can also be propagated from leaf cuttings, but not the variegated forms. Plants can also be produced from seed although this is a slow process.</p>

"What is this flower that smells like a skunk?","3223","","<p>This has been blooming in the sun in my yard in Massachusetts for the past two weeks. We've only lived here since last spring and since I didn't plant it, I'm guessing it's a  perennial. What's intriguing is that the flower smells like it's been sprayed by a skunk. The leaves have no odor. Can anyone tell me what it is? </p>

","<p>It looks like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleome_hassleriana""><em>Cleome hassleriana</em></a>, commonly known as spider flower.</p>

<p>Identifying characteristics are the compound leaves with seven leaflets, the long petioles (leaf stalks), the way that the individual flowers are held tightly furled around the flower head, and the long stamens visible on the older flowers lower down on the head.</p>

<p>It's an annual, and spreads easily, so you may end up with more of it next year if you don't remove the seed heads when they form (if they even will, this late in the year).</p>

"How can I make my Moringa Oleifera happy again?","3220","","<p>I'm having some problems with my Moringa Oleifera. It's about 6 months old and is placed in a sunny window (oriented south), in southern Sweden. It's been growing well and looked healthy until recently.</p>

<p>Now, many of the leafs are getting spots, turning yellow and eventually falls of - see photo. Since it summer in Sweden now, I don't think it's lacking sunshine. Neither do I think it's gotten too little or too much water since I try to keep that under good control (letting it dry up, but not too long, before I water it).</p>

<p>Any ideas about what could be wrong?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ns47R.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>I can't see a photo, nor a link to one, but my answer isn't dependent on that anyway. This plant is a pan tropical tree - its fast growing, and lives for around 20 years, reaching a height of 12 metres at maturity.</p>

<p>I'm sorry to say, if you're trying to grow it on a windowsill, that's why it's got problems. As it's fast growing, keeping it in a pot small enough to be on a windowsill means it cannot follow its natural inclination to put on growth very rapidly, because there's insufficient room for the roots to grow to support the topgrowth. After 6 months, it may well have reached the outer limits of its growth within the pot. It does sound as if its got some kind of Leaf Spot infection, but plants are more likely to suffer infections if their conditions cause them stress.</p>

<p>This plant appears to be possibly suitable for culture in a semi tropical greenhouse or conservatory, in progressively larger containers, rather than as a houseplant on a windowsill. Once it's reached a certain size, then stooling/pollarding is possible to keep it at around 1-2 metres, but it does need good root room.</p>

"How should I repot these overgrown and delicate plants?","3205","","<p>I've got several plants that are probably overdue to be repotted.  One of them is a cactus with lots of new growth and sharp spines.  And the other is a jade where many more of the cuttings survived than I expected.  With each of these, I can't simply grab the trunk to support it, and particularly with the jade, I worry that the weight of the soil will cause a lot of damage.</p>

<p>With the cactus, I've seen suggestions to wrap it in newspaper.  And with the jade, I may be able to get a knife in there to separate the soil from the side of the pot.</p>

<p>Are there any other tips and tricks that can be used to minimize damage?  Note, the pots are nice, so I don't want to damage them either.</p>

<p>Edit: For those unfamiliar with Jade, it looks like this with leaves that easily separate which can be stuck in the ground and they'll grow a new plant.  I did this with a dozen or so leaves from a dying plant, expecting 3-4 to survive, and almost every one of them survived so I've got a crowding issue:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IJ4KD.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The cactus looks a lot like this (web site from the pic calls it a Mammillaria gracilis Preiff) and with all the new growth around the sides, I don't think I'll be able to get a knife in there:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sCgJL.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>I don't know which cacti they are, but I just use gardening gloves. Yes sticking-out spines will go through them. The spines on a small barrel cactus or mammary cactus where they are wrapped around more, are less likely to go through gloves. </p>

<p>Usually I'm working with opuntia (<a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/280/do-opuntia-prickly-pear-cacti-readily-form-hybrids-in-the-wild"">see this question for photos</a>), where the spines stick out more, but there are usually gaps between the spines where a pad can be held without being spiked. Opuntia are also pretty hardy when it comes to this kind of thing. They get a bit of a  rough treatment if I'm cutting pads off for cuttings (depending on your cactus type, this might be something to consider?). Also the ""cinnamon bunny ears"" opuntia requires sacrificial garden gloves. It doesn't have spines but has nasty hairs that stick in the gloves. Often it is best to just throw the gloves out after use.</p>

<p>Newspaper does sound a good idea - especially if it is like a barrel or mammary cactus with the spines wrapped around. The paper should deflect them - the opuntia spines may still go straight through the paper.</p>

<p>So yes, I would try to loosen the soil and carefully pull the cactus out (wrapped in newspaper). Do the whole thing over newspaper to catch the soil and debris.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit after seeing photos:</p>

<p>Yes the cactus looks like one where the newspaper trick would work. It is more of an upright mammary cactus to what I have (or see growing locally),  but it has that wrapped-around ""bird nest"" pattern with the spines.
I see there's some finger space around the base, so I think you should be able to turn it upside down and tap the root ball out of the pot.</p>

<p>You may be able to split the side growths off once it is out of the pot. A knife would help make a cleaner cut. (my opuntia don't seem to mind but as I say, they're pretty tolerant of a lot!)
I looked in ""Cactus"" by Elisabeth Manke, Barron's. This says <em>M. gracilis</em> grows to about 4 inches. No specific propagation instructions, but says <em>Mammillaria</em> can be propagated by seed, grafting, or cuttings. I'm not a fan of cactus grafting - visually it never looks right.</p>

<p>If the jade cuttings took so well (sounds very much like opuntia in this respect), then I wouldn't be afraid of bits breaking off. If they do, you have more cuttings. Soon you'll be giving them away to your friends. Perhaps put fewer in each pot next time. Perhaps 3-4?
(The optuntia pads are obviously a lot larger, but I plant those one pad per pot and get >90% success rate. )</p>

"How to encourage weeping cherry to grow larger","3196","","<p>I purchased my Mother two 'Weeping Cherry' trees this year. I've planted them out and they've actually shown a large amount of new growth. I've had new whips growing 2'+ off of them. The plants are roughly 5' tall from the ground. There are no limbs all the way up and the trunk is ~2"" in diameter. All the growth is on the top and it's all coming out of the top 4"". I know it was probably cut and encouraged to do this at the nursery, since many people will buy them as a container plant or as a decorative plant for a small yard.</p>

<p>However, she has a large yard and would like to grow this tree much larger. I know they do grow to be large and I would love something that grew to look like this:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/77R1y.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/77R1y.jpg"" alt=""Weeping Cherry""></a></p>

<p>I will add pictures of what mine currently look like soon, but my question is about how to encourage them to grow bigger. With a regular tree, they'd tend to put branches straight up and I could choose a leader to encourage it to grow. However, these all hang down. Will they just keep building up higher, will it eventually put out a leader, do I need to pick one that's close to the top and splint it up till it thickens and stays pointing up? What do I do in this situation. Thank you.</p>

<p>Edit: Here are the pictures I promised. Also, the back of the plant tag said it would get roughly 34-40' tall and have a 20-30' spread. I did see that it was grafted. When I say it has whips growing out, you'll see them in the pick, they don't grow straight out. It appears there were branches on the grafted section that were pruned back and the new whips are growing horizontally and down from near these joints. Because of the tag, I wasn't really worried about the height, but more about if I needed to do anything to encourage it to grow upwards, since the branches all droop. I didn't know if a leader would eventually grow upright.</p>

","<p>If it is Prunus subhirtella 'Pendula', you don't need to do anything at all other than keep it watered during dry spells. Ultimate height and spread of this particular variety is around 2.5-4.00 metres (up to 13 feet) wide and high, and that height and spread will be achieved after ten-twenty years, but if you've got the plant tag, it should tell you the height and spread on there. Over time, some specimens may achieve a greater ultimate size than others - there's one in Virginia that's 35 years old and is about 20 feet high with a spread of around 40 feet. Usually, these trees are grafted on top of a straight stem - the height of the stem varies usually between 6 and 8 feet. When you say you've got '2 foot whips', does that mean you've got stems growing straight up into the air from the top of the plant? A photo would be useful.</p>

<p>Fertilising in spring with a balanced fertiliser would be good, but isn't critical. It's programmed to grow at a particular speed (slightly variable depending on conditions) and to achieve a particular height and spread; this process cannot be hurried or persuaded to go faster. This variety is considered a small tree - according to the link below, there are others that get larger, so you will need to purchase a different variety to get the size you want, see here (I'm not convinced they're much larger, really and to some extent, its dependent on the height of the stem and graft union)</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Now you've posted photos, its not going to change my answer - it looks healthy, so just needs to be kept well watered during dry spells in the next two years, and it'll grow on, no pruning/training interference necessary! I just wanted to check that the '2 foot whips' you mention weren't growing straight up into the air, which they're not, so it's fine.</p>

"What is a good source for free or inexpensive nursery pots?","3188","","<p>Are there free (or low cost) sources for nursery pots? Presumably nurseries reuse them. I'd like to get a few dozen in varying sizes for starting vegetables.</p>
","<h1>Be Creative</h1>

<p>Be creative -- my two favorite free pots for transplanting up (i.e. repotting tomato/pepper/broccoli/etc seedlings into a larger container) are milk cartons and yogurt tubs.</p>

<p>Half gallon cardboard milk cartons are the perfect size for tomatoes. I rinse them well, cut off the top, leaving 4-5"" on the bottom. Drill a few holes in the bottom for drainage and you're ready to go. The only problem I have is that they don't ""nest"" -- storing a bunch of these takes up a fair amount of space. These are very durable; you must take the plant out of the box when transplanting, and the box can be reused for at least a couple of years.</p>

<p>2 lb yogurt tubs are about the same size. These just need drainage holes drilled in the bottom. These are easier to store: they nest, so you store a lot in a small space. These are durable as well; the only problem I've had is with cracking. When they crack or break, you can recycle them (assuming your local place takes #5).</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.simplyforties.com/2009/02/making-toilet-paper-roll-seed-starter.html"">Toilet paper rolls</a> are an interesting idea; I haven't tried this.</p>

<p>I've seen several slightly different sets of instructions on making <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-organic-planting-pots-using-old-newspa/"">newspaper pots</a>. As another answer notes, make sure your ink is soy based -- some inks are toxic.</p>

<h1>Not as Good</h1>

<p>The smaller single serving milk or yogurt containers are ok, but a bit small for transplants. Don't try to use metal cans (e.g. soup cans) -- these are ok containers for growing, but it's impossible to get a plant out when it's time to transplant. Egg cartons seem like a good idea, but they are just too shallow.</p>

<h1>Ask</h1>

<p>As other answers noted, ask at the nursery, ask your friends. Ask at the local deli, they may have tubs that they discard when empty. Keep your eyes open for containers that would be good for growing.</p>

<p>The downside to this approach (see below) is that you end up with a varied collection of containers and your plants are harder to manage.</p>

<h1>Up Front Investment</h1>

<p>You can have a never-ending supply of pots by simply not needing pots.</p>

<p>If you don't mind a one-time expense, check out <strong>soil block makers</strong>. These are a little hand-powered device that you use to compress potting soil into a cube. The cubes hold their shape surprisingly well and are a nice way to start plants. You can get small, medium, and large block makers, along with an indent attachment so that the small blocks fit into the next size up. This way you can ""pot up"" your tiny seedlings as they grow.</p>

<p>I've used the 2"" block maker (makes 4 at a time) with good results. A friend borrowed my block maker this spring for use in his new greenhouse and started several hundred vegetable and flower plants successfully on his first attempt using this strategy.</p>

<p>I've also used the 3/4"" block maker (makes 20 at a time) with good results. You can fit about 300 blocks on a cookie sheet -- that's a lot of spinach! Then, by changing out the insert on the 2"" block maker, you can make 2"" blocks that you can drop the 3/4"" blocks directly into for another couple of weeks of growth before transplanting out to the garden.</p>

<h1>Trays</h1>

<p>Another way to go is to sidestep the individual pot and <strong>use trays (flats)</strong>. Again this requires a bit of an up-front investment in time and/or money. You may have or be able to find scrap wood that is the right dimension to use for this project; just be careful to avoid wood that has been treated/preserved (pallets are sometimes chemically treated so they last longer).</p>

<p>In ""How to Grow More Vegetables"", John Jeavons describes how to use flats that you can build yourself. Make shallow trays for starting seeds and deeper trays for pricking out when the plants are ready to be potted up. I should confess that I haven't built the trays as described, but they don't seem to require much building skill. I instead used some containers (old window boxes) that I had around the house that matched the depth specifications from the flats in the book. I followed the recommended spacing from the book for plants in flats, and everything transplanted into the garden easily. Also take note of his cautions and consider building the smaller size flats: an 11x22x6"" box full of moist soil will be deceptively heavy!</p>

<p>The big advantage of trays over something like milk cartons or a collection of individual containers that you've scavenged is uniformity. They're:</p>

<ul>
<li>easier to move in/out of the house when hardening off</li>
<li>easier/faster to water</li>
<li>faster to set up -- fill and plant</li>
<li>more flexible -- tomatoes need more room than basil, you don't need to ""waste"" a 4"" milk carton and all that space/soil on a single basil plant</li>
<li>easier to plan around -- you can set up your shelves and lighting based on the size of the trays (e.g. four trays to a shelf/light) <em>or</em> if you're building trays and already have shelves, you can adjust the size of the trays to what you have for shelves so that you can fit an even number into a shelf with no wasted space</li>
</ul>

<p>The only disadvantage that I've found is that if you're starting multiple varieties (e.g. I don't want 50 of the same kind of tomato, I want 30 paste, 6 of two different kinds of cherry, and 14 beefsteaks) it's challenging to keep the varieties separate within a single tray -- you should definitely have a separate planting container!</p>

"How should I speed up the decomposition of sickly sweet smelling giant compost heap?","3182","","<p>I have created a monster of a compost heap on my property (3 meters, by 2 meters, by almost 2 meters tall) next to an old granite rock wall. Anyway, I mostly put all my grass clippings (primary offended of volume of material) as well as leaves and other material. I just started doing this because I didn't think it would be good to have the local rubbish company haul this off.</p>

<p>As of late, the pile has started getting a bit bigger than I want it to, and it exudes a sickly sweet smell.  What can I do to speed up the decomposition of all this vegetation?  I don't mind the smell that much, since it's pretty far from the house.  However, will any process I initiate cause any other odours to come from it that may be more noticeable than the current smell?</p>

<p>I'm not after dirt, just trying to lessen my impact a bit (and stop that smell).</p>

<p>Will some of those organic disintegration agents work (like a stump dissolver)?</p>
","<p>If your pile has a sickly sweet smell (not ammonia) it is probably not from a huge overdose of nitrogen. You say that you've added leaves and other material -- so there is some carbon in your pile. My guess is that the composting process has gone anaerobic. In other words, you've got the wrong batch of bacteria working on breaking down the pile. Anaerobic breakdown will be very slow and give off this kind of smell.</p>

<p>You can get the right batch of bacteria (aerobic) working on breaking down the pile by allowing air to penetrate the pile. Right now your pile is so big that the center is not getting any air and these bacteria can't go to work.</p>

<p>Some bits of advice:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep your piles to about 1.0-1.5m cubed; this is an ideal size for a compost pile. It is easier to work with, but large enough to get the aerobic bacteria working. Alternatively, you can make a windrow of about that size but as long as you want. When you're composting this way, the pile with shrink a lot as it breaks down -- you don't have to worry about a mile long row of compost.</li>
<li>To introduce air and make your piles more manageable, you can: Take your existing pile and break it into about a half dozen piles, thoroughly mixing it as you go. Or try poking a long pole (as thick as you can find and are able to insert) into the pile to introduce air into the center. Your pile is big enough that the latter solution may not work well.</li>
<li>If you break your existing pile into separate piles, and you have some carbon-containing materials that you can add, it might be a good idea. Carbon is hard to come by this time of year (no leaves, etc but you may be able to get hold of some spoiled hay that you can mix in) so if you don't have anything just adding air might work.</li>
<li>As you're adding material, if you can make a layer of hay or straw every 10-20cm or so, you'll allow air to naturally move into the pile. If you don't mind keeping a bale or two of straw handy, I would just add a layer of 2-3 flakes of straw, and then dump the clippings on top of that. This will prevent it from getting too wet and matted down, and at the same time help to balance your carbon to nitrogen ratio.</li>
<li>If you can't or won't keep hay/straw on hand, you can add carbon to the compost pile by keeping a pile (or barrel, or bags) of wood chips or sawdust near the compost pile. Add the chips/sawdust as described above for hay -- about a 0.5-1.0"" layer of wood to a 4-6"" layer of grass (experiment to find out what works best with your materials).
<ul>
<li>Avoid charcoal briquettes because they take a long time to break down (you need more surface area) and they can have additives that will make your compost toxic to plants.</li>
<li>Avoid wood ash because it will raise the pH of the pile too much and put the wrong microbes in control.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can make a big pile of autumn leaves this year right next to your grass compost pile. If you can keep it dry they will be easier to use next summer, but even wet, matted leaves will do the job. This is another good carbon source you can use as described above to balance the ratio.</li>
<li>If you have topsoil or mature compost <em>that have not been sterilized</em> you can add to the pile as you build it, this will inoculate the pile with all sorts of bacteria and other organisms that will help it break down faster. A thin sprinkling (0.25"") of soil on top of every 6-12"" layer should do the trick.</li>
<li>You probably should not add any ""compost accelerator"" products. These contain bacterial and fungal ingredients as described above for soil/mature compost. They also usually contain nitrogen, which is the last thing you need to add to your pile -- you've got a nitrogen overdose.</li>
</ul>

<p>The pile should heat up and break down faster when you introduce air and balance the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio.</p>

<p>If you have no interest in managing your pile:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you don't mind the current smell, you can let it sit the way it is indefinitely. It will rot over time.</li>
<li>Check out your <a href=""http://www.bow-nh.com/Trash-AZRecycling.htm"">town's recycling guide</a> under ""Compost Materials"". It includes the number of a local landscaping company who will presumably take your compostables.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we were just a little closer (I'm about an hour away from you) I'd offer to come and take it off your hands. 10+ cu meters of raw compost sounds like a dream but I'd be trucking back and forth all day :)</p>

"How to make garden flat and level","3179","","<p>I don't know if I'm searching correctly, but I'm amazed I have only found one answer (which is still lacking).</p>

<p>How can a garden be made completely flat and level? How would it be done professionally?</p>

<p>The first step (now obvious to me after research) is to remove existing turf, plants, roots, etc. either by hand and possibly with a rotavator.</p>

<p>The next step is the one that eludes me: distributing the soil so it's flat. It sounds simple. But the one answer I've found was <a href=""https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070705060819AAuEptf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>; use a bit of wood and kick it around. This is just not practical enough, or simply good enough, for several reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>It will not ensure the whole garden is level</li>
<li>It will only work for sandy soil, not more stodgy clay type soil. </li>
<li>As the garden is walked on and compacted, unevenness will reappear. </li>
</ol>

<p>What would the professional process be for achieving this for a small-ish garden with no access for heavy machinery? And let's say the garden had to be level and flat enough to play a proper game of bowls. (I'm not that old yet, but might as well do the manual labour in preparation while I still can).</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>Borrowing from myself (part of an answer over on home improvement):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Developing a grade is a ""simple-yet-tedious"" process, for the most
  part. My preferred method is to set some stakes 3-4 feet tall, mark
  them all with a level (laser these days, dumpy or transit or water
  or... in the past), and then mark a line on each, depending where it
  is, at some fixed distance above the desired grade - say 30"" above.
  Then I run strings, tightly, between those marks, and mark my rake
  and/or tamper handle at 30"" - it's then a simple matter to line up the
  strings (to form a plane floating 30"" above grade) and see if the rake
  or tamper is too high (mark above) too low (mark below) or right on
  (mark even with) when set on the surface at any given spot. For
  convenience the plane should not be too low (or it's a lot of bending
  to see if things line up) nor too high (it's difficult to get stakes
  well-anchored for a taught string when the string is 5 feet up the
  stake.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you prefer, and certainly if you are trying to build to WorldBowls standards, a direct-reading laser level system is an alternate approach to the measuring aspect, but you still need to move and compact soils to make it level. That is the tedious part - you have to add or remove soils (and compact them adequately so they don't move as you walk on them) until the base is level - and long straightedges can be useful in that process. So can something like chalk or lime to mark either the high or low spots so that hand-raking can be applied to the appropriate effect, and perhaps colored chalk to mark spots that are at the correct level. However, to an extent, as you develop correctly leveled areas, the other areas become more evident. At the outset it will appear a daunting task, but it is mostly a tedious one.</p>

<p>Keep the lid off, or add spring tails (molding eating bug), or let the mold run its course.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do I need to put soil in the jar?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, moss will grow on anything really. It likes acidic soil, though I use peat moss myself and it works well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do to in winter?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn't matter. Moss in the wild freezes in winter and when the rainy season comes again it'll spring back. It'll do fine at room temperature; just keep it moist and out of direct sun and should do fine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can the spores be contained if grown in a closed glass container?</p>

<p>I'm unsure about this, but I have two 10 gallon tanks with moss and a 40 gallon tank with just moss in it (used to house plants and frogs) and I'm fine, so I dont believe they cause any problems.</p>

"How long can I leave ripe tomatoes on the vine?","3164","","<p>Can I leave ripe red tomatoes on the vine until I'm ready to use them? How long do they stay good on the vine? Will picking them cause them to go bad faster or does it make any difference?</p>
","<p>It really depends on the variety. Some can stay on the vine for a long time after they're ripe, and some have to be picked as soon as they're ripe. How picking affects the matter also seems dependent on the variety, as well as how ripe the fruit is when you pick it. It seems to me that if you pick them when they're still green they last longer after ripening. They don't have as much of a chance to split, crack, get eaten by wildlife and such, either, but this may affect the flavor.</p>

"Do legumes provide nitrogen to their companions?","3155","","<p>It's common knowledge that legumes (clover, beans, etc) can (with the help of Rhizobium bacteria) fix nitrogen from the air and hold it in the soil.</p>

<p>Much is made of this fact -- advice that we should plant clover in our lawn to give the grass a boost, ""three sisters"" plantings of beans with corn so the beans can provide the corn with nitrogen, etc.</p>

<p>But I've seen a couple of mentions that the nitrogen that legumes fix from the air is ""locked up"" on the roots of the plant until it dies. Thus they don't help their companions while they're alive -- so while clovers in a lawn have other benefits, they do not provide any nitrogen to the grasses. According to this contrary advice, the only nitrogen benefit these plants provide is to a following crop -- e.g. a soybean crop or clover cover crop will provide nitrogen to whatever follows.</p>

<p>Which advice is correct? Does it depend on the legume type? (I.e. are there some legume types that fix extra nitrogen that would become available for companions?)</p>
","<p>Yes, legumes do provide nitrogen to associated plants, through multiple mechanisms. </p>

<p>Nitrogen is transfered from nitrogen fixing plants to the soil solution, where it is then available to other organisms (e.g. plants and microbes). This nitrogen transfer is in the form of root exudates, the sloughing off of root cells, and through the turnover (growth and death) of roots within the growing season. Notably, root turnover increases with root nitrogen content, and nitrogen fixers have particularly high root turnover rates. Previous studies have quantified this transfer, for example <a href=""http://www.springerlink.com/content/367267326x2501g4/"">Laidlaw et al. (1996)</a> found that the N-fixing legume clover transfers 8 mg N / m<sup>2</sup> / d to the soil whereas non-N-fixing grass transfers &lt; 1 mg N / m<sup>2</sup> / d to the soil. Furthermore, about 50 kg N ha-1 (similar to typical agricultural fertilization rates after accounting for the inefficiency of fertilization) was transferred from clover to grass in a mixed field experiment <a href=""http://www.springerlink.com/content/q032564817717845/"">(Boller and Nosberger, 1987)</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the transfer of nitrogen from nitrogen fixers to the soil, the direct transfer from a nitrogen fixer to a non-nitrogen fixer by mycorrhizal fungi (known as  'common mycorrhizal networks' <a href=""http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:67757"">(He et al 2003)</a>) has been observed. For example, <a href=""http://www.bashanfoundation.org/gabor/gaborzonessoybean.pdf"">Bethelfalvay et al (1991)</a> demonstrated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maize, when associated with the N-fertilized soybean, increased 19% in
  biomass, 67% in N content and 77% in leaf N concentration relative to
  the maize plants of the N-deficient association.</p>

","<p>To some extent, it depends which variety you've bought - Morus alba 'pendula' is a smaller, neater version of this plant, and the largest known specimen of this particular variety is 4 x 4 metres. Even that, though, would require a larger pot as it grew than the one you currently have, probably something of the order of 90 high by 60 cm wide.</p>

<p>If, though, you have any other variety, ultimate height and spread after 20 years in the ground is 9 metres high with a spread of 10 metres. Clearly, that is not achievable in anything other than a very, very large pot, in particular if you wanted to use the fruit. If its stunted, it won't fruit very well.</p>

<p>Note that this plant tends to grow rapidly at first, (maybe the first 4 years or so) and then is slow growing thereafter. It also has roots which are fleshy and easy to break, so potting on needs to be done extremely carefully in order not to damage, or expose to the air, the roots - it dislikes the disturbance. For that reason, it is not a plant which is good for pot culture, and without knowing which variety you have, its impossible to hazard a good guess how long it will be 'fine' in that pot size, but I'll take a leap in the dark and suggest a couple of years at most.</p>

"Chinese Elm bonsai turning yellow after repotting","3118","","<p>I have a Chinese Elm bonsai. The tree was doing fine, sprouting many new twigs in the last month or two. After the growth slowed down I decided to repot the tree, because the original soil was too slow to dry out and also because the roots were starting to fill the pot.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I used something called Terramol as the substrate, it’s supposed to be something like Akadama. I didn’t mix it with anything. (The supplier says it can be used as is.)</p></li>
<li><p>I had to trim some of the roots so that the plant would fit neatly in the pot. I was very careful doing it, only trimming a small part of the roots.</p></li>
<li><p>I think my watering routine should be fine – I always water after the top part of the substrate gets sort of dry, and I keep pouring until the water comes out through the drain holes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But after a week the tree looks tired and wilted, some of the leaves are turning yellow. Is this expected after repotting, or have I done something wrong? If I screwed up, what’s the best way to help the tree?</p>

<p>This is how the tree looks now, after repotting once more into a mix of Terramol (two parts) with grit (one part) and potting soil (one part):</p>

","<p>I don't know where to start.</p>

<p>Do you use this as an indoor Bonsai? Where do you live? First of all you can't use that substrate if you don't use a special fertilizer. Then you can't cut the roots of a tree when it should have a winter break. And after that put him into literally rocks and water.</p>

<p>You need to put that tree into your garden, bury it so the trunk is covered by earth at least 10 cm. Let it stay there until mid of April. Use the time to get informed about how to treat a Bonsai tree the right way. Then buy real Bonsai substrate or learn how to mix it. If the roots don't fit the pot after you cut them the right way, buy a new pot that fits. Elm trees are famous for taproots, so I doubt a plate is the right thing to use without experienced treatment. Put the tree into a place where it can have morning sun until midday and then is protected from too much sun. Make sure it only gets much water when it has a good ventilation or it easily dries out.</p>

"How can I speed up germination of habanero chili pepper?","3115","","<p>I planted some habanero seeds a week ago. Most of the websites said it need 2 weeks to 3 weeks to germinate. What is the best condition for its germination?</p>

<p>I am in Hong Kong and having a 29 degree Celsius temperature on average. How much water does it need? Water once a day or twice a day?</p>
","<p>Two weeks is typical for most cultivars of <em>Capsicum</em> (chili pepper) and this is what I see with other species cultivars (I've never tried Habanero or any other <em>C. chinensis</em> cultivar). This year my germination rates were more like 3 weeks but I had an accidental dry spell during the first week.</p>

<p>For difficult-to-germinate varieties, many recommend soaking with Potassium Nitrate (Salt Petre) solution (1 tsp per quart is about typical, eg. <a href=""http://forums.gardenweb.com/forums/load/pepper/msg1123222410445.html"">here</a> ) for a few hours before planting. It is debated as to whether it makes much of a difference, but I do it as a matter of course for all varieties that I grow from seed. Salt Petre is a component of gunpowder and many jurisdictions control larger quantities, but you only need a teaspoon. Use the left-over solution as a potassium fertilizer.</p>

<p>Following from other chili pepper varieties, you will want to keep you compost/soil damp, but not saturated or soaked. Too saturated and your seeds might get wilt / fungi. You don't want them dry either. I try to give them sunlight - even before the seedlings come out. They will benefit from the gentle warmth and the seedlings will respond well to sunlight as soon as they start to emerge.</p>

<p>Initially you will get two small pointed leaves. These are followed by proper 'adult leaves'. I wait until the plants are about 3-4in high (and at least two pairs of the adult leaves have appeared) before I pot them out into bigger pots or beds. I only pot them out once.</p>

<hr>

<p>[Edit with answer to no. seeds]</p>

<p>The more seeds you plant, the more likely you will get some that will do well. But you also want to keep within the limits of your space and requirements (I've never grown habanero because we wouldn't be able to use all of the fruit - I much prefer sweet or moderate varieties)</p>

<p>My seed supplier sells 25 seeds/$2 so I usually buy two packets (50 seeds) of each variety (and about 5-6 varieties - but I grow a lot of peppers!). For <em>C.annum</em> varieties (most chile peppers) this covers me in the event of poor germination, but if they do well then I have surplus plants to give away. In contrast, this year I planted 50 Tabasco (<em>C.frutescens</em>) seeds and only four germinated (well maybe 5-6 but only four made it to be transplanted).</p>

","<p>Looks like an attack by Fruit Fly - the female burrows into the fruits and lays her eggs, which then hatch and eat their way out. The droplets on the exterior of the fruit are characteristic of such an attack, although sometimes they may just look like small dimples in the fruits. I can see something white on the left side of the cut fruit - not sure what that is. The other possibilities are Codling Moth, which does the same thing as Fruit Fly (burrows into the fruits) or Oriental Fruit Moth, but with the latter, you would also see wilting tips to the branches, or on the new leaves, and webbing where the larvae nest. Oriental fruit moth attacks new leaves and stems as well as the fruits, and the management regime is somewhat different than for either Codling moth or Fruit fly.</p>

<p>Remove and dispose of any affected fruits as soon as you notice them. Once the fruitlets start forming, you can mesh the tree with material which has holes not more than 2mm, which will stop the Fly from accessing the fruits, though any such mesh will also reduce slightly the amount of sun reaching the fruits. There are pheremone traps you can buy and erect in the tree yearly, but they tend to only trap the males, and many other insects, and aren't very effective in orchards. They do, though, tell you if there are Fruit flies about. There will be chemical treatment sprays available, but I'm unable to recommend any because the pesticides you have in Australia will not be the same as those in the UK, therefore a trip to your garden supplies retailer for recommended chemical sprays would be useful. Depending on the treatments available, it may well be too late to treat this year's crop.</p>

","<p>(<strong>Edit</strong>: My first attempt at an answer had the <em>wrong</em> nutrient... thanks to @kevinsky for the correction.)</p>

<p>Phosphorus is the key nutrient that promotes flowering.</p>

<p>Except that plants can't use pure phosphorus (not to mention that pure phosphorus <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oke8GinWDG8"" rel=""nofollow"">is dangerous</a>!), they need it in the form of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"" rel=""nofollow"">phosphate</a> (which actually describes any of a handful of different chemical compounds). Some liquid fish/kelp fertilizers are high in fast-acting phosphorus, but be careful not to overapply.</p>

<p>Plants can't take up phosphorus as well if the pH is too low or too high. Aim for slightly acidic -- which is what many plants prefer anyway.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the best approach would be to use limited quantities of fast-acting soluble phosphate like fish emulsion if you have an immediate deficiency, but to aim for a longer-term prevention of deficiency by (a) maintaining pH and (b) using an organic long-lasting, slow-release phosphate source like rock phosphate or bone meal.</p>

This year I hope to circumvent this catastrophe before it happens again. </p>

<p><strong>How can I get rid of or keep away these lubber grasshoppers in an organic earth friendly way?</strong></p>
","<p>Organic or low toxicity control of insects uses a different set of tools than the 'spray and pray' approach.  These points apply to any issue that needs to be controlled.</p>

<ul>
<li>observation is your first tool. Where are they coming from, when do the juveniles show up, what crops do they prefer?  (If the answers are from everywhere, all during the spring and they eat everything then this could be a tough year)</li>
<li>timing is everything. The time to start control is when you see the nymphs.  They are easier to control when they are smaller. At this time of year (April) the young should have emerged and be visible. Lubbers do not fly well, move slowly and are relatively large compared to other insects. Mechanical removal by handpicking or a butterfly net when they are young will reduce the damage that the adults could do later. Wear gloves and old clothes when doing this as they have a number of unsavory habits like exuding a foamy spray when menaced.</li>
<li>identify any areas on or near your property where young will hatch. In the case of the lubber this will be drier areas, possibly where there is tall grass. Consider early spring tilling in these areas if they are on your property. </li>
<li>try and plant your garden so you can use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_cover"" rel=""nofollow"">floating row covers</a> to protect your crops</li>
<li>cut down areas of tall weeds or grass and trim growth in ditches where they gather before moving onto your crops</li>

<p>Everything I read about control mentions chemical pesticides but I think it would be worth a try to use soap and water on the juveniles.

"Placing nitrogen fixers around established trees?","2977","","<p>I have several young (1-4 years old) fruit trees and am considering planting nitrogen fixers around/underneath:</p>

<ul>
<li>white clover (ground cover)</li>
<li>lupine (herb layer)</li>
<li>siberian pea shrub (shrub layer)</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems intuitive that the N-fixers will only provide a benefit as far as their roots extend.</p>

<p>I don't want to damage the tree roots by digging too close. I think the tree roots will extend further outward over time as the trees grow.</p>

<p><strong>Does it make sense, and is it safe for the trees, to dig planting holes for the lupine just outside the drip line of the trees?</strong> Or is there more potential for harm than good?</p>

<p>If I go to the effort of digging there (digging isn't easy here), I'd probably amend the general area with manure.</p>

<p>Similarly with the clover, I'm thinking about scraping away the mulch and scattering seed underneath the trees then covering with 0.5"" or so of composted manure. (Or covering the area with 1-2"" of compost and spreading seed there.) <strong>Are there any potential problems with this?</strong></p>
","<p>My understanding of nitrogen fixing plants is that nitrogen is retained by the plant for it's own use.  Farmers will sow clover and legumes but to make the nitrogen accessible they plow it in. This is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_manure"">green manure</a> and works well for fields with annual crops.</p>

<p>I see a problem with your idea due to the long term nature of an apple tree.  The clover will compete with the tree in the same root zone and you cannot plow the cover crop in without damaging the apple tree roots.  However the clover will attract bees who will pollinate your apple tree if the timing is right.</p>

<p>Nitrogen is highly mobile within the soil but mostly it is mobile in one direction, down.  So rain will wash it out but a source must be close to roots for it to be picked up.</p>

<p>Are there annual nitrogen fixing crops? Surely some of the soybean crops would fit. Then you could harvest the beans and mow the rest of plant into a green mulch.</p>

<p>Edit: I reviewed that post that you referred to that indicates that nitrogen transfer does take place from nitrogen fixing plants to the roots of other species. If your apple trees have or can host the microrhizae required to facilitate the transfer then you are in a trade off situation.</p>

<p>Pros: </p>

<ul>
<li>the clover provides some nitrogen at low levels in a continuous feed</li>
<li>the clover will attract pollinators when it flowers. This may assist if the clovers flower at the same time as the apple trees.</li>
<li>clover will add organic matter, keep the soil from being compacted, reduce water runoff</li>
<li>clover is not eaten by those Japanese Beetles that are problematic if you grew grass instead</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:
- clover is competing for the same water and nutrients that the apple tree roots are</p>

<p>It's very hard to assess whether there is a net benefit.  I agree with violadaprile that you do not see shrubs grown close to apple trees.  Farmers appear to prefer monoculture, possibly for maintenance reasons or just habit.</p>

"Do all plants emit CO2 at night and day?","2972","","<p>Do all plants emit CO2 at night? I heard that plants do respiration all the time but in sunlight they utilises more CO2 and releases more oxygen. During day with sunlight: CO2>Oxygen. At night or plants that are in shade, they don't produce oxygen at all but produce CO2? Correct?</p>

<p>Also, If suppose a tree is getting light but only one part, What will be the consequence of this? </p>

<p>(I am okay if this question migrates to Biology if this is not suited here)</p>
","<p>Yes, plants emit CO2 day and night. CO2 is an end product of metabolism which is the burning or oxydation of sugar that occurs in the mitocondria.</p>

<p>The Calvin cycle of photosynthesis can occur only in light or in daytime,if you wish. However the intake of CO2 varies across species. CAM species, of which jade (crassula ovata) is an example, take in CO2 at night and store it in malic acid. This means the stomata can be closed during the heat of the day, but the Calvin cycle can operate, unlike the common C3 species that have no means of storing CO2 and must take in CO2 during daylight as well. The third type, C4 also utilizes metabolism of malic or aspertic. Maize and sugar cane are expamples of C4 plants.</p>

<p>The critical piece of carbon fixation is an enzyme known as RuBisCo (an acronym for a very lengthy chemical name). RuBisCo does the actual fixing of carbon into elemental sugar. I also sometimes incorporates oxygen instead. The rate of fixation increases with temperature, however, the rate of fixing oxygen increases more rapidly than that of fixing carbon so that at temperatures near 95F (35C) and above, there is no net carbon fixing. Malic/aspertic acid in C4 and CAM plants is a mechanism of effectively blocking oxygen from RUBISCO and so allows carbon fixation to occur at higher temperatures. Hence, these are typically tropical species.</p>

<p>So plants continually emit CO2 because of the process of life. They emit more the hotter the environment, so this goes up and down though the course of a day. Carbon fixation occurs only via photosynthesis. Most species are C3 and will release more oxygen than carbon dioxide during the daylight hours and while the temperature is below 95F (35C). The same for C4 plants, except that there will continue to be a net fixation of carbon at yet higher temperatures. CAM, plants, however, will take in carbon at night.</p>

<p>SHORT VERSION: you are correct, but for plants such as crassula ovata and pineapple.</p>

"How to remedy die-off of lower and middle branches on my plum tree?","2968","","<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I have a plum tree that is not doing well. It is situated alongside a dirt road which gets regular (but not heavy) traffic. There's not a lot of wind, and the sun shines on it for about half the day.</p>

<p>For the last 4 or 5 years, the branches on my plum tree have been growing in a strange pattern. Every year, there are three zones:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ivbu0.jpg""></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bottom zone (red line in the picture above)</strong>: The lowest thick branches have no twigs or leaves.</li>
<li><strong>Middle zone (yellow line in the picture above)</strong>: Branches in the middle (about 6-10 feet above the ground) have sick twigs and few leaves. </li>
<li><strong>Top zone (green line in the picture above)</strong>: The top of the tree (about 10-15 feet above the ground) has lots of healthier-looking twigs and leaves.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sparse nature of the middle zone is hard to see in this picture due to the background trees and the poor camera/photographer (I include a close-up below). In reality the tree looks pretty goofy, because the majority of the leaves are very high off the ground.</p>

<p>Every year it seems the bottom zone gets taller, and the middle and top zones start a little higher off the ground.</p>

<p>Here's a description of the three zones:</p>

<h2>Bottom zone</h2>

<p>The trunk and the thick branches in the bottom zone have lots of lichen. They also have some cracks in the bark which expose orange/yellowish streaks, like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AMIhh.jpg"" height=""200""></p>

<h2>Middle zone</h2>

<p>In the middle zone, there are a lot of twigs. Some of the twigs have no leaves on them (but did have leaves in previous years). Some twigs have small, dead, shriveled-up leaves. And some twigs have a few, leaves at the ends. Here's a close-up picture of some twigs from the middle zone, where you can see the typical distribution of leaves. There are also some of the dark, shriveled-up leaves in this picture. (In the full-tree picture above, the angle and background trees make it hard to tell the nature of the 'middle zone'.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TWOOS.jpg"" height=""200""></p>

<p>This year (and some previous years), the leaves have holes in them, like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/meiQo.jpg"" height=""200""></p>

<h2>Top zone</h2>

<p>All the good twigs and leaves are at the top of the tree. They're not great, but they're good and they're the best the tree has. They are packed with flowers every year, and some years I get an occasional small fruit.</p>

<p>They grow tall and there's little or no lichen.</p>

<p>I say they're ""good not great"" because by this time of year, those top leaves also have lots of holes in them (see leaf close-up above) and the fruit-production is almost non-existent. (I've only got one plum tree, so maybe that's why there's almost no fruit.)</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>What's causing the slow die-off of this tree from the bottom up, and how do I promote healthy growth on the lower branches?</p>

<p>I have not taken good care of this tree. This means little to no fertilizing and pruning in the last few years. I know I need to feed and prune it, but at this point I'd like to integrate the feeding and pruning with a broader approach to solving the three-zone problem.</p>

<p>I've thought about grafting top branches onto the lower parts of the tree (but I don't have experience grafting), I've thought about severely pruning the top to tree to force growth on the lower branches (feels too risky!), and I've thought about just removing the tree (too passive).</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your ideas.</p>
","<p>The top and outside of the leaf canopy on most trees is what gets the most sunlight, so those are the areas that normally do the best, while the lower areas slowly become ""over topped"" by the more vigorously growing branches in what you've labeled the ""top zone.""  This is how most trees end up with the typical tree form of bare trunks and bare larger branches, but a wide canopy of leaves, instead of just becoming ever-denser balls of leaves all the way from the top to the ground. However, in the case of your tree it sounds like it's also not getting enough of something it needs so this is making this normal pattern seem more obvious and more intense.  </p>

<p>First, in order to prevent more damage from insects or diseases getting into the dead areas, I would suggest pruning back all the dead branches and twigs (do it properly, don't leave stubs and don't cut into the growing ""collar"" area at the tree trunk juncture - see this link for how to go about it right:  <a href=""http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/hort/consumer/factsheets/trees-new/text/pruning.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/hort/consumer/factsheets/trees-new/text/pruning.html</a></p>

<p>Second, I'd suggest ""opening up the crown"" of the tree to let some more light into the middle. (This means thinning out some of the branches in the top zone to allow light to penetrate through the leaves into the middle zone.) This <em>may</em> have the result of causing new growth to form in the middle zone of the tree, making the canopy appear fuller and healthier. It will also help any fruit that forms in later years to ripen better and will reduce the chance of fungal diseases in the inner core of the tree.</p>

<p>Third, I'd look into whether it is possible to expose the tree to more sun.  Most fruit trees in particular need full sun or pretty close to it to produce good fruit yearly.  If you can move something that's shading it, or cut back larger tree branches from nearby trees to let in more light, this would likely help a fair bit.  The more sun, the more energy your tree will have for making leaves and fruit.</p>

<p>Fourth, have someone there who is familiar with your local bugs and diseases check to make sure it isn't infested, and if it is, treat the infestation.  Also, feed the tree an appropriate type of food yearly, or twice yearly, at the proper time of the year.  Mulch around it to keep weeds back and also keep it from having a dry root zone. </p>

<p>If you do all of this, you <em>should</em> see a significant improvement in your tree's shape and growth in a year or two.  If not, you may have an issue with the soil its planted in, and perhaps a soil test would be a good idea.  Or you may have hard pan under the root ball (layer of impermeable rock) that is preventing the tree from spreading its roots out wide enough to support more growth as it gets older. Or, the tree you've chosen just isn't a good fit for your area's climate.  It's hard to diagnose this sort of thing from afar, but I think this covers the basics of good fruit tree care and gives you some ideas to try to help it get past this awkward scrawny stage.     </p>

"What varieties of sweet corn are best for freezing?","2967","","<p>Late fall / early winter means it's time to select seeds for next year's garden!</p>

<p>What varieties of sweet corn are good for both eating fresh and freezing? The seed catalogs seem to be silent on the latter point, mostly emphasizing the fresh eating qualities. I plant enough so that we have all we can eat fresh, and then some extra to freeze and eat during the winter.</p>

</ul>
","<p>For freezing, sweet corns that develop their sugars to starches slowest are best, Because they hold their flavor better than more starchy sweet corns. Super-sweet(sh2) are good for this, but have tougher skins and less flavor than others. On the other hand, you have sugary-enhanced(se) corn with tender skins and good flavor, but is more starchy. What I have grown for two years now is a variety that combines the sweetness of super-sweet(It is actually quite a bit sweeter), The tender skins of sugary-enhanced, and the flavor of normal corn. The variety name is 'Mirai 350 BC' a sh2/se/su corn that has bicolor, eight inch ears on 6 1/2' plants. It matures in 78 days. You would not believe how good this corn tastes. It makes old Silver Queen, a white su variety, taste like cardboard, even when freshly picked. Is stores well, and you can leave it in your fridge for four weeks, in its husk, and it will taste better than other corn. The earliest sweet corn is Earlivee, a 52 day yellow corn with 6"" ears on a 3 1/2' stalk. It is an su corn. It can be planted at the same time as the Mirai, without fear of cross-pollination. Its seeds are also much less expensive.</p>

"Best help for a tree with stunted growth?","2962","","<p>I have a few trees on my property which are at least five years old (sorry I don't know the kinds yet). Compared to other trees in neighboring lots, planted at the same age at the same time, they are notably stunted, short, and devoid of many branches. They are alive and well, with new growth and green leaves, but are not growing taller and branching.</p>

<p>I suspect a soil problem, but it could also be due to a history of underwatering.</p>

<p>What steps can I take to turn these trees around, and help them grow properly? (Or is the damage done and it's too late?)</p>
","<p>If you think it's a soil issue, then one possibility is to begin an aggressive campaign of mulching the soil around the trunks to build it.  Get a bunch of organic matter, hay from your local hardware or garden store works fine, and spread it around underneath the tree about a foot deep.  On top of that spread some composted manure and cover the whole thing with wood mulch (not the treated kind, the kind that is meant to rot).  Do that a few years in a row and you'll have much healthier soil and probably a healthier tree.</p>

<p>You can also try companion plantings around the base of the trees.  The local community orchard I volunteer at has comfrey and garlic planted in the mulch around each of the fruit trees.  The comfrey is a dynamic accumulator, it reaches deep into the soil and pulls nutrients up to the top soil.  It grows very aggressively and you can chop it down almost to stubs several times a season and spread the leaves on the ground beneath the tree to add to the mulch.  It will add a lot of nutrients to the soil.  I've never tried this, this is just what the folks at the orchard tell me.  The garlic is just to ward off various pests.  It's a deterrent to rabbits and various insects, I believe.</p>

<p>Look up sheet mulching. <a href=""http://www.wildwillowdesign.com/2011/06/three-ways-to-sheet-mulch/"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a> is a good article. There are a whole bunch of techniques for composting in place to build the soil.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately they didn't say <em>why</em>. What's wrong with adding a bit of manure to my garden every year? (I have vast amounts of horse manure at my disposal.)</p>
","<p>You are misinterpreting what the lab was telling you.  They are not telling you that it is bad or harmful to use manure over a long period of time.  They are telling you that it is bad to use manure as the <em>only</em> thing you add to your garden.  </p>

<p>Think of soil building as composting (because that's what it is).  You want to maintain the same sort of C:N ratio as you do when composting.  When you rely on manure as your only additive, you're unbalancing your soil.  You're adding way too much nitrogen.  It will have a similar effect to spraying a ton of NPK fertilizer.  It will burn out the soil life and eventually make your soil less fertile.  You can add manure to your garden every year, but you need to be adding carbon as well to off set all that nitrogen you're adding.  You should be adding lots of mulch (hay, wood chips) and compost in addition to the manure.</p>

<p>Finally, manure is a good source of <em>many</em> nutrients.  But it is by no means the source of all the nutrients your garden needs.  Soil needs a hell of a lot more than just NPK and Mg/Ca to be healthy.  In fact, we don't fully understand all the chemical reactions going on down there, let alone have the ability to optimize them.  Your best bet is to -- as previously mentioned -- add manure and then add carbon.  Compost any extra green matter on your land and add it back in.  Plant nutrient accumulators and then use them for mulch.  Also you can add other soil additives (like green sand, or kelp) to add various trace elements and nutrients.</p>

<p><strong>Summary: There is nothing wrong with adding manure every year.  But you should be mulching/composting on top of the manure to add carbon. You should also add other soil amendments to add what manure lacks.</strong></p>

<p>I did some reading and apparently the Drosera thrives in lots of direct sunlight as well, and its leaves should be reddish. A Drosera that is mostly green is also a sign of too little light. Since mine was pretty green, I took that as an extra confirmation that Theresa was right.</p>

<p><strong>Update 4: Summer's end</strong></p>

<p>I've moved the plants outside a couple of months ago. At first I kept them in the same pots, which worked well and they flourished. But after a while I moved them together to bigger 'pot' of peat. I thought this would make it easier to keep them moist. By that time, both the fly trap and the drosera (Alice Sundew, I'm guessing now) were grown big enough to be divided. In the bottom-right of the picture you can see half of the fly trap. The other half is hiding at center top. The one on the left is a different plant I added later. The drosera is divided and individual rosettes are spread around the bin. I've added some other species as well (drosera binata, drosera albino (?), two types of sarracenia and a nepenthes. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8eFJJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So far they are doing well, and I hope they'll make it through winter. I'm not sure every one of these species can handle frost, so I think I'll move the whole thing indoors before that time. Anyway, it seems like the plants are doing even better outdoors. I'm saving up for a greenhouse, and I guess that will certainly unlock some new possibilities. :)</p>

"How do I grow bamboo plants indoors?","2937","","<p>Doesn't this plant have root rotting property? I tried to grow this in my home which had the tubelight burning only for 6 hours at night. And at the rest of the time it is a shady place.

<p>In my opinion, you changed the water too frequently. You should only change the water if the water is dirty or bad. When you change the water, you should never throw away all the old water, but retain 1/2 of the old water because lucky bamboo plants are sensitive to water quality change. The ultimate solution is - do not throw away the old water, but let it evaporate until you think the water is insufficient, then add some new water to it. It is better to use distilled water with this approach. Add fresh water every 3 to 4 weeks. Patience is a virtue! (You can also use chlorinated tap water, which is sterile, but remember to let it stand for 1 night before use.)</p>

<p>Also, you should have washed away any dirt in the roots right after you bought it from the store.</p>

<p>And although this is not referenced, most of my local people suggest putting 1 or 2 iron nails into the water. Trust it or not.</p>

<p>Check out what type of light tube it is - if it is hot, it will lead to yellowing of the leaves. Bamboo plants like indirect light.</p>

","<p>First, I would not put them in direct sun until I hardened them off.  They look like you did over-water and I am glad you re-potted them.  Did you clean the pots with a little bleach?  Was the potting soil new?  </p>

<p>Last ditch effort would be to get rooting hormone and cut off healthy leaves and stem.  Put them in new soil and cover with plastic. Do not put them in direct sunlight otherwise you will cook them. Keep moist, not soggy.</p>

<p>Make sure that you are using very small pots. When they are putting out new growth and roots take plastic off.  Re-pot when you see roots beginning to grow out of the bottom...better yet, slide plant out of pot and if there are a lot of white, healthy roots you can re-pot into a pot an inch or two larger.   Allow to dry out, in fact, I allow them to almost wilt before I water again.  Use clay pots, coleus seems to like the air they get from the porosity of the pot.  Make sure that you wash your pots and use a little bleach before adding potting soil.  Coleus do well on a shaded porch that gets a lot of ambient light bouncing off white walls, concrete.  Slowly, get them used to direct sun...half an hour a day two or three days ten an hour a day...they do well indoors if they get bright sunlight filtered by windows.  </p>

<p>Fertilize with a slow release fertilizer, and if you see white patches on the outside of your clay pot (salts from conditioned tap water), soak, clean your pot and re-pot with fresh potting soil. </p>

<p>When you water, water very, very well...then allow to dry out before you water again.</p>

<p>Do not put stones, gravel in the bottom of your pot...the soil has to become saturated before it starts to move into the bigger pore spaces and your plants will have less air.  Just potting soil, lift the pot up off the deck, table, tray with tiles to increase the drainage. </p>

"How can I discourage ragweed from growing?","2934","","<p>After three years of pulling, hoeing, and tilling, one corner of my garden is still infested with this vile weed. I live in Southeast Colorado, and the brutally-hot summer days seem to keep it under control except for this one, shaded corner...</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to discourage its growth (short of paving this section of my garden over)? Or am I doomed to spend my days pulling these quick-growing little beasts...</p>
","<p><strong>Do not let them go to seed!</strong></p>

<p>(<a href=""http://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/BP/GWC-14.pdf"">Info from Purdue University</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Common ragweed
  plants allowed to grow for the entire growing season can produce 32,000
  to 62,000 seeds per plant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if you don't have time for all that hoeing, consider that you may want to be lazy <em>later in the season</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Plants that emerge mid-April through May can produce up to three times the seeds and
  biomass as plants that germinate in mid- to late June.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it might actually be helpful to <em>stop tilling</em>. Ragweed seeds can survive a long time in the soil (one source said 80 years (sorry, I forget where I read this), others say 20-30, even up to 40 years). According to the Purdue sheet above, the deeper seeds won't germinate without tillage bringing them to the surface. Unfortunately that reference doesn't help you with control strategies in your home garden much.</p>

<p>They are hard to kill, too. You can break off the stem and it will regenerate. This means mowing won't kill it, unless you're mowing frequently enough to starve the roots. If you're hoeing, make sure you chop it at or below soil level; even here it seems like there's a chance that an established plant can regrow. Pulling them up by the roots seems effective, especially if you keep up on it and get them while they're small. And if your garden soil is fairly loose, it's not too hard to yank them out.</p>

<p>Seeds can be dispersed by wind spreading them along the soil surface. This means that if you have uncontrolled ragweed in another part of your yard, have neighbors with uncontrolled ragweed, nearby fields, or if your town doesn't keep the roadside ditches mowed, then you'll end up with more seed in your garden year after year.</p>

<p><strong>The strategy I would recommend is to reduce the ragweed seed bank</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't let any go to seed. This is critical. Every plant that goes to seed makes your job next year that much harder.</li>
<li>Be vigilant. Go out every week and pull out all the ragweed seedlings in your garden you can find.</li>
<li>Cultivate (shallow hoeing) weekly. This will chop off small seedlings before they can establish a good root system.</li>
<li>Keep down any ragweed plants that are within your zone of control -- keep your yard mowed (which won't necessarily keep the ragweed from growing, but you can at least reduce the amount of seed) and pull plants where you can.</li>
<li>Don't till deeply if you don't have to. This will bring more seeds from deep in the ground to the surface where they can germinate.</li>
<li>Be aware of where your soil amendments are coming from. E.g. if you bring in some local horse manure where hay was used for bedding, or if spoiled hay is mixed in with the manure, you may be importing ragweed (and tons of other weed) seeds. If you buy compost, beware that it could be contaminated with seeds. Above all, don't use hay for mulch!</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately this strategy can take a few years to really pay off, and if you let it get out of control for one year, you have to go back to stage 0. On the bright side, this is a good general weed-control strategy, so you will reduce the pressure from other weeds at the same time.</p>

"Moving lemon and satsuma trees?","2925","","<p>I have a lemon and a satsuma tree in my yard that I planted roughly 2 years ago. So they are still fairly young. I planted them in a bad location and realized that in a few years they are going to end up taking over the area. So I would like to move them, but a few people warned me that it is a bad idea to do so and that the trees would die.</p>

<p>While I know that is a risk, are there any steps I can take while moving them to put the odds back in my favor? What time of the year would it be best to move them?</p>
","<p>You didn't mention where you are from. I am assuming Florida / the south / the west. 
The best time is when it is not flowering.  One thing to make sure is if whether the soil it is currently growing in is the same type of soil you are moving it to.  The tree is a living thing, so if anything such as: temperature, soil, moisture, humidity, light, etc changes then the tree will be in shock.  It means the planned move should not hinder the tree based on these conditions.  If it does you are risking the lifetime of the tree, it may / may not be dead if the move greatly impacts the tree.</p>

<p>The good thing about all of this is 2 years is not that long for a tree. If it were 1 it would even be a lot simpler, but 2 is still doable.  Because of the short timing the roots aren't deep at all, you may be able to dig a cone / circle around the thing and expect the entire ball to come out.</p>

"Can I successfully over-seed a lawn in the Spring in Colorado?","2910","","<p>My lawn is old and in desperate need of over-seeding. Many people in my area (Denver, Colorado) say to do it in the Fall. My thinking is that in the Fall the lawn areas are very dry and that aerating the hard, predominantly clay soil will be almost impossible. Also, the trees are full of leaves in the Fall and the lawn gets very little sun. Finally, the conditions are not very good for growing anything due to the approaching Winter.</p>

<p>These arguments suggest early Spring is the best time. What do you think? </p>
","<p>You would not want to overseed right now in Denver as there would not be enough time for the seeds to germinate and the new grass establish. But seeding early enough in the fall gives the grass a head start at a time when many broad leaf weeds and crabgrass, which would normally compete with grass for resources, are going dormant or dying. Come spring, the established grass ""seedlings"" will have a jump on the weeds, which will just be sprouting as the soil warms up. The grass will grow faster and compete with the weeds more effectively than it would if you seeded in the spring. The fall planted turf will be denser come spring, so it will also tend to shade out and prevent some weeds from germinating in the first place - something that grass seed spread in the spring wouldn't do.</p>

<p>That said, seeding in the spring will still improve turf density nicely, and is advisable if you couldn't do it in the fall. </p>

<p>As for aerating, don't worry about the dry,hard clay soil - that's what good aerators are for. A commercial plug aerator is designed to punch tubes into and remove plugs from compacted (hard) soil. If you're planning to grow grass, you'll probably want to water it anyway, and it is advisable to soak soil prior to aerating for good plug extraction.</p>

<p>On a final note, it would be great to take this opporunity to add compost. The compost will <a href=""http://www.trianglegardener.com/main/lawn-care/how-to-aerate-and-add-compost-topdressing/"">improve your soil in a number of ways</a>, and will help your new grass germinate and grow.

<p>Do I really have to wait more? For how long? Why?</p>
","<p>The trouble with gardening is, ask a panel of experts a question and you'll get 3 different answers. I remember your original question on this plant and then, you believed you should wait for the peat soil it was in to dry out before attempting to repot in different soil. That wasn't true, and I don't think this latest thing is any more true either - when I suggested you should repot immediately, I also said 'water in well' after repotting, and 'allow to drain freely'. And that, as far as I'm concerned, is exactly what you should do, assuming the new potting mix you've used is gritty/sandy and free draining. However, that said, an aloe will go for some time with no water at all, and  yours was apparently suffering from being overly wet, so if you prefer to follow the advice of whatever other source you're using, it probably won't come to any harm.</p>

<p>And not watering immediately after repotting any other type of plant is exactly the opposite of what you're supposed to do, so if you repot, say, a shrub or a perennial, you water, thoroughly, immediately after you've finished potting, but always allowing water to drain out of the bottom of the pot without any obstruction.</p>

","<p>First, your comment that its still snowing - don't even think about cutting back the gardenias until you are more or less certain that winter, and its cold temperatures, has passed, so don't do it now. You need to wait till spring starts properly, whenever that will be, without the risk of sudden cold snaps recurring.</p>

<p>When you've got to that point, check the bushes over again. You're right when you say to cut back to healthy growth, but sometimes these shrubs can be killed right back to the ground. There seems to be dead growth all the way down, with evidence of new growth higher up the stems, so you have a choice - you either cut them right down, or cut back to where you see new growth coming, as low down as possible. This unfortunately does mean no flowers this year, but there's not much you can do about that, other than be thankful they're still alive after such severe cold.</p>

<p>If you have to cut right down near the base, or fairly close to it, make sure you give them a good feed as often as recommended on the product you use, but do not feed past the end of June or early July. Feeding after that time just encourages new growth to form, making the plant more vulnerable to cold weather, because that growth won't be hardened sufficiently if winter arrives early, </p>

The most popular cultivar is ""Variegata"" which has multicoloured leaves of white green and red.  The way to confirm the identification is to pinch off a leaf.  There is a unique smell associated with this plant.  I can't describe it but the Wikipedia article refers to it as ""fish mint"". If it has mosquito repellent properties the ones in my garden are unaffected by it.</p>

<p>This plant grows well in moist to wet soil and even grows in water in partial or full sun.   After this was introduced to my garden by a well meaning gardener I can confirm that plants are invasive in gardens and difficult to eradicate.</p>

<p>After reading the article I see that it can be used as a garnish and I'm hoping to find someone who likes the taste so they can eradicate it by eating it.</p>

"How should I use corrugated cardboard for mulch?","2866","","<p>I tend to have a lot of corrugated cardboard boxes laying around, due to getting various things shipped to my house.  I have heard of using cardboard for a mulching material, but I'm not sure exactly how to do it (maybe I'm overthinking things).   Ignoring the option of shredding and composting it:</p>

<p>Should I shred it and treat it like I would straw mulch?
Should I rip it into sheets and just lay it down flat on the ground between rows?
Should it be covered with anything, or can it just sit out?
Is there some other method that I haven't thought of?</p>
","<p>If you are trying to simply keep the weeds down, then I think some people do just lay it down flat. You will need stakes (eg. Bent metal pins) to keep them down and stop them blowing around. You could also cover the sheets with something more pleasing - wood chip mulch. The card would act as a barrier against weeds, and the whole lot will eventually break down.</p>

<p>Shredding would aid break down and composting. This is what I would do if I was putting the card in a compost bin/barrel (I put a lot of shredded paper in our barrel). it could also go in the bottom of a trench or pit, to aid water retention (actually this is what I'd do - early spring, till my raised beds and put the card in as low down as I can).</p>

<p>When composting paper and card, be sure to remove all the tape and any attached bits of plastic. Shouldn't be a problem with card boxes, but be wary of glossy inks - these can contain oils and metal-based dyes which might be problem (this problem is diminishing as more and more glossy papers and magazines switch to soya based inks).</p>

"Which techniques and tools should I use to build a raised vegetable garden from bricks?","2842","","<p>I have about 2/3 of a pallet of bricks left over from building our house (I didn't build it!), and I'd love to use them to build a raised vegetable garden. I have never laid bricks before, but am keen to learn! I'd like to do it properly so that it's level, subsidence doesn't crack it, and it lasts for many years.</p>

<p>So, what do I need to do?</p>

<p>A little more background:</p>

<p>Without measuring the bricks at this point, I'd say they are the classic size used for building houses - if necessary, I can go and measure them.</p>

<p>When it comes to the height of the raised bed, I'd like it to be roughly knee height; this should be about 5-6 bricks high at a guess. I'm not sure at this point what sort of shape I might like for the bed, but an oval, circle or square are definite possibilities. It would have a diameter/length of roughly 2-3 metres. I do realise that I won't be able to easily reach to the centre at that size, but I'm happy with that - I'll probably just plant herbs there as companion plants.</p>

<p>Edit: The climate is mostly dry, sunny and reasonably mild (generally within -5 to 30 deg C) - we get probably 10-20 frosts each winter, but the ground itself doesn't freeze, and it doesn't snow as it's too near to the coast. When it rains, it really rains lots as we're surrounded by hills so drainage is important, however the soil is fairly free draining.</p>

<p>We don't want to get extra bricks, so will design based on what we have. The purpose is definitely partially decorative as the bricks will match the house.</p>
","<p>I'm not trying to put you off from doing it yourself, in fact I would encourage you to give it ago, but do keep in mind, laying bricks (properly) is a lot! harder than it looks.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Keep the shape of the raised-bed simple ie Rectangle or Square.</p></li>
<li><p>Take you time to install a good, strong and level foundation to build off.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider placing some kind of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_%28architecture%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">coping stone</a> on top of the brickwork, doing so will give you a nice looking finish, but more importantly it will greatly help extend the life of the brickwork.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To mainly make things easier for myself, I'm going to work with the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick#Optimal_dimensions.2C_characteristics.2C_and_strength"" rel=""noreferrer"">""standard"" UK brick size</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>215mm x 102.5mm x 65mm (8&#189;inch x 4inch x 2&#189;inch)</li>
</ul>

<p>To fully get the visual beauty of the brickwork, I would personally lay 5 courses of brickwork minimum (with the understanding 1 of those courses will be below ground level) ie</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Minimum raised-bed wall height: 5 x 75mm (10mm mortar joint) = 375mm (14&#190;inches) = 300mm (12inches) viewable above ground level.</p></li>
<li><p>Again to keep things simple, lay the bricks in ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretcher_bond#Stretcher_bond"" rel=""noreferrer"">Stretcher bond</a>"" pattern.</p></li>
<li><p>Raised-bed wall thickness = 102.5mm (4inches) or what is known as ""half brick"" thickness.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the above information means we can work on the bases of 60 bricks per m&#178; (50 bricks per yd&#178;).</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore you have enough bricks to build: 350 / 60 = 5.8m&#178; or 350 / 50 = 7yd&#178;</p>

<ul>
<li>Which translates into enough bricks to build: 5.8 / 0.375 = <strong>15.4 linear metres of raised-beds @ a height of 375mm</strong> OR <strong>17 linear yards of raised-beds @ a height of 14&#190;inches.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Again to keep things simple and ""standard"", a raised-bed should be 1.2m (4ft) wide -- this allows you to easily work the bed without stepping into it.</p>

<ul>
<li>A raised-bed can be a long as is practical.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Therefore you have enough bricks to build a <strong>1.2m wide x 6.5m long raised-bed @ a height of 375mm</strong> OR <strong>4ft wide x 21&#189;ft long raised-bed @ a height of 14&#190;inches.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Even though the brickwork is only 5 courses high, I'd be inclined to shorten the long sides down to 6m (19&#189;ft), then with the spare bricks build a 1 brick thick (215mm/8&#189;inch), 4 courses high (so you don't have to mess around with <em>special</em> coping stones and ruin the straight line of the bed), support piers halfway along the length of of those sides -- doing so will stiffen up those walls and give the raised-bed that much more strength.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Or maybe a better option would be 2 raised-beds: <strong>1.2m wide x 2.65m long</strong> OR <strong>4ft wide x 8&#190;ft long.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Will prevent you from having to build ""support piers"" (see above).</p></li>
<li><p>If you go with 2 raised-beds, leave enough space between them so you can work easily in each bed, 600mm (2ft) minimum gap.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Hopefully I've got my above maths correct, especially where I've given/used imperial units. Please feel free to pull-up any mistakes I might have made.</em></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Tools you will need:</strong></p>

<li><p>Builders ""layout"" spray-paint.</p></li>

</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Below advice mainly comes from helping others (skilled bricklayers) and doing it myself on the odd occasion:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Determine the size (plan area) of the bed, based on a height of 375mm (14&#190;inches).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>One ""long"" raised-bed: <strong>1.2m wide x 6m long</strong> OR <strong>4ft wide x 19&#189;ft long, with ""support piers"" (see above).</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Two raised-beds (recommended option): <strong>1.2m wide x 2.65m long</strong> OR <strong>4ft wide x 8&#190;ft long.</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Layout the plan shape of the raised-bed(s) on the ground using the builders ""layout"" spray-paint.</p>

<ul>
<li>Then layout the same shape 100mm (4inches) offset to the outside of the above shape -- this will give you the outside face of the strip-footing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If constructing on a lawn, carefully take up the grass and store it properly for reuse.</p></li>
<li><p>Layout the builders tarp need by, so you can easily put the excavated soil from the footing onto it.</p></li>
<li><p>Dig a strip-footing, 300mm (12inches) wide x 450 to 600mm (18 to 24 inches) deep.</p></li>
<li><p>Fill the excavated strip-footing with concrete.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Concrete should finish 75mm (3inches) below ground level.</p></li>
<li><p>Take your time and get the finished concrete as level as possible -- doing so will greatly help when you come to start laying bricks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Let the concrete set-up (cure) for at least 24 hours before starting to lay bricks.</p></li>
<li><p>Either use ready-mix bags of brickwork mortar or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortar_%28masonry%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">mix your own</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If mixing your own, measure out the materials by volume (use a bucket), doing so will ensure you achieve a consistent ""finished"" mortar colour.</p></li>
<li><p>Mix strength by volume of materials, 4:1 or 5:1 ie</p></li>
<li><p>4 or 5 parts soft building sand.</p></li>
<li><p>1 part <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_cement"" rel=""noreferrer"">Portland cement</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Thoroughly ""dry"" mix together the two materials.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a suitable <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=mortar+plasticiser"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mortar Plasticiser</a> to a bucket of clean water -- this will make the mortar more workable, easier to use.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the water (with plasticiser) slowly to the dry mixture, mixing together as you go -- you want to end up with a thick (but workable), lump free mixture <em>(see below image, click to enlarge)</em>.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>First</strong>, build the corners of the raised-bed(s), take your time...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make sure the first course of brickwork is level.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the corners are square (90&#176;) and plumb (upright, not leaning inward or outward).</p></li>
<li><p>If you cut corners on the above couple of points, you will be ""fighting"" to correct the brickwork as you progress further.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Once you've built the corners (up to their final height), use the bricklayers pointing iron or off-cut piece of hose to point the brickwork (the mortar joints).</p>

<ul>
<li>Then take the soft brush-head and clean (wipe-off) the brickwork.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>With the corners built,</strong> take the string-line, line it up with the top outside edge of the first course of brickwork, and run it between one corner and another corner.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>If building one ""long"" raised-bed and working on one of the long sides, you will want to build the ""support pier"" (see above) before moving onto the next point.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Then complete this course of brickwork using the string-line as a guide for the bricks.</p></li>
<li><p>Move the string-line up one course of bricks, then complete that course of brickwork... Repeat until you've finished that one face of the raised-bed.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you've built that face of the raised-bed (up to its final height), take the bricklayers pointing iron or off-cut piece of hose and point the brickwork (the mortar joints).</p>

<ul>
<li>Then take the soft brush-head and clean (wipe-off) the brickwork.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Repeat the above steps to fill-in the other three faces of the raised-bed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>On the second course of brickwork (first course viewable above ground level), remove (omit) the vertical mortar joint between the bricks, do so near the corners, then every 3rd joint along the length of the walls -- this will provide some drainage from the raised-bed.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Optional, but highly recommended -- to help prolong the life of the brickwork, lay a coping stone around the perimeter.</p></li>
<li><p>Before filling the raised-beds with suitable material, get some outdoor screen mesh fabric (small off-cuts) and place those on the inside face of the brickwork over the vertical joints you omitted -- this will help those drainage ""holes"" stay clear of debris and functional.</p></li>
<li><p>If the soil you excavated for the strip-footing is ok! (dark, crumbly, etc) I would take that and mix it with high quality ""organic"" material (compost, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_mold"" rel=""noreferrer"">leaf mold</a>, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, if the excavated material isn't ok! (clay, clumpy, etc) I wouldn't use it in the bed, instead I would bring in a 50/50 mixture of finely sieved top soil and high quality ""organic"" material (compost, leaf mold, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>Add the material in 6inch (150mm) layers, ""lightly"" tamping down each layer as you go.</p></li>
<li><p>Make good around the perimeter of the raised-bed at ground level -- if you built on a lawn, take some of the grass you stored (properly) for reuse and lay that back down.</p></li>

"Is mid-October too late to seed a lawn in Ottawa, Canada?","2817","","<p>My yard work has been delayed this year. This past weekend, I finished spreading the topsoil (which has been on the driveway since May) to rebuild an area of my lawn.</p>

<p>Is it too late to spread grass seed this year?</p>

<p>If so, what's the best way to control weeds until the spring?</p>
","<p>If you use a mix containing mostly perennial ryegrass, you still have some time. This will germinate whenever the temperature is over 32 degrees F., but takes longer (up to three weeks or more in cold weather) than it would if planted sooner. If your mix contains Kentucky Bluegrass and/or fescue, these will not germinate well, and you will have to sow thickly. </p>

<p>Make sure the soil is moist, and that the top inch or so (not too deep) is worked to a fine tilth. Rake the seed in lightly, don't let the seed go very deep, as this causes much of it to rot before germinating in cold weather.</p>

<p>As for weeds, you really have to take care of them as they appear, as obviously you don't want to apply a pre-emergent to newly sown grass seed. After the grass is up, but before it freezes, you may be able to get in a treatment, but I think you'll have better results in spring. Don't try to control weeds right before winter if large amounts of precipitation are expected. If your grass germinates long enough before the ground begins to freeze, and you see some broadleaved weeds coming up, you can apply a general broadleaf control such as clopyralid, dicamba, 2,4-D, mecoprop, quinclorac, etc, or a three-way. It's possible that some of these aren't available to residential people.</p>

<p>But again, control will be better if you wait until spring, and the grass will be more ready to fill in and cover the soil, which will help inhibit further weed development.</p>

I used a steel rake to pull up some today but it is still full of thatch. I feel like I could continue raking for days and never get it all.  Will a rake meant specifically for dethatching be any easier to use, and more importantly will it pull up more thatch than a standard steel rake?</p>
","<p>Where in California (according to your SE profile) are you?</p>

<p>Am asking, as from my limited research (knowledge) on grass types used in California, I discovered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Northern California tends to favour cool season lawns.</li>
<li>Southern California tends to favour warm season lawns.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do have a warm season lawn (grass type), for the overall health of your lawn you should only dethatch in Spring, once the grass has woken from dormancy &amp; is actively growing.</p>

<p>Dethatching at any other time of year greatly increases the chance of causing real damage to a warm season lawn.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you have a cool season lawn (grass type), without a shadow of a doubt the best time of year to treat, perform maintenance, on your lawn is late Summer, early Autumn (Fall). Around ""Labor Day"" in the USA is generally considered about ideal.</p>

<p>Now adding onto <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/1351/lawn-thatching-tools/1352#1352"">""Mancuniensis"" answer</a>, I recommend paying a visit to your local tool hire shop (store) and rent yourself a mechanically powered Dethatcher (a machine you walk behind, just like a lawnmower) for a &#189; or full day.</p>

<p>Additionally, as you paint a picture of a bad thatch problem, I would also be very tempted to get hold of a mechanically powered Aerator and aerate your lawn after dethatching. Doing so will open up the soil, get some much needed air in there.</p>

<p>Then after doing that, I would give your lawn a ""natural"" feed with a allover covering of &#189; to 1inch (12.5 to 25mm) thick layer of screened compost (preferably STA-certified or similar).</p>

"Can a raised vegetable garden co-exist with nearby fruit trees?","2781","","<p>I am putting in new raised beds for a vegetable garden. The beds will be 40cm (16 inches) high. The beds will line the length of a fence and I am planning to put a row of fruit trees (possibly blueberries and passionfruit) between the beds and the fence.</p>

<p>In order to try and prevent the tree roots from colonising the vegetable beds and stealing all the water and nutrients, I am planning on laying porous weed matting underneath the raised beds. My theory is that will keep the tree roots away from the vegetable soil but still allow drainage.</p>

<p>However, I have received strong advice from a family member that this isn't sufficient and that the trees will still suck the vegetable beds dry. Basically I've been told that you can't put fruit trees anywhere near vegetable beds if you want the vegetables to thrive. </p>

<p>Is this correct? Is there any way to make this work? If so I've considered some even more drastic measures such as hammering in sheet metal vertically down the back of the vegetable beds to keep the tree roots from growing in under the beds (they could happily grow the other way into the neighbours place as they don't have anything growing along that fence). Would this work?</p>
","<p>I have blueberries growing about 6' away from the edge of my vegetable garden, and I haven't had any problems with roots invading the garden.</p>

<p>I don't know much about passionfruit, but from what I see from a couple of quick searches, it looks like it has a small root system. Blueberries also have a shallow, fairly small root system. It doesn't sound like either plant will invade your beds.</p>

<p>Beware that <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/2336/51"">blueberries want much more acidic soil</a> than most vegetables. With raised beds it probably won't be as much of an issue, but if you have to lower the pH of the soil where the blueberries are planted, and the passionfruit is nearby, you may run into trouble.</p>

<p>You'll definitely want to mulch around the blueberries to conserve moisture. Both the blueberries and the passionfruit want consistent water while they're fruiting; the small, shallow root systems mean they need to be watered frequently, but they don't want to stay waterlogged.</p>

<p>Don't plant the blueberries or passionfruit in a place where they will cast shade on your vegetable beds.</p>

<p>It's hard to say ""fruit trees"" are good or bad around your raised beds: there's so much variation in plants matching that description that you'd really have to ask a narrower question to get good advice. (I.e. as you've done here by asking about blueberries &amp; passionfruit.)</p>

<p>Which is the best weather to prune mimosa?</p>

<p>Which is the best time to do it? </p>
","<p>I've decided to give you the information anyway, and you can interpret it for wherever you are in the world in terms of your spring/flowering times. Usual pruning time for this plant (Acacia dealbata) is immediately after flowering is over, when you remove any dead or diseased wood, thin out crossing branches/stems and reduce the size - you can take off two thirds of the growth if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED RESPONSE</strong>: I don't know whether you get very low temperatures where you are - the risk with pruning now is that you may induce new growth on the plant, which you really don't want before winter arrives, it won't have time to harden off. What you can do, though, is top any long branches to reduce windrock - this is best done when the weather is very cool, so if you can wait till end of November, that would probably be better,on the assumption it's colder then and a greater degree of dormancy is present in the plant. And make a resolution to give it a good prune and reshaping, taking out crossing/twisted stems, next spring after flowering.</p>

"When should I transfer a pothos rooted in water to soil?","2776","","<p>I recently learned how to take clippings from a pothos plant and root it in water. I am quite new to this sort of gardening and have no idea when I should transfer it to soil. I can see tiny roots growing but I'm not sure how big they should be before I transfer it to soil. When should I plant them? How long should the roots be?</p>

<p>I didn't include a picture originally to try to keep the question general, but as requested here is a picture: <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IyMmn.jpg"" alt=""A pothos rooted in water""></p>
","<p>About half an inch to an inch is sufficient - you don't want them much longer than that because its harder to pot them without damage, and once roots start appearing, its surprising how fast they grow. Try not to damage them when transferring to a soil medium - make a hole large enough to accommodate the rootlets without squashing or bending them, and gently push the soil around them, pressing down lightly at the base of the stem when you're done. Water in well with the pot standing in something to catch the excess - empty that after 30 minutes. Best done into a potting medium that's already damp. </p>

<p>UPDATED ANSWER:</p>

<p>Now you've added pics, wait a bit longer till they're half an inch, although, as its Epipremnum (Pothos) it will be okay to pot it now, but it means you have to pay particular attention to watering - enough to encourage the roots, but not so much that a fungal infection occurs. If you can bear to wait, it shouldn't take long for them to grow.</p>

"What are these red spots on the leaves of my boysenberry plant?","2770","","<p>Previously, I had issues with the <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/1704/how-do-i-prevent-my-berry-leaves-from-getting-scorched-in-the-sun"">sun scorching the leaves of my berry plants</a>. Now that the heat has cooled down, those leaves are back to normal. However, a lot of the leaves on my boysenberry plant have reddish spots on them, and I'm beginning to worry about them. The plants look perfectly healthy in all other aspects.</p>

<p>This is something I observed even when the sun was harsh (and a little prior to that). At first, I brushed it away, because if you observe closely, the red spots are around the edges or in between two leaf veins (the leaf membrane slightly curves up there) and it didn't seem unreasonable that the sun damage would strike there first (just like how sun damage in a plastic container first appears at the sharp corners and edges). </p>

<p>It was interesting to note that these leaves (the ones that have red spots) didn't quite dry up and shrivel like those in my other question linked above. Could these be due to a disease rather than sun scorching? Should I be concerned and is there something I can/should do about it? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Watering</strong></p>
  
  <p>Lack of supplemental watering from June to August severely limits successful production of blueberries in the Pacific Northwest. Shallow-rooted plants require close attention to maintain a uniformly moist environment around their base. They require 1, or possibly 2 inches of water each week, in the absence of any rainfall. Be sure the entire root zone is wet after an irrigation. <strong>Drought symptoms include reddened foliage, weak, thin shoots, and reduced fruit set.</strong> Maintain a 2-inch mulch layer to preserve soil moisture. A drip system, set on a timer, works especially well in keeping soil moist on a daily basis. Keep watering the plants through August to ensure good fruit bud development for the following season's crop.</p>

","<p>That seems a good idea, since the plants useful for your dragon surely are used to the same climate of it.</p>

<p>You could plante it if</p>

<ul>
<li>the soil is the same that you use for your animal</li>
<li>the manure is not dangerous for your animal</li>
<li>there is space enough for animal and plants</li>

<li><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnip""><strong>Turnip green</strong></a> are winter / spring
The benefits derived from turnip husbandry are of great magnitude; light soils are cultivated with profit and facility; abundance of food is provided for man and beast; the earth is turned to the uses for which it is physically calculated, and by being suitably cleaned with this preparatory crop, a bed is provided for grass seeds, wherein they flourish and prosper with greater vigor than after any other preparation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Turnip (flower)</strong> The leaves of turnips are also eaten as ""turnip greens""
The first ploughing is given immediately after harvest, or as soon as the wheat seed is finished, either in length or across the field, as circumstances may seem to require. In this state the ground remains till the oat seed is finished, when a second ploughing is given to it, usually in a contrary direction to the first.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnip""><strong>Mustard greens</strong></a> (Brassica juncea) - Mustard plant are any of several plant species in the genera Brassica and Sinapis. Mustard seed is used as a spice. Grinding and mixing the seeds with water, vinegar or other liquids, creates the yellow condiment known as mustard. The seeds can also be pressed to make mustard oil, and the edible leaves can be eaten as mustard greens. Mustard seeds generally take three to ten days to germinate if placed under the proper conditions, which include a cold atmosphere and relatively moist soil. Mature mustard plants grow into shrubs.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pea""><strong>Pea sativum</strong></a> is an annual plant, with a life cycle of one year. It is a cool season crop grown in many parts of the world; planting can take place from winter to early summer depending on location.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Each crop has its own rules, but in general they are easy. Once you get started, then you would find yourself well, or you can even ask for advice.</p>

<p>My fear is that the product obtained is not enough for your dragon, that would ultimately devastate your garden. Surely you will integrate the crop with vegetables purchased, unless your soil is so large as to be able to grow food enough.</p>

<p>If I harvest the 2nd and 3rd one for sowing the bare/thin patches, should I use a mixture of them, or maybe just stick with the 3rd one?</p>
","<p>Ah, I had a feeling you might be, from the look of the photographs. It looks as if the lawn has been largely colonized by weed grasses - this happens all the time in ordinary lawns, more so in those left unmaintained. If, as you say, 60 percent of the lawn is comprised of these rough weed grasses, and particularly if there is a large component of other lawn weed invasion, it's probably best to take the lot up, dig out the roots of the weed grasses, and returf. The best time for returfing is October, so long as the ground isn't frozen or waterlogged, but it can be done any time provided you're able to water sufficiently well. Get yourself a copy of D. G. Hessayon's ""The Lawn Expert"" - it's only around a tenner, and often you can find a copy in the library, although any chemicals mentioned will now probably not be available. Its a valuable resource, that book, and will tell you precisely how to lay turf.
If you don't want to replace the whole lot, then dig out all the clumps of weed grass you can see, by the roots, rake and relevel those areas, adding topsoil if  you need to, and then reseed using a proprietary Lawn Seed mix, preferably one with shortleaved rye grass as the main component, which is hardwearing but doesn't get 'tufty' (Playlawn, or General Purpose would be examples). Note that reseeding in this way, particularly for larger areas, means you cannot walk on the newly seeded/grown areas normally for a couple of months, it must be cut with shears the first couple of times so as not to tear the new plantlets out by the roots with the mower, and will need to be kept moist as a seedbed. The best time for reseeeding is either September or May. You can buy Luxury Grass Seed, but this is for the 'bowling green' effect, for areas where it's not walked on often, and requires a lot more regular maintenance.</p>

"Why do all my strawberries become moldy?","2740","","<p>We have a strawberry patch in our back yard.  There seems to be a lot of mold growing there, which is getting to the berries before we can.  What can I do to prevent this from happening?</p>

<p>Cool, and especially damp this spring.  I live in the St Paul, MN, so it is fairly cool most of the time (compared to summers elsewhere at least).  They have raised sides around them, and are pretty packed in there.  Looking at the bed, you can't see any of the ground through the leaves.</p>
","<p>Strawberry beds need to be ""rejuvenated"" every few years.  This means killing or removing  all the plants in one part of the strawberry bed.  The remaining plants will fill in the cleared area by runners.  The usual reason that this is done is because the older plants are <em>much</em> less productive than new runners / plants.</p>

<p>In your case this will also reduce the plant packing and get some air flow through the strawberry bed.  This will help dry out the moisture on the plants and soil.  (Mold likes moist conditions)  If you must water be sure to do in the early morning so that it can all dry out.</p>

<li>Can I aggressively prune them? When, how, and how much? Am I hoping for too much to want to get the trees down to about 15-20 feet tall?</li>
<li>Is the moss a problem? Should I just pull it off, or do I need to treat it with something?</li>
</ol>
","<p>The type of pruning you're looking for is called <code>crown reduction</code>. The main purpose of this is to reduce the height of the tree by cutting down its crown, as explained <a href=""http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/howtos/ht_prune/approaches.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>. </p>

<p>Since you say your tree is 30+ feet high, it is advisable to get professional help instead of venturing out to do this on your own. Note that the pruning cuts that will be made are quite large and <em>could</em> lead to diseases in the tree. This can be mitigated by sealing the wound quickly with tar. </p>

<p>Crown reduction is inherently aggressive and <em>could</em> send the tree into a temporary shock. I would suggest that you reduce the crown and <em>minimally</em> prune the smallest of the messy branches the first year. The second year, you can remove more of the smaller branches (as you would in a normal pruning). </p>

<p>You will have to be patient with the tree and give it a year or two to recover and start producing a bountiful crop.</p>

<p>As for the moss (probably <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen"" rel=""noreferrer"">lichen</a>) on the trunks, it shouldn't be a problem  as the thick bark provides protection for the tree. There might be cause for concern if it spreads to the leaves, as it could be symptomatic of something else and prevent respiration/photosynthesis, but until then, it should be fine. I personally think trees with a bit of green moss growing on them look pretty.</p>

<p>It seems like it would be a lot easier on the mower to go across it, and I'm confidant it wouldn't tip over, but I don't want the engine to seize up or something else dramatic.

"How can I get rid of a bush, without digging into the ground?","2711","","<p>I recently made my annual visit to my grandparents' graves. While there, I couldn't help but notice that the plant that my great-aunt had planted by my great-grandparents' grave was overgrown to the point of having moved the (insanely heavy) grave marker. I think it's time for this bush to go, and my dad agrees with me.<br>
My dad removed a lot of the small branches with a hedge clipper, removed all the small branches at the top; however, we could not hack through the heavy, thick ""trunk"" of the bush. (see picture)  </p>

<p>So, we have to find some way to get rid of this overgrown trunk. The logical thing to do (I assume) would be to dig under the thing, and take it out from the roots. However, Jewish law proscribes digging into the ground under a grave (besides for the fact that I don't really want to.....).</p>

<p><strong>What can I do to get rid of this plant, without digging?</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DU2z1.jpg"" alt=""this is the plant""></p>
","<p>If you can't dig it out, your best luck will be had using a pruning saw and taking it off at ground level. To keep it from coming back, drill small holes straight into the stems, going in at least an inch, but not going through the wood into soil. You can then use a 50% glyphosate mixture and fill the holes, being careful not to spill much on the surrounding soil/plants. This will kill the plant. Then you can cover the stump in a layer of decomposed plant matter (like compost) to speed decomposition. An addition of nitrogen-rich material, such as blood or hoof and horn meal, or even commercial lawn fertilizer, will speed the process up even further.</p>

<p>Could I do something to the inside of the walls to waterproof it, or could it be that the water might be coming down from the top? Any advice would be great!</p>
","<p>The only way to figure out a solution is to investigate. Fortunately all you need is a tarp and a spade (good back helps too).</p>

<ul>
<li>pick an area where the paint is spalling</li>

<li>roofing paper- ineffective very fast</li>
<li>40 ml pond liner - best solution</li>

<p>You need to prevent water moving from inside the bed to outside. This is what is causing the paint to spall off.</p>

"How do I keep red wiggler worms alive overwinter in the Northeastern USA?","2697","","<p>I'm going to be moving into my first house soon in Westchester County, NY. I've done a lot of container and patio/balcony gardening and am looking forward to having a real backyard garden.  I want to start composting with worms but am not sure if they are self-sustainable.  </p>

<p>I'm ok with having to buy worms every season (I see that the red wiggler is the worm to get) but am curious about the experience of other vermicomposters in NY and the Northeast.  I've read that an active compost pile can have a temp of 125 degrees Fahrenheit. I assume that worms will move out of my compost material when it gets that hot but what happens in the winter when it gets near zero?  </p>
","<p>I've been composting with worms awhile now and believe I have some good advice for you:</p>

<p>1) if you are using the active compost method, you can't use worms. Red wiggler Worms survive from 40-95°Fahrenheit (4-35°Celsius), but the optimum temp is from 60-77°F (16-25°C). If you will be having a lot of waste and want to use worms to compost with, you have a couple options: </p>

<p>A) use bokashi composting first (you can compost everything, including meat, dairy, and oils with this method. It is an anaerobic method, meaning you can use an airtight container. After the bokashi compost bucket is full, either bury the pickled waste in your garden or feed a little at a time to your worms. Over feeding the worms is bad and can overheat the bin. There are many sites on bokashi composting if you google it. </p>

<p>B) the second method if you really want to have an active pile is to wait until the hot composting process is complete. I have a compost pile that has yard waste and horse manure (worms delicacy) right now that is 154°F (68°C). That's almost twice what the worms can survive in. Let the ""hot"" process complete, then add the ingredients to your worm bin. Hot composting is great to do prior to worm composting because it kills any diseases, pathogens, and weed seeds. Horses only digest about 1/4 of what they eat so many weed seeds escape. </p>

<p><em>*</em> if you'd rather only use worms, you will need to build a compost pit (which you can insulate with straw in the winter) or you will need to put together a bin for them (wood ones are better than plastic because the aeration provided). You don't want to use garbage cans if you can help it because they will be too deep for the worms. If you have any questions, let me know and I'll be happy to help out any way I can. </p>

"Is there a traditional method/style for pruning a Chocolate Silk tree?","2694","","<p>I have a containerized Chocolate Silk (a.k.a. Summer Chocolate) tree that is two years old (i.e. it was planted in its present container from a branchless and rootless stalk two years ago).</p>

<p>It has grown robustly each year, but the foliage seems unbalanced in the sense that there aren't many leaves or branches near the trunk and it keeps growing out but not adding interior growth.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wXQBq.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Is there a traditional look or style for Chocolate silk trees</strong>, and if so how should I prune to achieve it? (My Google image searches mostly resulted in close-up pictures of the leaves; most of the tree-scale pictures were of obviously <a href=""http://pics.davesgarden.com/pics/2005/07/11/Kachinagirl/972860.jpg"">un-pruned plants</a> or copies of a <a href=""http://www.thompson-morgan.com/medias/sys_tandm/8797026320414.jpg"">single picture showing tight foliage</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a certain time of year when I should prune</strong> (i.e. it's early July, is it too late)?</p>

<p>More generally, <a href=""http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/howtos/ht_prune/prun001.htm"">do overall guidelines for pruning trees</a> (such as prune when dormant) apply to this varietal?</p>
","<p>This looked very familiar as either a ""mimosa tree"" or a guanacaste, so I looked it up. Yes ""silk tree"" is another name for ""mimosa tree"" (guanacaste, the national tree of Costa Rica is tropical and unrelated but looks similar).</p>

<p>This tree is one of the <em>Albizia</em> species (there are 150!) of the <em>Mimosoidae</em> sub-family, so they are distant relatives to the low lying mimosa plants that include ""Sensitive Plants"". This also explains their similarity in general shape of compound leaf and fuzzy pink flowers (or mine has pink ones!).</p>

<p>Yours looks about right and more typical of the ones I see in Texas, than the pictures I could find online(!). This is the best I could find:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9SPes.jpg"" alt="" Albizia Julbrissin By George (Own work) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons""></p>

<p>This might not be the exact same species but the branches look similar. I think the fact we're seeing a stand with multiple trunks complicates things.  As I say yours looks much like how I see them. The branches are quite springy and grow up and at an angle and level out. A full set of leaves will weigh them down so they'll often arc downwards (yours aren't that long yet), and the general look is of horizontal leaf ""canopies"". Might be tempting as leaf shade but it makes a poor shade tree - the leaf cover is thin and as the whole tree is springy it blows easily.</p>

<p>These are non-native to North America and considered invasive in some parts. I actually managed to grow my tree from seedlings that start on their own in back-fill when the city were working on out street, so with less of a winter, I can see how they could become a pest.  (I'll try to get a picture but it might take some time).</p>

<p>Mimosa Trees / Silk Trees look nice but they are vulnerable to physical damage. Limbs break easily. I read somewhere that a typical lifespan is about 15-20 years.</p>

<p>Robust growth sounds right. As is the non-lower-trunk growth. The leaves grow on the branches. My tree is older and it does have a little bit of growth further down - but they are like that ""twig"" you have (plus one example of mower damage that led to a low level branch sprouting - not recommended!). Let that grow, it will be a new branch. I think you're doing fine. I do note you have more growth on the right - probably due to the sun. I have the same problem with mine growing to one side but this is because an elm is impinging (a long story, but suffice to say the elm will be a decent size when the mimosa dies and I would prefer the large long-lived elm - so I'm letting everything be for now).</p>

<p>Pruning: I've never worried about the time although I tend to prune in spring so by default that is when it gets clipped. I only prune it to stop it getting in the way (eg. growing across our back alley). After a quick look at the URL you posted, yes I cut the branches in that manner. I find it also results in a neater looking branch/trunk.</p>

<p>Yours is about the size mine first put flowers out. It was even in a pot at the time - which is apparently unusual. General advice is to plant it out for flowers. Seeds should be viable. My Mum took some of ours and they germinated.</p>

<p>I find it can survive short drought conditions and at its worse will drop its leaves but with a good soaking will quickly put out new ones. If you are starting to see large numbers of leaves going yellow and dropping then it is probably too dry.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> Here's my Mimosa Tree:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZDrS2.jpg"" alt=""Mimosa Tree""></p>

<p>Sorry for the poor quality - it was taken with a phone not long after midday! You can see the general shape though. And the flat canopy-like areas from groups of compound leaves. Some of the more central branches go closer to vertical, but others curve outwards to horizontal. The lower part has three ""trunks"": The first (main) trunk has a Y shape with a branch about 1ft up: This was due to squirrel damage on the growing tip when the seedling was about 1yr old. The third branch is smaller and from further down. This is from strimmer/weedwacker damage - I think there's a good argument to remove it, but it does add some depth to the foliage above.</p>

<p>The lower left branch is bowing down a bit. There's probably an argument to trim it, but I probably won't.</p>

<p>You can also see the elm encroaching on the right. This is from a stump that started growing. The original was a grand tree that gave us a lot of shade. I didn't need much persuading to let it grow back again, even if it comes back as more of a coppice.</p>

I have seen trees that are cut return, but never plants in pots. I do not know what to do with this lovely happy plant during the cold months. <strong><em>Should I cut it?</em></strong></p>
","<p>The way I see it there are 2 options to keep this plant growing, but both are going to involve cutting the top back. First, I need to point out one important fact that makes this possible: Banana plants are <strong>not</strong> trees. Trees are woody perennials. Bananas are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_basjoo"" rel=""nofollow"">herbaceous perennials</a>, much like any perennial garden flowers you might have (hostas, daylilies, daffodils, etc). All the top growth can be replaced every year if it needs to. What appears to be the 'trunk' is just a series of overlapping leaf sheaths. If it's cut back within a few feet of the ground new leaves will grow out from the roots and grow right back. </p>

<p>So, you have <a href=""http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/PlantFinder/PlantFinderDetails.aspx?kempercode=d442"" rel=""nofollow"">two options</a>: One is that you can cut it back to about two feet and tuck it in a cool corner until spring. It will produce new leaves when you put it out in warmer weather. Another option is to plant it outside. If you do this you'll want to watch for the first frost. When that happens the leaves will all die off. At that point, cut down the 'stem' within 2-3 feet of the ground and wrap it in burlap, bubble wrap or similar, then mulch heavily over the roots to protect them from the worst of the winter freezes. Mulched properly, the roots can safely tolerate air temperatures down to -10 degrees Fahrenheit. In <a href=""http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/#"" rel=""nofollow"">zone 6</a>, that pretty much doesn't happen. In spring, the plant will put out new leaves from the base. If you decide to plant it outside, site it somewhere with well drained soil and full sun.</p>

<p>If that is possible then is it also possible to graft two different types of tree onto the stem of one tree such that it bears two different types of fruit?</p>
","<p>Yes and yes. It sounds like you have a sour orange which is typically used as root stock for full sized citrus trees. You can graft grapefruit, orange, lemons and limes to this stock. Oranges and grapefruit will do the best. If you put Mexican lime on one side and grapefruit on the other the lime side will grow slower and the grapefruit side faster and so you will get a very strange looking tree eventually. However, if you try some Valencias, navels and blood oranges the growth will be more proportionate. 
If the stock is more than a few years old you will use top working techniques - probably cleft grafting would be best.

","<p>This sounds like a job for the <a href=""http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/PlantFinder/PlantFinderSearch.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Missouri Botanical Garden's PlantFinder</a>! Using that tool, you can search for ""shade tree"" and ""edible fruit"", and the site will return 28 plant descriptions, including specifics on how each variety does in Missouri.</p>

<p>Of the edible-fruit trees, it looks like most of the natives like Hackberry, Hardy Pecan, and Black Walnut prefer moister soils; it's possible you might have more success with exotics like Turkish Hazel.</p>

<p>You'll notice that if you uncheck ""edible fruit"" and choose ""shade tree"" and ""shallow/rocky soils"", one of the suggested trees is the native Post Oak, which although not exactly a fruit tree would provide shade and acorns for your wildlife.</p>

<p>Also, what are the odds that this pathogen will spread to other nearby palm trees?</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, there is no known cure or treatment for a tree infected with this pathogen, which appears to be a strain of the fungus <em>Fungus oxysporum</em>. It is thought to spread to other palms on the wind and on pruning tools:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>• Infected palms die quickly, often within a few months of the initial symptoms.</p>
  
  <p>• There is no cure once a palm is infected, and no preventive fungicide treatments are
  recommended.</p>
  
  <p>• The disease is probably spread by wind into new sites. Once established, it could also be spread by pruning tools. Pruning tools should be sterilized after each palm is trimmed.</p>
  
  <p>• Palms, especially queen palms and Mexican fan palms, should not be replanted into a site where a palm with this disease was removed.</p>

"Heeding ""use by"" dates on seed packets?","2683","","<p>Generally seed packets have some kind of expiry date on them. I've got ""sow by"" dates on my packets of Suttons seeds and ""best before"" on Unwins.</p>

<p>Is it worth sowing seeds which have passed their expiry dates? And would the answer vary from plant to plant (e.g. can I be more relaxed about expiry dates for plants that are ""easy"" to grow, like salads and radishes)?</p>

<p>Also, if I persist with out-of-date seeds, will the results consist of:</p>

<p>a) fewer successful germinations </p>

<p>or</p>

<p>b) weaker, less productive adult plants</p>

<p>or both?</p>

<p>Is there any evidence seed companies apply these expiry dates cynically, in order to generate extra sales of newer seeds?</p>
","<p>According to <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1882424581"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Seed to Seed""</a> by Suzanne Ashworth, p29:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Always realize that seed vigor can be lost during storage well before the seeds die completely. For example, if a seed sample germinates at only 20%, that doesn't mean those seeds which sprouted would have grown normally. That sample's seed vigor has diminished to the point that 80% of the seeds aren't even strong enough to sprout, and the remaining 20% will have so little strength that they probably will grow weakly and may not even reach maturity. Constantly keep in mind that your seeds are living entities and will only grow strongly during subsequent seasons if you do everything possible to see that they are stored in truly excellent conditions. Strong plants in the garden are partially a reflection of good seed storage techniques.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So to the second part of your question, yes, you can get reduced germination rates and weaker adult plants.</p>

<p>But if the seeds have been stored well (in a cool place with stable temperature, away from light, and very dry) they may still be strong. If you have enough seed to spare for a test, it's worth doing a germination rate test as described in <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/346/heeding-use-by-dates-on-seed-packets/349#349"">Peter Turner's answer</a> so that you can get an idea of whether it's worth the effort and space in your garden. Some seed is so cheap (or you need so little) that it's better to toss the old seed and buy fresh.</p>

<hr>

<p>Re: does it vary from plant to plant? Yes, but it's not based on how ""easy"" the plants are to grow. See the longevity table <a href=""http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/07221.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in this article</a>. For example, onion seeds do not store well: germination drops off a lot after 1 year. But endive or cucumber can store for 5 years. And if you keep your seeds very dry and cool you can store them for even longer.</p>

<hr>

<p>Re: ""apply these expiry dates cynically, in order to generate extra sales"", I don't know of any evidence. But I'm guessing many casual gardeners aren't storing their seeds in ideal conditions, so the ""sow by"" date you see is probably legitimate. Good seed companies will mark the date and percentage of the last germination test on the packet. Use a chart like the one linked above to decide for yourself (or perform your own germination test) if the seeds are still good.</p>

The previous owners put plastic sheeting down and then spread the wood chips all over it for about 2 inches high. My question is, what is the best way to remove and dispose of them?

"What are these blemishes on the skin of my bell peppers?","2678","","<p>I've noticed the following on two of my oldest bell-peppers, also called capsicum (the third pepper of that ""batch"" had almost finished going red and ripening instead):</p>

<p>It's not ""on"" the surface - I can't scrape it off - but it can be felt on the surface. The worst bits (on the first image above) look like maybe the skin is starting to split?</p>

<p>What's happening to these peppers?<br>
Do I need to take any action?<br>
Are they going to be OK to eat?</p>
","<p>These ""stretch marks"" are the pepper equivalent of human stretch marks which form when the muscles &amp; tissues expand at a different rate from the skin covering them (e.g., pregnancy marks or from excessive gym + protein supplements, etc). In this case, the flesh of the pepper fruit expands faster than the outer epidermal layer and the brown spots are from ""healing"" (the equivalent of our scabs). They are perfectly normal and there is nothing you need to do about it (or can do about it).</p>

<p>I've read from more than one source (and experienced it myself), that peppers with stretch marks tend to be hotter than those without (i.e., smooth skinned ones). <a href=""http://forum.saiga-12.com/index.php?/topic/43220-kitchen-tip-how-to-check-for-the-hotness-of-jalapenos/"" rel=""noreferrer"">This site</a> also says the same:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ever take home a jalapeño chile pepper from the grocery store and have it either be so lacking in heat it may just as well be a bell pepper, or so hot a speck will create a raging inferno in your mouth? Here's a quick tip for choosing jalapeños that can help you decide which ones to pick. Jalapeño chilies start out mild and progressively get hotter the older they get, eventually turning bright red (and quite hot). As they age, they develop white lines and flecks, like stretch marks running in the direction of the length of the pepper. The smoother the pepper, the younger, and milder it is. The more white lines, the older and hotter. Red jalapeños are the most hot, because they've been maturing the longest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I understand, this is knowledge derived from empirical observations (as with most of gardening tips), and you will certainly find peppers that are hot and not have marks (e.g., I've never seen stretch marks on habaneros). This might serve as a very rough guideline to pick one that has a higher probability of being spicy from a given set of peppers of the same kind.</p>

"My composter has developed a sour smell and a lot of bugs. What am I doing wrong?","2676","","<p>I set up a 7 cu ft rolling composter in my garden about 3 weeks ago and filled it about halfway with 1/3 food scraps and 2/3 cardboard/leaves/finished compost.  My kids added more food scraps, so it's probably 50-50 now. I've kept it wet and turned it, but upon opening it yesterday, it had a sour stench and a lot of bugs squirming in it.  I added more finished compost, hoping it just had too much food scraps, but I'm not sure if that's the right thing to do. Is it just 'not done' yet?</p>

<p>Any advice?</p>
","<p>If it has a sour smell, you've probably got:</p>

<ul>
<li>Too much nitrogen, not enough carbon -- add more cardboard &amp; leaves. Avoid adding food scraps, lawn clippings, etc until the problem is fixed.</li>
<li>Not enough air -- turn it.</li>
<li>Too much water -- don't add any more water. (This also contributes to ""not enough air"" -- when it's too wet, the bacteria can't breathe.)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use just shredded cardboard (which has a very high carbon percentage), I'd add about 10% the volume of the bin to get it to equilibrium. If you use leaves instead of cardboard (high carbon, but not as much), I'd triple that.</p>

<p>This is a rough, off the cuff guesstimate. You'll have to add the cardboard, turn it, let it sit for a couple of days and observe. The cardboard will also soak up some of the excess moisture. If the smell goes away and the pile starts to heat up, then you've got the ratio about right. If it still stinks, add more carbon (leaves or cardboard), turn, and wait another couple of days. If the smell goes away but it doesn't heat up, you may have gone too far with the carbon. This is easier to fix than too much nitrogen: start adding kitchen scraps gradually.</p>

<p>If you have a readily available carbon feedstock (aka ""browns"": newspaper, cardboard, dry leaves, sawdust, etc), tell your kids that they need to add some whenever they add kitchen scraps. The ""browns"" belong on top of the scraps. Use more leaves, less sawdust -- the chart <a href=""http://www.composting101.com/c-n-ratio.html"">on this page</a> will give you an idea of how much carbon is in various ingredients. (But your own experience will be the best teacher.) A thin sprinkling of garden soil over the top of the browns helps inoculate the compost with good bacteria and trap nitrogen from escaping into the environment.</p>

<p>(As a side note, ""bugs"" are expected in your compost -- they're part of what will break it down. But it's possible that you've got more than you should. They will probably go away when you get the mix right, especially if you bury the scraps under browns as described above.)</p>

","<p>If the stem has softened, and there is a small amount of sawdust-like frass by the split, you have <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_vine_borer"" rel=""nofollow"">squash vine borer</a>. These pests are the larvae of a moth, and feed on the inside of the zucchini stem by the base of the plant. To control, slit the stem open carefully along the main stem until you locate the worm (it is usually not far from the slit it made). Extract and destroy the worm.</p>

<p>If that isn't the case, then it is most likely caused by too much water. Squash plants crack sometimes, right after a heavy rain. This can't really be avoided, but watch for disease in the slit until it callouses.</p>

<p>Another way that a bush-type squash (because of the thicker stems) can crack, is rotating the stem to point another direction. This stresses the stem base, and it may crack. To avoid this, try not to move the stem.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>From the picture, this looks like <em>tension</em> splitting, where the stem has a high enough tension in itself to split open. It shouldn't affect growth/production. This isn't a big deal concerning plant health, and you can mound soil around the stem if you want. Do not try to fix with wire, because this will not really help, but may damage the stem itself. Also, this will only happen when the stem 'ripens', or hardens, which sounds like what your plant has done. The stem hardens from the base out, and becomes darker in color - like you've described.</p>

"Why were my parsnips fat with a woody core?","2669","","<p>The last (and only) time I tried growing parsnips (""Harris Model"") a couple of years ago, they ended up much ""fatter"" than the parsnips I've typically seen in the store and in pictures. Instead of being just a bit bigger than carrots, these were about 3-4"" diameter at the top, and had a tough woody core. The core was inedible and removing it made cooking them a hassle. I regarded the crop as a ""loss""; nobody wanted to cook or eat it.</p>

<p>I followed directions seen in various places: direct seed in spring (late April) and harvest after some frosts (around Thanksgiving -- mid-November). Some research I did afterward indicated that I may have given them too long of a growing season and should have harvested them earlier. (I.e. maybe they were overmature?) The tops were at least 3' high, which is more than I've seen elsewhere. Was it too much fertility (i.e. an overdose of horse manure)?</p>

<p>What caused this problem and how can I prevent it when I try again next spring?</p>
","<p>The tough woody core would almost certainly have been caused by:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>insufficient moisture</em> - <em>the soil should never be allowed to dry out</em> - although, of course, some varieties of parsnip have a good deal more core than others; it is worth looking through the seed catalogs for a variety with very little core (the one I use is Tender and True, but I don't know if it's available in the US);</p></li>
<li><p><em>leaving them in the ground too long,</em> as you suggest. Although the standard advice is to leave them in the ground until after the first frosts, I've found that when I do this, they become woody, like yours, and are tunneled by carrot fly. I've now started lifting both carrots and parsnips in mid-Autumn and, although the parsnips are not quite as sweet, they are not at all woody, and carrot-fly damage is minimal.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Their over-large size is probably down to the horse manure, resulting in an <em>over-fertile soil</em> coupled with their prolonged stay in the ground. When sowing carrots and parsnips, I've found it  better not to add any manure at all, and  to sow on a plot that I've manured the previous year.</p>

"My garden soil is devoid of nutrients, how should I improve it this winter?","2665","","<p>The garden area in my yard has soil that even the weeds don't particularly love to grow in during the summer. They will make a half hearted attempt in the winter, but it definitely isn't as lush as the rest of my yard. I think decades of gardening by the little old lady who lived there before me, without taking care of the soil, has depleted it.  I have had some success gardening in it, but only with silly amounts of fertilizer. So I want to improve the situation this winter.  </p>

<p>I have a horse ranch near me that gives away free manure that has been reasonably composted already. I was thinking of acquiring enough for a few inches of coverage through the whole garden. I was planning to do this basically as soon as I till my summer garden into the soil.</p>

<p>I was then thinking of growing a cover crop like peas and beans to till into the soil in early spring. I live in the CA Bay Area, so growing winter plants shouldn't be overly difficult. </p>

<p>Are there other techniques I should be thinking of? The garden is already even with the rest of the yard, so I don't want to bring in enough dirt/compost to end up with a raised bed. </p>
","<p>My first step in your situation would be a soil test. The UC Extension service doesn't perform soil testing, but <a href=""http://ucanr.org/sites/gardenweb/files/82228.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">this pdf</a> has a list of labs in northern and central California. The results of this test will tell you in what ways your soil is deficient.</p>

<p>You don't specifically mention what you're growing, but it sounds like vegetables.</p>

<p>One thing that makes it hard for many vegetables to be able to take up nutrients is acidic soil. If your pH is much below 6, a number of vegetables will have a hard time. You can add lime in the amount recommended by the soil test to bring your pH closer to 6.5-7. Soil that is too alkaline will also be a problem, but I'm less familiar with the symptoms there.</p>

<p>Adding composted horse manure is a good idea. The biggest variable with horse manure is the bedding: does the stable use straw, sawdust, or something else? From one perspective, straw is better because it breaks down faster. From another perspective, sawdust (or any wood product in general) once well rotted, holds an outrageous amount of moisture. Then again, having woody remains in the garden if you get a lot of moisture can lead to mushrooms/toadstools. If wood-based bedding is not well rotted, the decomposing woody material will steal nitrogen from your plants so that it can decompose.</p>

<p>Standard advice is to add about 0.5-1"" of compost to poor soil, though I've on occasion added much more than this. (I wrote a calculator to figure out the <a href=""http://howtogrowahealthygarden.com/garden-calculators/how-much-compost/"" rel=""noreferrer"">volume you need to add a given depth of manure</a> to your garden; you may find it helpful.) Work it deeply into the soil -- 6-12"" depth is a good goal. You don't want to focus nutrients in the top layer, this encourages plants to develop shallow roots. You also want to put moisture-holding humus into the lower layers of soil.</p>

<p>Another problem you might have is soil compaction. In this case, if the space isn't too large, you're in good shape, and you have the time (several hours per 100 square feet), you might consider double digging:</p>

<ol>
<li>Loosen the area with a garden fork.</li>
<li>Remove weeds.</li>
<li>Spread your compost/manure over the area to be double-dug.</li>
<li>Add lime as recommended by soil test.</li>
<li>Dig a trench as wide as your spade across the width of the bed, to the depth of your spade. Put the soil in a wheelbarrow or buckets -- you'll use it at the end of the process.</li>
<li>Using the garden fork, loosen the soil at the bottom of the trench to the depth of the fork. While you're working, avoid mixing the soil layers -- you don't want to mix subsoil into your topsoil.</li>
<li>Move back, dig another trench adjacent to the first one. Put the soil from the second trench into the first trench. Loosen the soil at the bottom of this new trench with the fork.</li>
<li>Repeat until you come to the end of the bed. Use the soil from the first trench to fill the last trench.</li>
<li>As you're working (and in the future), <strong>don't walk on the garden bed</strong>. This compacts the soil. Standard advice is to place a board across the bed to stand on while you're double digging, but I don't see the point -- you're already probably dealing with compacted soil, and you're in the process of fixing the problem anyway. Just don't walk on the areas that have been double dug or you'll undo your work!</li>
</ol>

<p>""How to Grow More Vegetables"" by John Jeavons has a whole chapter devoted to soil prep and double digging.</p>

<p>You said you don't want to build it up to a raised bed, but this process loosens the soil and adds so much air that you will (at least temporarily) raise the garden soil somewhat. You don't need to create formal borders or anything, and the soil will settle over time.</p>

<p>A cover crop that you till into the soil next spring is a great idea. Peas and beans aren't bad, but if you want to generate a lot of biomass (and I think you should want to), I'm a fan of ""PVO Mix"" -- that's Peas, Vetch, and Oats. I think your winters are fairly mild, so this should do well for you. The main challenge is chopping it all up when it's time to till it under (vetch and peas can get pretty tangled up in the tiller tines). The vetch and peas both play host to nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and the oats grow tall to provide support for them as well as producing biomass. Fedco is my favorite source for seed, they have <a href=""http://www.fedcoseeds.com/ogs/search.php?item=8251&amp;search=pvo"" rel=""noreferrer"">PVO</a>, and I think they're still shipping cover crop seed this time of year. But you can probably find a supplier that's more local to you.</p>

<p>If the idea of having to chop up a lot of tangle-prone biomass is daunting, you could also consider planting winter rye. It doesn't <em>add</em> nitrogen like the vetch or peas, but it does <em>trap</em> the nitrogen you'll be adding in the manure, preventing it from being lost. Rye can take a couple of passes with the tiller to kill completely, but if you hit it before it puts on too much growth, it doesn't get tangled. Beware that rye must be killed at least two weeks before planting seeds in the soil, because it gives off chemicals that prevent seed germination -- transplants aren't affected.</p>

<p>Lastly, are you composting every bit that you can? Everything that leaves your garden takes some nutrients with it. Vegetable waste from your kitchen (rinds, peels, the forgotten lettuce that rotted in the back of the fridge, etc), along with garden debris (vines, leaves, etc) should be composted and returned to your soil so you don't have to purchase so many outside amendments. Don't put autumn leaves in bags on the curb -- this is valuable carbon you can mix with kitchen scraps in the compost pile and return to the soil.</p>

"How can I remove the moss growing on my lawn?","2660","","<p>I have a lot of fairly thick, short moss growing on my lawn. The grass seems to be growing through it and looks healthy, but I still have a carpet of moss. I try raking it, but it's relentless and continues to grow. What can I do about this?</p>
","<p>Moss loves acid, compacted soil.  Ph is merely a measure of H+ ions in the soil.  Rain will leach other cations from the soil, such as Ca++, Mg++, and K+ in about that order and with Ca++ being mostly leached.  When this happens, H+ takes their places.  This produces an acid soil.  Also, the presence of Ca++ in abundance in soil will cause the clay particles to flocculate, or draw close together.  Having the clay particles close together actually does the opposite of what you'd guess... it makes the soil looser and resistant to compaction.</p>

<p>So the solution to a moss problem is extremely easy.  Just add calcium.  The Ca++ will displace H+ ions and reduce acidity.  The Ca++ will flocculate the soil and reduce compaction.  Grass will again want to grow in the area.</p>

<p>Aeration does very little.  The soil will fill in the little holes and go right back to its compacted nature since the cause of the compaction has not been addressed, namely, lack of Ca++.</p>

"What is this dead light brown patch on my lawn, and how do I get rid of it?","2659","","<p>I have a speckled, dry brown patch on my lawn that won't go away:</p>

<p><img src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5575/14694763078_7acda1fc74_h.jpg"" alt=""brown spots on lawn""></p>

<p>I first noticed it a month or so ago while mowing the lawn, when it was isolated to a single area of several square feet. I figured that it might be due to something random like animal urine or a spilled chemical, so I dismissed it.</p>

<p>The next time I mowed (three weeks later), it had grown in size and had taken on a spotted/blotchy appearance. The brown areas are dry, dead, and crumbly - I can clear out the grass and expose the soil pretty easily with my hands.</p>

<p>Adjacent areas of the lawn are still mostly green, but appear to be taking on the same appearance at the base of grass near the soil. Areas farther out still seem to be healthy and unaffected.</p>

<p>Some other info that may help:</p>

<ul>
<li>I live in central Texas, where it's very hot and humid.</li>
<li>We've had drought (often severe) for the past few years, but this season has seen plenty of rain. It rained a lot before this patch appeared, and has rained a bit since it began to spread, though it's been about three weeks since the last rainfall. I haven't noticed the patch spread significantly since then.</li>
<li>I have awful clay soil that doesn't retain moisture well.</li>
<li>My ""lawn"" wasn't seeded or sodded; it's basically whatever will grow in this soil, which is about half grass and half weeds.</li>
<li>The area of grass that seems to be most - if not entirely - affected by this is pretty lush St. Augustine, at the bottom of a downslope, adjacent to a small creek that keeps the soil moist.</li>
<li>Kids play in the creek and do all kinds of destructive stuff - burning plastic, pouring out paint cans, and other stuff that bleeds over into my lawn and certainly isn't good for it. I didn't notice anything that would have obviously caused this, though.</li>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>A few interesting things to report.</p>

<p>It looks like my memory failed me - the dead grass isn't white or ashy. It's a light straw color, and of a similar tone and appearance to some clippings I left on my driveway that have since dried out. In other words, at a distance, it just looks like normal dried-out grass clippings.</p>

<p>But, on close inspection, I did notice that the dead blades do have some dark speckling that I didn't find on the healthy grass clippings:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ol9Is.jpg"" alt=""close-up of dead blades""></p>

<p>The speckles have a sort of faint graphite appearance - medium gray and slightly shiny. They're very small, and vary in density; some leaves have a few, and some leaves are completely covered.</p>

<p>Per @Bamboo's feedback, I looked around for insects, and I did discover numerous <a href=""http://bugguide.net/node/view/251478/bgimage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">big-eyed bugs</a>. I couldn't find any chinch bugs, but per the article that @Bamboo linked to, big-eyed bugs prey on chinch bugs. Maybe that explains why the patch seems to have slowed its growth? Maybe the chinch bugs came first and did their damage to the St. Augustine grass, and now the big-eyed bugs are clearing out the chinch bugs?</p>

<p>Per @ondoteam's feedback, I should also note that I don't have the best lawn care habits; I do mow on a pretty regular schedule, but not as frequently as I should (every 3 weeks during the growing season). I mow very high - about 3.5 to 4 inches, as I understand that improves root growth - but I'm reading now that that's about an inch too high.</p>

<p>I can't control the temperature or humidity, and I can probably only have a limited effect on the poor soil drainage, but it sounds like I need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>mow more frequently (weekly, at least during the growth season)</li>
<li>confirm the ideal grass height</li>
<li>dethatch (I own a light-duty electric dethatcher, so I'll give that a shot)</li>
<li>aerate (I can rent a power aerator at Home Depot)</li>
<li>keep the mower blade sharp (I just sharpened it, but that was the first time in a couple of years)</li>
</ul>

<p>Anything else I should do? Will the big-eyed bugs serve to limit further damage from the chinch bugs? Should I just let them roam uncontrolled? It seems likely now that the damage was due to chinch bugs, but since the damage has slowed/stopped, and I'm currently seeing only big-eyed bugs, is it safe to assume that I can bypass pesticide treatment for the chinch bugs?</p>

<p>Thanks for all the feedback!</p>
","<p>At first glance, it looks like a slime mould problem, which does make the blades of grass look ashy and white, but you say it's killing the grass because you can pull it out easily, and slime mould doesn't kill grass. The other thing that springs to mind is an insect infestation in the grass, but I'm in the UK, so the only one I can find that might be causing the problem where you are is Chinch bugs, which particularly like St. Augustine lawns, and would cause the grass to die. Checking whether it's those or not is not easy, you need to get down on the grass and have a look for small insects moving about. There's another bug that's beneficial though, the 'big eyed bug' which you don't want to kill because they predate on chinch bugs, and the two can be confused - here's a link I found at Discover Entomology at Texas A&amp;M that might be useful to help you determine whether it's those or not:</p>

<p><a href=""https://insects.tamu.edu/extension/publications/epubs/e-420.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://insects.tamu.edu/extension/publications/epubs/e-420.cfm</a></p>

<p>There's only one picture there of an affected lawn, and it does look a similar colour to your dying patches. I'm much better at gardening than I am at technology, so I'm hoping someone will turn that address into a proper link - I just Googled 'insect infestation causing dead, ashy patches on St. Augustine grass in Texas' and that's how I found the information.</p>

<p>UPDATED ANSWER: I would have expected you to find some chinch bugs if they really were the problem - in that link above, if you read all of it, it does tell you to do something with an old coffee can to test whether it's chinch bugs or not, and I'd certainly do it, because it may not be chinch after all. The other alternative possible problem is white grub - the link below does mention them, though isn't hugely informative as to how to detect them other than giving symptoms, which do fit with your problem.</p>

<p>Looks like the best time to treat for white grub is July, so you may have missed the window of opportunity, but have a good read and see what you think. Recommendations for treatments included in the links.</p>

<p>Otherwise, Google white grub on St. Augustine grass, Texas - there are other links. One thing you will note is that, with either of these problems, dead thatch in the grass isn't good, because it encourages these problems and prevents any treatments you use being so effective. Which means you will need to do more lawn maintenance than you've been doing, in particular dethatching or scarifying, which I think is called 'vertical mowing' in your part of the world. </p>

<p>This is normal for many plants, not just parsley. To prevent it, you'll need to come up with a way to block the worst of the wind. Also, harvesting the oldest leaves first (the ones emerging from the outside of the rosette) will keep the plant growing, and keep the leaves fresh. There won't be as many blemished or yellowing leaves, and the plant will produce much more than if the plant is harvested all at once, even if allowed to regrow.</p>

<li><p>Transplant them to my main garden area for a real potato harvest later.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how realistic this is... I suspect this would basically amount to harvesting the (likely small/immature?) potatoes, and planting them anew in my garden.  At this point, I may as well buy some actual seed potatoes, right?</p></li>

","<ol>
<li><p>Organic probably isn't well-correlated with whether the potatoes are carrying any disease or not. This is the primary reason that you want good potato seed stock, whether conventional or organic. I've grown my own organic potatoes and had them get full of blight, but was still able to harvest some edible potatoes. While they were edible (and probably would have been marketable if I were selling), they would <em>not</em> be something you'd want to save for seed.</p></li>
<li><p>Letting them be probably wouldn't do much harm. It's up to you if you want to deal with the hassle of adding to the pile while the potatoes are growing there. I've heard of plenty of people growing potatoes under straw, so they don't <em>need</em> soil. They look pretty healthy to me, and will probably give you some tasty taters.</p></li>

I know that a number of plants are light-cycle dependent as far as their determination of when they should bloom.  </p>

<p>What is the optimum light-cycle for basil and rosemary to grow vegetatively without me having to worry with pinching flowers back? </p>
","<p>I can answer only the question for basil.</p>

<p>If you wish to avoid flowering, the optimum light-cycle for basil is in the neighborhood of twelve hours. <a href=""http://www.florifacts.umn.edu/mnfgbulletins/July%202002%20Bulletin/Daylength%20and%20flowering.pdf"">Research at the University of Minnesota</a> has identified basil as a <em>facultative long-day plant</em>, that is long days, or more accurately short nights, encourage flowering. Short nights are, however, not <em>required</em> for flowering. For example, water stress (over or under watering) can often push basil into flower. Hence setting your artificial lighting to run for twelve hours daily will at least not encourage flowering. Also, make sure that you put the plants where they receive little stray light at night. A night that is interrupted by a bright light is interpreted by most plants as two short nights, and, in basil's case, this will push it to flower.</p>

<p>Since rosemary blooms in the spring, initiation of flowering likely to be more complicated. A mature rosemary will have buds ready to bloom as it heads into winter. Cool temperatures may be required for flowering, but day length (night length) may also play a part.  I have not seen any research, and, when I have brought rosemary inside during the winter, it has bloomed.</p>

"How can I propagate mint?","2612","","<p>I bought some mint twigs from the supermarket, and I needed only a few leaves. The rest of it was surplus, and I didn't want to throw it away. Knowing that mint is an invasive plant, I assumed it was hard to kill and could reproduce from basically any part of it, so I tried to put the twigs in water to see if they would produce roots. After three days, most of the twigs appear to be dry and dead. A small number of them, however, till have some leaves that appear healthy, so I still have hope. No roots though.</p>

<p>I have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this a possible way to propagate mint?</li>
<li>How do you get mint, considering that the plant does not give seeds? I know that you can look for runners somewhere, but I don't know where, to be honest.</li>
</ol>
","<p>Mint is typically propagated, as you correctly say, by runners (or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">stolons</a>). Stolons are longish horizontal parts of the stem that can either grow along the surface or underground and connect two vertical stems. Here's a picture of a mint stolon from <a href=""http://botany.0catch.com/mint0.html#3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this site</a> </p>

<p><sub>(I'll replace this with pictures from my plant when I get the time).</sub><br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/56Akqm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>It's the stolons that have the ability to put out both shoots (upward stems) and roots from the nodes. The upright stems do not have this ability and so if you only have mint stems from the grocery store, they're probably never going to grow roots. </p>

<p>The reason that you saw some of them remain fresh is because the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">xylem</a>, which is the plant tissue responsible for upward water transport, might've still been alive and hence would've been transporting water to the leaves via capillary action. However, it cannot sustain itself this way, and without a corresponding upward transport from the roots, the capillary pull cannot balance the water loss from transpiration in the leaves and eventually they'll dry. Slowly, but surely.</p>

<p>I've not tried to get a stolon to root in water, however, I wouldn't be surprised if it did, although it's not really a common way of growing it. To propagate it effectively, you need a good section with a bit of root (not necessary though), part of the stolon (a must) and some shoots with leaves (to nourish the plant when it's establishing itself). Although highly uncommon, some varieties are propagated by seed.</p>

<hr>

<p>Regarding its invasiveness, you can contain mint by growing it in a pot. That way, eventually it will get root bound, which then determines its maximum size.

"Why are my tomatoes cracking and what can I do?","2607","","<p>(Memphis, TN. Zone 7)</p>

<p>First garden. I'm growing tomatoes in two parts of the yard. One gets more sun than the other: the partially-shaded area is producing well, but in the the sun-baked area they're cracking before they can fully ripen. Cucumbers, okra and peppers grow fantastically in these same beds, but I suspect the tomatoes are just not getting enough water. I've tried watering the hell out of them, but still, no dice.</p>

<p>Some have tiny spots, as well as cracks.</p>

<p>There are also hundreds of little flying bugs, tiniest things I've ever seen. (Searching this site, they look like whiteflies.) I don't use anything artificial, pesticides, etc. It's possible birds are getting in there, too.</p>

<p>Several tomatoes have actually rotted on the vine and fallen off as mush. :(</p>

<p><img src=""https://s30.postimg.org/7juuwrl81/20150819_135242.jpg"" alt="""">

<p>The tomatoes in the back yard, partially-shaded, have none of these problems. The plants are also smaller. Those are romas and grape tomatoes, though; I don't remember what kind the problem tomatoes are.</p>

<p>The soil in both areas is a mixture of dirt and compost (chicken &amp; rabbit manure mixed with dried leaves and pine shavings) that had ""cooked down"" over last fall and winter (with my chickens scratching at it.) It was black gold by the time it went into the beds, so I don't think it's a nutritional deficiency, but maybe?</p>

<p>What can I do? Should I partially shade them? Is it just a bad spot? They're beautiful tomatoes until they crack, I'm so disappointed!</p>
","<p>Cracking tomatoes happens when the (almost) ripe fruit expands and the skin can't hold up any more. (A bit like stretch marks...)</p>

<p>There are a few causes that <em>typically</em> lead to different crack patterns, but sometimes it's a bit non-conclusive, so I won't go into detail.</p>

<ul>
<li>Excess water, especially after a drought - water as consistantly as possible, protect plants from rain.</li>
<li>Excess fertilizer late in the season - fertilize early, reduce or stop when fruits start to ripen.</li>
<li>Temperature differences, especially in fall or when wet fruit are exposed to full sun - consider some kind of a cover, but remember that high humidity leads to fungal diseases, so ensure good ventilation. </li>
</ul>

<p>A cracked tomato is actually fine for the kitchen - if you pick and use it asap. The wound is an open door for mold spores, as you noticed.</p>

"Does mixing ash with your potting soil make a difference?","2598","","<p>I always have some ash left in the barbecue. Would mixing it in the potting soil be a good or a bad thing for my pot plants? The ash is only from charcoal so nothing nasty in it.</p>
","<p>It will definitely make a difference if you add enough, but probably not a useful one.</p>

<p>Ash is high in potash (compounds of potassium) and usually also high in calcium salts. This invariably raises the pH of soil. Ash unfortunately does not contain nitrogen, which is a more important plant nutrient than potassium.</p>

<p>Given that potassium is the third major plant and crop nutrient after nitrogen and phosphorus, ash is an excellent fertiliser in cases where you have a potassium deficiency and/or soil that is too acidic.</p>

<p>I wouldn't use it in potting mix because usually potting mix, by definition, already contains optimal nutrients to nurture young plants. I would consider using the ash for other purposes in the garden. There are several, given the key properties of ash, but I won't go into that here.</p>

"How do I know when and how much to aerate my lawn?","2584","","<p>I have a section of my lawn which seems prone to standing water, grass that doesn't grow very quickly, and seems very hard-packed. I think it's probably in desperate need of aeration.</p>

<p>What is the proper way to know when and how much to aerate? Also, since I have a small lawn, is there such a thing as a small lawn aerator and will it get the job done?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>As it turns out, there <em>is</em> a small aerator, like this one:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xuhPq.jpg"" alt=""Green hand aerator""></p>

<p>I purchased one recently and it works rather well. Obviously not a good choice for a sizable lawn, but for my small lawn this worked extremely well. I'm seeing some improvement already in the grass gradually becoming more green.</p>
","<p><strong>How</strong> to aerate is covered by the other answers, but as for how to know if you need areation:</p>

<p>If you can easily sink a spade into your soil down to the handle, it doesn't need to be aerated.  If you have to force the spade into the ground and/or pound it with a hammer, your soil needs to be aerated.</p>

<p>The other sign that aeration is needed is if water isn't draining into the soil properly (which it sounds like you have).  If you have lots of puddles after a rainstorm, you probably need the soil aerated.</p>

"What is the maximum number of trusses for a tomato plant?","2578","","<p>I have 6 tomato plants of different varieties grown in planters outdoors. I have heard that there is a recommended limit to the number of trusses (bunches of fruit or number of branches bearing fruit) on a plant after which you should crop the top of the plant. I believe this is to focus growth on the remaining fruit.</p>

<p>Is this correct? What is the number of bunches/branches I should limit my plants to?</p>
","<p>The ""recommended limit"" depends on who you talk to. I think it comes down to how obsessed you want to be with managing your tomatoes.</p>

<p>In ""<a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/331/how-should-i-prune-my-vine-tomatos"">How should I prune my vine tomatos?</a>"", there's a video in which they suggest you should limit growth to the main branch and one sucker.</p>

<p>In one of Eliot Coleman's books, he talks about growing a single vine up to the roof supports in his greenhouse (8' high).</p>

<p>In my Garden Way book on tomatoes, the author is skeptical of any pruning at all. (Too much work for not enough additional yield.) Instead he is in favor of ""topping"" if the plants get too ""dense and green"". This involves snipping out some vines with shears or slashing some off with a sickle.</p>

<p>My personal experience is that pruning helps. Also, <a href=""http://www.foogod.com/~torquill/barefoot/weave.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">staking + weaving</a> works better than caging. I'm a pruner (not obsessively -- sometimes I get behind), and I've found that it's easier to prune staked tomatoes than caged tomatoes. Sometimes they get out of control, and I still get a crop. The year that I had an 8' high wall of tomato plants was probably my lowest yielding year -- I did almost no pruning and the vines were out of control, all veg/no fruit. This year I aggressively pruned my staked cherry tomatoes and it looks like we're going to have an excellent crop. Lastly, the combination of wider spacing between plants and regular pruning helps with air circulation and keeps down disease.</p>

"Why is my Japanese painted fern struggling?","2567","","<p>I bought a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athyrium_niponicum"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Japanese painted fern</a> several weeks ago. It was on the store's ""reduced price"" shelf, so it wasn't in perfect shape, but I figured I could try to nurse it back to health.</p>

<p>So far, though, it seems to be struggling. All but one of the original fronts have died off. It does have five new fronds emerging, two of which are nearly 6"" long at this point, but now one of those seems to be starting to fade as well, only about a week after emerging.</p>

<p>The environment the plant's been living in thus far is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>I live in an apartment with only north-facing windows. It's been positioned about 6-8 feet from a north-facing window.</li>
<li>When I got the plant, I moved it into a very generic orange clay pot, with a 50/50 perlite / peat moss mix.</li>
<li>I've been watering the plant until water just barely starts to drain from the bottom every five days. I do dump any excess water out of the saucer, so it hasn't just been sitting in there.</li>
<li>It's being grown indoors, so the temperature has been between 73 and 78 degrees (F) the entire time it's been with me. I have made sure not to position it near any central air vents.</li>
<li>The area I live in is (relatively speaking) quite dry. According to some weather statistics online, the average relative afternoon humidity in August is only 23%.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a picture of my plant:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XxQGZ.jpg"" alt=""My Japanese painted fern""></p>

<p>Over the past several weeks, I've tried moving the plant closer or farther away from the window, as well as watering it a bit more or less frequently, but nothing seems to change the fact that it's slowly fading away.</p>

<p>I have read that this type of fern is deciduous, so I wasn't too worried about the old fronds dying, but now that the new ones are having trouble as well I'm wondering what I need to change in order to make my plant thrive.</p>
","<p>Firstly, the 50/50 peat moss perlite mix contains absolutely <strong>zero</strong> nutrients. That means the plant isn't getting the building blocks necessary to grow. Start fertilizing with your watering every other week, with a balanced fertilizer. Miracle-Gro is fine. That may not be the best mix for a fern (it isn't, actually), and I'd repot it into something more suitable, as soon as possible. Even a pre-fertilized bagged <em>potting</em> mix will do (not a seed-starting mix-I've had people mix them up before).</p>

<p>You may not be watering enough. Ferns don't like drying out. make sure the soil is thoroughly moist after each watering, and don't let it dry out completely between waterings. Only the top 1/2 inch of mix should dry out.</p>

<p>Humidity is another big thing for ferns. They like as much humidity as they can get. being indoors makes it even worse. Try setting the plant on a tray of pebbles, filled with water. You can also mist the plant every day.</p>

<p>Japanese painted ferns aren't really houseplants, and although they will live in a large pot, the best spot for them is a shady corner of a garden, enriched with plenty of organic matter. It may not be very long-lived as a houseplant. Because you're in an apartment, you'll either have to do your best indoors, or give it to someone with a garden.</p>

When the grass grows through the mulch the roots are a lot shallower, and there's less of it.  Because the roots are shallower, and because the soil underneath is moister, pulling grass without harming the plants around it becomes a lot easier.

","<p>Excessive fertilization almost definitely. You shouldn't need to fertilize a plant for a while. Doing so will destabilize the soil conditions. Once a week is too often. Start with once a month but not until needed. Then as it gets larger, move to every 2 weeks but still only as needed which means it may vary (see bottom of post).</p>

<p><em>Also, as noted by Shule in the comments, the NPK ratio ought to be more balanced or in favor of slightly higher potassium. Potassium typically correlates to food for the fruits ie peppers in this case. I would recommend a light 1-1-1 fertilizer to start and again, not until necessary.</em></p>

<p>I'd recommend doing a water flush of about 2-3 times what you would normally do, stop all fertilization and wait a week. Depending on how much water the plant needs based on sun/heat, provide enough to keep it satisfied after flushing but not too much.</p>

<p>Do you need to be using Pyrethrum Spray? Reduce the amount/frequency by 50% if the pests are a problem, bump it up to 75% (of what your currently doing).</p>

<p>These things grow out in the wild in all sorts of varying conditions and they do just fine. The less you do and the less you deviate from nature, the better.</p>

<p>Container gardening can be tricky because roots cant extend as far as they normally would and are instead subjected to pretty much the same conditions uniformly. Typically you'll have a much easier time if you use a larger container with more soil. Larger = less susceptible to destabilization.</p>

"Can leaves absorb light from below as easily as from above?","2527","","<p>I'm considering trying to improve my indoor herb growing.  It seems that under certain conditions, one could easily run strings of LED lights at the soil surface, which would allow for the plants to grow tall without the complexity of an overhead support structure.  Plus, I think it would look pretty cool.</p>

<p>My question is: can you grow small plants with the lighting coming from below the leaves? (assuming that the lighting is bright enough within the bands that chlorophyll will absorb).  I would think this would affect the plant's growth pattern; has anyone here tried this, or found records of those who have?</p>
","<p>Lighting a plant from beneath will cause the plant to grow towards the light, ergo, downwards, if it grows at all. Phototropism is the name of the process induced by lighting or sunlight from above - the plant wants to maximise the amount of light it receives, and therefore grows up towards the light. If you place the light to one side, the plant will virtually grow sideways; you can see this in the wild or even in a garden, where plants are perhaps covered by a dense canopy above, or planted much too close to a fence, and therefore produce growth that is reaching forward, almost sideways, groping towards the brightest area. I'm afraid your suggestion simply won't work in terms of growth, but if you want to use small leds at the base of plants for purely decorative reasons for short periods, that should be fine.</p>

<p>UPDATE IN RESPONSE TO COMMENTS:</p>

<p>I'm not going to reproduce a full botanical lecture here, but will add a little more info. Light is one of the most important things controlling plant growth; plants have a set of photo receptor proteins, four of which have been identified so far. Photosensors in particular detect the presence, strength, colour and direction of a light source, and that information is used to dictate <em>direction of growth</em> (phototropism), which is the most relevant for the question asked. There's also proteins called phototropins which are activated by the presence of uv/blue light wavelengths, and these too are involved in directional growth, although they're also involved in directing chloroplasts in order to maximise photosynthesis, plus one or two other twiddly bits. It's quite a complicated, synergistic picture, but simply put, your plants ain't gonna grow well without the proper wavelengths of light placed at an optimum distance <em>above</em> your plants. Simply put, you could view leaves as solar panels, angling their upper surfaces to catch the light they need.</p>

<p>In terms of whether light placed beneath 24/7 will affect plant growth, depends on the plant, frankly - some plants are more responsive to certain wavelengths of light, and many plants need some hours of darkness. And yes, it is logical to assume that the plant will grow towards the strongest source of light, provided that particular light gives the right wavelengths and spectrum.</p>

It's easy, it's fun (my oldest son and kids in our street think I'm some kind of mad scientist, while my youngest son just wants to drink it), and I've personally noticed benefits in my garden from using it on a regular bases. The below quote comes from <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/1390/whats-an-organic-way-to-discourage-crabgrass-from-a-large-lawn/1391#1391"">this answer</a> here on SE.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>I make 5 gallons of compost tea each week (from late Spring to earlier Autumn ""Fall"") and apply the 5 gallon batch to the front garden one week, then the following week apply a new fresh 5 gallon batch to the back garden. I repeat that cycle for the period given previously. I have been doing this for 2 years now, and without question I have noticed a massive increase in worm activity eg lots of worm castings on the surface of the soil.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>I spread the 5 gallons of Compost Tea via a watering-can over approx 1800ft² (170m²). Lawn area is about the same front &amp; back for me. So one week the front lawn gets treated, then the following week the back lawn gets treated, repeat, repeat...</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Rightly or wrongly, below is the method I've used for the past 2 years (with success) and will continue to use, or at least until I'm told I am doing it wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Stuff you need:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>5 gallon (19 Litre) bucket - bought new and is used for nothing else.</p></li>
<li><p>Stirring stick (used for nothing else) - basically a clean, thin but sturdy piece of wood, about 2 to 3 feet (600 to 900mm) long.</p></li>
<li><p>Molasses ""Unsulfured"" - personally I spend a little bit more and go with an organic product.</p></li>
<li><p>Compost (I use my own homemade compost) - can be homemade or bought, the important thing is, it's ""good"" quality, aged compost.</p></li>
<li><p>Earthworm Castings (I buy locally) or a product like, <a href=""http://www.drearth.com/products/organic-soils/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dr. Earth Organic Planting Mix</a>. </p></li>
<li><p><del>Old stockings or tights, or buy the cheapest ones you can find.</del></p></li>
<li><p>Watering can - do not use one that you put any kind of chemicals in.</p></li>
<li><p>Funnel (used for nothing else) - large enough to allow easy transfer of the (finished) compost tea from the 5 gallon bucket to the watering can.</p></li>
<li><p>Materials bought from aquarium shop/outlet:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Aquarium pump - powerful enough to run the system you decide to set-up. I think the smallest pump my local aquarium shop sold was rated at ""20 or 30 gallons"" (76 or 114 Litre), but for only $2 to $3 more I decided to go with a slightly more powerful ""40 gallon (151 Litre) pump"".</p></li>
<li><p>Gang valve - 3 way.</p></li>
<li><p>3 Bubblers.</p></li>
<li><p>10 feet (3000mm) of tubing.</p></li>
<li><p>A reusable (fine) netted bag - after going through a few pairs of cheap stockings/tights, seeing as they're only good for one brewing process, I figured there must be a better way. I spoke with my local aquarium shop about my ""peculiar"" requirements, in fact they were fascinated by what I was doing, they suggested and got hold of a ""reusable (fine) netted bag"". I've now been using that bag for the past 18 months.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<p><strong>How I make compost tea (for use on my lawn, but I will occasionally give a plant a small amount, if it looks like it could do with a little pick me up):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I've set-up a small area in my garage where I make (brew) my compost tea. It's out of direct sunlight and protected from other outdoor elements eg Rain.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Keeping the brewing process out of direct sunlight will prevent it from heating up too much. Too much heat can cause the (beneficial) organisms that you're trying to stimulate (wake up, make perform their magic) to slow down.</p></li>
<li><p>Keeping the brewing process protected from other outdoor elements greatly decreases the possibility of ""foreign"" bodies, elements, etc from entering the compost brew.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course the brewing process can easily be performed outdoors if located in a shady area and some kind of enclosed brewing system is set-up.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Connect up the aquarium pump, 3-way gang valve, 3 bubblers and tubing (see photo below). When doing this, ensure each bubbler is connected to tubing that is long enough to reach the bottom of the 5 gallon (19 Litre) bucket - 2ft (600mm) of tubing should be long enough.</p></li>
<li><p>On a Wednesday morning fill the 5 gallon (19 Litre) bucket with 4 to 4&#189; gallons (15 to 17 Litre) of cold water.</p></li>
<li><p>Place the 3 bubblers into the water so that they sit at the bottom of the bucket, then turn on the pump. I let this run for 24 hours. <strong>Why?</strong> The air circulating through the water will remove (blow off) the chlorine, and you want that to occur so there's no chlorine left in the water to possibly effect (harm, kill) the beneficial organisms you add later.</p></li>
<li><p>On a Thursday morning mix together &#189; gallon (2 Litre) of sieved compost and &#189; gallon (2 Litre) of sieved earthworm castings.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Place that mixture into the reusable (fine) netted bag ie Basically make a giant tea-bag.</p></li>
<li><p>Then add the bag to the (chlorine free) water in the bucket.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Measure out 1fl oz (30ml) of Molasses ""Unsulfured"".</p>

<ul>
<li>Pour that into the (chlorine free) water in the bucket.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>With the stirring stick, give the mixture a good stir.</p>

<ul>
<li>Then for the next 2 to 3 days go out there 3 or 4 times a day and give it a ""quick"" stir.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Saturday, after 2 days of brewing (minimum) or Sunday, after 3 days of brewing (considered the perfect brewing period for the recipe I use) go out there and turn off the pump.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Remove the 3-way gang valve, bubblers, bag from the bucket, so you're just left with the bucket and its freshly brewed contents ie Compost tea.</p></li>
<li><p>Immediately transfer the compost tea to the watering can with the help of the funnel. The below point explains why it's best to use the compost tea immediately or within 1 hour to ensure maximum benefits are reaped from the brewing process.</p></li>
<li><p>Compost tea doesn't store well, mainly because without air being constantly feed through it, it will become <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">anaerobic</a> and eventually start to smell. Also the (beneficial) organisms will become inactive due to lack of food after 3 days of brewing, they've pretty much used up the 1fl oz (30ml) of Molasses ""Unsulfured"" originally added for their benefit.</p></li>
<li><p>With the watering can in hand, I slowly walk my lawn while allowing a small amount of compost tea to flow onto the grass as I walk in a pattern that ensures I cover my lawn the best I can.</p></li>
<li><p>Once all the compost tea has been poured onto my lawn (1 week the front garden, the following week the back garden, then repeat the cycle), I get the bag with the compost and earthworm castings mixture and place that mixture around any plants in my garden that look like they could do with a little pick me up.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, clean up everything with clean cold water.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Then the following Wednesday (after 2 or 3 days rest) I start the whole process allover again.</p></li>

<li><p>""Good"" quality compost doesn't really smell, apart from having a very slight earthy smell.</p></li>
<li><p>Earthworm castings also don't really smell, apart from having a very slight earthy smell.</p></li>
<li><p>Compost tea doesn't (shouldn't) really smell, apart from a having very slight, sweet, earthy smell.</p></li>

"Adding clay soil to compost","2515","","<p>I just started composting (again). I added a bunch of greens to a big bin, and then I added some soil.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, I was uprooting a bunch of grass for a vegetable bed, and without thinking, I threw a bunch of clay/grass into the compost bin. Actually, it's now <em>half full</em> of heavy clay.</p>

<p>Is this a mistake -- will this prohibit or inhibit the decomposition? Should I remove it? It's terribly difficult to mix it as is.</p>

<p>Also, I saw a couple of worms in the compost bin. In the future, should I add them if I see them, or leave them in the real soil? (My bin is covered.)</p>
","<p>The clay itself isn't going to break down due to decomposition because it is made up primarily of inorganic material - minerals and such.</p>

<p>If you plan on doing the lazy compost method, where you pile organic material up and forget about it, then it won't much matter if there's clay other than the fact that you'll have a lot of clay in that pile. Eventually, the organic material will break down, though you may find that weed seeds prosper in that environment because it is unlikely to heat up enough to kill them off.  That's a big mess to deal with.  Not worth the long-term hassle in my opinion.</p>

<p>If you plan on do the actively-involved compost method, where you turn the pile and ensure it is moist and encourage aerobic decomposition, then if there's a lot of clay, you may grow to hate turning the pile and it will likely revert back to the ""lazy compost"" pile that doesn't heat up much.  And there you are with a pile of clay and eventually some rich material veins running through it (and likely weeds).</p>

<p>On our farm, I've thrown clay clods along with weeds and turf into a pile along with horse manure and it has heated up just fine but I'd still hate to turn that by hand. I pick it up with the tractor bucket and toss it that way (it's easy when you can just scoop it up and dump it with machinery) but in my compost bins that are made of pallets I avoid putting clay in it if I can because I actively turn these with my pitchfork and as much as I love a farm workout, clay is (as you said) heavy and I lose my gusto for the turning.</p>

<p>My recommendation is to remove as much of the clay as you can from the pile. It'll break down much faster that way.  It will be a pain to deal with it once rather than a pain to deal with multiple times.</p>

<p>With regard to the worms - if it heats up considerably (which is what you want), they will move away from that heat down into the cooler areas.  I'm assuming your bin is on the ground and isn't one of those tumbler types.  If it is a tumbler, the worms will die if it happens to heat up enough and they have nowhere to go.</p>

"What are the advantages and disadvantages of using soil blocks?","2507","","<p>I recently read a book that suggests using soil blocks for starting seeds. What are the advantages and disadvantages of soil blocks over the more popular seed starting methods? I am mainly interested in using the seed blocks to start vegetables.</p>
","<p>Probably the biggest disadvantage of using soil blocks is the up-front cost. If you want to get the biggest advantage, you'll want to have the ability to transplant from smaller blocks to larger blocks. For example, you'd start tomatoes in 2"" blocks and then transplant up to 4"" blocks. I've seen a number of people recommend the little tongs/tweezers, which would be an extra expense. (I don't own them, but I could see how they might make handling blocks a bit faster.) Buying all of these tools (3/4"", 2"", 4"", tongs) at once will probably cost $200 or more.</p>

<p>A minor disadvantage is that all of the soil block recipes I've seen use peat. (I'd like to reduce my use of peat for sustainability purposes, but I'm hoping that reducing the use of plastic planting containers is a net gain.)</p>

<p>You'll want to mix your own potting soil. (I do this anyway, so there's no net change for me.) I suppose that you may be able to buy pre-mixed block soil, but it's fairly easy to do and you get to have control over the ingredients.</p>

<p>You'll want to set up a good watering system. I've done a couple of seasons of blocks without a good watering system, but I'm working on something for the upcoming planting season. The two problems related to watering are: (1) spraying the blocks with a hand sprayer is tedious and could lead to problems with fungal disease, and (2) if you pour water into the tray with a watering can (i.e. so that the stream of water makes contact with the blocks as you pour), you'll erode the blocks. Setting the blocks on a mesh screen so you can bottom-water seems like it will be ideal. I'm calling this a ""drawback"" because it's yet another bit of upfront setup you have to deal with.</p>

<p>It's not <em>really</em> a drawback, but I find that when I get in the groove of making blocks I will enthusiastically make a <em>lot</em> of blocks and then end up with a few too many plants. (A sure symptom of this is when you catch your friends saying, ""Quick! Hide, he's going to try to give us some more lettuce in those weird little dirt bricks!"")</p>

<p>Lastly, there's a learning curve: consistently making good blocks takes some practice. You've got to get the hang of mixing the soil to the proper consistency and then form the blocks correctly. It's not <em>difficult</em>, but it does take a bit of practice.</p>

<p>Benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>No containers.
<ul>
<li>This reduces an ongoing cost and hassle.</li>
<li>There's nothing to clean, nothing to throw away.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It's a big time saver.
<ul>
<li>Once you get the hang of making blocks, you can make a lot of blocks very quickly. (Don't be discouraged by your first couple of block making sessions. Stick with it and it will work out.)</li>
<li>""Potting up"" is really fast. Just drop the small block into the big block. No pricking out, no trying to squeeze plants out of little plastic containers.</li>
<li>Transplanting into the garden is really fast for the same reason.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can make efficient use of space: if you use a heating mat, you can put a whole mess of 3/4"" blocks onto the mat to germinate the seeds and then ""pot up"" the 3/4"" blocks into 2"" blocks.</li>
<li>It's gentler on the plants.
<ul>
<li>No root shock when transplanting.</li>
<li>Plants don't get root bound. The roots will be air pruned when they reach the edge of the blocks.</li>
<li>No pricking out, no squeezing/pulling plants out of containers.</li>
<li>Avoiding all that shock keeps plants growing steadily without setbacks. In theory this should give you higher quality plants that mature faster and yield better.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The block makers from Ladbrooke are high quality tools. I think that with proper care they're likely to last a lifetime.</li>
</ul>

<p>My suggestion to get started slowly would be to start with the 1.5"" or 2"" blocks. These are good for starting a large variety of plants: spinach, lettuce, broccoli, cabbage, etc. Then you can add either the 3/4"" blocks if you want to be able to germinate larger numbers of seeds at once, or the 4"" blocks if you want to be able to start plants that should be potted up to a larger size before transplanting in the garden (e.g. tomatoes, peppers) or those that are large to begin with (e.g. melons, pumpkins).</p>

<p>By the way: an old cookie sheet can hold about 300 3/4"" blocks, and 35 2"" blocks.</p>

"Why are leaves falling off of my Prickly Pear cactus?","2491","","<p>I just moved into a new home in Phoenix, AZ, and now have a lot of cacti to tend to.  I do not know their care history, or how much/how often they are watered.</p>

<p>One of the largest Prickly Pear cacti is dropping its leaves (pads?) at a seemingly high rate.  Is this a sign of over watering, under watering, a lack of pruning, or something else entirely?  Some of the pads look wrinkled, which I'm told can mean either over or under-watering.</p>

<p>This most recent break (the one pictured here) occurred about 24 hours ago.</p>
","<p>My experience with the prickly pears I have here in Texas (natives and cultivars) is that the wrinkling is typically due to under-watering. The seed pods (tunas) will also wither in low water conditions (I have yet to get my own tunas). Under-watered pads will appear thin. Over-watered are going to appear fat. I have yet to over-water prickly pears.
I don't think it is possible in a well draining soil.</p>

<p>I also see structural failure - groups of pads falling off. In my cases it is due to overgrowth. Overgrowth like this is probably quite natural - pads will readily grow as new plants - they're by far the easiest cuttings I've tried. Ie. pads get broken off or ""branches"" break, put out roots, and you have a new plant!</p>

<p>You also have corking which indicates some age, although I've seen this on some varieties after only a year or two. I don't think I've seen spotty corking like you have though. I don't think it is due to disease (the rest of the plant looks fine). Could be due to sunlight watering, or insect bites in the distant past (the cork would be a natural healing response).</p>

<p>re. pads or leaves. Botanically speaking, the pads are actually elongated stems. The true leaves are the spines!</p>

"Young avocado plant has brown spots spreading on leaves","2471","","<p>I have been growing in my flat an Avocado plant sprouted from a seed in December.
It developed well, up until about a month ago, but then brown dots started forming on the leaves, the oldest leaves first and spreading to the newest.
The dots start small on the edges and very quickly spread over the leaf, until the leaf dries out and the plant discards it.</p>

<p>Below I put an example. The first picture was taken last Sunday, when the leaf started showing the spots. The second picture was taken today, three days later, showing the progression of the spots.
Usually it takes about two weeks for the leaf to be dropped by the plant.</p>

<p>At first I blamed this on dry air caused by the central heating (In the picture you see a radiator, but that's just where I put the plant now that the radiators are off. During winter it was in a different position.).
The plant now is next to a window open most of the day, so the air shouldn't be as dry, but still the spots returned.</p>

<p>A second hypothesis I had was high salinity of the water. Tap water here is very hard and reading other articles it seems that there could be a stagnation of salt. To counter this I replaced most of the earth in the vase, but this still didn't stop the leaves from browning.</p>

<p>The plant itself is now down to three leaves, one of which is the one in the pictures above, and the top gem is not showing signs of development, so I'm running out of ideas to save the plant. </p>

<p>Any hints on what might be causing this and how to prevent it from extending to the rest of the plant?</p>

","<p>This leaf is telling me that this guy isn't getting enough nitrogen and that you are using tap water.  Have you fertilized?  Are you using tap water (very high in salts that cause browning of the tips and margins, very common)?  Get a little bottle of OSMOCOTE 14-14-14 it is extended release and the only fertilizer I recommend for newbies and for simplicity.  Go by the directions to the letter.  It looks like he is ready for a bit larger pot.  Use only potting soil and get another clay pot that is 6"" versus the 4"" I am looking at (is that correct)?  No rock or gravel below the soil, get the bottom of your pot off the surface and do not allow the bottom of the pot to sit in the excess water such as in a saucer.  Put thin tiles or chunks or flat stones beneath to put a layer of air beneath the pot and the surface that will enhance drainage.  Definitely needs some fertilizer first and foremost.  Not a lot.  Osmocote will probably only be needed twice a year...like a tsp at first a tablespoon in 8 months in the newer larger pot.  Allow the soil to dry out a bit before watering.  I'd get bottled water and not use the tap water (same for you btw, don't drink the tap water, where do you live)?</p>

","<p><a href=""http://www.asktheexterminator.com/Crickets/Cricket_Control.shtml"">This article</a> talks about prevention:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mow tall grass and weed flower beds. Crickets love tall grasses. If you have tall grasses near or around your house, it's best to keep them trimmed low. Crickets also live in debris. They are attracted to moist, shaded debris, like grass clippings.</p>

<p>Prevention is important because if you kill them (through whatever method mentioned below), they'll just come back unless you destroy their habitat.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomopathogenic_nematode"">Entomopathogenic nematodes</a> are one method of control. Shop for ""nematodes"" and read the label to verify that crickets are targeted by the particular type of nematode in the container. If you have mole crickets, <a href=""http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/nematode/mole_cricket_nematode.htm""><em>Steinernema scapterisci</em></a> will kill them. (See <a href=""http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/lh039"">this article</a> for sources.)</p>

<p>Pyrethroid is a natural (though still toxic; and often only available commercially as a synthetic) poison that may be effective against crickets. Check the label.</p>

<p>If you shop around, you'll find cricket bait available that is listed as suitable for organic production. I presume these are ""safer"" pesticides. Note that, at least on the websites I found, they are not available in several states.</p>

<p>Some of what you find on the internet says that ""natural predators"" will control crickets: birds, toads, etc; you should encourage these predators into your garden. The U Florida extension service article linked above says this isn't effective.</p>

","<p>These are fungi, specifically, Nidulariales, commonly known as cup fungi or birds nest fungi. The little 'eggs' inside are actually spores, though yours look like they may already have dispersed. The cup fungi themselves are just the fruiting bodies of mycelium within the potting soil. Whilst they will not harm your houseplant, the soil it's sitting in does appear to be overly wet, which will not only encourage this type of fungal growth, but more importantly, may also cause your plant to rot. Hopefully, there is a drainage hole in the pot, and you do not leave any water sitting in an outer tray 30 minutes after watering - assuming that's the situation, you should reduce the amount and frequency of watering. Let it dry out between waterings, so water when the surface of the potting soil feels dry to the touch, water thoroughly, let it drain freely and empty out any excess as described.</p>

<p>I'm now wondering whether I can graft my tree with his branches.</p>

<p>If so, which kind of branches I should choose?
Which method of grafting I should use?
Is it the right moment, if not, is it a really bad moment?</p>
","<p><strong>Quick summary</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Improving growing conditions only contributes minimally to your cherry tree's fruit size</li>
<li>Your neighbour's tree has a genetic advantage over your tree in terms of fruit size</li>
<li>You can <em>bud graft</em> a branch from your neighbour's tree onto yours

<ul>
<li>The best time to do this is from July 15 to August 15</li>
<li>Your own tree should have bark that slips easily</li>
<li>The other tree should have mature buds</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grafting the branch from your neighbour's tree should lead to bigger fruit <em>on that branch</em> only</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Just some background</strong></p>

<p>So I have an apple tree in my back garden. I had heard as a child that you could 
graft pear tree branches onto apple trees and forever have a branch that grows pears. Thus, a few days ago, I started researching this. Apparently, most commercially bought apple trees are not grown from seeds but from grafting. That is, someone gets a mature apple tree branch and grafts it onto a small (dwarf) tree. Just so you know for your own research, the tree that you intend to graft another fruit tree onto is known as the <strong>rootstock</strong> whilst the thing that is grafted onto the rootstock is known as the <strong>scion</strong>. For apple and pear trees, the whole process can be simple as making a diagonal cut on the root stock and scion, jamming them together and securing with electrical tape (<em>whip graft</em>).</p>

<p><strong>What type of grafting should I use for cherry trees?</strong></p>

<p>As for cherry trees, you should (according to this <a href=""http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/fruit/grafting-and-budding-fruit-trees/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">useful page</a> from the University of Minnesota) employ <em>budding</em>  which is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a form of grafting in which a single bud is used as the scion rather than a section of stem. It is the most commonly used method for fruit tree production in the nursery, but can also be used for topworking plum, cherry, apricots, and peach as well as young apple and pear trees. (<strong>Cherry, plum, apricot, and peach are not easily cleft grafted or whip grafted.</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for when you should do this...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Budding is done in the summer, usually from July 15 to August 15, when the bark of the stock slips easily and when there are well-grown buds</strong>. The first step is to cut bud sticks of the desired cultivar from strong shoots of the present season's growth (see A in Figure 6). These buds should be mature, as indicated by a slightly brownish color.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>.. which makes your post very timely.</p>

<p>Some fruit trees don't self-pollinate, but it seems like your neighbour's cherry tree doesn't have this problem. </p>

<p><strong>What influences cherry size on different trees?</strong></p>

<p>If you're interested in why your cherry tree has smaller fruit than your neighbours, there's a (free access) <a href=""http://journal.ashspublications.org/content/132/5/697.full"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">paper</a> from the Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science (JASHS) that links the size of your cherries to the number of (mesocarp, i.e., the fleshy bit) cells in a cherry. Let me quote their abstract. I'll also write my interpretation of it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Mesocarp cell number was the major contributor to the differences in fruit equatorial diameter among the five sweet cherry cultivars</strong>. The cultivars fell into three significantly different cell number classes: ≈28 cells, ≈45 cells, and ≈78 cells per radial mesocarp section. Furthermore, <strong>mesocarp cell number was remarkably stable and virtually unaffected by the environment as neither growing location nor physiological factors that reduced final fruit size significantly altered the cell numbers</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Growing conditions don't significantly alter the number of mesocarp cells.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cell length was also significantly different among the cultivars, but failed to contribute to the overall difference in fruit size</strong>. Cell length was significantly influenced by the environment, indicating that cultural practices that maximize mesocarp cell size should be used to achieve a cultivar's fruit size potential.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can increase the size of each cell, but the major influencing factor of cherry growing is the number of mesocarp cells.</p>

<p><strong>Some suggestions</strong></p>

<p>Following the above section, what comes next will probably only have minimal contribution to your cherry tree's fruit size.</p>

<p>You can investigate whether your cherry tree has the right growing conditions. If your neighbour's tree is making nice cherries, its rootstock may cope better with the surrounding soil (in terms of acidity, etc) - in which case, transplanting his cherry branch to yours won't be as useful as you think. Assuming you've not done this, the solution to nicer cherries may be as simple as the application of compost or the adjustment of soil pH.</p>

<p>See this <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/5813/can-i-graft-without-pruning?rq=1"">post</a> for more information on grafting.</p>

<p>Sometimes you hear of people severely cutting back the number of growing fruits so that nutrients are less spread out, giving larger but less fruit. This will probably work to some extent on your cherry tree in conjunction with what is written above...</p>

<p>Typically, when it comes to naming animals and plants, their common names stem from either the name of the person who discovered it, where it was found, or by their attributes. For example, pitcher plants hold water in them, much like a pitcher.</p>

<p>How did the name ""black-eyed susan"" come about? Was it discovered by a blonde lady named Susan who had a black eye at the time, and thought the flower resembled her appearance? Or maybe that it would resemble her if she had a black eye?</p>
","<p>It's said to derive from a British poem (which has also been described as a song) by John Gay, titled 'Black Eyed Susan'. The poem also refers to 'sweet william', which is possibly also the origin of the common name for Dianthus barbatus. Sounds like folklore to me - black eyed susan refers to the almost black eye in the centre of the flower. Why susan, who knows - there's a plant in Britain called Tumbling Ted in the North and Bouncing Bet by those of us living in the south - both refer to Saponaria ocymoides. Which is why I loathe common names, you never know what anyone's talking about...</p>

"How can I control erosion on a steep trail?","2390","","<p>I have a trail about 10' wide going down a hill in the woods behind my house. This particular section has a ~10-15% grade. It receives regular foot, tractor, and log skidding (i.e. behind the tractor) traffic, so there's not much that grows in the pathway (and planting some kind of turf grass won't work). The soil is gravelly under the duff layer. The area receives minimal light since this is going through the woods. The edge of the trail is a mix of brush, saplings, and large trees -- more the latter than the former.</p>

<p>When we get heavy rain, parts of the trail wash out. It can be repaired, but I prefer prevention over cure.</p>

","<p>Suggestion gleaned from <a href=""http://blueandwhitecrew.org/overseerinfo/erosion.php"">here</a>.</p>

<p>You might try some water bars. This is a small trench at an angle (30-40 degrees) to the trail at intervals filled with rocks or a log. These will catch water and shunt it to the sides of the trail so that it will not flow down your path. They also suggest digging drainage ditches along the sides of the trail to catch the water.</p>

<p>Id suggest (partly because they are effective and partly because they are really pretty) forsythia planted along the sides of the ditches to prevent erosion of the sides of the ditches.</p>

<p>Something like mulch or landscape fabric might also be worth considering, but so far it looks like water bars may be your best bet.</p>

","<p>As far as I can remember, pruning the vines of a melon/watermelon/pumpkin, etc, is not only allowed, but even encouraged.<br>

The whole place is very dilapidated, but at least the fence is mine. </p>

<p>How can I effectively prevent this sort of creeping attack and get rid of any nettles permanently?</p>

<p>The solution doesn't need to be particularly organic, and it would be great if there's something I can throw over the fence too*.  </p>

<p><sub>*I mean throw something against the nettles. Something at the neighbor is probably off-topic here :-)</sub></p>
","<p>I don't know what the rules are where you live, but in the UK, we're allowed to cut back and remove anything growing over our boundaries, but it is illegal to treat, damage or pull out any planting outside of our boundaries, so you might want to check where you stand, since your neighbour may well be the type to cause trouble if you're caught mucking about with their 'plants'.</p>

<p>That said, I'd try a strong salt solution - mix a couple of tablespoonfuls of cooking salt or table salt in 2 or 3 litres of warm water, and water on to the base of the plants nearest your fence, and only those nearest. Then clip back anything that's poking through the fence currently. The salt should kill the nettles you apply it to, and prevent anything else growing for some time, because salt in the soil is toxic to most plants. Otherwise, spray with glyphosate - this should kill the nettles after a few treatments, but won't prevent eventual regrowth. Keep your children away from the area until the spray has dried. </p>

<p>UPDATE (in response to Slim's comment): Yep, you're right, and salt isn't usually ever something I'd recommend except possibly on a small area of waste ground. I have tried it once, just to see what happened, in a planted area, by applying it only to one plant, at the base. It killed that plant, but none of the others was affected, so I think you'd have to pretty much broadcast the salt solution to completely poison the soil in an area. I didn't, though, risk planting that spot again till the following spring, so around 5 months and a lot of rain later.</p>

<p>For several years, I had tried to save money by not having landscapers do the annual evergreen trimming.  I can only assume that this is the source of my problems.</p>

<p>To start, I'm not a big fan of the ""manicured"" evergreen look.  With that in mind, is it possible with proper trimming and/or pruning to limit the growth of trees, shrubs, and hedges, or is it just an accepted reality of landscaping that eventually they'll need to be replaced?</p>
","<p>The only way to ""limit"" the growth of a tree / shrub is to prune / trim / hedge the plant.
There is also another possibility but it <strong>may</strong> have the consequences of actually killing off the plant.  That is to dig a hole maybe 1-2 ft around and depth wise for the plant.  Put in some good soil but around this soil fill with clay / rock.  This prohibits the roots from escaping and so the roots stay in place.  But again this has the possibility of killing the plant as the roots get to a point where either water gathers too much / there is no water at all.</p>

<p>The best advice I can give you is to trim / hedge / prune as often as possible, I just trimmed up everything today (mid june).  This way you get the growth of spring (april, may) so all your landscaping plants are ready for a haircut.</p>

<p>By doing this in june you give the plants only about 2-3 months worth of growing (depending on your region, July - August - September).  If you prune / trim too early (end of april, early may) then you will have to do this same task again come august.</p>

<p>One other thing worth looking at is your ratio of compost to the original clay soil.  Clay tends to be very compact...which means that it doesn't drain well.  It can prevent nutrients from getting to your roots as easily when you fertilize.  Also, it can make it hard for the roots to expand.  You need to make sure you allow enough buffer for the roots to grow below and around the original root ball.  I usually try to allow a minimum of 6-8 inches;  12-16 would be better.</p>

","<p>I let them ripen (I've already had quite a crop already from my banana peppers and anaheims - probably my best pre-summer crop ever).</p>

<p>It is true that leaving peppers on the plant might slow further fruit development - so it is often a good idea to start picking the largest fruit when you have a lot forming on the plant. I haven't heard of (or observed) fruit slowing plant growth. It is possible, but I don't think it can be significant.</p>

<p>I usually pick them when they are large and ripe to the point I want them, or if they are in danger of damage. Risk of damage might be due to sun scorching, frost (in early December for me), or the beginnings of grub damage. For the latter it is best to remove the pepper from the plant to be discarded or eaten (chopping the damaged end off can result in an edible pepper - depends on the amount of damage and size of pepper).</p>

"What is this low-growing plant with fuzzy green and gray leaves, and when can I transplant it?","2313","","<p>I found a number of these plants tucked behind peonies, bleeding hearts and other perennials. They're primarily up against my cement foundation, and are growing in clumps. I didn't plant them, but don't know if they're perennial or something that re-seeded. They may have been there in previous years and escaped my notice.</p>

<p>The furry leaves are a combination of green and gray. Each plant is only a few inches high, and the widest are about 8 inches (20 cm) at the base. </p>

<p>I'd appreciate an identification and a bit of information as to what I can expect from them as they grow. If they produce flowers, when will that be? Also, what will they look and smell like? Right now I don't see buds, just pairs of young leaves forming at each center. </p>

<p>They're very pretty and different from anything else I have, so I want to move some to where I can see them. When can I do that? I've heard that a general rule of thumb in transplanting is either well before a plant flowers, or after the flower has gone by. The foliage alone is worth looking at, but if it's saving energy for flowering, I don't want to interrupt the process. </p>

<p>Since they're all in the shade, is that a pre-requisite for optimal growth? I have both shady and sunny areas, so that would be helpful to know. </p>

<p>I live in zone 6. Our average high temperatures in the summer are between 80°F (27°C) and 90°F (32°C), although we usually get a few significantly higher spells. The location of these makes me think they're shielded from that level of heat, but I can't say for sure. I started seeing them just after our last frost, but if they've overwintered, they're hardy well below freezing.  </p>

","<p>It's one of the Stachys, most likely Stachys byzantina, common name Lamb's Ears because of its velvety, furry leaves. There's one called Stachys byzantina 'Silver Carpet' which is good ground  cover but doesn't flower (see link below) but there are others which do flower; 'Cotton Ball' produces spikes of round, silver white bobbles for instance. Hard to say which one this is at this stage, but they do like sun and free draining soil, though in very dry conditions, the leaves may shrivel and dry out. What they loathe, though, is wet in the form of lots of rain, when they'll become a sad and soggy mess.</p>

<p>More information below - in this link its called Stachys lanata, which is what it was previously known as, but this may be more useful information if you're in the States. According to this, the plant 'travels' and doesn't stay where you've planted it (which isn't true at all in the UK - it spreads and may die out a bit where it once was, but essentially it remains in the same area)</p>

<p>If you still think it's worth trying to move one or two to a more visible position, unless you're prepared and able to water daily with a couple of litres after moving now for four weeks or so, it's probably best to wait till the weather cools down as Fall approaches - either that or move them in early spring next year. But there may be a good reason why they're growing where they are - it's probably drier, it's out of rain, and certainly more sheltered up against your house.</p>

"What household wastes can you use to fertilize without composting?","2309","","<p>I cannot compost, no room, no permission. My kitchen produces a steady output of used coffee grounds, which is a <a href=""http://www.sunset.com/garden/earth-friendly/starbucks-coffee-compost-test-00400000016986/"">good slow release nitrogen source (2.3 .06 .6)</a>, should not attract pests or transmit diseases, and used in moderate amounts should not cause problems for plants.  So I figure I should be able to spread used coffee grounds over the garden without composting.</p>

<p>Are there any other typical household waste products that I can use on the garden without composting?</p>
","<h2>Eggshells</h2>

<p>Eggshells can be used uncomposted and relatively mess-free. These provide calcium to plants. As you use eggs, keep the shells in a gallon ziplock bag in your freezer (so they don't stink). Crush the shells as you go along so you can store more in the bag.</p>

<p>When the bag is really full, spread the shells on a cookie sheet and bake on low heat (160F or so -- the lowest setting in your oven) until they're fully dry. I think I left them in for about 40 minutes last time I did this. This might make your kitchen smell a little funky, but it isn't nearly as bad as when someone microwaves leftover fish in the office break room.</p>

<p>When they're dry, put them in a food processor and puree into a powder. This can give off some dust. I do it outside to keep the kitchen clean. You could probably crush them up small enough manually in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Spread the powder around your plants to provide extra calcium. You can scrape back the mulch and spread it under the mulch if you don't want it to show in your beds. (I put a little scoop of powder in the transplant hole when I set out tomatoes, peppers, and other ""hungry"" plants, but this won't apply to your perennial garden.)</p>

<p>You could spread larger chunks of shells, but it would get ugly pretty fast. Eggshells don't really break down in any reasonable amount of time.</p>

<h2>Wood Ash</h2>

<p>If you have a fireplace or wood stove, you can use of wood ash as a fertilizer in your lawn and garden. (Don't use the ash if you burn anything besides firewood; other materials may add contaminants.) Ash will raise your pH, so don't use it if you have alkaline soil already -- and ease up on the lime if you have acid soil that normally requires liming. Ash has varying amounts of nutrients, but 0-1-3 (N-P-K) would be a reasonable guess.</p>

<p>It's also been mentioned in a couple of <a href=""/questions/tagged/slugs"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'slugs'"" rel=""tag"">slugs</a> questions here that you can surround your plants with a thin line of ash to keep slugs off -- apparently they don't like to crawl over it.</p>

<h2>Newspaper and Corrugated Cardboard</h2>

<p>Black and white (not colored or glossy) newspaper and corrugated cardboard (uncolored and uncoated) can be used as the bottom layers of a sheet mulch for preparing new garden beds. These make decent weed barriers. Be sure to use several sheets of newspaper so that it is thick enough. Be sure to overlap the edges.</p>

It is really hot in Tennessee right now so I just started watering it every other day, but it is not showing any change. It is in full sun, should I move it to partial shade?!</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/v88Kr.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>You've had a LOT of rain in TN this year and cherries do not like wet feet.  They also don't care much for the acid soil you also have, which the rain made much worse.  If you want this tree to live, you have to get it out of that acid TN dirt and into some decent soil that isn't as acid and drains much better than TN clay.</p>

<p>Start by purchasing some dirt.  Look on craiglist.  It usually sells for about $30 a truck load.  Pile the new dirt on top of the TN dirt, making a raised bed.  You could probably add some lime as well ($3.50 from lowes for 40 lb bag).  Mix the lime with the soil real good and plant your tree in that.  The raised bed will allow for good drainage and root aeration while the lime will add calcium for a healthy tree, as well as stopping the effects of acid soil.</p>

<p>I wouldn't put the tree in full full sun, it only needs about 6hrs of direct sun per day.  Cherry is a small tree and would spend its life under the canopy of bigger trees naturally.  It does need some sun to develop sweet fruit.  I'd aim for 6hrs or so of sun.</p>

<p>Keep the area under the tree mulched with some fall leaves and maybe throw some grass clippings under as well.</p>

<p>The fungicides and pesticides aren't helping.  You shouldn't need those with a healthy tree.  The miracle-gro is fine, but it doesn't contain calcium and calcium is the #1 thing you need living in TN and growing things like cherries, pears, apples, grapes, tomatoes.  The exception to that would be blueberries and blackberries, which happen to like native TN dirt.</p>

"How do I treat and care for trees infested with borers?","2297","","<p>One of my apple trees recently started to look like it's dying (leaves dying when they shouldn't, bark peeling, lack of fruit, new branches growing and then quickly dying). My neighbor looked at it and noticed lots of small holes, pointing out that borers were living in it and that's what was killing the tree.</p>

<p>Knowing when the adults are active and flying/laying eggs will help with control. <a href=""https://insects.tamu.edu/extension/bulletins/b-5086.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here</a> is some useful information on prevention:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Prevention</h3>
  
  <p>Since most wood-boring insects are considered secondary invaders, the first line of defense against infestation is to keep plants healthy. Proper care of trees and shrubs discourages many borer pests and helps infested plants survive. Good sap f low from healthy, vigorously growing trees, for example, defends the plant from damage by many borer pests. Good horticultural practices include:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Selecting well adapted species of trees and shrubs that are not commonly attacked by wood borers in your area. Arizona ash, birch, cottonwood, locust, soft maple, flowering stone fruits (such as peaches and plums), slash pines (in west Texas), willow and poplar are especially prone to borer attack.</li>
  <li>Choosing and preparing a good planting site to avoid plant stress, freeze damage, sun scald and wind burn.</li>
  <li>Minimizing plant stress and stimulating growth by using proper watering and fertilization practices.</li>
  <li>Avoiding injury to tree trunks from lawn mowers, weed trimmers or construction. </li>
  <li>Properly thinning and pruning during [proper] months.</li>
  <li>Removing and destroying infested, dying or dead plants or plant parts, including fallen limbs.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, the borers will go for the weakest trees around, so the more ideal of conditions you can provide, like plenty of organic matter, water, proper fertilization, the better your trees chances are against borers (or almost every other pest problem, actually). </p>

<p>Now, for control, that can be hard. Again, from the same source, here are some methods of control:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Non-chemical control for infested plants</h3>
  
  <p>Once trees and shrubs are infested, non chemical options for borer control are limited. One option is to remove and destroy heavily infested or injured plants. Damage sites also can be inspected closely to determine if the larvae stages can be extracted from the plant with a pocket knife, wire or other suitable tool.</p>
  
  <h3>Chemical control</h3>
  
  <p>It is important to remember that stressed, unhealthy trees can be attacked repeatedly and will need repeated applications of insecticide indefinitely. In most cases this is neither economical nor environmentally justified. When chemical treatments are used, efforts always should be made to improve overall tree health.</p>
  
  <p>Most of these products are applied as sprays to the trunks and branches, and are non-systemic, residual insecticides (e.g., bendiocarb, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, es-fenvalerate, f luvalinate, lin-dane, methoxychlor, sumithion). While these products do not kill larvae that have already penetrated the sap-wood or heartwood, they will kill adult and larval stages tunneling through the treated bark layer. These are primarily a preventive treatment. Some products (those containing paradichlorobenzene and ethylene dichloride) act as fumigants to repel egg-laying adults or kill accessible larvae.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, chemical sprays are ineffective against borers once they are inside the tree. They will be effective against adult around and laying eggs on the tree at the time of spraying, and also newly emerged larvae before they enter the bark. Some adult borers, such as metallic wood borers, and longhorned beetles, will feed on the leaves of host trees, so canopy sprays can be effective where these are noticed. </p>

<p>This table will also be of use, although localized to Colorado. The flight periods may differ by location:</p>

"Building a DIY greenhouse  - where to start?","2285","","<p>I'd like to build an inexpensive, removable greenhouse over the back deck. The deck is approximately 20' x 8'. I'd like to build it for easy disassembly and storage in the summer.</p>

<p>I've never seen anyone attempt to cover their deck with a removable greenhouse. Are there some issues I should consider in planning a project such as this.</p>

<p>I'm looking for suggestions for the covering. Does it matter if the covering is clear or would it work better if it was green tinted or semitransparent? I'm also considering using <a href=""http://www.lowes.com/pd_77559-1115-1413A_?PL=1&amp;productId=3043880"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tuftex clear corrugated plastic roof panels</a>. Is a viable option?</p>

<p>Any recommended resources pertaining to this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Additional info:
Although, topically overcast and rainy we currently have about 9 hours of daylight.
I live in ""USDA Hardiness Zone 8a-8b"" where the average low is 20°F through 10°F.
Snow is unlikely and minimal at 0-3 inches in a year. High temperatures for the winter and spring would be in the low 40°F through 70°F. </p>

<p>As for orientation of the deck, the long axis runs east-west.</p>

<p>Here in the Pacific North Wet (as I call it, instead 'West') an abundance of rain seems to harm some of the plants, especially the tomatoes. Just the act of covering the tomatoes in the fall season seems to greatly extend their lifespan. In fact, I've got six tomato plants covered on the deck that are still producing and tomorrow starts the first of December. It is getting cold enough though that I have to pick the tomatoes green or yellow and let them ripen inside. I'm guessing that if I were to cover them in a greenhouse, it would produce an even better outcome.</p>

<p>Purpose for building a greenhouse over the deck:
- Cover six large plants of tomatoes.
- Keep the herbs through the cold, wet winter seasons. 
  (Example: rosemary, thyme, basil, mint, lemon balm, lavender, green onions, etc.)
- Growth of a late fall produce 
  (Example: lettuce, spinach, etc.)
- Shelter flowers
- Grow starts in the early spring
- Ability go out on the deck without getting cold &amp; wet.</p>
","<p>It would still be useful to add a couple of details to your question:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are you going to grow?</li>
<li>What orientation does your deck have? (Which way is the long axis running -- north-south, east-west, in between?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on what you've said so far, I can provide some general things to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm assuming you'll be using it to start plants from seed -- vegetables, flowers, etc. prior to transplanting them in the ground when the soil warms up.</li>
<li>20x8' is pretty big. (It's huge!)
<ul>
<li>For comparison: I start hundreds of plants (basil, tomatoes, squash, cole crops, celery, annual flowers, etc) every spring on two shelving racks in my basement -- about 6' wide x 6' deep x 7' high. That's enough to fill a 4000 sq ft veg garden plus smaller flower gardens in a third of the space you're proposing. <em>(Well, sometimes there's overflow to a third rack upstairs, but that's only when I'm hardening off one batch of plants and starting a new one.)</em></li>
<li>If you are going to use it for sheltering dwarf fruit trees or something like that, then maybe you'll need that extra space.</li>
<li><em>(It just occurred to me that maybe you're going to use it as a warm place to hang out during cold but sunny winter days? Is this part of your plan?)</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Depending on how cold it gets at night, since you're not going to heat it, you may not be able to use it to start heat-loving plants like tomatoes, peppers, etc. I think it will get too cold at night. (You may be able to prove me wrong on this point by adding thermal mass to the greenhouse so that it stays warm -- 65-70°F at night.)</li>
<li>You should research greenhouses that are built out of metal conduit. A friend built a small (6x6' or so) ""gothic roof"" style greenhouse, covered with poly sheeting, that worked out really well for her to start plants as described above. A structure this small could be firmly attached to your deck (to prevent blowing over) while in use, and then detached and carried away to be stored during the off-season.
<ul>
<li>I've seen plans for houses built out of plastic conduit too, you can check these out while you're doing your research.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consider very carefully how you are going to ventilate it. Roll-up sides might be handy. Self-ventilating roof panels might work on smaller structures. On a larger structure you may need to invest in some large fans that will need to be built-in to the endwalls and operated on a thermostat.
<ul>
<li><strong>Ventilation is critical.</strong> A sunny 70°F day in February will create a <strong>very</strong> hot greenhouse, and you will kill all of your plants! Even a sunny 40°F day is dangerous.</li>
<li>You may want to consider using shade cloth to keep the temp down on warm days. (But this works against providing light, see below.)</li>
<li>On the flip side, you'll want to retain heat at night (see above), so you'll need a way to make sure that your ventilation shuts off / closes when the greenhouse starts to cool at the end of the day.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Depending on how short the days are during your winter, you may need to provide supplemental lighting. In my basement ""nursery"", I put my seedlings under fluorescent lights on a timer for 12-14 hours of light per day.</li>
<li>Regarding the corrugated roof panels you're considering: I've seen a wood-framed greenhouse built with something similar (roughly 8x8'). It lasted several years and worked very well but eventually collapsed under a heavy snow load. If you decide to use these, consider carefully how much wear and tear you're going to create in your setup and teardown. (I doubt poly sheeting will be very reusable, but it's much cheaper than the panels.)
<ul>
<li>Yes, it matters that the covering (""glazing"") is clear. <strong>Plants need light to grow</strong>. The lower the light transmission of your glazing, the poorer your plants will do. I know of a greenhouse built using ""smoked"" glass (it was free) where (a) it doesn't warm up on sunny spring days like you might expect a greenhouse to do, (b) the plants don't thrive because they aren't getting full strength sunlight, (c) seedlings get ""leggy"" because they aren't getting full strength sunlight. I would go for the most transparent glazing you can get.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you're going to use it for starting plants as described above, what are you going to use for shelving? Are you going to stack vertically? If you're depending on overhead sunlight (versus sunlight entering at an angle), consider that top shelves will shade lower shelves. How high will the sidewalls be?
<ul>
<li>At 8' wide you can have multiple rows. Consider carefully which way your long axis runs, and whether stacked shelving on the outside rows is going to shade the inside rows.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you're going to build the large structure, and you plan to have a lot of plants out there, you're going to have a <em>very</em> heavy load -- all that soil and water, shelving, and the framing and glazing of the structure itself. (And possibly thermal mass -- e.g. barrels of water, bricks?) You may need to evaluate (by a pro) your deck to see if it has sufficient structural capacity to carry this large load.</li>
<li>Greenhouses are warm, damp places. Warm and damp is generally good for fungus and bad for wood. Consider how this may impact your deck. (You're going to disassemble it for the summer, so maybe this won't be such a big impact. It will depend somewhat on your climate.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Do some thinking about these aspects, a bit of research on what you think you need, and come back here and ask specific questions about your project.</p>

<p><em>(Disclaimer: I don't (yet) have my own greenhouse. Budget and siting have prevented me from getting one set up -- wind (50 mph+) and snow load (4') are major considerations for me, so I'll need a very sturdy structure.

"Why would we cut off leaves of strawberry plants once the harvest is done?","2272","","<p>Each year since I'm following Gardener's World (a BBC show for gardeners), Monty Don cuts off the leaves of his early strawberry plants once the harvest is done (in June or July). Last year I did it for the first time on my plants. This year I had the biggest harvest in 4 years. </p>

<p>What is the reasoning behind the idea of cutting off the leaves? 
Was this (one of) the reason(s) my harvest was outstanding this year?</p>
","<p>You've got what are known as June bearers by the sound of it - the reason you cut them right down or mow over them after they've finished fruiting is to prevent excessive runner production - if you leave them, they spend the rest of the summer throwing out long runners and rooting elsewhere. If you cut them down, they don't waste energy doing that and are able to concentrate on recovering as individual plants and putting their energy into making fruit the following year.</p>

"What should I do after a pepper plant has partly broken under its own weight?","2270","","<p>So, I'm sitting here on my computer and get the life scared out of me by a horrible cracking, rustling, thudding sound. I turn to find one of my peppers plants has broken - apparently one of the upper sections has just ripped off under it's own weight and dropped on to the toy box.</p>

<p>The plant was quite top-heavy anyway (all the fruit was high up) and the section that's broken off was supporting three peppers. As far as I can tell the plant is healthy, at least there's nothing obviously wrong, so I assume it has just suffered under the weight of its own fruit?</p>

<p>The break isn't very clean, as it has torn down the stem of the plant, as you can see in the images (apologies for the uneven quality):</p>

<p>Ignoring the fact the plant's effectively been pruned of a chunk of foliage, what should I do about this? Is there potentially something wrong with the plant? Anything else to bear in mind?</p>
","<p>Yes larger pepper plants will need support, although I usually find they tip over rather than split! As long as the roots survive the tipping, then then simply put out new growth from the bottom in the new vertical direction.</p>

<p>The old branch is not going to root and grow, so take the fruit off it and eat them. Throw those that are too small or unripe to be usable in the compost with the branch.</p>

<p>A clean cut is ideal and this would be the best choice for the above pictures. The only time you might not want to do this is if the leaves/stems that would be removed by such a cut make up over about half the healthy foliage. in such a case it is probably best to keep them so the plant has a chance of decent growth in the short term.</p>

"How much space between trees?","2267","","<p>Is there a recommended spacing when planting new trees so they do not interfere with each other's growth? I want to group a number of the same tree species together as densely as possible while still allowing sufficient sun so they grow almost as if each tree were alone in a field. Essentially, I do not want to create a forest of trunks with leaves only at the top.</p>

<p>Is there simple rule or formula for this? As a made up example: Minimum distance between trees should be 1.5 times the expected height or 2 times the expected crown spread (whichever is larger) for typical trees in the species.</p>

<p>If there is not a general rule of thumb for all species, I would appreciate recommendations for spacing between white dogwoods.</p>
","<p>It depends on the trees selected and the effects you want. In an orchard setting trees are often planted between 15-25 ft apart depending on what you are growing and harvesting techniques, etc. Hardwoods which grow tall and broad in their older years should be a lot farther apart.</p>

<p>Trees of different species sometimes fight each other allopathically and you'll see where the tops of two trees meet, they don't merge but have boundaries. Sometimes one tree wins and you can see that tree grows full while the other tree is retreated.</p>

<p>Some trees grow very well together, and these are often used in hedgerows, trees like these are mulberries, hawthorns, bush apricots, and I am sure many more. After they grow 12 - 15 ft tall, they get hedge laid, where the trees are skillfully cut part way through the trunk and laid down lengthwise to the hedgerow and then knitted together with others already laid down. There is an art to hedge laying so that you don't kill the trees and they continue to grow. It makes for some mighty impressive and impenetrable hedgerows.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AtsQA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Is that natural or should I do something for it?  Also, how can I make it blossom?</p>
","<p>This could be two things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>if the humidity is low and it is a sunny location the tips will die back as they have the most ""edge"" area and are at the end of the line for circulation. This can be prevented  by putting the plant on a self watering system with a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics#Passive_sub-irrigation"">capillary wick and a reservoir of water</a> that it can draw on at all times.  Spaths like it moist but not soaking and this can be done with some simple materials</p>

<pre><code>* put a one to two inch layer of inert material like stones in the base of a pot that does not have any holes in the bottom.  
* using a knitting needle insert a wicking material such as nylon parachute cord, acrylic or polyester material, into the base of the inner pot leaving six to eight inches to sit in the inert layer.
* fill the outer pot with enough water so the plant is sitting on top of the water but not in it.  Capillary action will draw water up to the roots on demand.
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>another possible cause of tip browning is a <a href=""http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/02911.html"">high level of fertilizer in the soil</a>.  In the rush to bring product to market many growers fertilize the stock during the entire growing cycle so it looks great on arrival. When you buy the plant and put it in lower light levels with a different watering cycle this can cause tip burn. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This leads me to my last recommendation.  If you are watering this plant three times a week this could mean that:</p>

<ul>
<li>you are not watering it until water runs out of the bottom of the pot. </li>
<li>the plant is pot bound and there is not enough soil to retain moisture</li>
<li>the plant is placed in unusually high light levels</li>
</ul>

<p>Good practices for spaths are:</p>

<ul>
<li>bright filtered light</li>
<li>when you water add enough water so the entire root ball is soaked</li>
<li>they respond well to capillary watering which prevents the root ball from drying out and avoids the unfortunate characteristic of these plants to collapse and look dead if they get too dry</li>
</ul>

<p>I have seen these plants flower in low light, high light, new plants or old.  There does not seem to be anything you can do other than good watering practices to encourage them.  They will flower when they want to.  You can make the flower last longer by removing the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spadix"">spadix</a>, the spiky thing.</p>

","<p>If you are going to water after a period of stress then you need to keep watering it to keep it green during the summer.  Grass has no problems going dormant in the summer but the turf opens up for weeds to get a hold.  If you want to keep your lawn to a high percentage of grass and low amount of weeds then it needs to be watered during dry periods otherwise it will go dormant as you have seen.</p>

<p>The other beneficial practice during the summer is to cut the grass high.  As high as you can stand.  Taller grass can cope better with dry conditions, three inches or more during the summer allows more root growth which, in turn, lets the roots get more water.</p>

<p>You can also peel back the layers at the very top just a little and see if the corn kernels there are ready. If they are, then the rest of the corn is ready too.

</blockquote>

<p>You might be over fertilizing them with those ""chemical"" spikes. Lots of growth and foliage, but lack of flowers (fruit, nuts) can be a sign of over fertilizing or an imbalance in the fertilizer being used.</p>

<p>Personally, I would:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mulch the trees with a 2 to 3inch (50 to 75mm) thick layer of ""good"" quality compost, doing so will feed the trees slowly and naturally. Mulching of trees is ""generally"" considered good practice (especially in warmer climates like yours), if done correctly, e.g. Mulch should <strong>never</strong> touch the trunk of the tree.</p></li>
<li><p>Move away from using ""chemical"" spikes, instead get a well balanced, organic fertilizer, something like 5-5-5, but nothing more than 10-10-10, that can be mixed-in with the compost (mulch) layer and allowed to work slowly down into the soil and root system of the trees.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Lack of fruit, nuts, can also be a sign of poor pollination, there can be numerous reasons why trees suffer poor pollination. In your situation, you would need to determine if in fact that was the case. If it was, then depending on the cause, you would need to make changes in an effort to prevent that from happening again in the future.</p>

<p>With all that said, I think your trees might be just a little bit too young to expect them to be producing this year. If they, or at least all of them except the 2 Pecan trees weren't starting to produce next year, I would be more concerned something is going wrong.</p>

<p>I have planted my seeds in the rectangular container.  But I believe I have possibly over-seeded them.  See the picture below on current progress.</p>

<p>On that link showing how to grow them, steps 7 and 8 show that you prick out the seedlings and transplant them into individual containers.

<p>Any thoughts on if this is currently still ok?</p>

<p><em>(not sure if it matters, but the front half are roma tomatoes and the back half are beef steak tomatoes)</em></p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BBE1j.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Yes, those are very close. You can still use most of them. First, get their new (cell pots?) containers ready and make sure you have moist mix ready. Moisten it beforehand, rather than after planting, especially if it's bone dry.</p>

<p><strong>To remove the seedlings from their flat:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use a plastic knife, popsicle stick, or similar, and starting from one edge, push them in near a clump of seedlings and lift them out in chunks. </li>
<li>With each clump, you will need to carefully ease apart the roots, trying to disturb the soil as little as possible. With smaller seedlings I've used toothpick, but for tomatoes, I usually just use my fingers. You can use your fingers if you're confident that you won't bruise them, or you could use toothpicks (or pencils, or similar) to work apart the roots.</li>
<li>Plant them in their new pots. Put them deep, they'll grow better. Just make sure the cotyledons are at least 1/2"" above the top of the mix. Plant slowly and carefully, and keep in mind that although the mix needs to be firmed, the roots will be very easily crushed, and crushed roots are susceptible to diseases like damping off.</li>
<li>Water them in, and keep them out of bright light for a while. Some wilting is normal, especially for those that came free with bare or very few roots. </li>
<li>You can begin fertilizing when they put out a couple new leaves, as that's a sign that they reestablished their root systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case that you don't need to grow that many seedlings to maturity, you won't have to repot them all. The easiest time to decide which to keep will be right after the clumps are split apart. Save the ones with the thickest stems, and the most soil on their roots. Or you can grow them all, and plant the best ones when they're ready, and give away the rest. </p>

<p>Also, ones that come out with almost no roots may not make it, or they may grow too slowly for good production. Losing a few isn't unusual in cases like this.</p>

<p>What could it be? Some type of disease? Lack of water? Not enough drainage? </p>
","<p>Unfortunately I can't see the pot they're growing in in your photograph - if they have grown apace, as you describe, it may be that they're getting a bit short of root room and need a larger pot.</p>

<p>This type of thing happens with chives anyway, though - some leaves die back and any stalks which have borne flowers go quite stiff and eventually bleach and die back completely. Other than perhaps needing a larger container (turn it out of its pot and see how crowded it is) there doesn't seem to be anything much wrong with your chives, though I can't actually see the whole plant in your pic. You might check how dry or wet the compost in the pot is - they don't particularly like being wet all the time, so should be allowed to dry out a little between waterings, so that the surface feels just slightly dry to the touch, and don't leave the pot standing in an outer tray full of water, empty it after 30 minutes.</p>

<p>You may find they die back completely if temperatures get low enough - although this is an evergreen perennial plant (bulbs, actually), in places like the UK, they disappear below ground completely during winter, reappearing in Spring.</p>

<p>If the plant is a creeper, is there a way that I can clean its leaves? Probably by spraying water on the whole plant, but that might spoil the walls! </p>

<p>Whenever we have to put water in the flowerpots are we supposed to take it out of house every time?</p>
","<p>The only disadvantages that occur to me are: (1) they require regular attention (feeding and watering), (2) need someone to take care of them when you are away on holiday, (3) outgrow their pots, become root-bound and need to be potted on, and (4) sometimes flourish so well that they eventually require a pot that is too large for the situation in which they are placed (eg a narrow window shelf).</p>

<p>Certainly, the leaves of some species, such as aspidistras and rubber plants, need to be cleaned occasionally, because they are fairly broad and accumulate dust, and this is easily done by wiping them gently with a damp cloth. Spraying before removing the dust is not a good idea, as the dust won't all be removed and, over time, is likely to form a 'skin' on the leaf surface, which will reduce the amount of light it receives.</p>

<p>It's important to water pot plants thoroughly (until water drains out of the bottom of the pot), otherwise they will be encouraged to surface-root in search of water and become stressed. You can stand your pots in the sink to drain them after watering and then place them on trays or, if small pots, on saucers.</p>

So I dug it some more , and the seed seemed stuck or too tight to come out.I used my fingers to just move the mud aside, and holy cow I saw a strong root going down ! I was so happy! </p>

<p>But then it had been just 20 days , so I thought the root might not be lengthy. I was trying to chisel the seed out with my hand ,my cousins helped me push the mud out of the way.By then there were three hands in the pot, and I tried to be careful but my hand slightly shifted and, Oh dear god, the root BROKE!just like that!</p>

<p>I took the seed out and the broken root. It was 2 inches approx long!.
But the seed still has an inch and a half  of strong root attached to it.The cut end had some kind of rootlings coming out of it,tiny &lt;1mm kind of light greenish white tubes( I don't know how else to describe it!) radially popping out.</p>

<p>I have planted the seed back into the mud and took away the broken root as a souvenir.
Is there any chance that the seed will grow a new root?</p>

<p>Can I do anything with the broken root? right now its inside a pot, But will it grow?I know that's silly , but still, does the broken root do any good? </p>

<p>EDIT 1: just made my sentence construction better.</p>
","<p>No, the broken root won't regrow - the part which produces topgrowth has now gone, so it has no 'instructions' as to how to proceed - this information comes from the actual seed or stone. I'm not sure if you're saying the tiny rootlets spreading out radially were on the now detached piece of root, leaving the original seed with just a root and no rootlets. If you are, there's slightly less chance your mango will continue to grow, since its been interrupted at a critical stage - but it might recover well, so its worth taking care of the one you've replanted in terms of water particularly.</p>

<p>It's a valuable lesson though - for a plant to start showing green growth from a large seed or stone, its already grown root/s below ground, or it wouldn't be sprouting in this way. If you've ever seen a conker which has started growing the spring after falling to the ground, you'll first notice the topgrowth, usually about 4 inches tall - if you dig that up, it has a very long root with rootlets already present, much longer than the topgrowth. Root initiation and development with large seeds starts before green topgrowth appears, basically, though some plants are quicker to produce topgrowth than others.</p>

<p>UPDATED ANSWER;</p>

<p>You've said there were rootlets present still on the seed end of the broken root - it should be fine, assuming it doesn't suffer drought. I guess you know that mangoes don't come true from seed - it'll be interesting to see how big it gets and whether it produces good mangoes or not very nice ones, though fruiting will be some years away.</p>

<p>Is there an effective method of removing it without effecting the good grass?</p>
","<p>First, let me say I've no experience doing battle with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynodon_dactylon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bermuda grass</a>.</p>

<p>Second, I've spent the past 24 hours reading up on removing Bermuda grass from a cool-season lawn, for the moment lets just say there's no easy answer, solution... Eradicating Bermuda grass from a landscape takes a lot! of work and time, there really doesn't appear to be a quick fix...</p>

<p>What makes Bermuda grass so difficult to remove are a number of factors:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Being a warm-season grass it thrives in the heat.</p></li>
<li><p>It's considerably drought tolerant (for a grass).</p></li>
<li><p>Has an extensive and deep root system.</p></li>

It's not a clump forming grass like Fescue which is very slow at filling in bare spots and limited to small areas (approximately 4inch/100mm diameter maximum).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Small areas of Bermuda grass can be tackled via:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>A proper and thorough cool-season lawn care program eg</p>

"What is causing the brown-black spots on my apricots?","2202","","<p>I've recently bought a house in the Auvergne region of France (South central) which is about 30 years old and that has the good fortune to have several mature fruit trees in the garden (cherry, apple, pear and apricot). All these species are in the same part of the garden so have similar aspects/exposures (lots of sun throughout the entire day) and presumably similar soil and drainage. </p>

<p>However, whilst my cherry crop was fine and I can see no problems with the other fruits still on the tree, most of my apricots have these kind of black-brown spots all over them:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZ5zJ.jpg"" alt=""these""></p>

<p>Though the spots don't seem to make any difference to the flavour of the fruit and the texture is unchanged apart from the skin being slightly harder where the spots are. What may be different is that I've noticed that the affected fruit tend to be more prone to rotting on the tree, and many of the fruit that have fallen from the tree are mouldy. </p>

<p>Any suggestions to what might be causing this and how I may eliminate the problem in future years?</p>
","<p>What you have is a fungal disease known as Coryneum blight. From <a href=""http://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/factsheet/coryneum-blight08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coryneum blight, also known as shothole blight, is a fungal disease that can cause damage on peach, nectarine, apricot, almonds  (ornamental as well as nut bearing) and, to a lesser degree, cherries (tart and sweet). Coryneus blight is caused by the fungal pathogen <em>Wilsonomyces carpophilus</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prune and dispose of infected tissue as soon as it appears. After leaf drop, inspect plants carefully and prune infected buds and twigs with lesions. Diligent sanitation and water management can provide adequate control where the incidence of shot hole is low. Avoid overhead sprinklers or use a low angle to avoid wetting foliage. Also, some varieties may be less susceptible. Where disease incidence is high, fungicides such as Bordeaux mixtures or fixed coppers may be applied. On peaches and nectarines, a dormant spray of copper in late fall will work well. On almonds, spray fungicides at petal fall in the spring.</p>

"Tillandsia (air plants) Turning Black and Dying After Watering","2197","","<p>I live in a northeast Connecticut boarding school, and have ten tillandsias on the windowsill of my dormitory room. I cannot collect rain water for them because I have no tools to do so, so the water I use to water them was the water from the drinking fountains. </p>

<p>After coming to the school, I began watering them by soaking them upside-down in plastic containers, just like I used to do back at home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I dried them up by placing them upside-down on paper towels. When I performed this process back in Pittsburgh, they grew quite well (the only difference was that I used rainwater then). I've watered them twice after coming here, but they only turned black on their bottom leaves and didn't look healthy at all. </p>

<p>So I have refrained from watering them for an incredible three months now, and I know you will blame me for doing this, but I was quite sure they would all turn black and die if I kept watering them. Now, all of them have dried up considerably, but they all still have healthy leaves in the middle and their leaves have stopped turning black. I really want to resume watering them, but I don't know how. </p>

<p>I have several varieties of tillandsias, but they all seemed to exhibit the same symptoms.</p>

<p>I would like to know why their bottom leaves turned black and shriveled after watering, and how I can change my practices to better care for them. </p>

<p>I have not been able to find answers online about tillandsias' leaves turning black after watering, so I hope this site will be able to help. </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>I read somewhere that spring water is good for Tillandsias. Do you recommend using it? If so, what counts as spring water and where can I obtain it?</p>

<p>Also, does Brita water filter work for removing chlorine as well as softening the water? (If that's the case, I will just buy a Brita jug to fix the water problems.)</p>

","<p>Your tillandsia has been damaged by using chlorinated water.  You can dechlorinate water by leaving it to stand for 24 hours but if the municipal authority uses chloramines instead, then you will have to use a dechlorinating solution that you can purchase from a pet shop.</p>

<p>Rain water is naturally very soft.  You can not use distilled water as that is too soft.  If you use dechlorinated tap water, it may still be too hard for your plant, and the trichomes could block up dehydrating the plant by preventing uptake of any further water.  You could try removing the calcium from the water by first passing it through sphagnum or peat moss.</p>

Every so often, I divide the clumps in spring and, apart from some slug damage, they are all thriving, so, unfortunately, the advice below is not based on personal experience; however, judging from what I have read, I think the problem is likely to be caused by one of more of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Planting/ re-planting <em>too low in the soil</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of essential nutrients in the soil; you say that it is fertile, but does it contain enough humus, and do you fertilize it from time to time?</p></li>
<li><p>Ineffective/superficial watering: hostas are moisture-loving plants;  sometimes even a soaker hose will fail to supply them with enough <em>in-depth</em> water, and overhead watering is far more effective.</p></li>
<li><p>Insufficient light: although hostas prefer partial shade, clearly they need enough light to thrive; perhaps the area has become over-shaded...</p></li>

","<p>Usual cause is either a light problem or insufficient organic matter in the soil. Regarding sunlight, they don't like it - what they want is diffuse or dappled bright light for a minimum of 5 hours a day, so if yours have been getting a lot of sun, that would explain the way they look. On the other hand, a totally shady spot isn't any good either - they do need bright light, just not bright direct sunlight.</p>

<p>Otherwise, they like a high level of nutrients, so in the ground, soil enriched with composted manures and the like - in a pot, fertilisers on a regular basis, particularly those higher in potassium, since its the root you're trying to cultivate.

","<p>Mint does this when constrained within a pot - its natural growth habit is to throw out long runners up to 18 inches under the ground and pop up a good distance away from the original clump, which is why its so often said its not a good idea to plant it in open ground.</p>

<p>Turn it out of its pot, cut the root ball into 3 sections, replant one in the same pot. If you want more, replant those in 2 other pots. It should recover and grow anew, although, if you live in the northern hemisphere, reduced hours of daylight and possible chilliness near the window means it won't grow as fast as it would in spring or summer.</p>

<p>One caveat though - I'm rather wondering what those black flecks beneath the leaves in the last photo are - are they just specks of potting compost or aphid infestation? If its the latter, that needs dealing with, you can either rub them off and kill them between your fingers, or use a neem spray. If the flecks are within the leaf and not removable, suggesting a fungal problem, take care with your watering regime - give it a good water when you repot, but don't keep it wet nor allow water to remain in the outer tray for longer than 30 minutes after watering.</p>

I heard that chili are self-pollinating, but I don't understand this. Wouldn't any plant become self-pollinated if we use their anther to brush their stigma?</p>

<p>In addition, I wonder whether different genus plant can be hybridized, because I want to plant sweet basil, together with holy basil and wonder if it'll cross-pollinate with the chilis.</p>
","<p>My understanding is that some plants will reject pollen that is like their own. Also some plants (eg. holly and papaya) have male and female plants. One plant has male flowers, the other has female flowers. So they can't self-pollinate.</p>

<p>In the case of peppers, they do cross-pollinate with other varieties, as long as they are cultivars of the same species (most peppers are <em>C.annuum</em>). For example two years ago I grew some sweet paprika and one of the plants produced some fruit which were hotter - they had cross pollinated with some anaheims in the next bed. So the cross-pollination influences the fruit that is produced as well as the plant produced by the seed (the paprika actually seeded itself and the plant that came up was a moderately hot paprika).</p>

<p>I usually grow about half a dozen varieties each year, and do not take any precautions against cross-pollinating other than keeping each variety together - and this is mainly for my own memory. I wouldn't describe it as a big problem - just don't be surprised when you get the odd cherry-shaped bell pepper, a cherry red ""chocolate"" pepper, hot paprikas, etc.!</p>

<p>re. @bstpierre's comments, I would only note that natural hybrids are much more common with plants than animals. Yes they usually have to be between species in the same genus, but plants like <em>Sarracenia</em> (trumpet pitchers), and <em>Opuntia</em> (prickly pear) form natural viable hybrids (within their own genus) in the wild. The only larger animal I'm aware of that naturally produces viable hybrids would be ducks - which are quite randy creatures anyway!  (mules are domestic, but they're also sterile).</p>

"What should I do about bare patches in my lawn after killing off Creeping Charlie?","2164","","<p>I live in midwest Iowa and my lawn has started to get taken over by <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glechoma_hederacea"" rel=""nofollow"">Creeping Charlie</a>. After much reading, I went out and bought the Ortho Weed Be Gone to try and kill it off. A week ago I tested by spraying just a few patches in my front yard. After just a few days, it started turning brown and yellow so it appears to be killing it off, just how I wanted.</p>

<p>So yesterday, I went ahead and walked around my ENTIRE yard (1/2 acre) and sprayed every spot/patch that I could find. Now I'm in a wait-and-see step to see how it does.</p>

<p>What's the next step here? I wanted to put down the Scot's Weed and Feed because it says it will ""push out"" all the weeds because my good grass will grow and take over. But it says that it should only be done in late spring. Should I go ahead and fertilize with this? I don't want the spots that [hopefully] get killed off to be just completely dead, I want my good grass to come in.</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated!</p>
","<p>You must not use Scotts Weed and Feed formulation now for two reasons - one, you've already applied a weedkiller to the entire lawn, and one of the active ingredients, 2,4D, is present in both formulations, which means you'll be overdosing on the weedkiller front. Second, where you live, your first frost date is early October, so feed should not be applied this late in the year. If you finish up with bald patches, you can reseed those this year, you've just about got time - <strong>you must wait for three weeks after applying the Ortho B Gon.</strong></p>

<p>There are 'autumn' (presumably labelled 'fall' where you are) feed preparations for lawns available in the UK, not sure about where you are, but they're designed to release low levels of nutrients for six months and do not contain any weedkiller. This treatment will not, however, 'push out' weeds - that claim is based on the idea that the weedkiller content in the Scotts Weed and Feed product will kill off the weeds, and the feed will increase the growth rate of the grass, so that its more likely to fill in any bald patches. In reality, if the bald patches are over 6 inches in size, re-seeding is usually necessary. </p>

<p>I wouldn't recommend using an autumn feed product if you are going to reseed some areas - best wait till late spring and use the Scotts Weed and Feed then instead, because the new seed will have been down long enough to withstand it.</p>

<p>If you feel it would be valuable, you could take a risk and apply a liquid Lawn Food immediately (something like Scotts Liquid Turf Builder), but it does mean walking over the lawn again  - it's also dependent on what type of grass you've got as to whether this is a good thing to do at this time of year, but ensure that, if you do this, what you buy is simply a <strong>liquid lawn fertilizer</strong>, without any weedkillers or other treatments included. Liquids tend to feed instantly with a shorter term residual effect, when compared with granular formulations; these latter wouldn't be appropriate at this time of year.</p>

"What thickness of twinwall polycarbonate should I use for my greenhouse?","2141","","<p>I bought a cheap grow house with 4 shelves for growing herbs but the wind has knocked it about and it is starting to lean to one side a bit more than it should.</p>

<p>I plan to build a wooden frame, to remount the shelves on and use twinwall polycarbonate for the panels, instead of the plastic that was over the grow-house frame.</p>

<p>The final unit will be 1.8m high and 40cm by 60cm shelf size. I was wondering what thickness twinwall polycarbonate to use for the panels, the local DIY shop only had 1 thickness but when checking online there is quite a variety: 4mm, 6mm, 10mm, 16mm, 25mm, 32mm and 35mm.</p>

<p>I will likely use the same material to build some cold frames later on.</p>
","<p>4mm twinwall polycarbonate is the best choice, for reasons which I'll explain. Where you live in Edinburgh, Scotland, the days are shorter and the light less bright - 4mm twinwall polycarbonate allows 80-84% light through, compared to single wall polycarbonate, which allows 94-96% (note that 3mm glass allows 97-98% light). This might sound like a big reduction in light transmission, but it is diffused by the polycarbonate, which means light reaches what would be darker areas were you using glass in your greenhouse. It's also obvious that if you used even 6mm, never mind 10mm, the light transition would be even less, and where you are, you don't want that.</p>

<p>The thermal ('R') value of 4mm twin polycarbonate is 1.42, compared to 0.83 for single, so its insulating properties are pretty good - 4mm is the one most commonly used in Germany, where it gets pretty cold. A higher mm would give more insulation, but you'd lose more light, so on balance, 4mm seems the best choice.</p>

<p>Note that you will need to tape over the cut ends of the sheeting to prevent moisture infiltration and subsequent algal proliferation. Note also that it excludes harmful uv light, so you won't get sunburnt if you spend a lot of time in there, and neither will your plants!</p>

","<p>Generally, carbon dioxide enters a plant through stomata on the leaves - these are like small pores on the underside of the leaf with two guard cells which allow CO2 to enter, and oxygen to leave. Part of the photosynthetic process, and there's a formula for it - six molecules of C02 plus six molecules of water turns into 1 molecule of sugar (which the plant utilises) and 6 molecules of oxygen (which it emits from the stomata). The water comes from root uptake in the soil, but some water loss is inevitable through the stomata too.</p>

","<p>Some seeds will germinate with just warmth and water but if they do not get sufficient light they become spindly and stretched out.  These seedlings are weak stemmed and tough to plant out.</p>

<p>My traditional thinking has been to aerate first then de-thatch (more like de-moss here in Portland) so that the de-thatcher will break up the plugs while it's also lifting thatch and moss. Finally, after removing all the moss and thatch, use the overseeder.  This will leave the seed undisturbed so it can germinate.</p>

<p>Does anyone else have a justifiable opinion for using these machines in a different order?</p>
","<p>I always dethatch first. That will create a clearer path for the other equipment, and make it a lot easier for the slicer overseeder.</p>

<p>As for the other two, I like to run the aerator first, to avoid disturbing newly sown seed. It can be done either way, and both ways I've noticed seed falling into the aerator holes, where it will not germinate. That doesn't seem to be a huge issue though, in my experience. It's more of an issue when you broadcast overseed. A slicer overseeder usually takes care of all the plugs, as long as they're dry.</p>

<p>Really, though, that's just my method, not necessarily the best one. Once you get a system going you tend to stick with it. Dethatching comes first for me also because I don't have a dethatcher, so I rent one and use it before I use the other equipment (which I own). </p>

<p>So basically I've been using a slightly different order than you, and if it's been working well for you also, that just goes to show that there isn't really a 'best' way. Do what's logical, use common sense, it will work fine. </p>

<p>So I would hold the seed over winter (perhaps in the fridge -- I think most conifers want a cold period to break dormancy), and plant in the spring in acidic, well-drained soil.</p>

<p>Lastly, I know people who grow Christmas trees, and they expect significant losses (in related species, not necessarily Norway Spruce) when they plant <em>from seedlings</em>, so I wouldn't expect all of the seeds you plant to survive.

<p>I think this shortens the growing season more than is necessary, and giving things more of a start indoors would help when it comes time to transplant.  </p>

<p>Is there a certain ""point of no return"" for transplanting from indoors to outside for common vegetable-garden varieties (cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, etc) or can a plant be transplanted if it is older than about 2 months?</p>
","<p>I gardened for many years in Zone 4b/5a at 9/10ths of a mile elevation before moving to Zone 8a last summer.  For many of the plants you mentioned, age of the transplant is not a huge issue, as long as while you are growing them out inside you move them to larger pots as their root balls fill the old ones, plus you are careful with the roots and make sure to fill each new pot with a good soil mix so they have every incentive to continue growing well.  </p>

<p>In fact, the way we used to get around the short season problem was to start our garden transplants in soil blocks, then move them to progressively larger grow bags as the season progressed until conditions outside were good enough for transplanting. Most years our tomatoes ended up in 2 gallon grow bags (with a plant that was about 16 to 18 inches tall and wide) before being transplanted out in late May/early June.  As a result of this practice, we almost always had ripe tomatoes on some of our fastest varieties by mid-July. If there was a setback, you would hardly notice it, and it was more than outweighed by having larger and older transplants to start with. The only issue we encountered with transplants that old and that large was it was a lot more work to get them into the ground!  </p>

<p>You could treat peppers and eggplants this way and do fine as well, although they likely wouldn't grow large enough to need a 2 gallon grow bag in the same amount of time, as they grow a fair bit slower than tomatoes do. </p>

<p>Things that would NOT do well with this method... cucumbers, melons and squash.  These resent being transplanted much past 3 weeks after germination, so only start those a couple or three weeks before you are confident conditions outside will be warm enough to keep them happy.  </p>

<p>By the way, I personally do not like peat pot products.  My experience with them has been that they do not disintegrate anywhere fast enough to keep from stunting the root system of whatever is grown in them, even if you follow the standard advice to tear the top edge off, crack the rest of the pot, and then bury it deeply.  </p>

"Amending clay soil on a large scale","2120","","<p>What would be the best way to amend clay soil on half an acre? We want to grow our usual garden plants like tomatoes, cucumbers and such but the soil on the land we just bought is small rocks and clay. Short of bringing in 4' of topsoil, is there anything else I can do? We have a whole year until we will be growing on it if that matters. Property is in Northern KY and hardiness zone is 7a-b.</p>
","<p>Clay soil is composed of extremely small clay particles formed by the breakdown of rocks by erosion and organic activity.  The particles have a high surface area with the capacity to hold lots of positive ions (cations) such as calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium which are essential for plant growth. And it has a capacity to hold a lot of water. The degree to which the clay is compacted is determined by the calcium to magnesium ratio.  High levels of magnesium lead to tighter soils.  Without first correcting the calcium/magnesium ratio, adding organic material to form humus may be ineffective in achieving good crop growth.</p>

<p>Albrecht's ideal ratio for healthiest crop growth is where the soil's ability to hold cations, the cation exchange capacity, is 65% calcium, 15% magnesium, 4% potassium and 1-5% sodium.  Because magnesium tightens soil, in a clay soil you instead want a base saturation of 70 - 80% calcium, and 10% magnesium to loosen the soil up.  The remaining percentages are occupied by copper, zinc, iron, and manganese with exchangeable hydrogen which then determines the soil pH, and sets this at about 6.4.</p>

<p>Just testing soil pH is inadequate. A soil can be alkaline but also be low in calcium. When clay soils are deficient in the 4 major cations, it rips free hydrogen from the water to bind to the negatively charged sites on the clay particles instead. Testing pH only tests the free hydrogen in soil water, and so will mislead you. Restoring the major cations restores pH as they will replace the hydrogen bound to clay.</p>

<p>So, the first step is to get a soil analysis done.  You can then calculate how much agricultural lime you need to add, or whether you should use gypsum which has added sulfur.  You won't probably want to use dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate) because of the magnesium.  The soil analysis will also advise you of any other imbalances that need correcting.</p>

<p>After you have amended the soil minerals, you can then add organic material to create humus in the soil.  Humus greatly expands the cation exchange capacity of the soil thereby greatly increasing the resources available to the plant roots.</p>

<p>The flowers were gifts but are now wilting.  Would florists or growers use anything on the flowers to preserve them that might be bad for compost?</p>
","<p>The only reason <em>not</em> to that I can think of is that commercially produced flowers can have a lot of pesticide residue. Some of these chemicals may break down during composting. And unless you're adding a large amount of flowers to your compost pile (in terms of the ratio to other material) it will be diluted greatly by the rest of your compost feedstock. So it seems unlikely to me that it would cause a problem with the end product, but if you want to be absolutely safe, add the flowers to a compost pile that you won't use on edibles.</p>

","<p>Yes you can grow onions in containers. You can usually buy onion sets from local stores which will produce a good size onion much faster than starting from seed. Garlic works as well. We are currently growing it in 2 inch diameter pots from a clove bought from the store.</p>

<li>wet soil is heavy. Check the load limits for your balcony if you are above ground level</li>
<li>soil much deeper than twelve to eighteen inches will not be used except by trees or shrubs.</li>

","<p>The growth rate depends on the climate. They'll grow super fast in tropical areas, but only a couple feet a year indoors in a temperate area. The problem for you is that they mature rather big.

<p>If you intend to plant them out, that won't be a problem for you. I doubt the shoots wil exceed 4' tall by april, but if they grow too fast, lowering the temperature will slow growth.

<li><p>Plant it in a <strong>large</strong> pot/container for at least a year, allow it to get somewhat established before subjecting to full outdoor life.</p></li>
<li><p>For its first Winter or two, bring it indoors (somewhere that doesn't get below 32&#176;F/0&#176;C).</p></li>
<li><p>From Spring through to mid (to late) Autumn/Fall place in a sheltered area (protected from the wind) in full-sun.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the soil constantly moist through the growing season, especially important during the heat of summer, you don't want the soil to dry-out.</p></li>
<li><p>Once every 4 weeks through the growing season apply a ""mild"" liquid fertilizer.</p></li>
<li><p>At the beginning of Spring 2013 select a suitable permanent outdoor location.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sheltered from the wind.</p></li>
<li><p>Full-sun (morning sun it important), late afternoon shade isn't a problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Soil should provide good drainage, overly fertile soils are best avoided.</p></li>
<li><p>Room to grow into a mature tree: ""generally"" 20 to 30ft (6 to 9m) high and canopy width of 20ft (6m) minimum.</p></li>

Given that you transplanted at the end of the growing season, this is not unusual nor is it particularly worrisome.</p>

<p>Cherries grown from seed often have tap roots and so was likely a bit unhappy in a pot. Being transplanted late in the season, added to the plant's stress. Leaf spot diseases (both fungal and bacterial) are opportunistic. They primarily affect the older leaves of plants under stress. Given the date, all the leaves on your cherry qualify as older leaves. Hence the seriousness of this infection is not surprising. </p>

<p>Since the defoliation the leaf spot is causing is happening only a couple weeks before normal autumn leaf drop, it is doing the plant no harm. Really. Serious leaf spot infections are a big deal when they occur earlier in the season. They can affect the new growth, they can ruin the fruit, and, most importantly, if they defoliate the tree, the tree will be forced to push out a new set of leaves. This can seriously deplete the tree stored food supply. However, a leaf spot problem this late is just encouraging early dormancy — not a serious cause for concern.</p>

<p>The cherry's stem appears healthy. The bud at the tip looks fat and healthy. So I see no reason the plant will not do fine next spring. Leaf spot diseases generally do not winter over in the plant. Therefore, if you remove the leaves and dispose of them, the leaf spot problems may not reappear.</p>

<p>If you have a serious leaf spot problem next year, then, maybe, you will have a good reason to get rid of the the plant. Even then, I would look first at cultural issues that may make the plant more susceptible to problems. Is it in too much shade? Does the soil drain well? Does the air circulate well where it is growing? If this area is a bad place to grow a cherry seedling, it will not be much better for growing second year cherry stock from a nursery.</p>

Is this accurate or can I expect further problems?</p>

<p>They won't be exposed to frost, but will probably be exposed to ""cold"" temperatures overnight and they will obviously get less sunlight (I won't be specifically heating/lighting the plants and I don't heat my home overnight).</p>

","<p>It sounds like these are outdoors with reasonable sunlight? If so, I would try it - the effort of re-potting one pepper plant is pretty small and there's a good chance it will work. Actually I would try all three as an experiment and use your findings for future years.</p>

<p>This is based on my experiences: Here in Texas, low temperatures will make the plants outside go ""dormant"". They're still alive and I think they'll probably still put leaves out, but no fruit will form. A mild frost will knock them back but not kill them - it can damage the fruit though. The last fruit will be late November (Thanksgiving time) and the plants will survive until the first hard frost (typically by Christmas). If it wasn't for the hard frosts, I think they would survive to the new year.</p>

<p>I have brought them indoors and I have managed to over-winter them like this. BUT there is an attrition. They lose their leaves and seem more susceptible to disease. I think the primary problem here is lack of sunlight. Also being indoors, once I get some aphids/whatever, they'll spread quickly.</p>

<p>Once over-wintered, I always plant them out, they quickly grow back their leaves, and you find you have a good adult plant by mid/late spring! So yes you get your fruit earlier - or more fruit earlier because you have an adult plant at an earlier stage. When I've done this, the fruit have been of the same size and quality.</p>

<p>Most chilis are happy to dry as long as they are somewhere warm and dry. A dehydrator will make it even easier. I've dehydrated hot red peppers and it worked wonderfully. I've never tried drying Jalapenos, because I like them pickled, but I wouldn't expect trouble if I were to try it.</p>

"Why use landscape fabric in a raised bed?","2070","","<p>We just moved into a home that had three existing garden beds.  We're using them for vegetables.  Next year I was thinking of building a new and smaller bed to use for herbs.  I saw a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B--i7Cv8ffA"">video from Lowe's</a> that seemed to show a relatively easy way to build a bed.  After removing the sod they roll out landscape fabric that will sit under the soil in the bed.</p>

<p>What is the purpose of using landscape fabric?  And more specifically, would it be useful in a vegetable or herb garden bed?</p>
","<p>Without looking at your video, I would expect the landscape fabric is being laid as a weed mat to inhibit weeds from regenerating from roots left in situ and coming up in the middle of the raised garden bed.</p>

<p>Figure out how long it takes to deliver 1"" of water (do the math using your square footage and 1 gal/hour), then run it for that long.</p>

<p>Do it all at once, and do it infrequently. It's better to soak the soil and get the water deep. That encourages the plants to send roots deeper into the soil. Frequent, shallow watering leads to shallower roots.</p>

<p>If you have a moisture probe, use it. Once your plants are established, check to see how much moisture you have deep in the soil. If the soil is moist enough, you don't need to water.</p>

They are, in their native habitat, a climber, so you may notice aerial roots growing out of the plant near the soil. If you give it something to climb (like a post stuck into the pot), you can train it to climb. Just be careful adding the post, so you minimize damage to the roots. You'd also want to make sure that you moisten the post when you water the plant, so the aerial roots get water as well. </p>

"Will a branch on a small tree always be at that same height?","2056","","<p>We have a lot of trees on the farm (Apple, maple, pear, walnut, oak...) and I've been reading about pruning lately. One of the things I stumbled upon is that when a tree is say five feet tall and has a branch at 18 inches above the ground there will always be a branch at 18 inches (even if the tree grows to 50 feet). Is this true? I assume this would also apply to Y's in trees where the trunk separates into two different sections. If you want a good looking tree ideally you don't want a big branch 18 inches off the ground, so you'd prune it.</p>

<p>So, basically, is it true that when a branch grows in it will always remain at the height it started out at?</p>
","<p>Yes, those branches will be at the same height forever. Trees grow from the top. If you have ever seen a sign or (very common where I live) fence nailed into an old tree, the sign/fence is at the same height that it was at 50 or 80 years ago. The same holds true for low branches or Ys.</p>

"When building a cinder block wall, how do I attach/level the stacked blocks?","2054","","<p>I am doing some garden remodeling, which includes making sunken beds for veggies. To separate the beds, I am stacking cinder blocks. The problem is that the base is not level, and there are some places where existing work means that the blocks can be offset vertically by as much as an inch.</p>

<p>So what I need to do is to get the second level of blocks level, and get the gaps/vertical differences filled. How do I do this? Mortar? Concrete? </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I need to be a little more explicit. I have the base line of blocks as level as I could get it, which is fairly close (I can usually get to about 3-5 mm). The bigger problem is where there is existing stuff that causes the office. These include fence bases, old walls, and old, buried railroad ties. I try and line up the blocks so the tops are at the same level as the obstruction, but I can't get it perfect. </p>

<p>The top of the cinder portion of the wall has concrete tops (landscape blocks), and even a little bit of a gap causes the blocks on top to be unsteady. I was thinking that mortar or whatever I should use might make everything more stable.</p>

<p>I will be walking on these (to weed, etc), and I noticed that some I built earlier are not stable. I think that the gravel might have settled, or something else. I'm not a pro, so I have done the first level incorrectly. </p>

<p>Thanks for any help/suggestions!</p>

<p>Erick</p>
","<p>Mortar or cement will not help you in the long run if you have an uneven base. Ground moves, particularly in the presence of water and will overcome the bonding strength of cement.</p>

<p>One crude but effective method is to buy metal T-bars which are available in six foot lengths.  Use a sledge hammer to put the T-bar into the ground through the holes in the cinder blocks. It can be tricky to line up the holes but if you start with that goal in mind then it is possible. Use an angle grinder to cut them off flush with the top.</p>

<p>If possible put landscape fabric (geotextile) on the outside of the block wall and back fill. This will prevent earth from moving in through any irregularities in the walls.</p>

<p>The best solution is to make a good base.  It takes much more time but provides a longer lasting solution.  A trench filled with six to eight inches of crushed gravel without fines (stone dust) and mechanically compacted is considered a norm.  If you suspect the presence of ground water or soggy conditions then my good friend, four inch drain pipe with sleeve at the outside base of the wall, will help.</p>

<p>Edit: I agree with @Grady Player a sand base might work.  Are you building to last five years or twenty five years? Heavy clay soil will ""push"" any wall in the spring where a sandy soil will drain nicely. There's a lot of local soil information only you can ""base"" your judgment on. :)</p>

","<p>Mold can be lethal to seeds/seedlings if left unchecked. I germinated corn seed at one point, just to the point of root emergence, in wet paper (this was going to peat pots in the cold frame, and from there to the garden under cover, for a late May harvest).</p>

<p>Out of the 2 lbs of seed, about 2/3 of them developed mold just as the root began emerging. these were separated, and treated with potassium bicarbonate before planting, in the peat pots (which were then drenched with a biofungicide (<em>Bacillus subtilis</em>) at the first watering). I got an 85% healthy germination rate from these, which is not bad considering the conditions.</p>

<p>Out of the seeds that did not grow mold, I only got about a 20% germination, which I am guessing to be from mold forming after planting. Looking back I probably should have treated all the seeds against mold at the time they were planted.</p>

","<p>The first thing to do is dig out your tulip bulbs and have a look at them. If they appear slimy, feel soft, or smell bad, they rotted in the pot.  This would most likely be a result of poor drainage due to the soil you used and/or no drainage hole in the pot.  If the bulbs feel firm, they are probably okay and I would guess there wasn't enough soil or nutrients or moisture in the soil which may have caused them to weaken and go dormant.  </p>

<p>If your bulbs seem to be fine, store them in a cool, dry, dark place until next autumn and try again (or buy new bulbs to avoid disappointment). Buy a slightly larger pot with drainage holes, and put a layer of gravel or broken clay pot at the bottom to keep the drainage holes from becoming blocked with soil. Make sure the soil you use is free-draining. Plant the bulbs growing tip up, and 2 to 3 times as deep as the bulbs are tall, spacing them about two bulb-widths apart. Make sure the soil stays moist, but not water-logged (water only when the top of the soil is dry). Protect the pot from frost in the winter. </p>

"What is a good grass replacement plant?","2004","","<p>I don't like mowing my lawn. Is there a grass replacement plant which:</p>

<ul>
<li>looks like grass,</li>
<li>one can step on it,</li>
<li>does not need mowing?</li>
</ul>
","<p>It sounds like the best thing for you is a <strong>clover lawn</strong>, although of course it will only ""look like grass"" from a distance.</p>

<p>Recently, after noticing that many homes in my neighborhood have large patches of clover in their lawn, and knowing how difficult it has been to battle in my own lawn, I did a search on it.</p>

<p>Instead of finding many resources on how to get rid of it, I found it is actually considered/promoted by many as a lawn alternative, or combination for a healthier lawn.</p>

<p>This <a href=""http://landscaping.about.com/cs/lawns/a/clover_lawns_3.htm"">about.com article</a> lists the following qualities of clover lawns:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>It stays a luscious green all summer, without being irrigated profusely (i.e., it's drought-tolerant).</li>
  <li>It is free of weeds, obviating the need to apply herbicides. Your carpet competes so well for growing space that the competition is choked out.</li>
  <li>It doesn't need to be fertilized.</li>
  <li>It is also relatively pest-free, so that you don't have to bother spraying pesticides on it.</li>
  <li>It aerates the soil on its own, so that you don't have to worry about counteracting soil compaction.</li>
  <li>It is soft to walk on.</li>
  <li>It attracts beneficial insects, including honeybees.</li>
  <li>It rarely has to be mowed.</li>
  <li>It doesn't suffer the discoloration from dog urine known as ""dog spots.""</li>
  <li>And if, despite all these benefits, you should ever want to replace it with a different kind of green carpet, it helps you to do so by improving the soil on its watch. Its ability to aerate the soil and pump nitrogen into it means that succeeding generations of plants using that soil will be better off. </li>

"Are there any bad effects in using nematodes in pest control?","2004","","<p>I have a pest situation on my apricot tree caused by the beetle Capnodis tenebrionis (see <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/q/1132/126"">this question</a>). I am averse to using chemical pesticides, and I read that nematodes can be used to control C. tenebrionis:</p>

</ul>

<p>I'm considering using this method. My question is can the nematodes themselves become a problem? There are many <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=nematode%20disease%20fruit%20tree"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">plant diseases caused by nematodes</a>.</p>
","<p>There are ""good"" &amp; ""bad"" nematodes, therefore it's vital you get the correct ""good"" ones for your particular situation.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://wikipedia.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> there are 2 kinds of nematodes from a horticulture perspective:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Good"" nematodes = <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode#Agriculture_and_horticulture"" rel=""nofollow"">Predatory</a></li>
<li>""Bad"" nematodes = <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode#Parasitic_species"" rel=""nofollow"">Pests</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind the ""good"" nematodes will not kill the actual beetles (get rid of the problem this year). The ""good"" nematodes will feed on the beetle lava, thus reducing the possibility of experiencing the same beetle problem the following year.</p>

<p>As long as I have been listening to (nearly 4 years now), <a href=""http://www.whyy.org/91FM/ybyg/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Mike McGrath from You Bet Your Garden</a>, I can honestly say I've never heard him once warn against the use of ""good"" nematodes ie possible side effects. Yes, I have heard him warn against ""bad"" nematodes, that is why I believe it's vital you do your research and get the ""good"" guys.</p>

<p>For total peace of mind, I would do plenty of research... before deciding on the exact type of ""good"" nematodes you buy and release into your landscape.</p>

<p>Do you have a horticultural service in Israel you can contact directly and seek their specific <em>local</em> advice, expertise?</p>

<p>If you can wait a few days (probably until sometime next week), I can call and speak with a local (Missouri) registered organic farmer and seek his advise. I know for a fact he grows, apples, apricots, peaches &amp; pears on his property.</p>

<p><strong>Here is what I have been able to find out during the past few days:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Speaking with a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_gardener_program"" rel=""nofollow"">Master Gardener</a>, first they clearly stated they weren't a nematode expert (very! much like myself), but they did say they have <strong>never</strong> heard of or read anything about beneficial (good) nematodes causing ""bad"" side effects. Depending on the nematode in question, they do a very! specific job, they do not mutate (change) and start doing something else (be it ""good"" or ""bad"").</li>
</ul>

<p>The above has been my limited experience (I've only used ""good"" nematodes once), is my understanding from reading up on the subject from an organic gardening approach to controlling unwanted pests, and listening to other people talk on the subject...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Spoke with a garden pest control expert (via the Missouri Botanical Gardens), they basically confirmed what the Master Gardener had told me. They also added that beneficial (good) nematodes isn't a ""magic bullet"" to pest control, will normally take more than one application, which can become expensive depending on the individual situation, and can take 2 or 3 years before seeing real results.</p></li>
<li><p>Garden pest control expert (via the Missouri Botanical Gardens) also referred me to this, ""<a href=""http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/IPM.asp?code=214&amp;group=13&amp;level=c"" rel=""nofollow"">Beetles - Grubs</a>"" ""general"" article on MOBOT.org</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking with my local (Missouri) registered organic farmer, he has never used beneficial (good) nematodes as a pest control method. Why? On his size orchard it would be far too expensive to use such a pest control strategy. Instead he uses a product called ""Surround&#8482; WP Crop Protectant"", which works by protecting the actual fruit on the trees. Since moving to this method of pest control on his fruit tress he has gone from losing up to 70% (really bad years) of his crop to only losing about 20% (per year).</p></li>

<p>Is there any danger for my plant ? Should I kill them ? How do I kill them ? </p>

<p>They are white and very small, I can only see them when I water my plants. They start to move in the water then.</p>
","<ul>
<li>If they are worm like then they are not root mealy bug.  Those guys are white, largish and round.  You normally don't see them until you re-pot the plant or it is a terminal infestation.</li>
<li>Aphids live on the plant not in the soil</li>
<li>soil dwelling insects like fungus gnats (dark, mobile) and springtails (brown or black and jump around) and others can usually be controlled with soap and water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put a tablespoon of dish soap in a quart of water. Put the plant in the sink, pour mixture through.  Wait five or ten minutes and flush with clean water.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work you can try what I call the ""big hammer"" approach:  one tablespoon of bleach, one quart of water, pour in, wait and flush with clean water.  Be warned that this is a last resort as many plants respond poorly to this treatment</p>

<p>Edit:  water mixed with soap will clog the breathing holes (spiracles) of insects.  A few minutes not being able to breathe is sufficient to kill most insects.  Eggs, however, will survive and hatch again.  A second application of soap mixed with water after another five to seven days might be required</p>

<p>My goal is to make make my yard free of glass, such that my family and guests can walk around barefoot without fearing cutting our soles to shreds.</p>

<p>Picking the glass up is not realistic given the size of the yard, the amount of glass (everywhere), and that I know I will miss many pieces. Brown, green, and clear glass blend expertly into the moist, lush lawns found in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>I was thinking of dumping clean fill and reseeding or alternatively placing down sod. My concern would be raising the grade or not adding enough material to cover the glass. Digging out the top few inches of topsoil could counter this, though I expect this would be starting to get pricey.</p>

<p>I am wondering if my approach is the best approach or if there are perhaps other methods I can try that I haven't yet considered?</p>
","<p>There isn't an easy answer - you need to rake off all areas, scraping up as much glass as possible, probably more than once, and then dispose of it. If you try dumping topsoil or laying new sod, those glass shards will inevitably work their way back up to the top, the same way that small pebbles do, which are usually at their most obvious after winter on the surface of the soil. It would be great if you could engage a crew to do the work and have it paid for by the vendor.</p>

Quantity refers to light's intensity, while duration is the length of time the light is present. Quality of light refers to its wavelength, or color according to some scientists.</p>

"Solid stone steps or interlocking stones for front stairs","1954","","<p>I'm in the process of planning a landscaping project for the front of our house. Is there any clear benefits to using solid stone steps over smaller interlocking stones.</p>

<p>My perceived benefits for solid stone steps is that they won't warp or change shape over the years. Where as interlocking stones can loosen with high traffic.</p>

<p>Since this is the main entrance to the home. I figure it'll see a lot of traffic.</p>

<p>Is it worth the extra cost? or is it purely a cosmetic thing.</p>
","<p>In order for you to decide what is best you should think about these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>what kind of soil is under the area of the step? Clay moves, sand drains well</li>
<li>how old is the house?  Older houses <em>might</em> have less soil movement</li>
<li>is there any history of subsidence around your foundation?</li>
<li>how long are you planning to stay in the home?</li>
<li>does the area of the step have hard boundaries like walls which can keep interlock from moving?</li>
<li>do you like to do a job once and not touch it again or do you like to tinker?</li>
</ul>

<p>We live in the same province so it may be helpful to look at what house builders have been doing for the past thirty years.  Common practice was to take a pre-cast concrete step and attach it to the foundation with two steel rods as seen in this picture.  This kind of installation lasts the life of the house.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PZxt6.jpg"" alt=""precast concrete steps""></p>

<p>This method has the advantage that it's not moving: ever.  The soil around a foundation can continue to subside for many years.  Clay soils will rise and fall with the seasonal changes in moisture and any areas of poor drainage near the foundation will make this more noticeable.</p>

<p>Interlock bricks have strength when they are in contact with each other. If the soil subsides or there are no hard edges to retain or there is the possibility of water causing movement in the compacted stone dust then the installation will fail. Exposed edges are the most likely point of failure.  I have seen some imaginative solutions such as pouring concrete to form a base and then compacting stone dust but I don't know if it lasts.  Interlock pavers can also be problematic if the stone dust between the bricks settles or is washed away.  Weeds and drifting become a problem.  This can be solved by reapplication of stone dust as required or my favorite solution of polymeric sand as described <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/4682/how-to-remove-the-weeds-and-avoid-them-growing-between-the-bricks"">here</a>.</p>

<p>My preference was for solid stone steps that I installed here</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HKRjP.jpg"" alt=""Solid stone steps""></p>

<p>I ignored a few common practices putting these in. </p>

<ul>
<li>I did not prepare a new base of compacted crushed stone,instead I relied on the previously undisturbed base</li>
<li>I only used a two wheel dolly and some friends to move the 400 and 600 pound pieces</li>
</ul>

<p>I had to shim one step by one eighth of an inch after the last winter. Took five minutes.</p>

<p>I think solid stone steps are worth the expense and effort.  </p>

<ul>
<li>They have better stability if the soil moves.</li>
<li>they look better</li>
<li>less maintenance than interlock because there are less gaps</li>
</ul>

<p>but...</p>

<ul>
<li>they are more work to install.  Remember to have a slight inclination away from the house to allow water to drain</li>
<li>if the orientation of the steps means there is the chance of rainwater hitting the steps interlock will drain better and will be less likely to have ice freeze on top in the winter</li>
</ul>

","<p>Hmm, I think a little explanation about mushrooms and how they function is necessary. When you see mushrooms or toadstools, those are only the fruiting bodies of an extensive underground root system called mycelium. The reason you're getting them in that area is because you have dead wood in the ground (your tree stump and its woody roots) and in fact, the mushrooms are a good thing - it means the mycelium beneath are being extremely busy in breaking down the wood of your dead tree as part of the decomposition process. Because the area is also quite damp and shady, this means fungi can function much better, so the decomposition process is faster - but also produces more fruiting bodies.</p>

<p>If you don't want this process to proliferate over the next few years, then the only answer is to have the stump and roots ground out, as already suggested. Unfortunately, it's likely some mycelium will remain (not all the tree roots get extracted, just the main ones), but there shouldn't be so many, and they will probably decrease over time because their main food source has been removed (the dead tree). After this work has been done, rake the area level and let it settle, then go ahead with paving - but I'm not sure what you mean by 'tarp' - that usually means tarpaulin, but if you want something under your paving, you need a reasonably heavy duty permeable geo textile fabric, something a bit thicker and stronger than the stuff usually sold as 'weed fabric'. This usually goes beneath the sub-base for your paving (sand or aggregate, depending what type of paving) and not directly under the paving. It's not essential to use the fabric, although it's advisable if you use paviours (sometimes called pavers, similar to housebricks in shape and size) which are not grouted after laying, rather than actual paving slabs with grout.</p>

"Fig tree mystery worm problem","1939","","<p>A friend has a fig tree which seems to be the target of a worm. As far as I can see the leaves and fruit do not have any bite marks or worms/insects inside them, but the fruit born was less this year, and they mentioned that they think a worm or worms have burrowed into the tree's roots somehow and is killing it. </p>

<p>I researched and found that 'nematodes' are a common problem and sounded like the root of the problem, though they are apparently microscopic, and it seems like they have seen the worms themselves, so now I'm not so sure. As far as I know I don't think it is the borer/carpenter worms as there is no sawdust that they leave behind. The roots seem to be damaged almost as if medium sized parts of the bark is damaged.</p>

<p>Anyone have any ideas or know what can be done to cure the tree?</p>
","<p>Fruit drop in figs can be caused by nematodes but there are other causes.  From <a href=""http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/119501/fig-growing-nsw.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this document</a> causes include:</p>

<ul>
<li>cool weather</li>
<li>insufficient irrigation</li>
<li>weak trees and nematodes. </li>
<li>Figs that develop on the ends of branches often dry out or drop because there has not been enough heat for them to mature.</li>
<li>Smyrna-type figs will drop when they are partly
grown if they have not been pollinated.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the problem is nematodes then they cannot be seen without a microscope but you would be able to see knots or galls on the roots.</p>

<p>Control can be attempted by using bio control in the form of a green manure crop of mustard that is grown and very lightly tilled into the soil.</p>

<p>I have 5 pits that someone saved for me last year and I'm going to give them a try. However they are completely dried out. They now look like little black walnuts once I removed the brown papery covering. </p>

<p>Are these worth even trying to sprout, or once they've dried out is there no hope?</p>
","<p>If they are all dried out then they are dead.  Avocado pits need to be planted pretty quickly after being removed from their fruit.  </p>

<p>On your first success, how did you start the pit?  The method I've had the most luck with was suspending the fresh and thoroughly washed pit over a glass of water using toothpicks stuck into the seed in several spots, with the bottom of the pit kept just barely under the water and the top (more pointed part) kept out of the water and dry.  Especially if you can find a slightly overripe avocado as a subject, this generally will yield a sprout in just a few weeks. After it has a decent root system, you can move it to a regular pot with a light but moist potting soil. </p>

","<p>Do not cut the suckers or you will just get more  of them. Instead hold it at the base and pull down and get the whole thing. If the suckers are coming from under the ground dig around it and then pull the sucker out. Buy cutting them you leave a node for others to grow. The suckers weaken the tree. It's possible to root the suckers and start a new tree. As for the stake you should not leave it there more than 6 months. Like children, if you do the work for them they don't learn to do it for themselves. Staked trees will not put down deep roots. Shake a young tree gently from time to time. The simulation of wind will tell the tree it needs to put down deeper roots. If you have a deep root watering stick use it to water below the root ball. The roots will have to go down to reach the water. If you don't have one make sure you water deeply and then let the top dry out before you water again. The roots will go where the water is. The first few years will make the difference between a well rooted healthy tree and an unhealthy one. After 3 years it's to late to train it.</p>

"Is it a good idea to make a brick patio on my septic tank?","1917","","<p>I have a pile of bricks and pavers (left behind from the previous owner). My septic tank is exposed a little in one corner, right at the base of my porch steps. I was thinking of scraping the tank clean then throw the bricks right on that, and then have some overlap onto dirt/sand. Is this advised? I'll make sure the opening is easily accessible. Should I throw a layer of sand down first?</p>
","<p>I don't think it's a bad idea, but having a different surface underneath the tank in some parts of the patio and dirt under the rest could cause some problems if you aren't careful.</p>

<p>Start out by preparing the base for the patio.  You'll want to dig down a few inches in the surrounding dirt and fill it in with sand.  Make sure it's compacted <em>really</em> well - the base for a patio is critical, and since the dirt will settle but the septic tank won't, you need to make sure that most of the settling is done before the bricks go down.  You can rent a compactor from tool rental places.</p>

<p>As far as putting sand on top of the septic tank, I think you should put some down as long as you can make the entire surface level without making the sand too deep on any one part.  You don't want more than a couple inches of sand.</p>

"Can I grow spider plants in coffee?","1915","","<p>Long story short, I have stale ground coffee (whoops vacation whoops) and two spider plants growing in pure water. Can I combine the two, or is that too acidic? I know that spider plants like acid, but... perhaps that's too much. Or perhaps there's not enough in the ground coffee to feed them?</p>

<p>For context: I am a student living in university housing, so I can't easily access potting soil.</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong> To be clear, I mean to use the coffee in lieu of soil, not as a liquid growing medium.</p>
","<h1>The Verdict</h1>

<p>For this experiment, I took four different spider plants that were roughly the same health/size at the beginning of the experiment, and waited approximately ten days to note any differences. They each had roughly the same amount of light/fluid in their tubes.</p>

<p>I attempted three trials, with one Control:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Control</strong> Water (original state of all four)</li>
<li>Sample 1: Water with unbrewed ground coffee</li>
<li>Sample 2: Water with brewed ground coffee</li>
<li>Sample 3: Brewed coffee</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>The Control</h2>

<p>The control grew predictably, with no pronounced damage.</p>

<h2>Sample 1</h2>

<p>The grounds were added dry, and floated briefly before becoming water-logged and sinking. The water remained the color of brewed coffee even after the grounds settled out.</p>

<p>The sample did not grow perceptibly, though it also showed no signs of damage or sickness. The root system seems to have expanded at roughly the same rate as that of the control, though clearly this is all estimated. </p>

<h2>Sample 2</h2>

<p>The water here too became 'dark-tea' colored after adding grounds, though obviously not as dark as that of Sample 1. The root system and leaves grew at the same rate as that of the control; presumably, this was the healthiest of the non-control specimens, and was possibly even healthier than the Control.</p>

<h2>Sample 3</h2>

<p>The coffee was allowed to cool to room temperature before being added to the sample. This sample exhibited identical behavior to the first sample: Increased root system, diminished growth of the exposed greenery.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>It seems as though the caffeine <em>did</em> stunt the growth of the plants, just as <code>S. Albano</code> proposed. However, it is possible these effects are temporary. I haven't followed it long enough to conclusively determine any long-lasting benefits/risks.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Add some used coffee-grounds to whatever growth medium (soil, water, etc) you're already using; but don't replace it entirely. </p>

<h2>Further Thoughts</h2>

<p>Perhaps if watered with coffee in normal potting soil, this would be a healthier setup? Additionally, I'd like to see what happens over a longer period of time, or with diluted coffee — or, indeed, with decaf grounds. I'll keep you posted if I find anything else out!</p>

","<p>You have to wait 3 weeks or whatever is on the label to overseed.  Exactly what did you use for herbicide?  Obviously broadleaf weed killer.  The only reason you even have that problem is because your lawn is not healthy, lots of bare ground to allow weed seeds to get plenty of sun, moisture and fertilizer to out compete your grass crop.</p>

<p>We need to help you turn this around.  Pesticides/herbicides are never necessary.  They are like a Band Aid on easily prevented problems. Yes, rake the dead material up and out of your lawn.  Mow no lower than 3"".  This is one of the best ways to stop germination of weed seeds.  Aerate by pulling plugs of soil out of the lawn and leave them where they lay.  Begin a process of watering where you water very deeply (4"") and do not water again until you are able to see your footprints in the grass crop.  That means the blades are not able to stand back up as they are not turgid.  Then and then only do you water deeply.  Never water in between deep watering and those footprints.  What this does is cause weed seedlings to die for lack of water, your grass to grow deep deep roots thus becoming drought tolerant and able to thrive while weeds die.  Mowing 3"" minimum gives your grass plants the photosynthetic ability to feed those genetically programed large root systems and have plenty of energy for all other botanical processes.  Plants make their own food.</p>

<p>Fertilizer is as important as water and sunlight for all plants under our management.  Also you need to test the pH of your soil.  If it is below 6.5 you need to lime your lawn. Do not lime unless you have a test.  Never ever water a little every day.  Try not to use Scott's or Ortho products.  I am not some 'organic or au natural lover'...chemicals are chemicals no matter how they are produced.  Filler material is another story.</p>

<p>I found after decades of lawn installation and care that this 'organic' fertilizer for lawns was phenomenal.  The words organic and natural and nutrients are so misconstrued I have a hard time using them.  I have only used Dr. Earth's Lawn Fertilizer (proper formulation for the time of the season) and I don't get amazed by fertilizer results. But I was truly floored and impressed.  So much so I promote this 'organic' lawn fertilizer. This truly is worth the extra money, you have to use more of it than the synthetics, it is extended/slow release which I think is far healthier for grass, takes longer to see results, lasts longer and I could not believe the difference.  Doesn't have to be Dr. Earth but look at the labelled ingredients.  There is also bacteria for decomposing thatch. </p>

<p>Fertilizer is normally applied 4X per season for cool season grasses.  Different formulations for each application.  Fast release sells to humans who insist on immediate results.  Extended release means healthier grass and longer lasting chemicals that grass has to have to be vigorous.  You use only 2 maybe 3 applications per season, not 4 so the price is mitigated.  But so worth the extra money and extra passes over your lawn.  </p>

<p>And if you follow this advice (look up other question answers for lawns on Stack Exchange Gardening and Landscaping as well) you will not have to deal with weeds and that expense and that work.  Weeds are truly over rated in the garden world.  Knowledge is all one needs to deal with weeds and severely reduce any worries about them.  </p>

<p>Do not apply any more herbicide.  It is not necessary nor is it helpful.  If people knew basic management tenets of gardening, lawns... pesticides and herbicides are never needed. And I can say this from decades of being a licensed commercial pesticide applicator.</p>

<p>There is usually a second growth spurt during mid-autumn and then late autumn the deciduous trees will drop their leaves.

<p>Generally, I buy seeds each year. But if I have a steady supply, and it's not ill-advised, could I not save seeds for the next year? If so, what steps should I take? Is there a reason <em>not</em> to save vegetable seeds?</p>
","<p>Saving seeds for many vegetables is not hard. You need to start with open pollinated varieties and not hybrid varieties. ""Heirloom"" varieties are a good way to start. I've done ok with beans, peas, and oats as well as different kinds of flowers.</p>

<p>Doing it well so that you can have a never-ending supply of your own seeds is harder. The main issue is purity -- keeping your desired varieties from crossing with other varieties (except where you want to breed your own, but that's a whole separate discussion).</p>

<p>Different plants are pollinated in different ways (wind, insects, etc) and have different tendencies to cross-pollinate with other plants. Some vegetables need hardly any isolation -- as @winwaed says in his answer, beans can often be kept pure without making any attempt at isolating them from another variety (as long as you don't grow two varieties side by side).</p>

<p>On the other hand, corn and tomatoes (for example) are very likely to cross. If you wanted to save seed from these, and wanted to maintain a pure variety (without random crossing), you'd need to isolate the plants (or at least the blossoms) so they aren't crossed by an insect. Some people will put bags on corn, for example, and manually pollinate the corn then keep the bag on to keep it from getting wind pollinated by another plant. I've intended to use the bagging technique in the past for both tomatoes and squash but end up getting caught up in the madness of harvesting and weeding and forgetting to do it.</p>

<p>Some vegetables are difficult to save seed from, especially if you live in a cold climate. Biennials don't set seed until their second year of growth, and most vegetables will winter-kill if left in the garden over a cold winter. Carrots, for example, are a biennial, and will usually rot (at least here in Zone 5b) before they can regrow and send up a seed stalk.</p>

<p>For some vegetables, there are special techniques to harvesting seed. With tomatoes, for example, you <a href=""http://gardening.about.com/od/totallytomatoes/ss/TomatoSeeds.htm"">have to put them in a cup and let them ferment for a bit</a>.</p>

<p>The go-to guide for collecting vegetable seed is ""Seed to Seed"" by Suzanne Ashworth. It has some general / introductory seed saving info in the beginning, and then a species-by-species reference that makes up the bulk of the book. It has considerations for the minimum population size needed to ensure genetic diversity (ie avoiding too much inbreeding), isolation distances, growing, and cleaning techniques for almost any vegetable you might find in a U.S. garden.</p>

<p>An additional book of interest is <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/086571553X"">""Gardening When It Counts"" by Steve Solomon</a>. It is a general gardening book, but includes a section near the back of the book with information on a limited number of common garden vegetables and some practical advice on saving seed from each of them. He also debunks the pair of ideas that you can't start seed-saving with hybrid varieties and that ""heirloom"" varieties are a good choice for the novice seed-saver. (He's the original founder of Territorial Seed Company, so I'm willing to listen to his advice on this topic.)</p>

"Does fruit on fruit trees need to be thinned?","1904","","<p>Do fruits need to be thinned on the tree? For example, I have a young <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomelo"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pomelo</a> tree that's producing fruit for the first time. In order to get bigger, nicer fruit, should I be thinning the fruit? How is it done?</p>

<p>Here's a good example cluster from my Pomegranate tree:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ibv7w.jpg"" alt=""Pomegranate cluster""></p>
","<h3>What is ""thinning""</h3>

<p>Thinning simply refers to the process of removing fruit from the tree when it is still small (or not fully ripened). Some fruit trees require more thinning than others. For e.g., it is common to talk about thinning peaches/apples/apricots, but not cherries. While ""how much to thin"" might depend on the type of fruit tree, the reasons for thinning and the benefits are general.</p>

<h3>Why should you thin?</h3>

<p>Fruit trees usually produce way more fruit than they can handle. Depending on how the pruning was done, the exact amount can vary, but in general, they do. Just as with everything else in nature, fruits on a tree compete with each other for essential nutrients and space. This can become a problem with young trees that are </p>

<ol>
<li>not strong enough to support the weight of the fruits and</li>
<li>not big enough to provide nutrition to all the fruits.</li>
</ol>

<p>While these are the primary reasons for thinning, there are other benefits to it.</p>

<h3>Benefits of thinning</h3>

<ol>
<li>Once you thin the fruits, the remaining fruits have more space to grow, so you get bigger fruits.</li>
<li>More space leads to more air circulation and sunlight, which in turn leads to better fruit flavor and color.</li>
<li>A common reason for fruit rot on the tree is because the fruits are touching each other closely. The decay occurs where they touch, because the skin couldn't breathe. Thinning reduces the chances of this occurring.</li>
<li>Less chance of damage to the tree (My &lt;1 yr old peach tree almost broke in two because it was burdened with 7 enormous peaches and I did not know about thinning back then. Also I did not expect a tree this young to bear fruit! Luckily the gophers did it for me.)</li>
<li>Since the tree can now support the smaller number of fruits, it is not overburdened with supplying nutrition to the fruits.</li>

"Is it safe to add compostable plastics to my compost pile?","1896","","<p>A couple stores I frequent now use, or are starting to use, plastic bags and cups that say they're compostable. Are these safe to add to my compost pile or are they just more environmentally friendly for landfills?</p>
","<p>I suspect the answer is still no, they're not suitable for your compost heap. There is currently a programme in action at Imperial College in London which is making good progress on producing plastic bags and the like made from degradable polymer, which should be compostable. </p>

<p>However, most 'biodegradable' plastic bags currently are polylactide based, and these need high temperatures of the sort achieved in industrial facilities to ensure breakdown rather than what you might achieve in your compost heap. The current crop of these plastics otherwise requires sunlight and air to break down - placing in landfill or in the middle of a compost heap means the breakdown process will be slow or non existent. This polylactide product has metals added which help it to biodegrade, but according to a Swedish study recently, the process is also halted by cool or cold, damp conditions. Since that description applies to most of the Northern hemisphere during the winter, 'biodegradable' in this case appears to be a very loose term indeed. </p>

<p>Given optimum conditions, polylactide based plastics should, in theory, biodegrade within 3 years - in reality, that is not what's happening because they're not in optimum conditions. There is also a big question mark over the metals they contain and what happens to those within the environment, never mind your compost heap.
So on balance, I'd not recommend putting them in your compost heap unless you are sure they are polymer based and, so far as I'm aware and have been able to ascertain, these won't be available for another 5 years or so, unless someone out here has already perfected the process and has marketed them.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 14th September</strong>: sorry only just seen your comment that the cup you have is made from PLA - PLA is polylactide, not polymer (vegetable origin) so I wouldn't be putting it on my compost heap. Although you could try one, I'd love to know if/how long it takes to degrade, and whether you have fragments of plastic in its place rather than a whole cup. Which is what I'm betting will happen, no idea how long that'll take, I suspect 3-5 years, but it'd be interesting to see.</p>

","<p>Ornamental chile peppers are perfectly safe to eat, including <a href=""http://www.bountifulseeds.com/en/capsicum-annuum/68-little-elf-chilli-pepper-seeds.html"">Little Elf</a>.</p>

<p>I've only grown one kind of ornamental pepper, so far: <a href=""http://www.rareseeds.com/chinese-5-color-pepper/"">Chinese 5 Color</a>. I understand Chinese 5 Color is supposed to taste better than most ornamental peppers do. Usually, ornamental peppers are not said to have much taste appeal. Chinese 5 Color tastes pretty good when it's purple (the first phase), but when fully ripe it's unpleasant to my taste. It's quite hot either way, but the heat seems to be a much more pleasant kind of heat while purple.</p>

<p>So, in essence, some ornamental peppers may not be palatable, but they shouldn't poison you or anything either way.</p>

<p>So, I recommend trying these at each color phase. It's possible you might like yellow more than red, or vice versa.</p>

<p>I do caution you, however, to make sure they actually are peppers. If they're not peppers (but rather a related nightshade species), they might be toxic to eat.</p>

"Are old green zucchini commonly orange inside?","1888","","<p>I was under the impression that zucchini are always supposed to be their regular color inside (pale green or whatever you want to call it). However, twice now I've seen large zucchini that are orange inside (from different people growing them in the same town, on different years). I thought maybe it was cross-pollination the first time, but the person who gave it to me this year wasn't growing anything else but zucchini. So, I'm thinking either they must have the same variety of unique zucchini (which is possible), or zucchini must commonly get like that when it's large (I know it's not always like that).</p>

<p>Anyway, my question is, is this normal? We've grown zucchini lots of times in the past, but only this year and last have I noticed green fruits with orange interiors. The first year, the variety was called Black. This year, I don't know what it is, but it <em>looks</em> like the same variety to me.</p>

Zucchini are eaten when immature and they typically have green skin and pale green pulp. However when they mature the interior (and often also the skin) tends to become orange and the taste is not very good. </p>

<p>So I believe what you got it's normal when the fruit matures. Again, outcomes can vary a lot for different cultivars. </p>

"Should I be concerned about Ginkgo leaves yellowing in early July?","1881","","<p>Three weeks ago I bought a potted Ginkgo biloba from a local nursery, with strong green leaves. I've never looked after a Ginkgo before but I watered it every other day apart from the day we had heavy rain. It's been in a sunny spot and I've recently moved it into a part of the garden where it's shaded on one side.</p>

<p>This is how it looked the day I bought it:</p>

<p>I live in the south-east of England.</p>
","<p>The yellowing and hint of browning indicates insufficient water. The pot its in is now too small and the tree needs planting, either into a larger pot or into the ground. Relying on rain, however heavy, to water plants in pots is not a good idea, they should still be watered anyway, and because this plant is probably root bound, it can't hang onto enough water because the soil to root ratio isn't right. </p>

<p>The best thing to do right now is pot it up into something larger, keep it well watered, then plant into the ground come autumn, again keeping it watered during dry spells for the first year or two. If its going to stay in a pot for a while, water when the surface of the compost feels just dry to the touch, and  water copiously, allowing the excess to drain away freely from the base of the pot. And because of where you live (which is where I am too) another piece of advice - if you decide to keep it in a pot, keep a careful eye on it during October in particular, if October turns out to be dry and not very cold - it will still need watering.</p>

"What's wrong with my chili bush?","1880","","<p>I've had a chili bush I grew from seed for about a year now, and it's finally growing into something resembling an actual bush (rather than just a seedling) and it was going great until the last few weeks.</p>

<p>The new leaves are starting to kind of crinkle, and the most recent new shoots look as though they're dying entirely.</p>

<p>In spite of this it's bravely trying to grow a pepper on it!</p>

<p>But yeah - couldn't see any pests (other than the stupid things that ate the leaves further down the plant a month or so ago which are no longer affecting it) so am I looking at bacteria, fungus, virus, or deficiency here? Or something else?!</p>

<p>Location: Brisbane, Australia. It's late Summer here. Soil is clay, although clay breaker has been used occasionally on it, and the grass nearby has been fertilised recently.</p>

<p>Here's some pics in case it helps:</p>

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nDOen.jpg"" alt=""Whole chili bush in case it helps""></p>

<p>EDIT: Accepting diagnosis answers is tougher than I envisaged!</p>

<p>So, since originally posting this, I refertilized (herb/veggie fertilizer) which seemed to only very slightly help. Then, we had a cyclone, which dumped 150+mm of rain onto the soil, which also helped a bit, then I cleared the grass in a 50cm diameter circle away from the base, added weed control sheeting, topped with a little new soil, and fertilized with some stuff that had higher calcium concentrations in it than most fertilizer. Result is:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Eq14R.jpg"" alt=""New shoots after calcium, water, and grass removal""></p>

<p>Doesn't look completely better, but seems a lot less unhappy. So it's really hard to tell which of the three things it was that made the most difference, and I won't really know unless the plant starts to get worse again. As it is, it seems like the new shoots are much less curled (but not completely flat) so... yeah. Here's a pic of the whole bush showing the base etc:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YR5G4.jpg"" alt=""Whole bush with base cleared""></p>

<p>EDIT: Latest pics after drenching in eco oil and pyrethrum a week or so ago.</p>

<p>As of last week, this is what the worst affected parts of the plant were starting to look like:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0bzDH.jpg"" alt=""Worst affected parts example""></p>

<p>I finally tried absolutely drenching the plant in eco oil and pyrethrum (both sides of all the leaves, all trunk/stem surfaces... to the point it was dripping liberally off onto the ground underneath it.) A week or so later, it started to look like it was throwing out new leaves and these weren't affected, so I trimmed off the older damaged foliage etc, and this is now the result:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/c1ipt.jpg"" alt=""Treated and trimmed plant, much happier""></p>

<p>It... certainly is very suggestive that it might have been a pest that was not easily seen... will wait to make sure it's still on the right track, but all things going well I'd say this will finally get a resolution in a few weeks or so... capsid guy is looking good so far :)</p>

<p>EDIT: update after a year of trying to nail this persistent sucker.</p>

<p>So my latest update to this is that none of the above appears to have made a lasting difference. After a lot of reading up and experimenting over the year I'm almost certain now that this is a virus, and I suspect it is spread by midges or similar. Spraying with white oil and pyrethrum not just on the chili bush but also on surrounding grass, plants, vegetation, and weed reservoirs appears to dramatically slow the spread of the disease from reaching new plants, but you need to keep applying the spray every two to four weeks or it wears off and the bugs come back, and then a few weeks later so does the curl.</p>

<p>If you give it fertilizer and make it generally happy with water and light and warmth etc it seems to be able to outgrow small infections reasonably well, but once it starts to get too infected you have to basically kill it and burn the bush to prevent spreads. The bush in the images above is now sadly cut off to the ground and burnt, though the stump has started to sprout some leaves so we'll see if the below-ground portion is okay or not.</p>

<p>The Bhut Jolokia and Butch T chili plants I also grow are also possibly to be affected by the virus, but not as strongly.</p>
","<p>Capsid bug damage looks like this - as the distorted leaves grow, they should look tatty and have holes. Whether its thrips or capsid, it's difficult to see the bugs themselves, you usually only know there's a problem with them because of the distorted and puckered appearance of the affected plant.</p>

<p>Some sort of pesticide spray seems to be necessary - check what's available in your area which is suitable for food plants. This usually means a non systemic treatment, and it will need to be applied frequently, but check the instructions.</p>

"Tomatoes...what is the difference between early blight and late blight?","1876","","<p>What are the differences in early and late blight of tomatoes?  Can you cut off affected areas of one or both to prolong the life of the plant? What can one do to prevent this disease, what can one do to stop the infection, what can one do to prevent the disease the next season?  </p>
","<p>Here's the biggest difference: <strong>Late blight is caused by the pathogen <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytophthora_infestans"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Phytophthora infestans</em></a>, while early blight is caused by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternaria_solani"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Alternaria solani</em></a>.</strong></p>

<p><em>Phytophthora infestans</em> is an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oomycete"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">oomycete</a>, a fungus-like eukaryotic microorganism. It is similar to <em>Alternaria solani</em> (a fungus) in that it is a <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localized_disease"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">localized disease</a>, and doesn't spread internally</strong>. <em>P. infestans</em> is a more aggressive disease, and spreads much faster than <em>A. solani</em>. It also kills all infected material, causing dark, watery spots to form. these eventually become hard and brown.</p>

<p><strong>Control of <em>P. infestans</em></strong> is very difficult. There is no cure for badly infected plants.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you notice signs of infection, <strong>remove all affected parts</strong> and destroy them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If the disease spreads anyway, destroy the entire plant.</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You can prevent it to some extent by:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Rotating your crops</strong> every year, remembering that both tomatoes and potatoes are susceptible to <em>P. infestans</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Destroying all affected crops as soon as possible.</strong> Remove them from the site, and burn them, or place in air-tight bags and send to the landfill. Do not compost.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Growing resistant varieties</strong> like 'Defiant', 'Plum Regal', 'Mountain Magic 'and 'Mountain Merit'</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Control of <em>A. solani</em></strong> is easier, but it's best to prevent the disease, or catch it early.

<li><p><strong>Remove all leaves showing signs</strong> of early blight (yellowing, dry margin, large to small round dead spots.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not touch the unaffected leaves</strong> with the removed portions, or your hands until they are thoroughly washed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spray with a copper fungicide</strong> (like BONIDE© Liquid Copper Fungicide). Apply once every 5 days, and after any rain. Continue for 3-4 weeks, or until the plant stops developing the symptoms. </p></li>

<p>To prevent future attacks, you can try to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Minimize soil-foliage contact</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the plants get good <strong>air circulation</strong> (including proper spacing)</p></li>
<li><p>When you water, <strong>try not to wet the foliage</strong>, or splash soil onto the leaf undersides. The fungus spreads faster in wet conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>To go along with that, an organic <strong>mulch</strong> will help keep soil from splashing, and is also useful for many other reasons.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the plants have a <strong>support</strong> to climb on.</p></li>

<li>Would one  suggest me to leave it a little time, and try for instance propagation by cuttings?</li>
</ul>
","<p>To be honest, I'd have those plants out of there, totally remove them, and plant new ones. Doesn't have to be lavenders if you can't keep up with the maintenance on them, and they may recover a bit anyway, if your weather has been cold during spring as it has here in the UK. So, you can either just wait and see if they put out new growth, if you can stand looking at them as they are, or take them out and replant. Lavenders aren't long term plants really - with correct maintenance, you can keep them going and looking quite good for five years quite easily, sometimes longer if you've been particularly rigorous, pruning correctly and often enough, but after 5-8 years, they're usually replaced because of their refusal to grow from old wood. If you do replace with lavender (I'm assuming its a full sun area, because that's what they like) choose dwarf or smaller varieties.</p>

<p>UPDATED ANSWER</p>

<p>In response to your comment, yes you can certainly take cuttings, they strike quite easily, and you could grow them on and maybe replant with those next year, or even by autumn if they're big enough. Softwood cuttings should be taken within the next month though, link contains propagation info</p>

","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liriope_muscari""><em>Liriope muscari</em></a> is rather challenging to grow from seed. For one thing, the pulp contains <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphenol"">phenolic</a> compounds which inhibit germination, so the seeds must be cleaned well before use. Seeds also have a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_dormancy"">morphological dormancy</a> because the embryo is not fully developed when the fruit ripens, so a period of <a href=""http://gardening.about.com/od/seedstarting/g/Seed-Stratification.htm"">warm stratification</a> is required to complete maturation. The seeds do not store well. Plant them in the fall, after the stratification period is over, in a flat of coarse, sterile seed-starting mix. Push the seeds into the mix surface, and cover in 1/4"" of fine grit. Keep the mix damp, and place over a bottom heat of about 75-80°F.. The seeds should germinate in 25-40 days, at a rate of at least 75%.</p>

<p>The seeds are  <a href=""http://www.actahort.org/members/showpdf?booknrarnr=517_8"">polyembryonic</a>, so many of the seeds will put up multiple initial leaves, and should be separated carefully when 2-3"" tall, and grown on in individual cells until the frost is out in spring, at which time they can be moved outdoors, either into the ground, or into larger cells for plug planting later. Begin fertilizing with a weak, balanced fertilizer at separation, and don't start full-strength fertilization until they are moved outdoors.</p>

<p>Even though the germination rate is very low, the polyembryonic feature often provides over twice the number of seedlings than the number of seeds initially sown. Expect differing growth rates from the seedlings, as they will differ genetically from the parent, to a degree. For a uniform crop, cull for:</p>

<ul>
<li>leaf length</li>
<li>leaf width</li>
<li>leaf color</li>
<li>rate of growth</li>
<li>disease resistance</li>

<li><p>Water retaining material is traditionally Peat Moss, in the US it's mostly <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphagnum"" rel=""noreferrer"">Sphagnum Moss</a> imported from <a href=""http://www.peatmoss.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Canada.</a> One thing to be aware of is, nearly all Peat Moss has a low <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"" rel=""noreferrer"">pH</a> (usually somewhere in the range of 4.0 to 5.0), therefore this needs to be taken into account when mixing your own potting mixes. Generally speaking the ""sweet spot"" for nearly all potting mixes is a pH of 6.5</p>

<ul>
<li>One alternative water retaining material is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coir"" rel=""noreferrer"">Coir</a>. Can be bought in a ""brick"" format, excessive salt can be an issue depending on the process used. If the label of the ""brick"" shows excessive salt content, the coir should be washed ""thoroughly"" before use.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Drainage material is traditionally coarse sand.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some alternative drainage materials are, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlite"" rel=""noreferrer"">Perlite</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermiculite"" rel=""noreferrer"">Vermiculite</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_hulls"" rel=""noreferrer"">Rice Hulls</a>.</li>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a ""general"" potting mix that <a href=""http://www.gatewaygreening.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Gateway Greening</a> have settled on (at least for the time being, as they also continually carryout experiments with different formulas):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>5ft&#179; (0.142m&#179;) of Peat Moss (sieved) - Water retaining material.</p></li>
<li><p>5ft&#179; (0.142m&#179;) of Perlite - Drainage material.</p></li>
<li><p>5ft&#179; (0.142m&#179;) of Worm Castings (sieved) - Plant food (fertilizer) material.</p></li>
<li><p>1 quart (1.1 Litre) of (finely crushed) Lime Stone - Added to increase the pH level, remember, Peat Moss has a low pH (usually somewhere in the range of 4.0 to 5.0).</p></li>
<li><p>1 quart (1.1 Litre) of Bone Meal - Added to increase the amount of Phosphorus available to the newly germinated plants eg Help with root growth.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The above mixture is then thoroughly dry mixed together. Once that is completed, water is added to the dry mixture via a fine mist. This is a two person job, as one person drops the dry mixture through the air, the other person adds the water to the falling mixture. The potting mixture should end up moist (like a damp sponge), but not so wet that when you squeeze it water runs out.</p>

<p>The above potting mixture quantities make enough potting mix for at least 50 seedling trays, and works out at about 38&#162; per tray.</p>

<p>Two weeks after the seeds have been sown in the potting mix, they receive a ""weak"" Fish based fertilizer feed. This is done to ensure the newly germinated plants have enough nutrients (food) in the soil to help them grow properly.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We were also (given) pointed toward an excellent potting mix reference, it basically contains all of the above, plus a lot! more information:</p>

","<p>There is so much genetic variation in the genus Prunus that each seed will produce a different tree and the only way to be sure of the outcome of the fruit is to grow clones from a mother plant.  Based on the size of those fruits I'd say it's probably a seed grown individual and you won't find any like it.  The good news, however, is that anything in the genus Prunus (apricots, plums, peaches, nectarines, almonds etc can potentially pollinate your tree as long as they are blooming around the same time, and bees will travel for miles to pollinate them in early spring.  So what we can deduce from this is that if you live in an isolated or rural area where other plants in this genus are rare, you can boost pollination by planting anything from that genus that blooms around the same time (especially another plum.)  If you live in a  city, odds are there is plenty of pollen all over the place and the tree is not fruiting either because of environmental stresses, or just because that particular genetic individual is not a heavy fruit setter.  Based on the apparent health of the tree and the size of those fruits, I would assume the latter. </p>

","<p>As far as I am aware, fertilizer burn is a result of too much fertilizer causing the water in the plant to be drawn out. This makes leaves look, well, burned. </p>

"Sprinkler/irrigation system for new yard: DIY or hire a professional?","1857","","<p>My backyard is essentially a wasteland; I plan on installing an irrigation system along with landscaping, hardscaping, shrubs, trees, retaining walls, etc.</p>

<p>As far as I've been able to discern so far, I want to get my layout done first, and start on an irrigation system before any other features go in.</p>

<p>That said, I've been wondering whether this is the sort of project I want to tackle on my own (to save money) or if I am better off hiring a professional company.</p>

<p>I am aware of some of the concepts behind designing and installing such a system (low spots, zones, dual-coverage of all areas) but I wonder if there's enough of a cost savings to justify venturing into this project on my own.</p>

<p>I am looking for advice from those who have designed and installed their own, and whether you would do it again.</p>

<p><em>My lawn is about 3600 sq. foot and is essentially a flat rectangle.</em></p>
","<p>I've done all my own irragation. I would do it again myself. Here is why.</p>

<ol>
<li>You know what was done. What grade of pipe was used, proper cleaner/glue, quality of valves and timer. I've seen lots of shoddy installations at other houses.</li>
<li>You know where the pipes are running. Take photos of everything. This really helps when you need to dig later. </li>
<li>It is not all that hard compared to many other DIY projects. Pipes are easy to carry. Glue is easy to work with. The materials are not very expensive. Compared to pouring concrete or building a retaining wall this is easy.</li>
<li>You can take your time. You can spen a few days installing everything. It does not have to be finished quickly, like concrete.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some downsides:</p>

<ol>
<li>It takes time. You could be watching tv/fishing/bowling instead!</li>
<li>There is a lot of digging. Rent a trencher.</li>
<li>You will get dirty!</li>
<li>You will get wet!</li>
<li>You will probably have to fix a leak!</li>
</ol>

<p>Some tips:</p>

<ol>
<li>Buy the thicker PVC pipe.</li>
<li>Consider above ground valves. It is no fun working on valves when they are below ground and in the mud.</li>
<li>Put in more zones than fewer. Think about sun/shade/soil differences.</li>
<li>If you are putting more than one pipe in a trench color code them. This will really help when you need to add to a zone later.</li>
<li>If possible, put the timer where you can see the water when it is running. </li>
<li>Use better quality sprinkler heads.</li>
<li>Bury the pipes deeper than you need. That way when you need a taller sprinkler head you can just install it. You can always use a taller riser.</li>
<li>Make sure the sprinkler heads are below the surface of the lawn. The kids don't like stepping on them when they are running around.</li>
<li>Make a test run before burrying everything. Check for leaks!</li>
<li>Get the proper tools. Do not cut pvc pipe with a saw. You'll have to deburr every cut.</li>
<li>Don't forget to flush the pipes before installing the heads!</li>

"How do you collect and keep cucumber seeds for planting the next year?","1855","","<p>So I see there are seeds in cucumbers. But they're always so soft that I don't notice them when I eat the cucumbers.</p>

<p>I'm assuming that means the seeds are just young and not ready to be collected yet (kind of like how watermelon seeds start soft then harden). So how do I know when the seeds are ready to take from the cucumbers and what do I need to do to collect and keep them?</p>
","<p>Pumkins, squash and cucumbers all are pretty easy to propagate by seed.</p>

<p>The important part is letting the fruit ripen thoroughly so the seeds finish formation.</p>

<p>So, you have to let one of your Zucchini or Cucumbers completely harden up (develop a rind) and change to full ripe color, ie leave it on the vine till the vine's nearing death. Winter Squash tend to be the least hassle for most people to save seeds from because you let them fully ripen for harvest anyway.</p>

<p>Cut it open, scoop out the seeds, wash them clean and set them out on paper towels to dry. You don't want them to remain damp, they will mold and rot.</p>

<p>Viable seeds will have a hull developed, semi hard because it's still damp which will dry out to form a tough seed case.</p>

I want to make sure it grows in a healthy, maintainable way, but my only experience of pruning fruit trees is with apples.   Should I treat this tree the same way as an apple, and prune at the same time, or should I approach this differently?</p>
","<p>First, a disclaimer: I haven't pruned a cherry tree (yet); this year will be the first :) But I did do some research when I bought them and here are the important things to keep in mind.</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep strong, firm lateral branches that stick out from the central trunk and prune the smaller ones. Cherry trees need sunlight and good air circulation around them and so some pruning techniques like ""pyramid"" etc which work on apples are not really useful here.</li>
<li>The natural tendency for the lateral branches is to grow vertically and hence they need to be ""forced"" to grow outwards by weighing them down.</li>
<li>Prune cherries in late winter for the best growth in spring/summer. Pruning them too early might result in infections. </li>
<li>Summer prune them <em>only</em> if you want to control their growth.</li>
</ol>

<p>That said, you might want to look up and see if there are additional requirements for your cherry tree type. Mine is a hybrid low chill requirement cherry tree (because where I am, there isn't really a winter season), that still needs to be pruned with the ""seasons"". Also, because I'm constrained for space, I'll be pruning them in summer to check their growth. In any pruning, this is important to bear in mind: </p>

<p>Winter pruning -> Encourages growth &amp; fruit bearing in spring.</p>

<p>Summer pruning -> Discrourages growth for the rest of the season.</p>

"what care should I give my lemon and orange tree after 8 months neglect?","1844","","<p>In July I moved into a new house with an established lemon tree (about 4-5 m high) and orange tree (3-4 m high). Apart from collecting the last crop we have left them alone. 
The previous tenants grew their own vegies, so I assume the trees were cared for up until about April last year.</p>

<p>Today I stripped off a vine that had been growing all over them, and I wonder what care should I give them now. I assume I should get rid of all the stuff growing under them. Is it too late/early to fertilise (I'm in Sydney, so it is midsummer)?</p>

<p>Some of the leaves on the lemon are a bit yellow, but that might be from being overgrown by the vine.</p>
","<p>Did the trees flower over the last few months? Do they currently have small green fruit on them? If so then you have a chance to save the current crop in which case you should definitely fertilise. Use a good quality citrus fertiliser. For trees of that size you will need to apply quite a bit. It has taken me a few seasons of caring for the established citrus trees I moved into a place with to get my head around how hungry they are. Without enough fertiliser you will get a lot of fruit drop.</p>

<p>If you don't have fruit on your tree now then you've missed this seasons crop so fertilising or not won't make a huge difference, but it can't hurt.</p>

<p>You should definitely clear all grass and weeds in the area under the trees. Citrus do not like grass etc growing in the root zone. Be careful when removing the weeds as citrus have relatively shallow roots than can be disturbed by vigorous digging. Once you've cleared the root zone, put down a goodly layer of cow manure (and fertilizer) then top with mulch such as sugarcane or lucern.</p>

<p>Yellow leaves can be a sign of general nutrient deficiency (lack of fertiliser) or specific lack of zinc and magnesium. First thing is to clear the weeds, mulch and fertilise. If you still have problems you can investigate further.</p>

<p>The other thing you probably want to do it give them a good prune. If they have fruit on them just take off the worst looking leaves and any dead wood at this point. If not, then you could take the opportunity to prune them harder, in particular opening up the middle of the tree and removing any diseased leaves (leafminer, black scale etc). My established citrus have been doing much better since I gave them a hard prune after I suspect several years of no pruning. Just avoid doing this while they are fruiting or you will lose that crop (most likely).</p>

<p>In general, citrus need a fair bit of TLC to keep them going well. I'm in northern Sydney and find that unless I keep up a consistent schedule of applying white oil then leafminer and black scale take over. I also get a lot of bronze sucking bugs (commonly known as stink bugs) which I remove with a pair of tweezers. Again I find that unless I go around at least once a week or so the bug population gets out of hand. Personally I'd find it difficult to give this attention to a 4 metre high tree, so I now keep mine to around 2-2.5m high. This obviously makes picking the fruit much easier as well.</p>

<p>Firstly, am I even right in diagnosing this as sun-scorching? If so, how can I prevent it? The obvious option would be to move it to a place with more shade. However, I'd rather wait till Jan-Feb when it'll be dormant, to move the plant. An alternate would be to cover it with a black netting that cuts the sunlight, yet allows it to breathe.

<p>If you are able to get larger size material (12"" to 16"" + pot size) these plants are more stable and able to withstand less than optimum conditions.</p>

"Help needed to keep away weeds coming from a creek","1801","","<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>

<p>There is a small creek in my backyard and it's a nightmare to maintain. A lot of weeds grow there and spill over to my land, some of them growing up to three or four feet tall and are very dense. The portion of my land that is adjacent to such creek is 265 feet long. This is a warm climate (Puerto Rico to be exact), so they will always grow there. My goal is to keep them at bay, and not entirely eradicate them (I know that is impossible)
Here are some photos so you can have an idea:</p>

<p><strong>What I Have Tried:</strong></p>

<p>I have been hiring people to chop it down, but I dont want to spend money on that every single month. I have tried to lay down one of those landscape fabrics, but that was entirely futile. And I dont want to spray herbicide... it's a creek, and I dont want to pollute.
Any research that I do online is for smaller problems, like pulling them out (already tried that, believe it or not), or spreading bark mulch (its too much, 265 feet, and the water of the creek will eventually swipe it), etc.</p>

<p><strong>What I Plan:</strong></p>

<p>My next idea will be to try and plant some tenacious shrubs that can compete against those weeds and keep them at bay. But which ones can handle this (almost everything grows here in this climate)? I had in mind Bougainvillea (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bougainvillea"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bougainvillea</a>) since I have heard they are very hardy.</p>

<p><strong><em>Any other idea is really welcomed.</em></strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Additional Comments:</strong></p>

<p>These comments originated from the responses below.</p>

<ol>
<li>My main reason for battling the weeds is that they look ugly and propagate too FAST into my land, in which I'm starting a vegetable garden. Sure, not a life-threatening situation, so I will reconsider my stance a bit. Note that I want to keep them at bay, and not entirely eradicate them (I know that is impossible)</li>
<li>The water doesn't get too high, even in torrential rains, which happens once every one or two months. And yes, there is a gradual slope in which I can put plants. I have included two additional photos.</li>
<li>Yes, the soil inside my land is not the best. Some time ago, an excavator went through it to clear the ditch, and it compacted the land and also toiled the soil in the creek a lot (since I have started a vegetable garden, I won't allow any more excavators or heavy machinery). But the actual soil at the edge of the ditch is somewhat loose and easy to toil and with good drainage.</li>
</ol>
","<p>Reading your question, I'm moved to ask, ""Why cut the weeds in the channel at all?"" You mow to the edge, and could much more easily manage weeds on the level ground. The weeds, though tall, do not seem to block any kind of view. Finally, the dense vegetation in the ditch is an excellent buffer for water entering from your property and will slow the movement of water through the channel. <a href=""http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/stormwater/toolkit/swales.html"">Slowing movement of water is generally desirable</a> in such channels, though you don't want to slow it down so much that it ponds up over the banks. </p>

<p>But assuming you still want to deal with the weeds:</p>

<p>Your plan is really the only good way to go about it. You've got to get something in there that will out-compete the weeds. </p>

<p>One issue you are sure to have to deal with is the existing weed seed bank. I'm glad you don't want to use herbicide, but that limits your ability to deal with the weeds. You also won't want to till along those banks. You could try prepping the site by <a href=""http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn74145.html"">solarizing the soil</a> after cutting the weeds to the ground, but this will have limited use as it will not be very effective against perennial weeds. </p>

<p>Ultimately success will depend on what you plant there. Bougainvillea sounds like it would be a decent choice - just make sure you get a shrubby and sprawling variety that doesn't want to climb. Depending on how how high the water gets and how often it gets there, you might be limited in how far down the slope it will survive. From what I read, this plant needs good drainage also. Judging from the foreground of your photo, I'd guess the soil is somewhat compacted and not well draining. If you do go this route, you'll still want to manage weeds until the Bougainvillea are established. Depending on how densely you can plant that could take several years.</p>

"Is drylok a good option for an aquaponics fish tank?","1799","","<p>I've been looking into making a 3000-4000 liter system. When the water tank came in to play I wasn't happy with the sky-high prices so the next option was to dig a hole. For cover I found EPDM pond liner, but that posed its own problems and is also expensive. Then I saw a post on using drylok. I'm wondering if this product can handle that. Also does it have any adverse effects on the fish or plants... or me when harvest time comes?</p>
","<p>A setup for 112 gallons is quite different than a 3000 to 4000 litre system.  The water alone will weigh 3000 to 4000 kilograms ( ~8800 pounds!).  This amount of weight implies being sited on the ground on something like a concrete slab or using pond liner with a cushion layer.</p>

<p>If you were to use Dryloc, which is meant to be applied on concrete, the concrete would have to be added to your static load, unless you meant to build an in ground tank.  If that were your choice EPDM pond liner would be much easier but it's not cheap.</p>

<p>Finally, lets talk about safety.  EPDM pond liner can be purchased that is food safe. Firestone EPDM PondGuard, Hypalon, Permalon (layered HDPE) are brands I have seen.</p>

<p>Dryloc is not designed for use with food. Seeing as the main ingredients are limestone and resins it might be safe but there is no certification.</p>

<p>The question was asked about what shape of tank is better when using pond liner. Circular is a little better but no matter what you do you will get folds and creases in the liner.  Water goes where it wants to so to prevent capillary action allowing water to go up and out of your pond you can construct it using this method below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/u8VUn.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>By folding the liner on top of a block or stone you accomplish two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>it's now safer to stand on the edge as your weight is distributed over the area of the block</li>
<li>any water moving via capillary action  up the folds and creases will remain in the tank</li>
</ul>

<p>After you have the liner in place and the perimeter set up let things settle for a few days.  You can only cut the liner once and it is difficult to patch.</p>

<p>You might want to consider how you will prevent someone falling into the tank and drowning. While not technically a swimming pool some cities apply the same rules about fences and gates that are locked.</p>

","<p>Yes, they do tend to point downwards, although if your weather is very warm and dry, it may need a couple of gallons twice a week for the first year. Looks pretty healthy to me, but keep up the watering - if it flowers this year, then remember to increase watering when/if fruit starts to form, particularly during dry spells.</p>

<p>UPDATE: If it flowered, its ready to fruit. The flowers it had either weren't fertilised and fell naturally, or there was a water shortage and they just shrivelled, though sometimes heavy cold can shrivel them before fertilisation. I don't see any signs of flowers remaining on the tree indicating other problems, and everything looks pretty healthy from the picture.</p>

"How to prevent raspberries from shriveling before they've matured?","1779","","<p>I have a 5 foot tall Fall Gold Raspberry plant. I bought it as a 4 foot plant from the local nursery earlier this year. It has been producing quite a lot of berries. There are perhaps 20 growing on this plant at the moment. The problem is that the fruit shrivels before it reaches mature size. Here is someone else's photo to show what a mature Fall Gold raspberry looks like:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o7Uvd.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>All of my berries start shriveling at half that size. I have eaten them before they've shriveled and they are quite sweet and aromatic. However, I'd prefer to eat larger meatier berries. This is a photo of my my shriveled berries:</p>

<p>This is a photo of the entire plant. It is planted along a southeast fence. It doesn't get sunlight in the morning because the fence blocks the southern sun, but starting at noon, it can start sunbathing. The plant looks green and lush to me. It seems that the few burnt leaves are the ones that receive the most sun. I've been putting a tad bit of cottonseed meal to slightly acidify the soil.</p>

<h1>Update</h1>

<p>It's now the middle of summer and my Fall Gold is producing its second batch of berries. This time around, the berries have remained green before reaching full size. The previous batch would become gold far too soon. Temperatures have been a tad bit more comfortable - 60 F at night, under 80 F during the day. I still water it every 2 or 3 days. </p>

<p>The lush cane closer to the camera is newer growth. It's producing some big berries. The sickly one in the background is the original cane from the nursery - the same cane that produced the immature shriveled berries. Even though it has become sickly, it's still producing a second batch of berries now. So I'll let it produce before sending it to the grave. As this is my first year gardening, I don't really know what pale and dried up leaves signify. I'm inclined to believe that it's a cane that's reached the end of its lifecycle.</p>

","<p>It's a water problem, specifically, not enough, evidenced by the browning edges on the leaves and the shrivelled fruits. Once the berries start forming, you need to keep the plant well supplied with water, or the fruit will atrophy on the stem. You say you bought the plant earlier this year, so the fact it's only been planted this year also means it has a higher water requirement. Increase your watering.</p>

"How would I go about grafting Japanese Maples?","1778","","<p>I would like to plant a nice weeping Japanese Maple in my yard, but the nice ones at the nursery are quite expensive.  Some friends have exactly the type of Japanese Maple that I would like in my yard.  How would I go about grafting a branch into a tree that I could plant in my yard? What is the process and how long does it usually take?</p>
","<p>eHow has a good article on <a href=""http://www.ehow.com/how_4746374_graft-japanese-maple.html"" rel=""nofollow"">how to graft a japanese maple</a> that you may find useful.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Timing is key when you are grafting a Japanese maple. Cut dormant
  scions (wood) in late winter or in mid
  to late summer, make sure the wood is
  firm and ideally about the thickness
  of a pencil (smaller scions can be
  used as well). Take cuttings from the
  desired Japanese Maple cultivar
  (Bloodgood, Red Dragon etc..) Make the
  cuttings about four to six inches and
  be sure they have at least two to
  three buds. Place the cuttings in a
  moistened paper towel, put in a
  plastic bag and label the bag. Keep
  refrigerated until you are ready to
  graft. (Scion wood can last about 2
  months in refrigeration). If you can
  use scion wood on the same day it will
  increase your success rate.</p></li>
  <li><p>You may graft a Japanese Maple as early as late July continuing through
  March. Select a healthy Japanese maple
  to be used as your understock. Ideally
  it should be about the thickness of a
  pencil but you may use a smaller or
  larger understock. Find a long smooth,
  straight section on your understock
  where you will make your first cut.</p></li>
  <li><p>Make a 15 degree slanting one inch cut on the understock of the Japanese
  Maple. The cut should be a smooth
  single stroke. Now cut the scion wood
  on both sides at 45 degree angles to
  match the understock cut. Insert the
  scion under the flap on the understock
  and align the scion at the edge so
  that the cambium layers match. The
  cambium Layer is the thin green layer
  located just below the bark.</p></li>
  <li><p>Use the grafting rubbers or grafting tape. Grafting rubbers are
  preferred. Begin wrapping at the base
  of the Japanese Maple graft to secure
  the end of the grafting rubber by
  overlapping the first 2 wraps. Slowly
  work your way up the graft union
  overlapping as you go while keeping
  tension on the grafting rubber. This
  secures the scion in position. As you
  complete the last wrap, secure rubber
  with a loop end of rubber under itself
  to secure.</p></li>
  <li><p>Take plastic bag and moisten the inside with fungicidal water and place
  over the scion to just below graft and
  secure with a tie or staples. This
  creates high humidity until the graft
  has joined. The graft should take in
  three to five weeks after joining the
  graft.</p></li>
  <li><p>Remove the top of the rootstock just above the graft once it has
  taken. Cut off any stems below your
  graft union as they may overtake your
  graft.</p></li>

"Can I thin grapes/vines in July?","1766","","<p>I have bought a garden in Austria (Central Europe) which has some grape vines (I don't know the exact kind). The previous owner told me they harvested 20 kilograms of grapes last summer. Currently (early July) the vines are bearing a good handful of grapes -- still developing of course, less than 0,8cm each -- but a friend told me that the grapes would not be good unless I remove some of the fruit, so that the remaining fruit will be better (sweeter, juicier). I found <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/819/pruning-a-long-neglected-grape-vine"">this similar question</a> which says to prune in early spring. Since I didn't prune then, my question is:</p>

<p><strong>Can I thin the fruits in July? If so, how? If not, will the grapes be any good this year?</strong></p>

<p>Considerations of how the vine would grow next year aren't relevant because I will be building a house here next year and the vine will have to be sacrificed. This year, I'd rather have few but enjoyable grapes than buckets full of bad ones, so I would not mind pruning ruthlessly, to get <em>any</em> good ones this year. I'm just hoping it's not too late for that?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CBC26.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""><br>
There is apparently only one vine growing; another one or two seem dead.</p>
","<p><strong>Don't prune unless the vine is dormant.</strong></p>

<p>What your friend was probably meaning was to snap off some of the grape clusters (fruit)  so that the remaining grapes will be sweeter. This only works if the grape plant produces more fruit than it can supply with adequate sugar. Also, (common sense) removing fruit after it is well developed will have little impact on the sweetness of other fruit since the sugar has already been invested. </p>

<p>If there are only a few hand-fulls of grapes on the vine, I would probably leave the plant entirely alone. </p>

<p>However, if there are more than one (significant) cluster on a shoot and the clusters aren't developed very well, I might remove all except one (or two, if the shoot is large and/or the clusters are small) clusters of grapes from that shoot. (assuming they aren't significantly developed already)  </p>

","<p>Having done a bit of research, your USDA Zone is 10a, which means this plant should survive very well outdoors, as you've discovered.

It's a good plant to use, particularly in walls or raised areas where its 'babies' and leaves trail attractively, but is considered quite aggressive, in that it spreads easily. It is not, though, difficult to dig up and remove. </p>

<p>Regarding depletion of soil, they don't absorb any more nutrients than any other plant would.</p>

"Mint leaves yellow after transplant","1752","","<p>I have hard clay soil and live in hardiness zone 5. I planted some mint in a garden bed, which did well for a few months. Now, I moved it into the clay soil itself, and the leaves yellowed at the bottom. I removed them.</p>

<p>I probably over-watered it, and the clay soil retained the water. I piled on a bunch of soil on top, and moved to a more moderate watering schedule, but I still see new yellow leaves.</p>

<p>How can I diagnose (and hopefully fix) the problem?</p>
","<p>If the older leaves are yellow on a plant, I would suspect nitrogen first.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_nutrition"" rel=""nofollow"">Nitrogen is mobile in a plant.</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nutrients are moved inside a plant to where they are most needed. For example, a plant will try to supply more nutrients to its younger leaves than its older ones. So when nutrients are mobile, the lack of nutrients is first visible on older leaves. However, not all nutrients are equally mobile. When a less mobile nutrient is lacking, the younger leaves suffer because the nutrient does not move up to them but stays lower in the older leaves. <strong>Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are mobile nutrients</strong>, while the others have varying degrees of mobility. This phenomenon is helpful in determining what nutrients a plant may be lacking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mint is a leafy plant which responds well to nitrogen.  Roots may have been damaged in the transplant process and it will take time for the plant to regrow the fine feeder roots which supply the nitrogen to the plant.  If the nitrogen deficiency is caused by root damage, the problem should resolve itself in a couple weeks.</p>

<p>If the problem is a deficiency in the soil, it won't resolve itself. I would add a spoon of miracle-gro all-purpose to a 2-liter bottle of water, then pour about half of that on the root zone.  I would expect to see improvement in a day or two.  If you don't want to use miracle-gro, you could soak fresh grass clippings in water until the water is green (overnight or so), then pour this water on the root zone.  This is a nitrogen solution and not a complete fertilizer like miracle-gro, but I'd still expect to see some kind of improvement in the next day or so.</p>

<p>I suggest removing the extra dirt you applied, then adding fresh grass clippings around the mint, then covering the clippings with the extra dirt.  This will trap the nitrogen in the ground which the mint can use.  It will also add organic matter to the soil, add aeration, and fight dehydration.  Every now and then you can add more grass and more soil.  After a while of doing this, you'll have some really nice soil.</p>

<p>The long term plan (i.e. next year) is probably to move the beds so I don't want to properly fill them - just put enough compost in for good growing this year.</p>
","<p>If you're buying bagged cow manure, it is thoroughly composted and should pose no harm to your vegetables.</p>

<p>The only possible harm I can think of is if you use it on the peppers: if the bag is labeled with NPK, you may want to check that you aren't adding too much nitrogen. Manure is usually pretty low analysis (1-2% N), so it should be fine. But I wouldn't hesitate to add it to broccoli or the other spots you mentioned.</p>

<p>One thing to check on your broccoli is pH: cole crops want soil that is nearly neutral pH (6.5 - 7.5). If you're planting this weekend it might be too late for lime (for acidic soil) to really have much effect prior to planting.</p>

<p>The main problem I have with broccoli is cabbage loopers. If you have these in your area, I'd recommend planting under row covers and/or spraying with Bt on a regular basis. (I've had too many broccoli harvests that were <em>loaded</em> with little green worms.

<hr>

<p>Related: <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/q/727"">Do clovers cause any problems?</a></p>
","<p>The clover (assuming white clover) is spreading on its own because, most likely, the soil is low on nitrogen, which favors the clover instead of the grass.  Clover can fix nitrogen from the air, so it thrives in the low-N soil where other things have a hard time competing with it.</p>

<p>According to this: <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/1356/do-legumes-provide-nitrogen-to-their-companions"">Do legumes provide nitrogen to their companions?</a>  Clover will provide N to other plants (weeds) as it spreads, so you will probably never have a monostand of clover unless you kill everything and sow only clover.  Also, the clover will never get tall enough to shade-out other established weeds.  It competes by growing in places other plants won't.  If other plants are absolutely thriving, its hard to see clover out-competing them.</p>

<p>Many weeds favor certain soil conditions.  Like, for instance, yarrow will out-compete other plants in low potassium soils.  What you have growing in your soil is what is favored to grow in your soil in its current condition.  If you want to change the population of plants, change the composition of the soil to make it more favorable to one and less to the other.</p>

<p>If you want a stand of clover, mow low to keep the tall weeds in check.  Clover thrives when mowed.  Bag the clippings to keep the nitrogen low in the soil.  Water deeply to wash away nitrogen.  If you can, provide shade to shade-out other plants in favor of the clover, which likes shade (plant a tree to provide shade and use up N).  All these things favor the clover and doesn't favor fast growing weeds (which need lots of N and light to grow fast).</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with having a clover lawn.  Some people prefer them (on the basis the clover adds nitrogen to the soil rather than removing it like grass would).  Though, usually those interested in clover lawns are also interested in growing wild flowers and attracting a population of bees for their gardens.  So, you have a fairly unique combination of requirements.  I'm not sure how bees respond to clover flowers, but a lawn mower would chop the flowers off anyway.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Chilli plants are housed in a grow cage with a shade netting(lets
90% light through), I live in Sydney west where we are seeing
temperatures of 40 degree centigrade and the sun can be deadly
scorching at times. UV index is normally between High and extreme during summer. More <a href=""http://uv.willyweather.com.au/nsw/greater-western-sydney/toongabbie-east.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">information here</a>

<li><p>I feed them PowerFeed fertiliser every 1-2 weeks. This fertiliser works wonders on my other plants but since I am still a light green thumb I am worried about being over eager in my care of my plants. The fertiliser product can be viewed <a href=""http://www.seasol.com.au/products/72/PowerFeed-for-Vegies"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on this product page</a>.

<li>Phosphorus (P) 1.4%</li>
<li>Potassium (K) 9.0%</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are Carolina Reaper always suppose to turn red? Could it be I have a green variety? Have not seen anything on the net about this.</li>
<li>Generally speaking how long does it take for chili to mature.</li>
<li>Could the fertiliser be providing an problem by providing a unbalance in nutrients?</li>
<li>Maybe I should move them into direct sunlight as they are not established and not going to scorch to death.</li>
</ol>
","<p>A month is not a <em>particularly</em> alarming amount of time for a chile pepper of any variety to stay green, especially depending on your soil and growing conditions. If the variety isn't used to the growing conditions, it's possible that this might also delay ripening.</p>

<p>Carolina Reapers are supposed to take between 70 to 90 days after the transplant before maturity, but other varieties may be earlier or later (it really depends on the variety). However, in some areas and/or soils (such as mine) it may take much, much longer for Carolina Reapers to mature (like maybe longer than the season). I believe the variety comes from South Carolina (so the growing conditions there may be more like ideal than many areas). I don't know what kind of soil they're used to (but probably the usual ideal for peppers).</p>

<p>I tried growing a Carolina Reaper this year, but I only got fruit indoors, while the Orange Carbonero chile plant I grew indoors next to it got loads of fruit after the transplant outside. I did, however, get a very large plant from the Carolina Reaper seeds (it may have needed a bigger container; I had it in a 5-gallon bucket, and it was bigger than all my other pepper plants). I also got plenty of fruit from a number of other varieties (Ring of Fire, Aji Omnicolor, Yatsufusa, Grandpa's Home, etc.) at varying stages of the season.</p>

<p>Peppers generally take between 60 and 120 days after the transplant to get mature fruit. (I've read about a whole lot of peppers, and that's the general range I've seen.) Most chile peppers take somewhat longer than sweet peppers to ripen, however, but there are early chile peppers. Ring of Fire is supposed to be 60 days, in fact (but, it was much later for me—although still productive and tasty).</p>

<p>I'm not sure about the Carolina Reaper, but many chile peppers (including all of those others I mentioned) will ripen a large amount of fruit at approximately the same time. So, I wouldn't be surprised if that happens. However, don't fret if it does. Chile peppers are normally pretty easy to dry, and if you dry them, you can use them at your leisure.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.scottrobertsweb.com/ultimate-guide-to-drying-hot-peppers/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here's a link that outlines some processes for drying peppers, including safety tips.</a> It has good advice, and several methods, but some of what they say about the bowl method is rather overkill for some areas (although following all the advice certainly won't hurt). I mean, in my semi-arid area, I don't have to worry much about light levels when I dry peppers. I just wash them, dry them, put them in a bowl in the kitchen or dining room, and wait. I can even pile them higher than the stated one layer of peppers with good results (maybe three or more layers, but there is still a limit: if there are too many, the peppers may leak juice, attract fruit flies, and go bad; if they start to leak, you can separate them into more bowls). If your area isn't arid to semi-arid, you may want to worry about sunlight, ventilation, only doing one layer of peppers, etc. Ventilation seems to help things dry faster and stay good longer in my area, too; I recommend worrying about ventilation even if you don't have to, per se. It's just a good idea. I recommend using a dedicated fan, especially if you're drying them in a small room.</p>

<p>Chile peppers can take a long time to dry with the bowl method, but if all you care about is preserving them, it doesn't really matter (you can still use them while you're waiting for them to dry). If you're selling dry pepper pods on a schedule, it might matter to you, though.</p>

<p>If your peppers have thick walls, they may be more difficult to dry. You may have to cut them into strips (and in that case, you might want to use such as a dehydrator to dry them—but it can be done successfully just in the open air or in brown paper bags, in my area, at least). Food dehydrators may change the flavor of your peppers, however. I prefer just to let them sit and dry, for flavor.</p>

<p>Chile peppers (and peppers generally) are also extremely easy to freeze, however thick the walls are. Just wash them, put them in sandwich bags (or other zipper bags that you can freeze stuff in), and freeze them. If the peppers are whole, you shouldn't have to struggle to separate them when frozen. If they're cut into pieces, you may or may not, depending (but it shouldn't be too hard, most of the time).</p>

<p>I've personally never had peppers get mushy from being on the vine too long (unless they had blossom end rot), but it's possible in a more humid area, they might be prone to getting mushy (I don't know). So, if you're familiar with the concept of mushy peppers in your area, maybe someone else will answer with more details on how to handle the situation according to your needs. It's also possible that certain fertilizer programs may result in mushy peppers, but I don't know. Maybe they need extra silica or other nutrients to make them stronger (they might if they're container-grown with a pre-mixed soil). I would guess that disease might be responsible (but you'd think there would be visible signs of disease, too).</p>

<p>Carolina Reapers are supposed to turn red, eventually. I don't know of a kind that stays green. There is a new yellow variety, however. They may or may not turn red while drying them if it's not too cool, if you have to pick them green.</p>

<p>I do not recommend refrigerating your peppers. This will slow ripening, make drying them difficult (if not impossible) and limit their shelf life. (I'm actually kind of surprised they refrigerate fresh peppers in the supermarket. It doesn't seem to help, in my experience. Maybe it helps in humid areas.)</p>

<p>Direct sunlight might help your plants, but maybe not. It probably depends on your sun and air. If the UV index is high, it'll likely result in hotter peppers, though. I haven't noticed a big difference in ripening speed for chile peppers between partial shade and even more shade, personally (but I've only really tested it with Ring of Fire, a Capsicum annuum variety; the Carolina Reaper is Capsicum chinense).</p>

<p>Giving your plants more phosphorus could possibly speed ripening. I noticed the amount in your fertilizer is very low compared with the ratio in most NPK fertilizers. Phosphorus is often lower than nitrogen and potassium in fertilizers, but in this case, it's lower than usual. The nitrogen levels in that fertilizer are somewhat high, for peppers, I think (especially if it has already set fruit). Unless the soil is high in potassium, I might just give it a dose of <a href=""https://www.greenwaybiotech.com/products/monopotassium-phosphate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">monopotassium phosphate</a> and see if it helps (but getting a soil test first would be a better idea, if you can do it).</p>

<p>I think fertilizing every 1-2 weeks is too often. The plant probably won't use it all, and eventually the nitrogen may burn your plants, cause root rot and stuff (and the soil may become too salty and maybe even too acidic). However, if the soil is high in nitrogen, I do recommend more sun (unless the UV rays are too harmful for the plants). If you've been fertilizing that often, you can (and probably should) take a break from fertilization (nitrogen especially) for a long time. Trying to balance out the nitrogen with other nutrients may help, but it may be dangerous if your soil has too many nutrients already.</p>

<p>High nitrogen (and/or low potassium) could possibly result in weak fruit (which may be the mushy fruit you mentioned). Weak plants/fruit may be more susceptible to disease. Disease can increase the spoilage rates, and even partially diseased fruits may be more difficult to dry successfully (you may not want to try it). If it's edible as is, you can freeze it, if you can't dry it. Silica and the proper proportion of calcium can also help strengthen a plant. Calcium can raise your soil pH, though. Silica sources include such as sand and rockdust.</p>

"What's the best way to cut leaf lettuces?","1737","","<p>The last few years I've had success growing romaine and other leaf lettuces. I usually try to harvest only as much as we need for a day (or couple days). That often means just a few leaves at a time Is it best to cut the leaves as close to the ground as possible and, if you do, is there any chance that those leaves will regrow?</p>

<p>Also, if I'm only taking a few leaves from a bigger plant is it best to take them evenly from the perimeter and slowly work inwards? Or better to do one section inwards so you get a mix of inner and outer leaves?</p>

<p>In short, what's the best way to harvest lettuce to insure maximum yield and the best taste?</p>
","<p>If you only want a few leaves, it's easiest to harvest the outer leaves. There's no botanical advantage one way or the other; It's just easier.</p>

<p>But old growth starts to get tough and bitter. It's better to keep harvesting (and re-harvesting) while the leaves are still small and tender.</p>

<p>That's why <strong>it is actually best to just grab the top of whatever portion you want to eat and lop it off like you're cutting the grass.</strong> Leave at least an inch or so above the growing crown near the roots and it will keep growing back. That way you are always getting new growth rather than the oldest leaves you were picking one at a time.</p>

"How do you know when a tree has died?","1736","","<p>A tree trust planted 2 trees for me along my fence-line.</p>

<p>One hasn't budded at all this spring, the other tree has a few small leaves on one of the lowest branches.  I have a lot of aggressive-growing, mature vines along that area - I'm thinking maybe they were depriving the trees of water and/or nutrients.  </p>

<p>I have the same issue with 2 Douglas Fir trees I planted about 3 years ago.  Other than the fact that they've barely grown in the 3 years, this spring 2 of the 3 have lost all their needles.  I live in Minnesota, and since the trees are so short, they were completely submersed in snow for awhile.  In retrospect, I should have dug them out, but I'm a bit dense apparently.</p>

<p>I'm trying to figure out if I should wait it out and see if they recover, try an emergency transplant, or start shopping for headstones. </p>
","<p><strong>One hasn't budded at all this spring.</strong> </p>

<p>At this point, that one is probably dead. Depending on the species, green will show through the young bark when it is alive. If there is no green showing, scratch lightly through the bark on the trunk near the ground. If the cambium layer is wet and green or white, the tree is alive. If it is very dry, or brown to black, the tree is dead. If the terminal growth was alive, the tree would have begun to bud by now. This tree, even if not quite dead, won't survive well and should be removed.</p>

<p><strong>The other tree has a few small leaves on one of the lowest branches.</strong></p>

<p>That signifies that the rest of the branches are dead. If you want to try and save it, don't transplant it. that will put it in shock, and won't help the tree. You can cut back all of the dead from the tree, to help with appearances, but it should be for the most part left alone. This tree doesn't have an established enough root system to safely fertilize with most products yet, but water as necessary. This tree will not have a staight trunk if you keep it, because the small branch will be forced to form a new leader.</p>

<p><strong>I have a lot of aggressive-growing, mature vines along that area - I'm thinking maybe they were depriving the trees of water and/or nutrients.</strong></p>

<p>This is probably not the main reason for your trees' poor health. The vines should be cut back if they attempt to climb the trees. It sounds like the trees were damaged in the winter, from the above ground parts of the trees drying out when the roots were frozen. There have been many similar cases this spring with newly planted trees, even in my area (zone 6b), because of the fairly harsh winter.</p>

<p><strong>I have the same issue with 2 Douglas Fir trees I planted about 3 years ago. Other than the fact that they've barely grown in the 3 years, this spring 2 of the 3 have lost all their needles.</strong></p>

<p>It sounds like the trees never came out of transplant shock. This can occur if the hole was too small, and the roots weren't spread out properly during planting. Also, compacted clay soil can do this, if the sides of the planting hole were not loosened. If the soil is shallow and nutrient-deprived, the trees will find it hard to put out root growth, and therefore top growth. Evergreens also need to be watered well before winter in dry areas, because they will let off moisture all winter, even when the roots cannot supply more.</p>

<p>That is what happened to the ""two of the three"" which ""have lost all their needles"". Those two are dead and can be removed. If the remaining tree is growing, it should be mulched well and fertilized, and given a good bit of water if/when dry. If the tree is still green, but hasn't budded out, things look grim You can try transplanting if you have had any of the planting problems mentioned above. I'm assuming from: ""they were completely submersed in snow for awhile"" that they were not balled and burlapped.</p>

<p>Dig the hole first, making sure to dig a good bit wider than the roots of the tree will be, spread out evenly. Make sure you have enough good fill soil nearby. You want to use a soft, free-draining, acidic soil with a high organic matter content. Dig the tree out carefully, to get out all the roots with as little damage as possible. Plant it as soon as you can, making sure the top of the root flare is even with the surface (even if it wasn't before). Do not let it dry out.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VQfZCl.jpg"" alt=""my lawn""></p>
","<p>Definitely start with a soil test. You mention that the soil is black, rich, but artificial fertilizers and many pesticides can lead to biologically poor soil. Without good soil biology, much of the nutrients you dump on your lawn remains unavailable to grass.  If you can afford it, get a bioassay done (like that from <a href=""http://soilfoodwebnewyork.com/"">http://soilfoodwebnewyork.com/</a> but from a local lab).</p>

<p>You also mention that your soil is moist. This in itself can be the problem. The number 1 cause of lawn problems is improper watering. Lawns should be watered deeply and infrequently, and you should let them dry out between watering. This encourages deep turf root growth and helps it compete with weeds. You may also have drainage issues - which a soil test may be able to detect. Continually wet soils lead to disease and prevent turf from competing with weeds effectively.</p>

<p>Finally, I can't tell from the photo exactly, but it looks like your grass is cut really short. You should not cut your lawn below 3"" during the growing season, and never cut off more than 1/3 of the height of the grass. Taller grass has much more leaf area, shades out weeds and their seeds, cools the ground below it to reduce evapo-transpiration and heat stress, and leads to much healthier lawns. </p>

<p>Finally, leave grass clippings in place if at all possible. These clippings can be an important input of both carbon (food for the soil biology) and nitrogen (food for the turf).</p>

","<p>Leca pebbles are really for use when growing orchids or in hydroponics, in other words, soilless growing, so they won't stop the fungus in your pot, it'll still be in the soil, you just won't be able to see it beneath the leca (the fungus won't grow on the leca).</p>

<p>Fungus grows in pots because, as you've said, there are moist conditions most of the time - usually its there because its decomposing material within the potting medium, particularly woody parts, no matter how small they are. You might also see fungus in the soil (if its damp all the time) which is actually associated with the roots of the plant, helping it to grow well in a symbiotic interaction - this is not usually visible on top.</p>

<p>I'm afraid, if you want to stop this, its out with the self watering pot, repotting into something with a drainage hole that you water yourself when necessary, rather than trying to kill any fungus present. This answer assumes the plant is perfectly healthy and growing well.</p>

","<p>Thanks for confirming the plant name.
This one likes well drained soil, so the first thing I'd say is that it shouldn't be in a non draining pot - being waterlogged will cause it problems. If you can transfer it to something which drains, with an outer container which doesn't, water with tepid water when the surface of the compost is dry to the touch, but not shrunken from the sides of the pot. Reduce watering in winter. Empty any water left in an outer pot after 30 minutes. Mist frequently, it likes high humidity, although where you are, high humidity might be the norm anyway, I'm not sure.
As for the direction of growth, this one has fairly lax, drooping stems and leaves spilling out and down over the pot, which is its natural habit, but growth will always aim for where the light is brightest. You may find it becomes leggy and unattractive over time - cutting back hard in spring helps, but its advisable to root cuttings for replacement plants at the same time, in case the parent plant continues to look unattractive. Repot in Spring if necessary.
Note that watering is not an exact science in home conditions - how much the plant needs is dependent on its local environment, how large the plant is, the ratio of compost to root within the pot, heat, and speed of growth, which varies according to the time of year. </p>

  <li>Should I remove any of the papery outside layers, for example if they are damaged or covered it dirt I can't easily remove?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Don't remove any layers. Don't wash them. Gently brush off dirt when they are fully dried if you must. You want the onion intact for storage. Any that are damaged should be used right away -- these won't store well.</p>

<p>Any that are thick-necked, spotted or soft will rot if stored normally; they need to be either eaten within a few days of lifting or frozen. [From a comment on this post by Mancuniensis.]</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>I live in a hot climate so there are no cool locations below room temperature except the refrigerator or freezer. Is a fridge well ventilated enough and does it have low enough humidity for long-term storage?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Fridge humidity is too variable. Your produce drawers may be around 80%, but if the fridge is left unopened for a period of time it can become very dry. Bottom line is that they are likely to spoil more quickly -- and they will make everything in your fridge smell like onions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Do they need to be somehow cured or prepared after harvesting but before storing?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Onions should be cured for a couple of weeks. Dry them on a rack or other place with good circulation out of direct sunlight. Turn them a couple of times so that they dry evenly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Is there anything better than a mesh bag? For example, wrapping them in foil.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I had never heard of wrapping them in foil. If you store them in a mesh bag (really, with any storage in general), be sure to check frequently for spoilage -- if one of your onions spoils in storage, it will cause rapid spoilage of all of the other onions nearby.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given ideal storage, how long can I expect my onions to last, and is there a way to tell if they're about to go bad so I can use or dehydrate them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Mine</em> never last this long (I don't have ideal storage), but according to books like ""Root Cellaring"" by Mike and Nancy Bubel, onions stored under ideal conditions can last from a late summer harvest until the following spring (6-8 months).</p>

<p>Since you don't have a good place to store them long term, I'd recommend using them or dehydrating them now. (You don't want to dehydrate onions that are about to spoil -- it will not make a good product.)</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.garden.org/foodguide/browse/veggie/onions_harvesting/502"" rel=""noreferrer"">This page</a> describes freezing as an alternative storage method:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>you can salvage them by peeling and pureeing them in a blender. Pour the puree into ice trays, cover them with plastic (so the odor won't affect other foods) and freeze them. After the onion cubes have frozen, transfer them to a plastic bag in your freezer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and for whole onions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Peel and wash the onions and blanch them in scalding water until the centers are heated (three minutes for small onions, seven minutes for medium to large ones). Cool, drain and put the onions on cookie sheets, and place the sheets in the freezer. After they're frozen, put the onions in a plastic bag for convenient storage</p>
</blockquote>

<p>with this caveat:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the best flavor, use frozen onions within a month or two.</p>

","<p>I'm going to guess fungus gnats because I always think tiny black bodied winged bugs are fungus gnats but in this case I think I'm right. :)</p>

<p>It looks like you have the plants in containers. Is that how you purchased them or did you pot them yourself? I had purchased a bag of organic potting mix once that was infested with fungus gnat eggs. Once I watered it they came to life. If your potting mix contains compost it's possible they came in the bag. I've only had the problem once with a bag I mail ordered (forget why I bothered to do that.)</p>

<p>At the time I was filming a time lapse video of some grass growing which is how I found them. You can see a portion of my video where I used <a href=""http://www.organiclawndiy.com/2012/07/growing-grass-indoors-bugsneem.html"">neem oil to kill the fungus gnats and their larvae</a> on my site. It was pretty effective. You can see the little white dots crawling around the container on the right for the first couple of seconds until I sprayed. Any insecticidal soap I believe will work.</p>

<p>I think the adult flying gnats are harmless but the larvae can feed on the roots. You can also let the potting mix dry out which would kill the larvae as they need moisture. I hear bacillus thuringiensis works too. That's the bacteria they use in mosquito dunks.

"How can I love a Silver Maple?","1701","","<p>I'm reading this question <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/q/3500/652"">What is the average lifespan of most maple trees?</a> and the <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/3515/652"">answer</a> mentions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Silver maple 100 years (I cannot imagine why you would want to plant this species)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>followed by a comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Silver Maples in urban areas are trouble. Their roots seek water and infiltrate water pipes. They have a poor branch structure that unusual weather can cause broken branches or splits in branches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With such bad press about this tree, I looked it up and googled the images and lo and behold, <strong>that's my tree!</strong></p>

<p>It saddened me a bit since my brother-in-law gave me this seedling from his yard (as mine was barren of any trees) and I've been really happy with how fast it's been growing.  The leaves are full and pretty and it's about 15 feet high.</p>

<p>I really don't want to take down this tree, so what can I do to improve the branch structure?  How realistic a concern is <code>infiltrates water pipes</code>? (the main water pipe to the house is not that far away from the tree)  Are the roots drilling through metal?</p>
","<p>The structural problems that silver maples usually have include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/gardennotes/615.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">included bark</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://agebb.missouri.edu/agforest/archives/v10n3/gh1.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">narrow crotch angles</a></li>
<li>a tendency when grown in urban conditions to grow wider than taller</li>
<li>a shallow root system</li>
</ul>

<p>If you consistently trim the width over the next four or five years to promote vertical growth and you remove any branches with narrow angles or included bark you can reduce the risk of branches breaking off in wind or ice storms.  <a href=""http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/00-005.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">This guide</a> is for fruit trees but the ideas apply to what you want to do.  </p>

<p>The other issue to address is how close is the tree to any structures or parking areas?  Urban areas are unnatural for trees.  The soil is different and they are not planted with the same density as a forest.  In a forest a tree can depend on it's neighbours to buffer high winds.  This is not true in urban environments and silver maples can blow over and break things like your house or car.</p>

<p>Lastly the issue of water seeking roots.  Tree roots cannot drill through metal or plastic.  However, depending on the age of pipes there may be pinpoint leaks at the joins.  Where there is water ---->   roots will go.  Roots can go into a pipe where there is the tiniest gap. </p>

<p>Only you can do a complete analysis of whether this tree should be kept or not.  Talk to a local arborist and get some costs:</p>

<ul>
<li>how much to remove it now?</li>
<li>how much to give it some structural pruning on a yearly or bi yearly basis for four or five years?</li>
<li>how much to remove a full grown silver maple (assume full grown after fifty years)</li>
<li>what could it fall on and how much would it cost to fix? Are you insured?</li>
<li>has your area had high wind storms or ice storms in the last ten years?</li>
</ul>

<p>If the silver maple clogs your water pipes fifteen years from now how much could it cost to get new pipe laid?  </p>

<p>I know this answer sounds like it's all about money but as a homeowner you will be responsible for what happens to the tree. If you are unsure hire an arborist for an opinion and estimate now.  It's much cheaper to spend a little money now than a lot of money later.</p>

I couldn't open it, so I don't know what they look like, but the box was about 6 inches tall and 3 inches front to back. Although I have a lot of experience with flowers, this would be my first vegetable. I've been told they're not easy to grow, but I'd like to try, especially because asparagus is so expensive to buy!</p>

<p>The box said both of the plants were male, as did all of the other boxes on the shelf. I assume that's important to know, or else it wouldn't have been made clear.

If so, is there a certain way I should position them in the garden?</p>
","<p>Male asparagus plants don't produce seeds; female plants do. </p>

<p>With asparagus, you need to allow some stalks to grow fully over the growing season in order to provide energy for next year's growth. Since female plants are putting some energy into making seeds, they don't store as much, so they'll produce fewer spears than a male would.</p>

<p>The crop is the growing shoot, so you don't need a mix of male and female plants. In fact, if you have females, they can drop seeds which can grow and crowd your existing plants, reducing the overall yield. This is why you'll usually only find male plants for sale.</p>

<p>There's no special way to plant them, other than to dig a 1 foot deep trench for them, mix the soil with composted manure to enrich it, then put some of the loose soil underneath the crowns as you plant them. Space the crowns a couple of feet apart, and backfill the trench as the plants grow. You also need to wait a couple of years before harvesting any spears because you want the plant to have put all its energy into growth.</p>

Evergreens let off water vapor throughout the winter through their leaves, but the roots cannot replenish the supply, while frozen. The yellow areas are dead, and you should follow each dead stem back to a live green shoot or bud, and trim it off neatly. Winter burn was a bad problem with the harsh 13-14 winter.

Best kept trimmed as a shrub 3-4 feet high max, and placed outdoors in summer. When indoors, mist leaves regularly, keep in a cool position away from heat sources, but preferably good daylight and with some sun, repot as necessary in spring.

"Can I eradicate blackspot on roses with a winter pruning?","1693","","<p>In mid-winter, I pruned my standard roses back harshly.  Black-spot can be a problem on these roses.  The pruning is such that they have hardly any leaves.  The remaining leaves do not have any black-spot.</p>

<p>Should I spray now to remove any remaining fungus on the plants?  Will this keep black-spot from the new foilage that will grow as spring starts?  Or will the fungus spread through the air to the new foilage in any case?</p>
","<p>Blackspot is a difficult disease to control, as I know from bitter experience. I see that you are in Australia, where it will soon be spring, so here is what I suggest:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Remove <em>all</em> dead leaves from around your rose bushes, as the disease spores overwinter on them and, in spring, as soon as it rains, are splashed or blown up up onto the new foliage. Dispose of the dead leaves in a sealed bag.</p></li>
<li><p>Rake the area and put down a 3 or 4"" mulch, but keep it away from the stems, to avoid giving them collar rot;</p></li>
<li><p>Spray the new leaves with <em>both</em> a contact and a systemic fungicide as soon as they begin to emerge, and ring the changes on the type of fungicides you use, to prevent the fungus from developing immunity - see *Richmond Rose Society advice below.</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever you water, try to avoid wetting the leaves and stems, as blackspot spores are water-borne, and this will minimize the spread of infection</p></li>
<li><p>Promptly remove any infected leaves and prune any stems with lesions</p></li>
<li><p>Feed regularly with a good rose fertilizer. Roses are heavy feeders and fertilizing at regular intervals will help yours to recover from the severe pruning.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, although you should be able to bring the disease under control, you're unlikely to eliminate it completely, as spores will be blown in from elsewhere on wind-borne rain.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>*Use a systemic fungicide: These are compounds that prevent the germinating black spot spore from taking hold on the leaf. While systemics do not kill the spores, they do stop the fungus dead in its tracks by interfering with its metabolism. The fungus can’t digest its food and soon dies. Popular systemic fungicides include Banner Max and Compass. Mixing a contact and systemic fungicide in the same sprayer works well. By killing off spores and preventing the growth of any existing fungus, black spot is quickly eradicated. Although <em>using both a systemic and a contact fungicide is the key to controlling black spot</em>, don’t make the mistake of using the same systemic and contact fungicide each time you spray. Just as bacteria have become increasingly immune to antibiotics, the black spot fungus is becoming resistant to some of the compounds used to control it. To ensure that an immunity does not develop in your garden, switch the fungicides you use each week. Here is a list of some of the more common systemic and contact fungicides that control black spot.</p>

Although this garden is in the notoriously wet Pacific Northwest (USDA zone 8a), it is against a two story south-facing brick wall, under a large overhang, and in a sandy soil. Combining that with our rainless summers and a hard-nosed gardener who refuses to provide supplemental water after a plant's second year, it is surprising anything survives. And yet, all the standard dry soil herbs, thyme, chives, fennel, tarragon, sage, and rosemary, are all doing well in this little piece of Provence in Washington State.</p>

<p>I am looking for a plant (perennial) for a spot behind a rugosa rose against the wall. It must be narrow so it does not crowd the rose, but tall, 4 to 6 feet, so it stands up above the rose.</p>

<p>Here is the trouble: the typical tall, narrow dry-soil perennials — mulleins (<em>Verbascum</em>), yucca, or fox-tail lilies (<em>Eremurus</em>) — may have flowers that will go up above the rose, but that important part of the plant, the foliage, will be shaded by the rose.

"Translucent worms are growing on my moss, will they move onto other plants?","1684","","<p>I started growing moss indoors and I now see a strange discoloration with a few tiny translucent worms on it. </p>

<p>The moss is in an open jar and I mist it twice a day and keep it moist.</p>

<p>How can I eliminate the worms? Is there a risk of the worms moving to other plants in the house, or moss in other parts of the house?</p>
","<p>These translucent worms are almost certainly the larvae of <strong>Fungus Gnats</strong> and, if you look closely, you may see the adults running across the soil. They are attracted by damp conditions and their presence suggests that you have been keeping your moss too moist. They also thrive on potting soil that is high in organic matter - and on peat moss!</p>

<p>I have done a quick online search and, apparently, they rarely harm healthy houseplants but, given the right conditions, will breed and spread to your other plants, and even to the rest of your house.</p>

<p>You can control them by:</p>

<ul>
<li>ensuring that your plants are not over-watered; allow the potting compost to dry out a little between waterings, so that it is <em>slightly</em> damp to the touch, but <em>never wet</em>;</li>
<li>spraying the soil with neem oil or an insecticide of pyrethrins.</li>

<p>I'm now wondering if I could use especially the griftstones to make a border of my raised beds. My main doubt is that the wall won't be closed. By definition there are holes and I'm afraid that water will dissolve the soil with time.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>
","<p>A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_stone_wall"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">drystone wall</a> is certainly an option. The stone you have is ideal for building.  All it takes is a little preparation and some inexpensive materials and...time. Here are some practices I have used which assisted me:</p>

<ul>
<li>know your soil type. Clay will shift in a cold winter or a very cold winter. Sand drains freely but is more likely to washed out</li>
<li>drystone walls are good up to one meter tall or so.  Higher than that takes some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retaining_wall"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">practice and preparation</a>. (More <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retaining_wall#Sheet_piling"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">deadman</a> retaining stones, more drainage, angling the wall into the soil on the higher area)</li>
<li>a geotextile fabric or soil separator is essential to keep the soil from washing out from between the stones EDIT: in North America these are sold as ""Landscape Fabric"" or ""Weed Barrier"".  I find the quality of this type of retail product is insufficient for a long lasting job and suggest you source commercial grade products which will be called ""geotextiles"".</li>
<li>drainage pipe on the inside base of the wall is also essential. In North America you can buy four inch diameter drainage pipe with a woven sleeve that does the job nicely. I'm sure similar material is available where you live.</li>
<li>a list of tools you might need is <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/4334/what-tools-do-i-need-to-build-stone-steps/4335#4335"">here</a></li>
<li>some alternative ideas are <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/3741/how-should-i-build-a-raised-garden-bed/3757#3757"">here</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I find the best part of using stone for your bed is that are also building a miniature micro climate.  Stone will warm faster and retain heat than soil. Plants placed into the wall will grow sooner and, if the correct species are chosen, flower faster</p>

<p>My stone wall is starting to shape up nicely after a few years of stuffing plants into every crack. It has been stable for 5 years with a temperature range of -30 degrees Celsius to + 30 degrees Celsius.

If I want the bin to last 5 years,do I need to line it to protect the wood? And if so, with what?</p>
","<p>All untreated wood that is part of a compost bin will start to rot eventually, but how fast it will rot will depend on the type of wood you've used. I think most wood types will last about 5 to 10 years.</p>

<p>Plastic linings will help prevent decay, but chemicals from the plastic may leach into your compost and the plastic itself will start to decay eventually, so small plastic parts may also end up in the compost. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can oil the wood to make it last just a bit longer, but it'll probably give you about 1 year extra. If you decide to oil it, it's best to use plant oils like organic hemp oil or linseed oil.</p>

"Can I get rid of sap stains on my mulberry tree?","1674","","<p>My <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morus_(plant)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mulberry</a> tree was leaking sap earlier and it left ugly black stains down the trunk. The tree has deeply furrowed bark. Can I remove this?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/s5Abi.jpg"" alt=""""></p>
","<p>That leaking sap &amp; stained bark appears to be caused by bacterial wetwood, also known as slime flux. This is a common bacterial infection that creates slightly caustic sap &amp; raises pressure within the wood. The pressure forces the sap out at weak points, staining the bark. The sap smells sort of fermented, right? That's the result of the bacteria having chowed down on the sugars in the sap. You may also notice bugs showing up for a party.</p>

<p>You shouldn't try to remove the bark. You can remove extra sap by infrequent gentle washing with plain water (rain is free, don't buy a hose for this.) Removing the discolored bark or trying to plug/patch will just cause additional spots where sap will leak instead, and may interrupt any compartmenting the tree's done on its own. The best management of the situation is to keep the tree free from additional stress, and living with what it looks (and smells) like.</p>

<p>The good news about slime flux is it can actually prevent other sorts of rot! It also generally does not kill trees. (I've had one infected in this way for 10 years, and it's healthier &amp; larger than ever aside from the flux.)</p>

","<p>It's a chafer grub, specifically a cockchafer. These can cause significant problems in lawns, and more occasionally, flower beds. Once they're adult like this, insecticides are relatively ineffectual, so when you find any whilst rootling around, kill them yourself. If it becomes a major problem (plants suddenly wilting or dying in numbers) then it might be worth looking for a nematode solution. These can be found online by googling Nemesys - there are products for all kinds of pests, so make sure you select the right one. The solution is usually watered into the ground and in the case of chafer grubs, September is the optimum time. Certain insecticides applied to the soil much earlier in the year may kill off any juvenile chafers, but one or two of the most effective are no longer available for non professional use in the UK.</p>

","<p>These are two different plants.  The one in the second (lower) photo is astilbe, a common ornamental, perennial garden plant; it is not poisonous.  </p>

<p>With a number of plants imitating poison ivy in form of leaf, it's difficult to determine what the plant is in the first photo. There is considerable variation in the leaf shape (toothed vs lobed) and surface (glossy vs dull) of poison ivy, so you need to look at other characteristics as well. The leaves of poison ivy occur alternately along the main stem so try and check for that without touching the plant. Also, the central leaflet is usually attached by a short leaf stalk while the side leaflets attach directly (or on much shorter stalks) to the leaf stem. From this side of the computer, it looks a lot like poison ivy to me.</p>

<li>Fertilized the lawn, which was perennial Bermuda grass, and put out some pre-emergent a couple of times in the spring and early summer to strengthen the lawn and help it out-compete the goat heads.</li>
<li>Had frequent ""goat head pulling parties"" where each person took a large paper grocery sack out to the yard and spent as long as it took to fill it by pulling off the newest crop of green goat head sticker stems.  </li>
<li>Repeat every week during growing season for the next three years.  </li>

"What is the type of moss that commonly grows in dirt, trees, and bricks?","1662","","<p>I'm trying to grow moss for my paludarium, and there's a certain type of moss that is very common (especially during fall) that you can see growing in hard-packed dirt, trees, and bricks -- (at least where I'm from, Houston, TX, US).

<li>grows well indoors with no direct sunlight (although bright room with lots of windows)</li>

"What is a good distance to grow coconut tree from house and compound wall?","1662","","<p>I am planning to plant the following trees in my new home (yet to build). I think I will not get much space between house foundation and compound wall. What is the recommended space to grow the coconut tree? </p>

<ul>
<li>Coconut Tree </li>
<li>Teak Tree </li>
<li>Lemon Tree </li>
<li>Jack Fruit Tree</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you recommend any trees (Hot climate - India) that will not damage the house foundation but will give sun shade along with other benefits?</p>
","<p>My mother, a seasoned farmer, has had no problems planting coconuts right by the house foundation. The challenge actually comes from the tree either leaning on the house or from things falling right on to the house, or people walking below etc. So, leave some distance from the house, at least 2m and if you have space, more. Space them so that they are at least 1m within your fencing. Bananas may be grown in the shade but will need copious water depending on variety. </p>

<p>We also had problems with one coconut tree close enough to the main power line, it became a fire hazard and fire service actually had to be called. I am not trying to scare you. With proper planting, co-seeding and fertilization, you can receive years worth of crops if you have the right climate. </p>

<p>Lemons grow nicely in hot weather, never really get too tall to give shade unless you plan to sit under them. Check with the nursery though, if they can recommend tall varieties. Lemons are very good and worthy trees to grow. </p>

<p>Neem, Indian ""strawberries"" and mangoes as well as tamarinds can give you plenty of shade, but each will need a good deal of spacing, like 3ft all around themselves or on the sides. In our house and in our farm in South India, we grew all these very successfully, except tamarind, our place being slightly cooler than needed. Almost of all of them will need some soil conditioning. </p>

<p>Teak will need pruning and harvesting, but can be eye catching and give good shade. Make sure they will grow in your area. </p>

<p>Figs are another option, but they can root quite deep and cause hassles. </p>

<p>I wouldn't recommend Eucalyptus unless you have cool climate, live near the coast and/or require wind-breaking. They consume quite a bit of water and are a fire risk in summer. </p>

<p>From what I can tell, Jack Fruit grows tall, in neighboring Kerala where humidity appears to aid it quite a bit. It needs about 1.5 - 2ft or more in spacing, and plenty of patience for the fruit to be produced. They need quite a bit of fertilizing, care and humidity, just so you know. </p>

<p>Before planting, my mother always consulted with the nurseries, and with the local Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. These chats can help you quite a bit, saving time and money. I recommend you do this. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This happens because some mites enter the flower buds and start sucking out the sap. The ovary of the flower is misshapen, so the fruit is, well, outlandish. Citrus bud mite is apparently particularly a problem near the coast in our area, just where we depend on lemons for most of our garden citrus. </p>

<p>And in relation to that, I found another <a href=""http://en.allexperts.com/q/Container-Gardens-714/2008/2/insect-problem.htm"">post on AllExperts</a> about getting rid of them</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To insure you kill all activity, treat once a week for 3-6 treatments. This schedule is necessary in the warmer months when cycles develop quickly. If it is the off season and development is slower, treat 2-4 times every two weeks. Don't waste your time with standard materials like dursban or diazinon. Like most arachnids, spider mites are not too vulnerable to these active ingredients. The best material for spider mite control is called CYFLUTHRIN.</p>

Parthenocissus varieties (P. henryana, P. tricuspidata and the like) won't cause similar damage, provided the mortar or bricks or stucco are, preferably, newly finished (as in new build homes) or are in extremely good repair.</p>

","<p>According to notes by the Alabama  A&amp;M and Auburn Universities:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BER is caused by calcium deficiency, <strong>usually induced by fluctuations in the plant's water supply</strong>. Because calcium is not a highly mobile element in the plant, even brief fluctuations in the water supply can cause BER. Also, if plants are growing in highly acidic soil or are getting too much water from either heavy rain, over-irrigation or high relative humidity, they can develop calcium deficiency and BER.</p>
  
  <p>This is a very full paper, which goes on to suggest steps that can be taken to control BER, and points out that some varieties tend to be more susceptible to the conditions that cause BER.</p>

"How do I water a desk plant at my office without making a mess?","1657","","<p>I have decided to get a few plants for my office desk. However, one thing still eludes me.</p>

<p>Plant pots usually have a drainage hole to allow excess water to escape. If I keep the plant on my desk, how do I water it without making a mess?</p>

<p>I thought of putting another container (like a saucer) under the pot with gravel or pebbles to raise it up. But then, excess water would just remain in the saucer and maybe cause fungal growth. There is very little moving air in the office so I doubt whether it will all evaporate.</p>

<p>Will I need to regularly move my plant to drain/clean the outer container? That may be impractical given our ""open"" office plan and messy desks.</p>

<p>Am I missing something? Is there a better way that I haven't thought of?</p>
","<p>I assume that you yourself will be the only one watering the plant.</p>

<p>Most people use a saucer under the pot (without gravel) and avoid too much water build up by watering the plant only as needed.</p>

<p>If you do over water the plant you can carefully empty the saucer or leave it until the excess has soaked into the soil (it's very unlikely that you will get fungus or mould issues from just water).
You can normally tell if a plant will need more water because the soil will be dry to the touch. Loamy soils will retain water better than sandy ones but most pot plants use potting soil which is nice and water retentive.</p>

<p>Different plants will need different amounts of water so if you are unsure how much to give a plant, start off pouring very slowly and evenly over the soil surface and stop when water begins to appear in the saucer. After a couple of times you'll get a feel for how much. You may have to water the plant anywhere from once a day to once a week depending on the size and water requirement.</p>

<p>In terms of having to regularly move your plant, you may need to upgrade it to a larger pot or prune it from time to time but otherwise as long as it has enough light you shouldn't need to do much with it.</p>

"What is the ideal onion spacing/layout?","1654","","<p>I purchased some onions to plant in a small planter on my apartment balcony. The planter also contains some lettuces/greens, parsley, basil, and sage. The onions came in a little box as nursery plants do, sprouted with long green stems, with perhaps 15 onion plants packed in very tightly, one next to the other. So far, I have transferred the onions from the little box directly into my planter as-is, but I feel this might not be right and wanted to get some advice.</p>

<p>My hope is to continuously harvest the greens of the onions, for use in salad, eggs, whatever, and occasionally harvest young onions when I want a bit more kick. If a few make it all the way through to mature onions, great. </p>

<p>What would be the best way to lay out these onions? Should I leave them in a clump, separate them out a little, spread them through the planter as singletons?</p>
","<p>You don't mention what variety of onion you have, but for how you're planning to use them, I'd recommend fairly close spacing -- perhaps 1"" apart.</p>

<p>Normally I plant onions (for mature/bulb harvesting) at about 4"" apart in rows 6"" apart. This gives them plenty of space so the bulbs are competing with each other.</p>

<p>If you've already transplanted them, you may not want to transplant them again -- too much disturbance will negatively affect the plants. You can achieve the final spacing by thinning: when you want a small onion, carefully pull out a plant that is too close to its neighbors.</p>

<p>I might also suggest planting seeds instead of plants. Something like <a href=""http://www.fedcoseeds.com/seeds/search.php?item=2444&amp;index=8&amp;search=onion"" rel=""nofollow"">crystal wax white onion</a> is good for baby onions, and since you'd have a whole packet of seed, you could plant the seed thickly for cutting leaves for flavoring. (If you choose to go this route, remember that onion seed <em>must</em> be fresh -- year-old seed will not germinate well; don't buy last year's seed from the discount rack.)</p>

<p>Another possibility would be chives -- a very hardy perennial in the onion family that you can snip for flavoring whenever you want.</p>

"How long can I store seed potatoes?","1654","","<p>I've just ordered 1kg of heirloom seed potatoes but I only intend to plant 500g or so.</p>

<p>Going forward, I intend to harvest true seed from their fruits, but I'd like to keep a backup in case blight strikes in year 0.</p>

<p>How long can I viably store the seed potatoes and what would be the best conditions?</p>
","<p>Seed potatoes by the time you get them from your supplier have a chronological age and a physiological age.  Depending on how well it has been kept by the supplier, its physiological age may be older then its chronological age would suggest.  Factors that increase physiological age include crop stress ( high temperatures, low moisture, frost damage, disease ), damage from handling, and high storage temperature.  A seed potato that has been purchased still dormant will last longer.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z0wU1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z0wU1.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>One of the best-known potatoes for storage is Russet Burbank because it has a long dormancy period.  The longest period observed for this potato variety over an observation period from 1999-2013 is 200 days at 42 deg F.  Storing potatoes at lower temperatures causes sugar formation which is generally undesirable when used for consumption.  Herbicides are misted onto potatoes for sale as produce to inhibit sprouting, and commonly chlorpropham is used.  This may well affect the viability of seed potatoes, and there are alternatives such as ethylene and essential oils which can inhibit sprouting for a few weeks without affecting viability.</p>

<p>However, the problem is that unlike a seed which is largely metabolically inactive, a seed potato is actively respiring and physiologically ageing.  This will eventually trigger the physiological processes that cause sprouting, and measures to try and stop this may well affect the viability for its use as seed.  Since you've already ordered tubers as seed, the approximate maximum duration you can keep them as seed before they break dormancy is 200 days but will depend on what variety you ordered and you might be able to extend that for a few weeks without affecting viability using seed inhibitors.</p>

<p>BTW, if you're interested in developing or keeping potato varieties, you can check out the <a href=""https://web.facebook.com/groups/316831657858/?_rdr"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kenosha Potato Group</a> on facebook, with over 2000 members, and the <a href=""http://www.seedsavers.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Seed Savers Project</a></p>

"How can I encourage mulch to decompose?","1637","","<p>I have a few football-sized holes in a yard where I removed some rocks. I have access to a large amount of finely chopped wood mulch.</p>

<p>How can I encourage the mulch to decompose into fill dirt?</p>
","<p>There are several steps you can take to speed up decomposition of organic material. Decomposition of organic debris is both a physical and chemical process. Some of the steps listed below are needed to counteract some of the side effects of mulching that slow the mulching process.</p>

<p>The amount of heat generated by your mulch pile is an indicator of how fast breakdown is occurring. More steam from the pile interior when you mix it indicates a faster chemical breakdown but this higher heat also means you will need to perform regular physical mixing of the pile and keep adding water to keep the pile from getting too hot and killing the fungus and bacteria inside (slowing breakdown). It is entirely possible if you don't keep the pile wet enough it may get hot enough to come close to ignition, so keep a close eye on the pile during early mulching.</p>

<p>Some of the other answers here mention adding worms to the pile. The problem with this is that if you are trying for a fast  breakdown, the heat inside will tend either cook any worms inside or drive them out of the pile. Worms are great as natural aerators in slow decomposition mulch piles or in normal soil, since neither of these create the large amounts of heat that ""fast"" decomposition does.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) First, use mechanical force to break the contents of your mulch
  pile into as many small pieces as possible. Set your wood chipper to
  ""liquefy"". The smaller the starting mulch pieces, the faster the
  mulching breakdown process. Thin organic matter like tree leaves and
  grass break down faster than wood chips and twigs which break down
  faster than large wood pieces like branches.</p>
  
  <p>2) Add water as needed to keep your pile wet. Moisture encourages
  faster breakdown by encouraging bacterial and fungal growth. Usually
  keeping the pile covered by a plastic cover sheet keeps too much water
  from escaping the pile and keeps the surface of the pile moist.</p>
  
  <p>3) Mix your mulch pile on a daily basis using a garden fork. If your
  pile is breaking down quickly, you will notice steam coming from
  inside of the pile due to the heat from chemical reactions during
  breakdown. Mixing allows heat to escape from the pile as well as
  spreading bacteria and fungus around and aerates (allows air to mix
  into) the pile. Add more water as needed to help keep things moist as
  well as to cool the mulch.</p>
  
  <p>4) Mix some crushed lime into the pile using a garden fork a few days
  after starting the mulching process. The acid level of your pile will
  increase over time as your mulch pile breaks down, and this slows
  bacterial growth. Adding lime will decrease acidity, encouraging
  bacterial growth and speeding breakdown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The steps listed above apply to any mulch pile, but if you added a lot of wood to your pile when you created it, there are two further steps you might want to use. Wood in a mulch pile changes the chemical breakdown process.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5) Mix nitrogen fertilizer (such as ammonium nitrate) into the mulch
  pile. Nitrogen is used up during chemical breakdown of wood fiber, and
  insufficient nitrogen slows this breakdown.</p>
  
  <p>6) Sprinkle/mix fungi into the pile. Fungus (such as mushrooms) breaks
  down the physical structure of wood pieces so the bacteria can get
  into the interior of the wood chips.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eventually your mulch pile will no longer be warm and you will no longer see steam escaping when you mix it. This means that the breakdown of the mulch is slowing and is mostly complete. There may still be some wood chips mixed into the black organic crumbly mass of the decomposed mulch. Once the mulching breakdown slows like this, you can choose to age the pile for a few months longer to allow the mulch to completely break down, or if you are in a hurry you can use the mulch as is.</p>

<p>If you choose to age the mulch further, you won't need to mix the pile as often as you did during the early mulching process. Continue to mix the pile once a week or so and add water when needed to keep it moist. Continued aging will allow any remaining un-decomposed matter such as wood chips to completely decompose.</p>

<p>If you decide to use the mulch without aging it completely and wood still remains in the mulch, you should add nitrogen fertilizer to the mulch before using it on plants. If you don't add nitrogen, you risk starving the plants if when the wood decomposes it uses up all the nitrogen out of the soil.</p>

"My basil is ""rotting"", here's all the clues I have gathered","1635","","<p>This is my third try in having a basil that lives more than a month and I've been rather successful with my last try. But now, for some unknown reason to me, it's dying.</p>

<p>Is this ""normal""? Does it do any damage? Will this pollinate the flowers?</p>
","<p>Ants aren't typically trouble for plants themselves.  They <em>do</em> like sweet things, of course, and would be attracted to the fruit but I've not seen them destroy plants themselves.</p>

<p>Could be aphids.  The honeydew produced by the aphids is something the ants like.  Ants have this interesting relationship with aphids.  The aphids produce the honeydew and the ants like it and in return the ants protect them from predators.</p>

<p>Could also be the nectar that they like.  Nectar is sweet, of course, (it's one of the ingredients in honey) and they may be drawn to that, particularly if they are down in the flowers.</p>

<p>Will they pollinate them?  Maybe.  Raspberries are ""self fruiting"" and <em>can</em> produce their own fruit but honeybees (the common pollinator for raspberries here on our farm) help to ensure the best possible fruiting by moving that pollen from the anther to the pistil.  Ants <em>could</em> do that too, assuming they brush up against both parts.</p>

<p>I'd check for aphids but they're usually on the underside of leaves.  Natural predators like ladybugs or lacewings will work but you've got to have them handy to really combat the aphids.  I'd avoid any use of diatomaceous earth on the raspberries though, as this will harm honeybees too.  A little soapy water is effective against them, as is the time-consuming by-hand removal of them.</p>

<p>If it is not, why? Is there any study to make it possible?</p>
","<p>Probably not, which is why you don't find them in the tropics. Almonds grow well in Mediterranean type climates, with warm dry summers and mild wet winters. They also require a number of hours of chilling to enable the buds to break dormancy, between 300 to 600 hours at a temperature below 7.2 deg. C. Optimum temperatures for growth and nut production are 15-30 deg C, which is somewhat lower than a tropical region.</p>

<p>You could always think about using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminalia_catappa"" rel=""nofollow"">Terminalia catappa</a> instead, though it is a large tree at maturity - it's commonly known as the Tropical Almond, but also has lots of other common names.

You could probably get round that by using horticultural grit or gravel at the bottom of the pot though, it would certainly help, but the water in the last millimetre or two will always sit there.</p>

<p>I'd just like to add that you don't need to have only one drainage hole in the bottom, you usually only see that in ceramic or terracotta pots, most pots made of other materials have several, smaller holes in the base, and the water will drain out even if the pot is sitting on a solid surface.</p>

<p>1) Yes it is normal. They often even stay above ground year round. Any dead or completely yellowed foliage can be removed at any time.</p>

<p>2) Splitting the clump and replanting in rich, well drained topsoil will encourage flowering. Try not to compact the soil, or let it become waterlogged. Also, I've found that mulching with any carbonaceous organic material keeps out weeds better than cultivation, and is good for the plant.</p>

<p>3) The best time of year to divide this is in autumn before the ground freezes, but after the plant has finished with its growth for the year. This gives it time to regrow damaged roots and get established before blooming time next year.</p>

<p>And more importantly, how do I take care of this plant? This is a succulent plant, so it needs less water, right or wrong? On one site it says that I need to water it every time the top soil gets dry. I am confused as to how to take care of this plant. How do I take care of it and why the leaves are short.</p>
","<p>Jade plant is actually Crassula, usually Crassula ovata, but there are other varieties such as Crassula rupestris; even with Crassula ovata, there are varieties with slightly smaller leaves, variegated leaves and so on, so its possible you have a slightly different variety from the basic Crassula ovata. </p>

<p>From the photo supplied with your other question on this plant regarding pot size, its also possible the plant is etiolated and has not had sufficient nutrients or the right conditions for the leaves to have achieved their proper size, so I'm not sure which of these is correct - its being a sub variety or just not kept in optimum conditions.</p>

<p>In terms of watering, these plants are prone to fungal diseases if kept too wet, but they still need water, particularly in summer, so they need good, free draining soil in a pot with good drainage. Water when the surface of the soil feels dry to the touch, water well, allow to drain freely, and water again only when the soil feels just dry to the touch. They need bright daylight but be careful about sunlight - if they're used to it already, they do very well in sun, but one that's grown without sun may burn when first exposed. More information regarding watering and general care here</p>

<p>I know the link refers to Crassula argentea, but that's just an alternative name for Crassula ovata, they're the same plant. Note that, although there is a recommendation for fertilizing regularly during the summer months, the plant will cope just fine with less feeding than is suggested. Recommendations regarding fertilizing are based on optimum rather than 'average' care. </p>

","<p>Those are grubs. There are a lot of kinds of grubs, though, and they look so similar, you often can only tell them apart by their rear ends (seriously, see below)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Sgfk.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>They feed on roots (usually turf, but also trees, perennials, and other plants) as larvae, and then emerge from the ground as beetles, which feed on the leaves. I think they might be <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclocephala_borealis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">masked chafer</a> beetles. You don't yet have Japanese beetles in Phoenix.</p>

<p>Methods of control:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Chickens</strong> work after a till, but this isn't practical unless you intend to till the entire area.</li>
<li><strong>Adult beetle traps</strong> (pheromonal/floral) have worked for me in reducing the amounts of adults.</li>
<li><strong>Insecticides</strong> are the usual method of control. You may not want to use them in an orchard, if you want to be perfectly organic. I use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidacloprid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">imidacloprid</a> for grub control in lawns. It's a systemic (taken in by the plant, so when the grubs eat it, they die) neurotoxin.</li>
</ul>

<p>For grub control, timing is key. The grubs live low in the soil most of the year, below where you can effectively treat. They come up near the soil before pupating, and then when the adults lay eggs, the new larvae start out near the surface before going down. So you need to apply right in that pupae-flight-egg window.</p>

<p>Here's a helpful chart. It may vary according to your location:</p>

"What are these dark brown spots on my tomato leaves?","1595","","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bF1Lj.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">I have these dark brown spots on my tomato leaves that appeared over the weekend. I'm only seeing them on one branch. The rest of the plant looks fine. The nearest I can tell, it looks like spotted wilt. The leaves are starting to draw up and die. Should I cut this branch to avoid spreading? If not, what's the best way to get rid of it?</p>
","<p>Definitely, cut that branch off (clean your pruners with alcohol, before and after). Based on this picture, it looks like you had aphids first, then their honeydew and the terminal leaf looks like leaf spot, a fungus. The spots are going across the veins and there is a slight tan halo where the plant is cutting off nutrition to the areas where fungus is producing spores.  The plant does this on purpose to get rid of the fungus.</p>

<p>It's hard to believe that only this branch has been infected. Look carefully at new growth, under leaves and watch the stem.  If you get black spots on your stem, the plant is in trouble.</p>

<p>Is this plant outside in the garden? If it gets humid, provide your own wind with an electric fan.  If you plan to have more humidity, you might want to spray with Neem, at night to protect bees (some Neem brochures say it is hazardous to bees and others say it is not).  Neem is like a little raincoat that is pretty safe...read the directions before you leave the store.  Make sure the formulation is safe for edibles.  Not all Neem products are equal.  Don't water late in the day.  Start looking for Powdery Mildew, slight cupping, white dusting...this you will need to get on top of right away.  Spraying with Neem or even Serenade (bacillus subtilus, a bacteria that helps prevent fungal infections).  </p>

<p>If you start getting into fungal infections you might want to put up a roof to keep plants out of the rain.  Still need aeration, so keep the fans under the roofing material. Roof material could be clear plastic, a sort of partial greenhouse.</p>

<p>Do you know what the difference between reproductive branches versus vegetative?  What you are holding is vegetative.  Meant to gather sunlight and do photosynthesis.  If you can see the difference, look for vegetative branches that don't get a lot of sunlight and prune those off to increase aeration.  Allowing air to flow through the plant and keep leaves dry.</p>

When new growth appears, keep it in bright filtered light, such as near a large east facing window. Use a weak fertilizer solution, such as half-strength 10-10-10, every other week after the plant has put out top growth.</p>

<p><strong>As a garden plant:</strong></p>

<p>Prepare some well worked loamy soil in a shady area, preferably away from large trees. Mound the loose soil into mounds 10"" high, and 18"" wide. Plant the roots 10-12"" apart, and right below the soil surface. Keep the soil damp. Harvest when the tops are killed by frost, in temperate areas, or when needed otherwise.</p>

Water well, and place in a warm, humid environment. When new growth appears, keep it in bright filtered light, such as near a large east facing window. Use a weak fertilizer solution, such as half-strength 10-10-10, every other week after the plant has put out top growth.</p>

<p><strong>As a garden plant:</strong></p>

<p>Prepare some well worked loamy soil in a shady, well drained area, preferably away from large trees. Make sure the soil is worked at least 6-8"" down, and free of debris. Plant the roots about 12"" apart, and right below the surface. Water well. You can mulch with leaves, grass clippings, or another good organic mulch after the top growth emerges, to help keep in the moisture. Harvest when the top growth is killed by frost in temperate areas, in other areas harves lightly as needed through the season.</p>

<h3><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmeric"" rel=""nofollow"">Turmeric (<em>Curcuma longa</em>)</a></h3>

<p><strong>As a houseplant:</strong></p>

<p>Use a container at least 12"" wide, and 14"" deep. Fill it with a well drained organic potting mix. Bury the rhizomes right below the surface. Water well. Place in the brightest location possible, full sun is ideal. Fertilize when new growth appears (in about 2-4 weeks from planting time). Do this every other week. </p>

<p><strong>As a garden plant:</strong></p>

<p>In a well drained, sunny area, with deep, good soil, work up the top 8"" and remove debris. Plant the rhizomes about 2"" deep, and 12"" apart.

","<p>You can definitely grow grass right up to the foundation - it won't harm your house in any way. That said, there are a few reasons you might not want to do this. </p>

<ul>
<li>First, your mower is unlikely to be able to get the grass right next
to the foundation, which means you'll need to take a trimmer around
the house every time you mow to get a nice, clean look.</li>
<li>Second, your yard is most likely graded to direct water away from the
foundation of your house quickly or keep it away altogether, which
means the grass right next to the foundation may struggle to get
enough water. Dry, brown grass right next to your house is a real
possibility; on the bright side, you won't need the string trimmer if
the grass is dead.</li>
<li>Finally, foundations aren't the most beautiful thing in the world,

"Does urinating at the base of a tree help it grow?","1576","","<p>I've been reading about tree fertilizers and urea constantly comes up as a good source of nitrogen for trees. Let's say your dogs always pick the same tree to urinate on every day. Would that tree be healthier, grow faster etc. as a result?</p>
","<p>In one word, no.</p>

<p>Dog urine contains high concentrations of nitrogen and salts. The concentrations are sufficient to burn grass roots.  Tree roots near the surface are only slightly woodier and just as subject to burn.</p>

<p>For mature trees they can probably deal with the root burn in localized areas.  A freshly planted tree might have a harder time depending on the number of dogs.</p>

<p>Edit: @David High nitrogen levels kill roots in a small localized zone. After the urea has been broken down into nitrogen that is available then new roots can make use of it. Dogs tend to be consistent on where they urinate so you get a cycle of root burn followed by new root growth in the kill area and then more root burn. This does not help a tree grow.</p>

"Crop rotation theory v. practice","1573","","<p>Every guide to growing vegetables will have an early section on rotating roots, brassicas and legumes. There might even be a little diagram with neat evenly spaced and sized areas marked out for each group.</p>

<p>It always sounds so simple in theory. </p>

<p>But the guides are frustratingly silent on practical questions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What if you don't tend to grow the three groups in even quantities (say you grow very few brassicas)?</p></li>
<li><p>What if your vegetable plot isn't uniform in its distribution of warmth, light and soil quality? For example I always want to start off early salads, radishes and carrots up the warm end of my little rectangle in Feb/Mar. But that's crop rotation immediately messed up.</p></li>
<li><p>Where do salads fit in?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>I've been trending towards lots of heavily interspersed companion gardening (e.g. rather than 10ft of onions and 10 ft of carrots, I'll have 1ft of onions, and 1ft of carrots, ten times).  And I like to completely change up my garden layout from one year to the next.  So the chance of any particular crop being grown in the same place two years in a row is slim, even if I don't put any mental energy into planning the rotation.</p>

<p>Likewise, I try to make sure that new compost gets laid down at least once a year.  And definitely think about fall/winter cover crops that might nourish the soil.</p>

<p>So I take the roots/brassica/legume as one guideline among many.  Another guideline I've read is squash => nightshades => grains (corn) => beans.  Or nightshades/potatoes => brassica => carrots => alliums.  Or three years of anything and then legumes.  These are good guidelines, but as a home gardener don't stress yourself out over them.</p>

<p>Since salads tend to be spring/fall crops, I'll either rotate them with turnips/radishes, or I'll rotate which parts of the garden are used for spring or summer crops.  I have one area of my garden that gets great light in the early spring, but only about 5-6hrs of direct sun during the late spring through fall.  So I tend to rotate quick spring veggies (e.g. lettuce), root veggies, alliums, and herbs through there, because that's what will grow there.</p>

<p>The point is that there are different crop rotation recommendations, but you can relax them a bit if you put down fresh compost every fall and spring, keep things moving around so the soil doesn't get too stressed, and make sure those nitrogen fixers get a chance at every spot in your garden every so often.  It's all about the health of the soil.</p>

<p>When overwatering occurs you get some leaf drop but you also stress the plant so it is vulnerable to bacterial/fungal/viral infections which are the source of the spotting.</p>

<p>You can reduce the spotting by increasing the light levels and decreasing the amount of water.  Let the plant get healthy and it should outgrow the disease.  Repotting will not affect the disease as it is inside the plant.</p>

<p>A watering schedule should reflect how much light, how pot bound the plant is and the type of soil.  For a plant that is in very high light (unobstructed south exposure), moderately pot bound and a soil less mix no more than once a week with enough water to wet the entire root ball.  It is more likely that watering every ten to fourteen days would meet the plant's needs.  </p>

"What is this tree with ovate-elliptical, serrate leaves, and racemes of small berries?","1566","","<p>Asking from northeast New Jersey. Sorry I couldn't get a better picture of it - I'm hoping this is enough to identify it. These pictures were taken from below the tree branches. The tree is in the front yard, is a little taller than the one-story house it's in front of and I think is wider than it is tall (hard to tell because a portion of it is getting crowded out by a large pine tree). It currently has small round berries growing on it that are various shades of green and yellow at the moment.</p>

"Hugely different results storing apples from different trees?","1556","","<p>So, I took a look at my apple store over this weekend. It being February, the apples have been in there a number of months.</p>

<p>In previous years I haven't had a massive amount of success storing apples but I've learnt some lessons (secure the store against rodents, don't store windfalls) and I'm getting better results.</p>

<p>This autumn, for the first time, I decided to store apples from <strong>different trees</strong> in <strong>separate trays</strong>, instead of mixing them up.</p>

<p>Huge difference in success rates! We have four trees. The trays from three of them (two eaters and a cooker) are pretty clean and the apples have lasted well. The trays from the fourth tree (a cooker) are 100% brown and unusable.</p>

<p>Maybe this was my problem all along in previous years! Mixing them up, I just didn't realise that one variety was rotting out the whole store.</p>

<p>Is it normal for one variety to completely fail to store? Is store-ability widely variable depending on <em>variety</em>?</p>
","<p>Quite normal. Some varieties store well, some don't. As a rule, the better storing apples are harder than the not so good for storing apples as they come off the tree. If you know the variety (beyond it being a cooker) you might even find that noted as part of its description - in any case, you now know it for yourself.</p>

<p>An alternate storage method might suit the one that does not store as well (I made gallons of dried apples last fall, as well as apple sauce and apple butter.) You can also make sure that any stored whole apples from that tree are the first ones to be used, and to be sure to use them up before February (depending when the last time you checked the store was, you might have some idea how long they did last.)</p>

<p><strong>Edit, Add:</strong> If you are not already doing so, you may also benefit from <a href=""http://postharvest.tfrec.wsu.edu/REP2010B.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">scalding your trays</a>, to greatly reduce mold populations and perhaps also carryover of codling moths.</p>

","<p>That is a bad case of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_mites"">spider mites</a>.  Check the link to a similar question. The good news is that you can control the situation easily and safely with soap and water and a cloth.</p>

<p>Mix up a solution of a teaspoon of dish soap to a quart of water and stir.  Soak the cloth in the solution and wipe down every surface of the plant, top and bottom, stems, everything.</p>

<p>Wait five minutes and then rinse or spray the plant with water to wash off the soap.  </p>

<p>The Spider mite eggs that are left will hatch in approximately five to seven days at room temperature.  You will have to repeat the treatment at least twice and continue watching for them to return.</p>

<p>Edit: I reviewed the picture and it's possible that you have mealy bug as well. There are some white cottony tufts in the upper left of the first photo.  Soap and water will help control them too.</p>

<p>The damage to the leaves from the spider mites is permanent.  If the plant was in good health you could consider waiting until things are under control and then pruning it back and removing the damaged foliage.  This should cause new growth which will be healthy.</p>

<p>Edit: Sandra asks where do spider mites come from?  For new plant purchases it is most likely that spider mites were present in the grower's greenhouse or holding area but were being controlled by pesticide sprays. After you bought the plant the population started increasing.  For an established plant spider mites can transfer from other plants in the immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>Citrus plants are known to be tasty to spider mites and the low humidity conditions found indoors are a low stress condition for most houseplants.</p>

<p>Another solution, if you live in a warmer area, is to put the plant outside, under shade and hose it down.  This will provide a rapid take down of the population and make it easier for subsequent applications of soap and water to control the population.</p>

<p>What is the best way to go about removing this nuisance (all 20/30 of them) if it is a weed?</p>

<p>(The location is in eastern Iowa.)</p>
","<p>If you mean burr in the usual ""comes off the plant and sticks to clothing/animal fur"" sense, that charming behavior tends to class them as weeds in the minds of anyone who isn't of the ""but there's no such thing as a weed"" camp. They don't look exactly like the tiny green  (later brown) burrs (latin name unknown by me) that plague my yard and animals and socks, but they are similar in aspect. Remove and burn or remove and place in trash, digging out as much root as possible and trying to not lose too many of the burrs, which will add to the seeds that are probably already in your soil to make the next several years annoying. Also try to learn what they look like when smaller (before they fruit) so you can pull them out earlier next year.</p>

<p>Not burdock - that's pretty easy to spot/identify (and eventually easy to spot even the year before it flowers, since it's biennial.)</p>

","<p>The pot surface looks quite dry to me. While they are water efficient, these plants do need sufficient watering. </p>

<p>The death of lower leaves is not that concerning, under normal circumstances, because as the plant matures, it drops off lower leaves. </p>

<p>I grow this plant outdoors in Zone 9B, and they get water every 3rd day. The soil is draining, and mulched, and so far the plant is doing okay. For now, water the plant immediately, water every 3 or 4 days and see if the plant improves. Later on you can consider scaling back the schedule. Do not feed the plant fertilizers till it recovers, given it is currently distressed. </p>

","<p>When you fill this with soil...and water this will definitely separate and blow out.  You need a foundation of compacted gravel with drain pipe and at least one block depth beneath the floor of block.  Rebar pounded from top of wall through gravel bottom at least 12"" apart.  'Banter' blocks with each layer 1/2"" towards inside of your planter (at this point to get this height which is MAX already you'd need 4 layers the loest layer is on compacted gravel footing, then one block or 3/4 block to surface, then 2 more blocks...don't do any higher than 3 blocks! anymore is pretty iffy).  Mix concrete in a wheel barrow and fill from top. Keep jiggling and prying with extra rebar to get rid of as many air pockets possible while filling. This can be done with each layer but takes more proficiency with rebar.  Find a friend who has done this before?  Allow to cure for 2 weeks before filling with soil (purchased top soil with mulch or even bagged potting soil).  Do not use garden soil.  Drainage will be fine if you've got drain pipe at the footing inside your planter, daylighted downward to grade.  Lots of holes in your wall to facilitate aeration and drainage.  I'd find a way to CAP this wall so that one can sit on it or place big pots of flowers securely.  If this design were in straight lines and 90 degree corners you'd have far more room for plants and this would be much more in line with your home, also in 90 degree angles...planters any higher than 18"" are rare unless the patio is higher.  At this height you are creating an area for sitting as well as being able to use for props/dinners.  If I were you I'd redesign your Keyhole garden without curves.  Lower your whole project by a foot and 1/2.  Dig trenches, fill with crushed gravel, compact, lay drain pipe at bottom to gather water and drain out of planter.  Allow one block to be laid so that at least 1/3 of block is below grade.  No more than 2 blocks high off this layer of block. Go ahead and use mastic...concrete glue between blocks. Why don't you want this to be permanent?  Filling with concrete and rebar does not make this totally permanent.  Not tough to break up and take out.  But why?  Why don't you make this planter larger? Think about making a similar one on the other side of the patio!! Your patio should be enlarged as well...I'd use a Roman cobble 7X9X2 to expand out and around bases of planters.  Leave room between house and planters at least 3 feet to walk upon or bring right up to house and leave a foot of space away from stucco/siding and at least 4"" below siding should be free of soil/gravel to protect siding.  Gravel you intend to walk upon should be 3/8- crushed or smaller.  And compacted.  Do not get tempted by any color!!  Always use ONE color, preferably dove gray...</p>

<p>As for plants...because of the concrete your soil will have an alkaline pH.  Do not try to grow acid loving plants in your planters or even near your foundation.  You CAN but you'll have to test for pH on a regular basis and make sure your soil is acidic enough for the plants.  There are ways to lower the pH for acidic soil loving plants.  </p>

<p>I know you are thinking that if you have to go to this much trouble...well, I would go check out CMU walls.  Concrete Modular Units...grin!! Lots of more...authentic rock wall looking concrete blocks...even in Ashlar patterns meaning some vertical units as part of the wall.  Concrete caps, a lighter gray than blocks if possible... 2"" thick are designed to use with these walls.  One can even design curves that will have concrete caps made in their radius. And the blocks you have already purchased make for a great foundation for CMU blocks. </p>

<p>Looks to me that you have a stucco sided home?  Using your concrete blocks you should be able to do the same siding for your planters.  This truly pulls your home into the garden and would look very professional.  One way or the other but your concrete block wall as you have it and one block lower, will look ok if you do at least one more planter like it on the other side of the patio.  Those concrete pavers to extend your patio would pull it all together.  The pavers need to be set on compacted gravel then sand butted up tight.  No spaces!!  You'll still get a few weeds between pavers but oh so easy to maintain.  They'll need and EDGE and the guys that sell these pavers can direct you...whatever you do DON'T SKIMP.  This done correctly will amplify the value of your home more than a brand new kitchen or bathroom.  I kid you not...</p>

</ul>

<p>And so on.</p>
","<p>Standard, in this context, means trained into tree form. Usually standard shrubs and vines are trained from a young age, allowing only one stem to grow from the ground, forming the trunk. This must be kept free of sideshoots and laterals up to a certain point, which makes up the head of the standard. A good head will look bushy and balanced, and fit with the length of trunk. </p>

<p>In other cases, The trunk is grown first, either from seed, or as a cutting, and the head is grafted on as one or (usually) more scions. This is grown on and trimmed regularly until it is ready for show, at which time it is planted out or sold. This is almost always the method used or weeping plants, or to get multiple bloom colors in one head. It creates a more formal, globe shaped head in non-weeping specimens.</p>

<p>These plants must be carefully tended, to keep them from reverting back to their natural form. This means removing all shoots from the head down, and careful heading back, pinching, and thinning out of the head as it grows over time. Eventually, you will want to replace the entire plant, as they can get ragged and lose vigor with age. However, with informal standards, like the wisteria standard pictured below, age enhances the plant, and the best ones are the ones that have been around the longest.</p>

<p>Usually, the standard needs support, which is usually provided as a system of stakes and ties. This is especially true of vine standards, which cannot support themselves well even when mature.</p>

I have placed nothing on the pot as cover and I water them with a watering pot once a day. The room temperature is about 29&#176;C (84&#176;F).</p>

<p>What else should I do in order to encourage the seeds to germinate?</p>
","<p>Possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is watering once a day enough? Is the soil drying out between waterings? You want to provide evenly damp soil. You may need to lightly water morning and evening to keep the soil damp.</li>
<li>Are you using fresh seed? If your seed is old and hasn't been stored in ideal conditions, the seeds may be dead.</li>
<li>Are they purchased seed or seed you saved yourself? If it is seed you saved, and you didn't collect or store it properly, it may be dead.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a large enough batch of seed, you can do a germination test to see if the seed is viable:</p>

<ol>
<li>Take a sample of the seeds. 10 is enough, but if you have a larger batch, 20 will be a better sample size.</li>
<li>Get a damp paper towel (not sopping wet, just damp) and a ziplock bag.</li>
<li>Place the seeds in a row in the center of the towel. Fold over the towel so the seeds are covered. Place the towel and seeds in the bag. Seal the bag.</li>
<li>Place the bag in a warm place.</li>
<li>Check after a week. Count the number of seeds that have sprouted and multiply by 10, this gives you your germination percentage.</li>
</ol>

<p>If fewer than 50% germinate, then your seed is weak -- even the ones that germinate are unlikely to be strong plants. In this case, buy new seed from a good supplier and store it properly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tomato shoots are geotropic: They try

  Topsy Turvy plants slump as they grow,
  often twisting their stems, which can
  cause splitting.</p>

Black dots of excrement pinpointed on the first thrips related image of the article are visible on my first posted image.  </p></li>
<li><p>In the article it is also mentioned that the trips leave some kind of shiny cast on the plant after feeding on it and the damaged areas on my pepper really do shine.</p></li>
<li><p>The greenhouse whitefly didn't look quite like the insect i spotted, but the two thrips shown on the second image from the article look pretty much like the bug which i tried to describe in my question (sorry, i should have given a little bit more detailed description).</p></li>
<li><p>Spider mites looked like something close to that, what is attacking my plant. There even were some single web strings hanging around the peppers, but nothing as dense and as small as the spider mites webs shown on images related to mites. I know it can still be them, but the webs look more spider-like (regular spider not spider mite) to me and there was in fact a little spider, which could make these webs, hanging around my desk a little while ago. At least i hope it was a spider and not a spider mite.</p></li>

<p>I'll now try to get rid of the insects treating them as they would in fact be thrips. If i succeed i will assume that i was really dealing with thrips and accept this answer. </p>

"What Should I look (out) for when purchasing a hydrangea plant?","1539","","<p>I was about to buy a potted hydrangea as a last minute gift. I looked at the stem and it appeared dry, brittle and brown at the base of the plant. It's nice and green and firm near the heads of the flowers. Here is a picture that attempts to capture this difference:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AvA6a.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Is this color/texture difference along the stem a problem?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What characteristics should I avoid when buying hydrangea plants?</strong></p>

<p>Most stems are in bloom, colored pink, so from above the plant looks very lively. </p>
","<p>I'm <em>almost</em> certain that what you're seeing is the <strong>difference in color between old growth and new growth</strong>. Hydrangeas (I mean <em>H. macrophylla</em>) always bloom from the current year's growth. So after a season, or during winter, the plant can be cut back and the lush new growth in spring will bloom.</p>

<p>In your pic, the plant looks like its stems were pruned at some point and the new growth from the buds are the green colored stems. You can see that the transition from brown to green is always at a joint (node), which sort of confirms this. Even if they weren't pruned, you'd see something similar if the plant had a growth spurt from the apex after a dormant period. I think your plant is <strong>perfectly healthy</strong> and there's nothing to worry about.</p>

<h3>Choosing hydrangeas:</h3>

<p>In general, you should not just look for good characteristics in the hydrangea that you buy, but you should also pair it with your soil conditions and sunlight availability. </p>

<ol>
<li>Most hydrangeas require shade for it to thrive, so consider if you'll be able to provide that (if you're planting outdoors), else you might have to settle for a smaller, indoor one.</li>
<li><em>H. macrophylla</em> changes colors depending on the soil pH. <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/1745/109"">I explain more on this in a different answer</a>. If your soil is acidic/alkaline, it might be preferable to getting a blue/pink hydrangea respectively, as then the plant will not have to experience a shock from a dramatic change in pH.</li>
<li><p>Avoid plants that only have thin, upright stems. These occur due to irregular pruning (or none at all) and will bloom only at the top and don't branch out much. Eventually, it will break under its own weight. Having several branches will ensure that you will have lush blooms and also tells you that the plant has been pruned well.</p>

<p>I learnt that I needed to prune my hydrangeas only after I let it grow to look like a Hanukka menorah (until then, I was only <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/965/109"">deheading the flower heads</a>). Needless to say, flower production took a hit and the poor thing looks all scrawny now. So you don't want to buy something that looks like this.</p></li>
<li>Avoid plants with obvious spotting in the leaves, rots, patchy leaves or curled/warped flowers. These are all signs of some defect/disease or the other. </li>
<li>Choose plants that have large (it wasn't named <em>macrophylla</em> for nothing!), bright leaves and preferably ones that have a nice bloom. The bloom is primarily so that you can have a look at the color and the liveliness before buying it.</li>
<li>Lastly, if you can drive to a local nursery (if there's one in your city), I'd strongly suggest buying a plant from there. This is more likely to have been grown in your climate (or a similar one), which makes it easier for it to adapt. The packaged/gift-wrapped hydrangeas that you find in a grocery store are usually mass produced somewhere and then shipped to various places. These will <em>look healthy</em> as long as they're in the same pot, but once you transplant it, it'll have a hard time.</li>

"Dendrobium nobile: How and when to cut and pot new plant (keiki) from mother?","1539","","<p>I have a (slightly neglected) dendrobium nobile that has started to grow new plants at the top of two old stalks. One is staring to show roots (see picture below), the other is still a bit smaller. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J4K7G.jpg"" alt=""Dendrobium baby""></p>

<p>While I have seen this phenomenon with phalenopsis orchids, it's new to me with a dendrobium nobile.</p>

<p>So what's next? Should I </p>

<ul>
<li>cut off the baby plant (keiki?) and put it in its own pot? (now? once it has more roots?)</li>
<li>bend the mother stalk down, let the new plant take root in a second container and cut then? </li>
<li>do something else?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Let the keiki grow on until it has more leaves and more than two roots - preferably around 4 to 6 roots. Once its achieved that sort of size, cut it off the mother stem just below the point from which it's growing, without damaging its roots, and pot up in the usual way.</p>

"Should I pinch my blueberry bushes for the first year?","1538","","<p>I know you're supposed to pinch strawberry plants for their first year. That way you have higher yields of strawberries the following years because the roots have been able to fully develop during that first year.</p>

<p>Does the same hold true with blueberry plants? Would I need to pinch off the blossoms during the first year I've planted them?</p>
","<p>Blueberry plants don't always flower much the first year, and I usually leave them. However, like strawberry plants, blueberries are establishing a root system during the first year or so, and it is beneficial to remove flowers to divert the energy sources toward something that will benefit the plant. There are some cases where I've had to start pinching flowers because the plants weren't growing at all, but loaded with berries from year 1.  </p>

<p>So if you don't have a huge plantation or something huge, I'd recommend pinching the flowers the first year. Blueberries are a longer term plant than strawberries, so anything you can do for them in the beginning will greatly help the plant later on. Under good conditions, in 5 years or so, you might have a 6 1/2' giant bush producing over 20 quarts per plant.</p>

<p>I've found that in less than ideal conditions, potted blueberries adapt a <em>lot</em> better than bareroot plants. Actively growing potted plants with leaves aren't going to flower, dormant stock might. Look for a significantly wider bud. Or if you're planting in the fall, which is a good idea, you could get flowers from bed or pot grown plants. </p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://gardener.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Catfacing"">this web page</a> there is no cure; the problem is related to planting out and can only be prevented. They mention that large-fruit varieties are most susceptible, so your Brandy Boy and Porterhouse may be at risk if they were planted the same way. Your grapes might be safer. They also say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...disturbances in flower production such as low temperature, injury 3-weeks before flowers are mature, especially in early plantings, but also with injury from growth regulators such as 2,4-d. Pruning and high nitrogen can also aggravate the problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some useful references are included at the bottom of that page; the [second reference to a <a href=""http://www.avrdc.org/pdf/tomato/catfacing.pdf"">World Vegetable Center article on catfacing</a> gives explicit control instructions to help prevent it next season.</p>

<p>This <a href=""http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/02949.html"">Colorado State Extension tomato problems fact sheet</a> shows pictures of catfacing next to blossom end rot. If you compare the two photos there, yours looks much more like catfacing than BER.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Catfacing (Figure 10) is a term that describes tomato fruit that is misshapen, with scars and holes in the blossom end. The cause is thought to be cold weather during blossoming and perhaps high levels of nitrogen. To manage it, avoid setting out transplants too early in the season.</p>

","<p>It'll be, as you suggest, slow release fertiliser such as Polyon - these are coated with polymer, and it depends on the formulation of the polymer whether they eventually bio degrade, and how quickly they do so.

"When will my tomatoes be ready to harvest?","1530","","<p>I am planning to serve homemade tomato soup for a large dinner party on Sept 24, 2011 (42 days from this posting). </p>

<p>This dinner is really important to me; so important, that I decided to plant my own tomato garden (those gas treated supermarket tomatoes just don't compare to the real thing, ya know?). This will be my very first gardening experience, so I'm looking for any useful information at this point.</p>

<p>So, to continue the story, this weekend I found a source for 4 large Big Boy tomato plants. The season is almost over and the people at the nursery looked at me like I was crazy as I walked off the lot with $130 worth of tomato plants, soil, pots, and feed. </p>

<p>Here are some picks of one of the plants:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7qwva.jpg"" alt=""Tomatoes""></p>

<p>The plants stand about 3 feet tall and look reasonably healthy. They're planted in 14in ceramic pots (around 4 gal).</p>

<p>Now here's the real question: Based on these images, <strong>will my tomatoes be ready in time for my all-important dinner party?</strong> Is there anything besides a healthy dose of sunlight, regular watering/feeding that I can do to speed things along. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Here's a pic of the tomatoes a day before the dinner party. The plants are still going strong (thanks to you all, no doubt) and I foresee many more tomatoes in the next few weeks.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RucZS.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>
","<p>From the look of the pictures I think that the plants will be ready on time for the dinner. In the meantime I would recommend the following care for them. I water once a day at least. Never let them stress for water. Nine out of ten days they are watered with a half solution of Peters or some other water soluble fertilizer rated for tomatoes and vegetable gardens. On the tenth day water them very thoroughly with plain water. Stop all fertilization a week to ten days before harvest. This helps to leach out any salts or nitrates that can build up in the soil and harm the plants. By being observant you should be able to minimize any damage. When you need to get rid of pests always try the method that will do the least harm to the environment and helpful garden critters. Start with mild soaps and work your way up if you must. I hope that this helps. Keep them in a sunny spot. Good luck  </p>

"Why do blueberries need acidic soil?","1525","","<p>I know that blueberries need soil in the range of ph 4-5, but no one ever says why they need the pH in that range. I've heard that it may be because of a lack of available iron at higher pH, and that other plants emit acidic in their root zone to create iron that they can use. So is it all about the iron? This chart of nutrients avaiable by pH is also interesting...it looks like the only nutrient available at low pH is iron. But if iron is the limiting factor, it looks like it is available up to pH 6.5. So why the pH 4-5?
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1SWpZ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Blueberries have a rudimentary root system that doesn't have the finer root hairs found on most plants.</p>

<p>They grow best in forest duff (lots of acidic, organic matter). The acidic nature of the soil causes bacteria and fungi to thrive that release minerals and ammonia that blueberry bushes thrive on and that their roots can readily absorb. </p>

<p>In plant root systems it's more about symbiosis and the nutrient pool it creates than the measurable byproducts (acidity, nitrogen, etc.). The main difference between woodlands and gardens is the method of nitrogen uptake (ammonia vs. nitrates).</p>

<p>Neutral to very slightly acidic soil tends to be a nitrate rich source of nitrogen, with mostly bacterial activity (the rest of your garden), whereas acidic soil favors more fungal activity and an ammonia rich environment for the nitrogen source. Acidic soil also hosts acid loving bacteria (which that chart doesn't address) that directly attack mineral in the soil to release phosphates, iron, magnesium which your blueberries love. The iron particularly is needed to prevent chlorosis so the leaves can create enough chlorophyll.</p>

"Can drained water from potted plants be used again to water another house plant?","1525","","<p>I'm wondering if it's okay to use water that has drained through a houseplant to water another plant. Is it safe for both the other plant and the soil? What I mean is that we use at least 500ml (2 cups) of water for each pot on an average basis. A lot of the water is drained from the pot, so if someone has no trouble collecting the drained water, can it be re-used to water another houseplant?</p>

<p>This might seem nonsensical, but consider this when you have to water 30-40 or more plants. What one will achieve via this is conservation of water.</p>
","<p>Well, the correct way to conserve water is to watch your water, and make sure you don't have excess drainage. This of course takes time and experience. Till then, use measuring cups, or watering jugs that have measurements on them. Or, if watering with a hose, time yourself. A kitchen timer for example, can come in handy. </p>

<p>Unless you have different soils for different plants, such as citrous fruits etc., you can do this. Collect the excess water, dilute it with fresh water, just in case you have used different or excess fertilizer on a plant etc. and then re-use it.</p>

","<p>This does likely have something to do with watering, but there are several issues here. When watering, it is better to give the water all at one time, ideally over a period of &frac12; hour, and make sure it soaks in well. Then let it dry for a time before watering again. The time will depend on environmental factors, such as temperature, precipitation, and cloudiness. Making a shallow trench around the trees will keep the water where it should be, and help keep precipitation in place.</p>

<p>Mulch with a layer of organic matter to a depth of between 2 and 4 inches. This will conserve soil moisture, keep the soil temperature more even, and add organic matter as soil microbes work it in. Keep it away from the trunk, though, in a 6"" diameter circle.</p>

<p>Those trees are on the larger end of those that are regularly transplanted. On trees this size, the first 2-3 years are often spent rebuilding the root system, which was severely damaged during transplanting. What you should do is make it as easy as possible for the tree, by watering properly, fertilizing very lightly, or with an organic fertilizer high in phosphorus, mulching, and even cutting back crowded top growth (which is possibly pulling more energy than is well sustainable.</p>

<p>From your picture, the trees look OK. Again, water more, in the style described above, fertilize, and mulch. Also, that wall will be very reflective, so that may have some affect on the leaves drying. If you can cover it with something less reflecting that will be beneficial.

<blockquote>
  <p>Cucumber bacterial wilt is caused by the bacterium, Erwinia tracheiphila, and is characterized initially by wilting and drying of individual leaves, especially those exhibiting cucumber beetle injury. Cucumbers and muskmelons are more susceptible than pumpkins or squash; the disease is rarely a problem on watermelons.</p>
  
  <p>Infected plants initially show wilting and drying of individual leaves. As the leaves wilt and shrivel, stems may dry out suddenly. Later, wilting spreads to entire branches and vines. Wilting will occur during the middle of the day during periods with high water stress. The vine may recover at night. Eventually, however, the entire vine will wither, collapse, and die. In partially resistant plants, symptoms appear as dwarfing, excessive blooms, and branching. A good diagnostic test for this wilt is to cut a wilted stem near the base. Touch a knife blade to the cut and draw away from the cut. White to clear strings of the bacterial ooze will be strung out from the cut made on the infected plant to the knife blade. This diagnostic test is not 100% reliable. Further investigation may be necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means you've had at least one striped cucumber beetle around. Unfortunately, you cannot cure the disease. It's best to destroy the infected plants asap, to prevent spreading.</p>

<p>You can prevent it somewhat if you rotate your crops each year, grow tolerant varieties, and deter the beetles (the disease carriers) from landing on your plants, with an insecticidal dust, or netting.</p>

"What to guild with Asparagus","1507","","<p>I have been working on applying permacultural techniques of layering in space and time, and most of my gardens work well on this principle but I am having trouble applying it to asparagus. What should I plant around my asparagus to reduce exposed soil and improve fertility?</p>

<p>I have done some research and found a lot of people seem to say that asparagus should be grown alone, but this poses weeding and soil fertility problems I would rather avoid long-term. So, how can I apply permacultural techniques to the growing of asparagus?</p>

<p>Asking here because it was declared off-topic on sustainability.se.com.</p>
","<p>The <a href=""https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/250/66"">second version of your asparagus question on sustainability.SE</a> specifically asks about reducing water requirements:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have been looking into applying this with asparagus, to reduce water usage involved in growing this food, but have been unable to find recommendations for plants to plant alongside (and given the spacing between plants, this leads to a lot of exposed soil). I would like to grow asparagus with as little external water input as possible. What can I plant next to asparagus to help cut down on the water loss, weeding requirements, and fertilizer requirements? I.e. how can I grow asparagus sustainably?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your aim is reduce water usage, then the thing that immediately comes to mind is a thick organic mulch for both suppressing weeds and retaining moisture. Some (free!) mulches that would be suitable for a permaculture garden:</p>

<ul>
<li>straw</li>
<li>autumn leaves</li>
<li>don't just chop &amp; drop your cover crops that are grown elsewhere, drag some over to the asparagus</li>
<li>arborist wood chips</li>
</ul>

<p>(<em>Note that I do not have an asparagus guild, but I will lay out how I would go about assembling one.</em> Conventional wisdom is that you want to keep all that soil around your asparagus bare, and while I find a couple of mentions of asparagus in permaculture guilds, I didn't see any lists of plants.)</p>

<p>In the table for Asparagus on p. 182 of Ed Smith's ""The Vegetable Gardener's Bible"", it mentions basil, calendula, parsley, and tomato as good companions for asparagus. The text, however, mentions that while tomatoes are commonly recommended as companions (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asparagus#Companion_planting"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia</a> for example), both asparagus and tomatoes are fairly hungry plants, and you don't the tomatoes to steal nutrients from your asparagus.</p>

<p>So using that principle, you wouldn't want to plant anything near it that is going to use up a lot of nutrients.</p>

<p>Another hurdle to finding good plants to go along with asparagus is that you want something that will actually grow beside the asparagus. Basil is another suggestion in the list above, but basil likes full sun and the asparagus can get quite tall, casting shade on the basil. So <strong>basil</strong> is questionable, but since it's fairly easy to grow, and it's just an annual, I think it would be worth trying as an experiment.</p>

<p>In Barbara Damrosch's ""The Garden Primer"" on p. 270, she suggests that during the first year of growth, the asparagus won't grow too high and you could plant bush beans between the rows. This seems like a good choice: nitrogen-fixing beans would help the soil, and a dense planting of beans will shade the soil quite well. In later years, she suggests early crops like <strong>radish</strong> or <strong>lettuce</strong>. Radish seems like a good choice -- light nutrient usage, and they're out of the ground before the asparagus gets very tall. Lettuce seems like it will use more nutrients, but if you aren't using it as the <em>only</em> companion and therefore planting a ton of them then it sounds like a reasonable guild member. (For that matter, other <strong>""baby"" salad greens</strong> might be reasonable as long as you harvest them while they're small and don't plant so densely that they suck up all of your nitrogen and other nutrients: <strong>kale</strong>, <strong>spinach</strong>, <strong>chard</strong>.) If you end up with substantial plantings that you're harvesting, definitely consider a generous top-dressing of compost in the spring; this is challenging if you've got a couple inches of wood chips on the ground, so plan accordingly.</p>

<p>Note that I'm assuming that asparagus is the apex of your guild -- it wants full sun, so I don't think you want anything to overshadow it. With that said, I suppose it would be possible to plant something taller on the north side; perhaps a small <strong>fruit tree</strong> that won't spread so far as to overshadow the bed but would provide a wind break and some extra shade for the soil on the north side. A deciduous tree would also provide leaves that you can use for mulch (i.e. providing multiple yields &amp; stacking functions). The risk here, of course, is that a tree is rather permanent -- the other plants suggested are more temporary and thus very suitable as experimental guild members. Although now that I write that, I suppose a tree has a several decade long life span but the asparagus bed will only be around for about 15 years so you could replace the asparagus with something else if it didn't provide good results. (A ""successful"" experiment as long as you learn something, right? Be sure to share what you learn!)</p>

<p>Finally, at the bottom layer you want a low-growing, nitrogen-fixing ground cover. I'm a big fan of <strong>white clover</strong> for this in other settings. The bees love it when it flowers, it tolerates light traffic (so you can plant it in lightly-used paths), a thick planting it the soil and crowds out weeds, and if it starts to get too tall you can mow it and leave the clippings in place.</p>

<p>Note that I see <a href=""http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/rye_cover_crops_slow_asparagus_emergence"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rye</a> mentioned as a winter cover crop in conventional asparagus growing, but it seems like a <em>terrible</em> idea in a permaculture guild around perennials like asparagus. I love rye in my annual garden because it is very hardy, scavenges a bunch of nitrogen that might otherwise be lost, and can put on a good flush of growth in the spring; however it is hard to kill, often requiring multiple passes with the rototiller (the linked article mentions glyphosate) -- not possible with the asparagus.</p>

<p>If you were going to use an annual winter cover in your asparagus, you'd want something that is guaranteed to winter-kill. If you do this, make sure you leave the residue in place to compost back into the soil -- you don't want to be removing nutrients from the asparagus bed by way of cover crops!</p>

"What could be causing rot to appear on the skin of my bell peppers?","1505","","<p>I have a set of four bell pepper plants that I am growing in 12"" containers in my backyard. They've been growing alright until the fruits on the plants have started to develop what appears to be a rot on their skin. What could be causing this? I water them well every two days and they get 6-7+ hours of sunlight a day. This is my first time ever growing vegetables by the way.</p>

<p>Here are some pictures since this is probably impossible to diagnose without:

","<p>This is almost certainly blossom end rot (BER), a disorder that is usually caused by <strong>fluctuations in the plant's water supply</strong>, leading to a calcium deficiency. It affects a number of plants, including tomatoes, squash and eggplant. On peppers, the lesion is usually a tan color in the early stages, later turning brown or black, and can affect the side of the fruit, as in your first photo, as well as the blossom end.</p>

<p>You're right to water your plants thoroughly (superficial watering could cause them to surface-root, and become stressed), but once every two days may be over-frequent, unless, of course, the ambient temperature is very high, and the soil/compost is drying out very quickly; it should be slightly damp most of the time, not wet. <strong>Over-watering</strong> washes calcium out of the soil and is another cause of BER.</p>

<p>You will find detailed information/links about BER and steps you can take to control it, in my answer to a similar question <a href=""https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/987/what-else-besides-calcium-deficiency-could-be-causing-tomato-blossom-end-rot/992#992"">here</a>.

","<p>The grape like fruits are the seed pods.  Yes, you can grow snowdrops from seed, but for most bulbs it will take 2-4 years from seed to bulb.  Given how many seeds each one can produce this is easily your fastest way.</p>

<p>Failing that, however, pruning off the seed pods/ flowers ASAP means that the plant pushes more energy into growing the bulb.</p>

<p>Now, some basic math:</p>

<p>Suppose that you want 5000 snowdrops, and you have 5 right now.  Suppose that you give them lots of TLC and they double in number every year.  You will have 5 the first year, 10 the next, then 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2560, 5120. </p>

<p>As far as I can tell snowdrops thrive in the same conditions that lawns do.  You can probably do a bit better than that.</p>

<p>Ten years.  But notice that it took you the first 5 to get to 100.  Go out and buy a hundred snowdrops and cut the time in half.  They are cheap.</p>

"Planting tree a little 'high'","1498","","<p>I bought a Magnolia in a 100 Litre container. It needs to sit tightly next to a fence, with intent to block a neighbouring property. Now, here is the problem... The tree is 2m tall, but blocking the neighbour requires closer to 3m. </p>

<p>This is a slow growing tree, and I want my privacy sooner rather than later. </p>

<p>What problem would I have if I plant the tree just a tad high -- i.e. I put it into a hole in the ground, which is, say, only 1.5m deep? Does anything change if I put a 0.5m frame around it (it's next to a deck, so I don't want lots of additional dirt in the area).</p>

<p>------ Additional info ------</p>

<p>The Magnolia is a 'Kay Paris'. To add complication, I have clay soil, which I believe isn't ideal for this tree (happy to be corrected). I still want it very close to the fence, a bit less than a foot. I am happy to water it regularly, and I suspect it may even work despite a 'rain shadow', as clay tends to hold moisture. But at such short distance from fence, the rear branches will be squashed a bit tightly, at least for a year until I cut them. So... will this work?</p>
","<p>There are a couple of problems with your description of how you're going to plant this tree. First,  no plant should be planted less than a foot (as a minimum) away from a fence or wall, so if you mean the rootball when you say 'sit tightly' next to a fence, as the topgrowth continues to expand, it will all lean forwards to get away from the fence behind it rather than spreading out all round and up, and the rootball itself may get too dry; up against a wall or fence is a dry place to be because of something known as 'rain shadow'.</p>

<p>Second, no, you should not plant it a little higher so that some of the rootball is sitting above soil level, and adding any kind of framework around it will  not solve that issue. It should be planted at the same level (in terms of the trunk/top of soil) as it is now in its pot, or you risk root material drying out.</p>

<p>Magnolia like deep,rich, neutral to acid, fertile soil which does not frequently dry out - sitting it above soil level, up against a fence, is almost guaranteed to create conditions it does not like.</p>

<p>Have you considered a clumping bamboo such as a Fargesia variety (assuming you live somewhere that has a suitable climate), which would give you the height you need much more quickly, and which would cope much better with being closer to a fence?</p>

<p>Wherever you do plant it, ensure you keep it well watered - large, more mature plants often have difficulty settling in and growing on well once transferred to the ground.</p>

I tried finding the variety name through several sites and they all looked different. How can I identify them?</p>
","<p>The genus Saintpaulia, and original species S. ionantha, were scientifically described by H. Wendland in 1893.</p>

<p><em>Saintpaulias grow from 6–15 cm tall and can be anywhere from 6–30 cm wide. The leaves are rounded to oval, 2.5–8.5 cm long with a 2–10 cm petiole, finely hairy, and with a fleshy texture. The flowers are 2–3 cm diameter, with a five-lobed velvety corolla (""petals""), and grow in clusters of 3–10 or more on slender stalks (peduncles). Flower colour in the wild species can be violet, purple, pale blue, or white.</em></p>

<p>Several of the species and subspecies are endangered, and many more are threatened, due to clearance of their native cloud forest habitat for agriculture.</p>

<p>Revisions of the genus by B.L. Burtt had expanded the genus to approximately 20 species. On the basis of recent studies that showed most of the species to be very poorly differentiated, both genetically and morphologically, the number of species has been reduced to six, with the majority of former species reduced to subspecies under S. ionantha, in a recent floristic treatment. The most recent taxonomic treatment from 2009 recognises 9 species, 8 subspecies and 2 varieties.</p>

"How can I tell when root vegetables are ripe?","1494","","<p>I have never planted root vegetables before so I don't know how to tell whether it is ripe or not without pulling the root out of the soil and seeing it.</p>

<p>I love beets and I love carrots also but if I ever grow them, I am going to have to know when they are ripe without pulling them out of the soil. One solution I can see to this is hydroponics where you grow plants in nutrient enriched water. There is just one problem with that. Roots, whether you are talking about the edible roots or the non-edible roots, need oxygen and the little bit of oxygen that is dissolved in water is not enough. However too much oxygen can kill the plant if it isn't doing cellular respiration fast enough.</p>

<p>So how would I know when a beet or a carrot or any other edible root is ripe without pulling the root out of the soil or risking lack of oxygen and oxygen poisoning with hydroponics? </p>
","<p>Well, it is so easy, it will probably surprise you:</p>

<p>Beets and carrots grow partly <em>above the soil</em>, especially when they mature.</p>

<p>Especially beets - you may assume that about half of the thick, fleshy part remains exposed. See this picture and note how only the lower part shows traces of soil:</p>

<p>Similar for carrots, but you <em>may</em> have to wipe away a tiny bit of soil to get a better idea of the current thickness:</p>

<p>The dates on the seed packets will give you a good idea about when you should <em>expect</em> them to be fully ripe, but you might choose to harvest sooner (""baby beets"") or later, if you feel they ""need a bit more time"". Roots don't spoil like fruit does.</p>

<hr>

<p>Practical side notes: </p>

<p>If you planted the seeds a tad too close (like in the carrot picture above), you can harvest baby carrots etc. to give the remaining plants adequate room. Likewise, you can stretch your harvest by pulling the largest specimens for your current kitchen needs and letting the smaller ones grow a bit longer. </p>

This makes me wonder if turning the compost actually slow down composting by discouraging detritivores and burrowers to live in the compost. I would imagine turning the compost frequently makes it a less ideal place for most of these organisms (so the frequency is important) which seem to be efficient at reducing the particle size of litter (fallen leaves are usually the bulk ingredient of the compost) as in the video. </p>

<p>Does turning over a compost pile slow down its decomposition?</p>
","<p>I sort of agree with both the answers you've been given, but essentially, no, turning the compost pile does not slow down decomposition over time.</p>

<p>It is perceived wisdom that turning a compost heap regularly will mean that the resulting compost is ready much quicker, and will be suitable for use in potting soil mixes because the heat generated in a turned heap means weed seeds and pathogens will have been destroyed. Climate where you are makes a difference - in hotter places, turning the heap may be essential to cool it down temporarily, but in temperate regions, its unlikely the average compost heap will get hot enough to destroy pathogens, and will take longer to turn into compost,see here for the standard advice <a href=""http://www.homecompostingmadeeasy.com/turningcompost.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.homecompostingmadeeasy.com/turningcompost.html</a>. Basically, the choice is between a faster hot, aerobic heap (turned regularly) or a slower cold, anaerobic one (not turned).</p>

<p>Your very interesting time lapsed video link shows a leaf litter layer rather than an actual compost pile comprised of different materials, and all it demonstrates is that soil without life forms means that anything sitting on top will take forever to decompose, although you can see green mould or fungal activity beginning on the inert side. There are various ways a heap breaks down, and it's not just burrowing insects,but also bacterial and fungal activity that may not be readily visible. </p>

<p>This 'fun' article here <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2011/sep/02/friday-debate-compost-turning"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2011/sep/02/friday-debate-compost-turning</a> cites two horticultural opinions that say it's not worth it on the strength that life's too short, largely, but in fact, being really scientific and rigorous about managing (turning, controlling moisture and content,covering, etc) compost heaps does mean achieving useable compost much faster.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it depends what you're going to do with the resulting compost from your pile and how soon you want it. If you're just going to put it back into the ground and you're not in any major hurry,  or don't have sufficient time to take on the job (and most of us don't) then just leaving it to get on with it is fine. On the other hand, if you have the time and interest, then monitoring,turning, and so on, on a regular basis, will produce compost faster which will be pathogen/weed seed free and suitable for use in potting soil mixes, despite the temporary, short lived cooling and disruptive effect of turning.</p>

"When can a tomato plant come back from the ""dead""?","1482","","<p>I've heard stories of people who have had seemingly-dead tomato plants which they left alone and the plant grew back. How can I tell if my plant is dead as opposed to merely in poor shape? Is there anything I can do to encourage it?</p>

<p>This was the plant a few days ago; since then the brown wilted part has been spreading down the stem. It had some damage to the stem in a storm, losing the top portion with the leaves.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/D0EdF.jpg"" alt=""The plant""> </p>
","<p>Well it isn't dead, as the stem seems quite green. If you are interested from a botany/plant physiology standpoint let it grow.</p>

<p>There will be nodes where there used to be leaves. These will regrow new branches, but if you are in a hurry for tomatoes, go out and buy a new one, the biggest one that you can find cheaply.</p>

"Why is it bad to till wet soil?","1482","","<p>I read that tilling wet soil can destroy soil structure and make it more difficult for seeds to grow roots through the soil.</p>

<p>How exactly do roots find their way through the soil? Can artificial soil structure be created for roots to grow more easily?</p>
","<p>I think you're conflating two things - tilling wet soil and jumping straight to 'artificial' soil to create particular conditions for seeds to grow in,but the one doesn't necessarily lead to the other. The statement that tilling wet soil destroys soil structure is accurate, but tilling destroys soil structure whenever it is done, its just worse for seeds and plants if you do it when its very wet.</p>

<p>First, why you shouldn't till wet soil; the reason you don't is because, if the soil is very wet, when you cultivate it, you knock out the air spaces between the soil particles, and this can cause solid mud, particularly if your soil is clay based or heavy. Using hand tools such as spades or forks is slightly better than machine tilling in such conditions, but even hand cultivation is best done when the soil is not very wet. One of the purposes of tilling/digging is to increase aeration and reduce compaction,but tilling wet soil has the opposite effect,so its best to wait until the soil is merely damp, then till. Tilling very dry soil isn't great either, it tends to increase the amount of dust, but your question is about wet soil.</p>

<p>In terms of sowing seeds, they grow best if the soil is friable, which means reasonably loose with a relatively fine, crumb like structure - these are ideal conditions for seeds to germinate and put down roots easily. If the soil conditions aren't great because of excessive moisture, its possible to sow the seeds into seed and cutting potting compost bought from a supplier (I'm assuming this is what you mean by 'artificial' soil), prick them out into pots when they have two sets of true leaves, then plant out into the ground at a later date, when the soil is in a more friable condition.</p>

<p>Further reading about tilling soil generally here <a href=""http://homeguides.sfgate.com/rototilling-wet-soil-95825.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://homeguides.sfgate.com/rototilling-wet-soil-95825.html</a></p>

<p>In regard to roots finding their way through soil, gravity (geotropism, also known as gravitropism, mentioned by someone else) does play a large part in their going downwards; roots push their way through soil primarily for reasons of stability, and to seek out moisture and nutrients. Obviously, if the soil is solid, compacted and just muddy, root penetration and spread will be compromised or even impossible. A lighter, damp and friable soil with many small air spaces makes it easier for roots to grow and thrive, and allows more bio diversity within the soil, making it a healthier place for plants to be.</p>

"How do I set up a roof top garden in a tropical climate?","1480","","<p>I live in India. I have quite some space in the terrace. The roofing is of concrete slab with some weather-proofing done and red oxide tiles laid above. The climate is tropical ( Chennai ). I would like to know:</p>

<ol>
<li>How to go about setting up a garden in the terrace ?</li>
<li>Is there any threat to the building structure in the form of water seepages, algae formation etc.</li>
<li>Are there any specific watering needs as the terrace can get quite hot during the day time.</li>
<li>Do I use just earthen pots or is it better to construct tray-like concrete structures ? </li>
<li>Any other precautions to be followed while setting up roof gardening?</li>
</ol>
","<ol>
<li>I think setting up a terrace garden is a great idea! </li>
<li>I agree with @winwaed, the risk from water seepage is probably minimal considering the amount of rain you get already.  You might consider putting some mats down to walk on in case it gets slippery up there though.</li>
<li>The watering needs would depend on multiple factors, including the type of plants you are going to grow.  I would make sure and only plant stuff that can handle full sun though.  You can reduce your watering needs some by putting a layer of mulch on top of your soil.  This will help the soil retain moisture.</li>
<li>My preference between those two choices would be the earthen pots, just because I think they'd be easier to move around if you wanted to re-arrange.  You also need to be careful that you don't build something that weighs more than the roof can handle.  It sounds like it's pretty sturdy, but you definitely don't want your roof caving in on you!</li>
<li>If you don't own the building, make sure it's OK with the owner first though.</li>

"For fruit trees, is it better to plant a single multigrafted tree, or multiple trees in one hole?","1477","","<p>In fruit tree catalogs, I've seen multi-grafted or multi-budded trees. Here's an <a href=""http://www.groworganic.com/multi-grafted-fruit-salad-semi-dwarf.html"" rel=""nofollow"">example</a>.</p>

<p>And I've also heard of a technique where you plant 3 or more trees in the same hole. Here's a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=W0WM0HFduXI"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube</a> video talking about it.</p>

<p>Which one is better? Or what are the advantages and disadvantages of each technique? Is one likely to yield more fruit than the other?</p>

<p>What about planting multiple multi-grafted tree in one hole? I suspect that would be a bad idea, but I thought I'd bring up the possibility.</p>
","<p>The question is where you want the competition for resources to take place. On multi grafted trees some of the grafts may grow faster due to their position or vigour. I have seen trees like this where one of the grafts fails but you are still getting fruit from the others.
By planting three trees in one hole you are putting the competition for nutrients and water at the root level.  If one fails you still have the others.</p>

<p>These are solutions for gardeners with limited space who have the time and interest to work with trees that are higher maintenance.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have lots of space plant one tree of each type at the usual spacing.  </li>
<li>If space is at a premium and you don't mind the cost of buying three plants then plant them all in the same planting hole.  </li>
<li>If you don't have space or enough money to buy three trees then try one multi graft.</li>
</ul>

<p>Edit: The advantages of multi graft or multi stem apple trees is that the different types can pollinate each other. If you only have room for one tree or one clump and there are no other apple trees around this is real advantage.</p>

<p>Both types of grafted trees require more skill and time to prune.  You have to ensure that all parts are getting enough light.  A clump of different apple types could get a bit tricky to prune but nothing out of the ordinary.  I don't think the yield of fruit or quality will be any different between the two types so it comes down to space available and price.</p>

The berries do dangle in this way, and they are red to start with, turning black when ripe. The leaves on this plant are toxic, but the berries not so much, though they are not at all pleasant to eat.</p>

"How long until I can over-plant grass seed after spraying Weed b Gon","1472","","<p>I have 5 acres of backyard that used to be farmland.  I planted grass, but I think I used the wrong kind, as it doesn't seem to be spreading.  Now ~5 years later, the yard looks decent, but the grass is fairly thin and the weeds (dandelions mostly) are starting to get heavy.  <strong>So I sprayed Weed B Gon on it, and now want to over-plant grass seed.</strong></p>

<p>I'm not concerned about getting it perfect.  If 10% of the seed I put down comes up and starts to spread over the years, I'd consider that a win.  Every amount above that certainly welcome, but...</p>

<p>I just sprayed today, and it's supposed to rain in 2 days (and a few days in a row).  I was hoping I could toss down the grass seed tomorrow before rain, but I wasn't sure if that's too soon, or if it matters with this particular chemical.</p>

<p><strong>Can I over-plant grass seed a day after spraying Ortho Weed B Gon? If not, how long do I need to wait (and why)?</strong></p>
","<p>The product you used contains triclopyr as the active ingredient - this is a synthetic auxin, and its effect on seeds is either to cause them to germinate with abnormal growth, or more likely, prevent growth even if the seed does germinate. That's why the recommended gap between using it and sowing seeds is three weeks.</p>

<p>I'm surprised the recommended gap between treatment and seeding is only three weeks - with most chemicals used on lawns, it's six weeks.</p>

<p>UPDATE JUNE 2014:
Here's confirmation of the science behind what I've said - I note I've been marked down two points, one of which was done yesterday (no prizes for guessing who that one might be from):-</p>

<p>The only other thing I can find which Linda Chalker doesn't mention is that the phosphorus content in bonemeal is only available to plants growing in soil with a ph of 7 or less, so if your soil is alkaline, the plants won't be able to access it anyway. This was the result of a study carried out by Colorado State University into organic fertilisers - there's a link to it under Wiki.</p>

<p>As you can see, it was light purpalish - light pinkish kind of colour. On touch it was a bit soft, and the diameter of the whole thing was not more than 5-8cm. As far as I know, it looked like a mushroom.</p>

","<p>If it is a true aloe vera, then it will eventually need a larger pot, because it will create ""pups"" (small offshoots) around its base, which will then grow to full size (maybe as tall as 18"") and then produce pups of their own, which will then grow to full size...  </p>

<p>The smallest pot I'd try to keep a true aloe vera plant in would be a 12"" (30 cm) pot.  And even in that size pot you will need to divide it now and then in order to keep it healthy, because when they are happy they can grow pretty quickly to fill that space.  Dividing will give you new plants to keep or give away.  Rooting new plants is pretty easy.  Basically, you pull off side shoots, and stick the stems into a free draining, sandy soil, and water very sparingly until you see new growth.  </p>
