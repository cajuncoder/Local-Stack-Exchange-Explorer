"How to remove dust after sanding before applying paint/oil/glue?","74497","","<p>Before one can paint a piece of wood, it should be clean from any dust on its surface.</p>

<p>What is the recommended way to remove the dust?</p>

<p>I tried using</p>

<ol>
<li>a hand brush, <em>which only got rid of the rough bits and pieces</em></li>
<li>a vacuum, <em>which worked great for the most part, but did not
remove the very fine dust. The suction could cause the nozzle to bump into the surface and leave scratches</em></li>
<li>a glue soaked cloth (called ""tack cloth"") from the hardware store, <em>which was intended for
exactly that purpose and got the job done. Working with it was not
very nice though, reusability is questionable and who knows what
kind of stuff is used to make it sticky.</em></li>
</ol>

<p>I guess that a wet cloth has similar sticky properties than the aforementioned shop bought cloth, but has the disadvantage of applying moisture to the wood (leading to warped wood).</p>

<p>Is there a better/recommended way to do this?</p>

<p>All the methods you list are recommended ways of removing dust from the workpiece. </p>

<p>Brushing is actually a very good way to get dust off wood, and for many woodworkers it's the main method they rely on. It's just that you usually can't do it properly with only one brush. You can use a large soft hand brush to get the worst of it off but you need switch to something with stiffer bristles for the finer stuff. Paintbrushes work well for this and their small size makes them good at getting into corners. </p>

<p>Some people swear by tack cloths*, others don't like them because they hate how they feel and they worry that they'll leave a residue behind which will cause problems with the final finish (this doesn't appear to be much of a concern however).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The real 'danger' to this is not warped wood, normally wood has to get really wet for there to be a risk of warping.</p>

<p>What you would worry about is raised grain (surface wood fibres swelling due to soaking up water). But this doesn't happen if you moisten the cloth with mineral spirits, acetone or very pure alcohol.</p>

<p>A very good modern material to wipe with that isn't often recommended is microfibre cloth. The very same surface texture that makes these so good at cleaning glass and polished surfaces make them very good at removing traces of fine dust from tiny imperfections in the wood surface. A lightly dampened microfibre cloth may be the best way to remove dust from sanded wood.</p>

<hr>

<p>* <strong>Homemade tack cloth</strong><br>
You can make your own quite easily, from a clean scrap of lint-free cloth (old sheets and t-shirts can be good donors for the fabric), a few drops of varnish, the appropriate solvent for the varnish and a little water.</p>

"How do I achieve a ""piano black"" high gloss finish on wood?","60849","","<p>I'm building some speaker cabinets for my living room out of MDF. I'm wondering how to achieve that ""high gloss"" / ""piano black"" look, like on B&amp;W speakers or, well, black pianos...</p>

"Dealing with knots ""bleeding"" through paint","55582","","<p>I'm sure that people have seen this where you would be painting something white or lightish colour only to have the resin from the knots bleed through paint sometime later. Similar to what you see in the following picture. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fZ7Vwm.jpg"" alt=""Knot Bleeding""></p>

<p>For my latest project I knew this was a possibility so I coated the knots with some shellac. However after about a month it still came through. I am sure if it was dried properly this <em>might</em> not have happened but the project was a large storage shelf that did not fit in my oven. </p>

<p>So I have 2 related questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What <em>should</em> I have done to try and prevent this?</li>
<li>What can I do to correct the damage after it has occurred. </li>
</ol>
","<blockquote>
  <p>What should I have done to try and prevent this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of shellac-based primer as already recommended (although very effective it can be inordinately expensive) I was actually going to recommend shellac itself, but then I read you'd already tried this and it wasn't effective. </p>

<p>However, I think the reason you got bleed-through wasn't a fault in the shellac but probably just that it wasn't applied in a heavy enough 'cut' (cut traditionally refers to dilution rates for shellac when made up from scratch). Rather than make a heavier cut you can simply apply further coats since it's the <em>total thickness</em> of the shellac layer that is important, not how many applications it took to achieve it. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I can't recommend a specific number of coats. Erring on the side of caution I suppose three would be the minimum to apply, and as one of the chief advantages of shellac is the very fast drying time this shouldn't take that long. Apply more than three if patience allows.</p>

<p>The bad news you were probably expecting: you should really remove the paint, treat the knots and re-paint.</p>

"Can I apply water-based polyurethane over an oil based stain?","50005","","<p>I recently finished a dresser top in a very light gray oil based stain.

  <p>You may apply the Minwax Water Based Polyurethane over a fully cured 
  Minwax Wood Finish Stain (oil-based). Please use the following
  guidelines:</p>
  
  <p>To ensure the color fastness of Minwax Wood Finish prior to applying 
  Minwax Water-Based Polyurethane:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Allow final coat of stain to dry 8-24 hours (Dry time is affected by
  your ventilation, temperature, and relative humidity).</li>
  <li>Wipe down the stained surface using a soft, lint-free cloth dampened
  with 100% pure mineral spirits. If the stain is cured and inactive, 
  the mineral spirits will not affect the color. You should not have 
  any color pick-up onto the cloth. The mineral spirits will remove 
  any active/excess stain from surface and help the stain to cure out.</li>
  <li>Allow the mineral spirits to evaporate/flash off the surface.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Once the stain color is set and cured (passed the color-fast test), 
  apply 3 coats of the Minwax Water Based Polyurethane per label
  directions.</p>

"Should I use sandpaper or Steel Wool between coats of polyurethane?","47130","","<p>Polyurethane is typically my go-to finish, but I'd always just kind of done it how dad showed me rather than reading the instructions, sanding with fine grain between coats, or not at all if it's still ""tacky."" It always seems to turn out fine, but recently I read the back of the can and it said to wait 4 hours between coats (i.e. not tacky) and to use fine (000 if I recall correctly) steel wool rather than sandpaper between coats. Is this one of those ""recommended but not required"" sort of things, or have I been doing something which will bite me later?</p>
","<p>It doesn't matter except if you're using water-based poly.  If so, the water will rust the steel wool fibers that end up stuck in the pores of the wood and cause rust spots.  </p>

<p>I prefer steel wool because it lasts longer and conforms to whatever curves you are smoothing.</p>

"Should you always use Pre-Stain?","44031","","<p>I've read that wood conditioner (also known as pre-stain) helps prevent blotching, but it 'designed' for use with soft or porous wood.</p>

<p>I've got an 80x36x1"" red oak panel that I think I'm going to stain. Red Oak is not considered a soft wood, but would Pre-Stain help my staining project turn out more uniform anyways?</p>

<p>Furthermore, if I change my mind on staining, but still wish to do a poly coat, does Pre-Stain do anything beneficial for that?</p>
","<p>It depends. On blotch prone woods such as pine, poplar, cherry, and maple, yes. On oak and walnut, it depends. A pre-stain conditioner can limit absorption and therefore the shade of the stain - it may not be as dark. Pre-stain conditioning will even out the color tone across the piece, and this may or may not be desirable, i.e. for a more rustic look don't condition. End grain, especially for red oak, will absorb much more stain. It can be conditioned by itself, but that can be difficult. I prefer to sand the end grain to ~600 and then burnish it with a polished piece of metal. This closes off the pores and limits absorption.</p>

<p>There are multiple approaches to pre-stain conditioning. The solvent based products I am aware of are simply solvents that are absorbed by the wood grain until saturated, and then begin evaporating. You need to stain within a time window - too early and not much stain is absorbed, too late and more blotching occurs.</p>

<p>Thinned topcoat finishes, such as shellac and lacquer can be used. The problem is they dry quickly, and don't allow the uneven absorption by the wood grain to occur.</p>

<p>The best conditioners are water based, and can be used with solvent or waterbased stains and topcoats. About any water based topcoat can be thinned 50/50 with water and used as a pre-stain conditioner. Also, PVA glues can be used, thinned with water 4-10 parts water to 1 part glue. I use Elmers Glue All 4 parts water to 1 part glue. It is the cheapest and dries clear.</p>

<p>Water based are best because of the long open time and relatively quick dry time. The long open time allows the conditioner to be absorbed unevenly by the grain. the water evaporates leaving more sealer in the more porous areas resulting in more even stain absorption. It will not affect the amount of pigment deposited on the surface for a pigment type stain. It effects the dye portion of the colorant. Solvent poly could also be used (long open time) but has a very long dry time. I have not tested it and don't know the thinning ratio.</p>

<p>Apply the water based conditioner by flooding the surface (spray, brush, sponge, doesn't matter) then using a brush keep spreading and adding until the surface stops absorbing, then wipe it off with dry rags/paper towels and let dry. Sand lightly with either the last grit used or the next one up - remove the raised grain but don't cut too much away. Pine will swell significantly, and leveling the surface will remove the conditioner in spots. It needs a 2nd application. Stain and topcoat with solvent or waterbased products as usual.</p>

<p>Yes, a coat of solvent poly (or a water based finish) can be applied over any of the conditioners described. Allow the solvent conditioner to evaporate completely, and let the water based conditioner dry, then apply the poly. </p>

<p>It is highly recommended to test any new finish or preparation method on scrap first.</p>

"Can I speed up stain drying with a hair dryer?","35183","","<p>Can I speed up stain drying with a hair dryer or a heat gun?</p>

And by ""drying"" I mean getting it to the point where I can gently handle it without marring the surface or sticking to it, e.g. flipping it over to get the other side, not having dust stick to it (being able to brush it off without wiping off stain) etc.</p>
","<p>Yes if you blow air (especially heated air) over various oil-based finishes they will dry faster.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there any reason not to?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hairdryer first: you're unlikely to cause a problem unless you get really close (nozzle only an inch or so/couple of cm from the wood surface) and it fits the bill theoretically, but you'd die of boredom before you see any benefit. You could in theory set up a hairdryer on a stand blowing over the piece and leaving it for a couple of hours but they're not made for that kind of sustained use and I bet you'd burn out the average modern hairdryer in short order.</p>

<p>Heat gun: this can easily cause a problem. With the typical temperatures these can generate you could accidentally heat the piece past the point where water will start to be released from the surface wood fibres, and it will literally start to bubble through the finish. I've accidentally done this using a hairdryer (being impatient and speed-curing epoxy fills on finished tool handles) so no question it would be even easier with a heat gun.</p>

<p>Where you do see the basic idea applied successfully is using fan heaters. Typically they'd be set up a few feet/a metre or so from the piece and blowing warmed air over it. In cooler weather, particularly if it's not dry, this can make a big difference in the drying of some finishes so it can be well worth experimenting with if you have an unheated shop or working space. Note though that there is quite some risk of the currents of air disturbing sanding dust from some hidden corner and making it airborne, and you can bet it will unerringly find its way to the finished surface.</p>

"What is the difference between a rip-cut and a cross-cut?","34732","","<p>In <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/305/20"">this answer</a> talks about rip and crosscuts and that one saw is better for ripping than one that is more suited for crosscutting.</p>

<p>What is the difference between the 2 cuts and why would a saw-blade be more suited for one or the other?</p>
","<p>With the rip cut, you cut along the grain; while with the cross cut, you cut across the grain.</p>

<p>Cutting along the grain is a very easy cut; even before you had mechanical saw, you had saws with few but large teeth so you cut as fast and as straight as possible.  Essentially, you ""rip"" the wood apart, like you can split it with an axe, except you'll get a straighter cut as you may still cut some of the wood fibers.  This cut has a tendency to bind the blade as the wood fiber relax.</p>

<p>Cutting across the grain is much harder for the saw (you need to cut a lot of fibers), and you typically use a saw with smaller teeth, but many more of them.</p>

<p>One other reason why you have more or fewer teeth has to do with the amount of saw dust you need to evacuate after each cut.  As the rip is easier, you'll need more space between the teeth to carry it out.</p>

<p>Someone told me not long ago not to use metal drill bits on wood and vice versa. I've never heard this before. </p>

<p>How to identify a wood drill bit from a metal drill bit - and does it matter?</p>
","<p>It does matter - wood drill bits won't work on metal (destroying the bit in the process, unless used on thin and soft metals) and metal drill bits will increase splintering and tear-out when used on wood (but this depends also on the wood type and the diameter of the bit, and for smaller diameters there is little difference between wood and metal drills bits).</p>

<p>As for how to tell them apart - wood drill bits have two distinguishing features: a spar (also brad) and a lip. The spar helps in keeping the bit centered when starting the hole and prevents wandering of the bit on the surface of the wood. The lip acts like a chisel, slicing through the wood fibers in the circumference of the drilled hole, improving the quality of the finish. This is most important for through holes, where the lips helps reduce ""blow-out"" of the wood when exiting the wood on the other side. Wood bits are typical black and silvery in color, but other colors exist.</p>

<p>I wouldn't at all be surprised by this, sanding properly — not just scuff-sanding where you're <em>only</em> looking to scratch the surface — will very easily break through only a couple of layers of poly. Particularly cheap poly, which Minwax is an example of.</p>

<p>This is one of the other reasons I personally object to that part of the finishing instructions. Ignoring that it's not needed for adhesion what it does is <em>pointlessly</em> remove varnish you just applied, only to be replaced by more varnish in the next layer(s)! </p>

<p>Although some sanding between coats is needed for some users, it's actually a very self-serving direction on the part of the manufacturers as they're assuring you use more of the product than needed. This is just like the directions for some stains and for oil/varnish blends, where supposedly only by applying a liberal excess of the product <em>and then wiping almost all of it off</em> can good results be achieved. This is very far from the truth, and it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say it can waste 95% of the product that goes on the wood.</p>

<p>If manufacturers were truly interested in helping their customers to apply the product most effectively, as they say or imply, what they would do is give people specific tips on how to apply smooth, even coats of varnish such that no sanding would normally be required (except to de-nib).</p>

"What advantages does a dust collector have over a shop vac?","26206","","<p>From what I know, dust collectors are generally quieter, hold more chips, and can support a larger hose than a shop vac.</p>

<p>Besides this, are there any advantages related to suction? Can dust collectors pick up or filter things that a shop vac can't?</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> A shop-vac is better than nothing, but barely adequate for dust collection on almost any stationary power tool. On the other hand, a dust collector would be inappropriate and wouldn't work very well for most handheld tools.</p>

<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> read on...</p>

<p>The others mentioned that a Shop-Vac produces low-volume air flow with high static pressure, and a dust collector produces high-volume air flow with low static pressure. But what does any of this really mean in practical terms?</p>

<h2>CFM vs. Static Pressure, defined</h2>

<p>Air volume is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM) or liter per second (l/s)--the volume of air that the device can move from its intake to its exhaust in a given amount of time.</p>

<p>Static pressure is measured in inches of water (often referred to as inches water column, or inches WC), as in, how many inches the suction device can lift water up a pipe, or in millibar (mbar).</p>

<p>In simple terms, static pressure determines how much resistance (“static pressure loss”) your dust collector can overcome in order to move a given volume of air through the hoses and pipes. When it comes to designing a dust collection system, the raw CFM figure is initially more important than the raw static pressure figure, though static pressure does come into play once you start designing your ductwork (more on this later).</p>

<h2>Is that enough CFM and static pressure?</h2>

<p>WOOD Magazine has a great <a href=""http://www.woodmagazine.com/figure-dust-collection-needs-by-the-numbers"" rel=""noreferrer"">article</a> on calculating CFM and static pressure requirements for dust collection. Although the worksheets in the article may look intimidating at first glance, they aren't too difficult to fill out. The article includes some typical CFM requirements for various tools, some of which I've included or summarized below.</p>

<ul>
<li>Table saw, radial arm saw, miter saw, bandsaw: 350 CFM, 165 l/s</li>
<li>Belt, disc, or drum sander: 350-550 CFM, 165-260 l/s (depending on size)</li>
<li>Table-mounted router: 195 CFM, 92 l/s</li>
<li>Thickness planer, up to 13"": 400 CFM, 190 l/s</li>
<li>Thickness planer, 14""-20"": 785 CFM, 370 l/s</li>
</ul>

<p>Now let's look at some contenders for an entry-level dust collection system. As of this writing, a ”6.5 peak horsepower” <a href=""https://www.shopvac.com/specifications/quiet_series.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">Shop-Vac®</a> vacuum rated at 9.3A@120V produces 185 CFM (87 l/s) of airflow and 64 inches (160 mbar) of pressure. That's not even adequate for the least-demanding machine in the list, falling 10 CFM (5 l/s) short for a router table. In practical terms, this means the vacuum won't be able to produce the recommended 4000 FPM (feet per minute)/2 m/s (meters per second) linear air velocity necessary to capture most of the dust particles produced by the tool. (Note that the 4000 FPM/2 m/s figure somewhat oversimplifies things but it is a good, convenient figure for making realistic estimates.)</p>

<p>By comparison, a 1hp <a href=""https://www.grizzly.com/products/1-HP-Dust-Collector/G8027"" rel=""noreferrer"">Grizzly dust collector</a> rated at 8A@110V produces 500 CFM/235 l/s and 2.76""/7 mbar of static pressure. As you can see from the CFM figures above, under ideal conditions this dust collector should be able to capture most of the dust from most tools except larger sanders and 14"" or larger planers.</p>

<p>Remember, I said that was under ideal conditions. This is where static pressure comes into play. Every inch of pipe or hose, every turn, and every change in diameter produces resistance which your dust collector (or vacuum) must overcome. You can use one of the various static pressure calculators such as <a href=""http://www.billpentz.com/woodworking/cyclone/staticcalc.xls"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bill Pentz's static pressure Excel spreadsheet</a> to calculate the static pressure drop produced by your ductwork and hoses. For the Grizzly 1hp dust collector we looked at earlier, the total static pressure drop can be no more than 2.76""/7 mbar. If you plug only 500 CFM/235 l/s and 7 feet (2 m) of 4"" (10 cm) flex hose into the calculator, you'll see the static pressure drop is almost 3""/7.5 mbar, so we already need to look at a more powerful dust collector.</p>

<p>Although this is the simplest way to size a dust collector, you don't suddenly go from 500 CFM to 0 CFM. The excessive static pressure loss simply reduces the airflow through the system. Some manufacturers or magazines provide the CFM curves at various static pressures, which is helpful in determining whether you can sacrifice a few CFM for a longer run of pipe or hose while maintaining the recommended 4000 FPM air velocity.</p>

<h2>Other considerations</h2>

<p>In addition to the fact that a Shop-Vac just isn't suitable for stationary power tools, one of the dust collector's greatest advantages over a Shop-Vac is that it has a larger hose and is less likely to clog from chips and shavings. Whereas a Shop-Vac typically has a maximum hose size of around 2-1/2 inches/6 cm, a dust collector hose (or pipe) is typically 4 inches/10 cm or larger and is less likely to clog.</p>

<p>Getting back to your questions, you asked whether a dust collector can (1) pick up or (2) filter things that a shop-vac can't. We've already answered the first question (yes, a dust collector can “pick up” more). HEPA-rated filters can remove 99.97% of particles down to 0.3 microns. You can buy these types of filters for both Shop-Vacs and dust collectors, so technically the answer to the second question is <em>yes</em> but it just depends on what type of filter you buy (and, in some cases, how determined you are to adapt such a filter to your machine if your manufacturer doesn't offer one).</p>

<p>Of course, even the best dust collector will not capture all the dust, and even if you pony up the cash for a HEPA filter your dust collector will disperse some amount of fine dust back into the air. That is why you should try to exhaust your dust collector outside if it is practical (while also venting outside air back into the shop), and you should still wear a well-fitted respirator with replaceable P100 (HEPA-equivalent) filter, regardless of any other precautions.</p>

"What are some suitable woods to use for tool handles?","26027","","<p>We all occasionally have to replace a tool handle, be it an axe, a shovel, a sledge, whatever.</p>

<p>The standard handle materials seem to be hickory and ash.  I've bought my share of hickory handles from hardware stores and have no issues with them.  I use ash for lathe tool handles and have used it for file handles as well.</p>

<p>Recently I made a hatchet handle out of osage orange (hedge).  Historically, osage was used for bows in the southern US, and I've heard legends that an osage bow was worth a horse and a blanket (that's just hearsay, don't quote me on it).  It seems to be holding up well, as I would expect from a dense, springy wood.  Also, I expect the hatchet head to rust out before the handle rots due to osage's extreme longevity.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FZKRR.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FZKRR.jpg"" alt=""osage handle""></a></p>

<p><a href=""http://magichammer.freeservers.com/tool_handles.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">One website</a> states that hickory and ash are really the only (US domestic) woods worth using.  I've thought about trying black locust, also due to its rot resistance and toughness, but this is not readily available in the Chicagoland area.  Another <a href=""http://www.bladeforums.com/forums/showthread.php/501198-Axe-handle-question"" rel=""noreferrer"">forum thread</a> discusses suitable woods in terms of vibration transference.  <a href=""http://axeconnected.blogspot.com/2013/03/weak-handles-revisited.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">This website</a> also seems to suggest using whatever is available locally and not worrying too much.</p>

<p>So, <strong>what other woods are suitable for tool handles based on your experience?</strong>  Sometimes, you just get better results making your own handles than buying them at the store, so knowing which species work (and which species last under use, abuse, and time) would be very helpful.  Note that I am more concerned with ""long"" tool handles, not so much short ones like one would see on a plane or a screwdriver.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>One website states that hickory and ash are really the only (US domestic) woods worth using. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously just one man's opinion and a gross over-simplification. It's also inherently misleading because it's light on detail. In reality while hickory is broadly speaking worthy of its reputation as a premier handle wood it obscures certain facts. The first is if you're buying an axe or sledge handle it should be pale in colour because it should be sapwood only. It is <em>hickory sapwood</em> that (usually) makes great handle stock, an important detail that people tend to forget to mention all too frequently. </p>

<p>Any reddish wood in a handle is the heartwood. Now hickory heartwood is fine wood, but not ideal for handles of this type. It would be perfectly well suited to chisel handles, plane totes and knobs, but then so are many other strong, hard or dense hardwoods as traditionally favoured for these. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This website also seems to suggest using whatever is available locally and not worrying too much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is worth paying attention to as they make many sage points.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, what other woods are suitable for tool handles.... Note that I am more concerned with ""long"" tool handles</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hate to say it but it might best be summarised as: forget the species, what's <em>this piece</em> like? </p>

<p>Wood is inherently a variable material, so one piece of hickory (or ash, poplar, oak, willow, yew, walnut, birch, etc. etc.) is not equal to another. And no single piece is quantified by a broad description of the species, no matter how accurate it is in general.</p>

<p>Another consideration: beyond the species, beyond the flexibility or the shock-absorbency of the wood chosen, grain orientation in the handle is perhaps of equal or <em>greater</em> significance. The most obvious aspect of this is the grain should be aligned with the axis of force when the tool is in use (it should run front-to-back in the eye of the tool head) but as well as this for a long haft grain run-out should be minimal or absent. Summarised in this diagram from a US Forest Service handbook:</p>

"How should I store the batteries of my cordless drill?","24120","","<p>I have a nice cordless drill that came with two rechargeable batteries. However, there are times when life gets in the way and I'm not using the drill at all over the course of several months. When I return to the drill, both of the batteries have died.</p>

<p>How should I store the batteries when they are not going to be used for several months? Is there a way to do so such that they'll have a charge when I need them next? Are there any steps I should be taking when storing the batteries so lengthen their overall lifetime?</p>
","<p>Batteries in general have several points worth concerning their usage. Yes, you are asking about storage but it is worth knowing that their storage strategy is influence by their usage frequency as well. <strong>Which type you have is important</strong>. There is not one <em>overall</em> method. </p>

<h1>Li-Ion (Lithium Ion)</h1>

<p>Like most batteries they should be stored at room temperate and not in direct sunlight. Some sources mention that storing it slightly warmer can help it perform better but the consensus is storing it at <strong>15°C</strong> (59°F) is ideal. A dry area is also an important factor. </p>

<p>In general we are advised to store the battery in a partial discharge state. Storing the battery in either a fully charged or discharged state can actually harm the battery. Most manufacturers recommend storing these batteries in a 30-40% charge level. Charge level can be <a href=""http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries"">determined usually by battery temperature</a>. The better you take care of it the longer it will last. I don't see myself ever testing the charge level but since I use my drill a lot I get a feel for when its getting down in charge since it starts to lose its torque.</p>

<p>The above tactic is sound but it is important to fully discharge the battery every 30 or so cycles of use to reset the batteries <a href=""http://www.batteryeducation.com/2008/08/digital-memory.html"">Digital Memory</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The digital memory effect is a failure mode whose effect results in the transmission of improper calibrations of the battery’s fuel gauge to a device.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To that effect the article goes on to say that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To correct the digital memory effect and properly re-calibrate the fuel gauge circuitry simply do a full cycle discharge/recharge every several dozen charges. There is no real hard number. </p>
</blockquote>

<h1>NiCd/NiCad (Nickel-Cadmium)</h1>

<p>Similar temperature and moisture suggestions exist for NiCd in that they should be stored in a cool and dry location. Between −20 °C and 45 °C (-4°F - 113°F) is recommended but I have seen several sites suggesting that freezing should be avoided ( Guessing mostly due to potential ice crystal build up. This could be avoided by putting the battery in an air tight bag.)</p>

<p>The batteries themselves should be stored either fully charged or fully discharged. Note that they have a higher discharge rate when compared to Li-Ion batteries but are not permanently affected by this discharge. </p>

<p>If you plan on storing these batteries long term (more than a couple of months) it is important to <a href=""http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_restore_nickel_based_batteries"">use them periodically to prevent crystals from forming</a> and shorting the cells. The crystals can lower battery performance and the extreme one can cause damage that is irreversible. While modern NiCd's don't have a true internal memory problem, the crystal formation factor can effect the battery in a <em>similar</em> way. </p>

<h1>NiMH (Nickel Metal Hydride)</h1>

<p>Depending on what you read these batteries had a rough start when used for power tools. They have been getting better but were not as widely accepted until more recently due to their <a href=""http://www.toolcrib.com/blog/2007/03/making-the-power-tool-battery-decision-nimh-vs-nicad-vs-li-ion"">disadvantages</a>.</p>

<p>As far as temperature and periodic use the NiMH and NiCd have the same approach. The important difference is that NiMH have the highest discharge rate and it is more important to periodically use it to prevent damage. Some people have made special cradles to allow a trickle charge to prevent this effect although that is more for your standard AA,AAA batteries. </p>

<h1>Refer to your manual</h1>

<p>Assuming you still have it there could be more specific instructions included with your device. </p>

<h1>Awesome resource</h1>

<p>I have been reading a lot about this and this website has information that covers a broad overview and more in-depth coverage of batteries if you so chose. </p>

"Long term, what happens if I paint wet wood?","23448","","<p>If I paint wood, for outdoor use, while it is still very wet, what problems can I expect in the long run (2-3 years)?</p>

<p>In my specific case, I have pressure treated outdoor lumber (fir), which I purchased at Home Depot (where my only theory is that they store their wood in tanks of water before putting it on the shelves). The wood also feels relatively fresh based on the way it feels when I rip pieces off along the grain. The paint is an exterior latex paint with primer (Behr Exterior Premium Plus Ultra). I intend to paint every side, which will completely seal it with paint.</p>

<p>But it's going to take weeks or months for this wood to dry out and I only really have a day or two.</p>

<p>I don't mind repainting in a year if it is just a matter of the paint not sticking. My main concern is effects on the wood itself due to trapped moisture and pressure treatment chemicals.</p>
","<p>A paint chemist might have a cow over my answer, but I will give it a try.  </p>

<p>Regardless of what finish you put on the wood, the surface must be dry.  In order to bond with the wood, the finish must be absorbed. If the surface is too wet an oil based finish will be rejected (oil and water don't mix).  If the finish is water based the excess water in the wood grain will prevent the finish from sinking onto the surface.  In either case the finish will cure without getting a good grip on the wood fibers and the finish will tend to peel off in short order.  A simple test to see if the surface is dry enough is to sprinkle some water on the surface of the wood.  If it beads up, the wood is too wet.  If it is readily absorbed then you can proceed with finishing.  </p>

<p>The next concern is how much water is inside the wood.  Treated lumber is made using water infused with chemicals to prevent mold growth and insects. That is why it is so wet.  The wood goes directly from treatment to the lumber yard... no need to wait any longer.  This means that the wood will be evaporating water for some time (6 mos. to 1 year at a guess).  If the wood is not finished on all sides, the water has a path to get out, although warp and twist from unequal drying are possible. If all surfaces are well sealed then the water vapor will be more likely to blister the surface, finding the thinnest/weakest locations to break through as pressure increases inside.  </p>

<p>I do not think the treatment chemicals in the wood will have an effect since they are present whether the wood is wet or dry.  There may be a possibility that they can be absorbed by the paint  and affect its performance or color. However that is just conjecture on my part.  A test sample should alleviate any concerns here.</p>

"Finishing schedule for live edge walnut slab","23342","","<p>I'm working on a live edge walnut slab coffee table.  This is a photo of the bottom side of the table before any finish is applied sanded to 220 (for reference the holes are for threaded inserts that take a 1/4-20 bolt -- I machined metal legs that mate to the table):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QRaaS.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I finished the bottom using <a href=""http://www.buybutcherblock.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=goodstuff-finish4&amp;Category_Code=maintenanceProd"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Emmet's Good Stuff</a>, which is a gel polyurethane oil based varnish.  I applied a few coats, scuff sanded, and then used steel wool to apply some wax.  I used some cotton rags to polish the wax by hand:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uvkue.jpg"" alt=""walnut color example 1"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZGBAo.jpg"" alt=""walnut color example 2""></p>

<p>It's pretty hard to capture the grain/reflections with my iphone, but in general I liked the results. That stated I'd like something that pops the grain a bit more on the top side.  The Good Stuff contains ""synthetic oils"" (whatever that means) that do penetrate the wood nicely, but it doesn't have quite the pop I'm looking for.  Additionally the color of the wood doesn't quite match, the look I was hoping for seen in examples like:</p>

<p><a href=""https://store.kaufmann-mercantile.com/products/live-edge-black-walnut-cutting-board"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Example 1</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://stinewoodworking.com/portfolio/live-edge-slab-dining-table/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Example 2</a></p>

<p>I'm hoping to get a richer/darker tone in the heartwood while maintaining a nice contrast with the sap wood (it's fine by me if the sap wood darkens up a bit too so long as it maintains that nice contrast seen in the above examples).</p>

<p>I've been reading a ton about finishing and was hoping to get some feedback on the following finishing schedule for this piece:</p>

<ol>
<li>1-2 coats of oil (either boiled linseed, tung, or something like a danish oil).  The idea of this step is to pop the grain more than the good stuff is capable of as well as possibly darken the color of the wood a bit.</li>
<li>1 coat of dewaxed shellac.  The idea here is to provide a sanding sealer, optionally use a darker shellac (maybe amber?) to help darken the wood as well (augmenting step 1), and provide an interface to other finishing products. (perhaps this step is unnecessary if the next step isn't needed?)</li>
<li>Pore filler.  Not really sure about this step -- I've been reading a bunch about it/watching youtube videos and it's unclear to me if this will help accentuate the pores (which I would imagine would help pop the figure) after the first two steps in this process.  From what I understand I think I'd want to use an oil based pore filler.  I am under the impression that I should sand this stuff off so it just stays in the pores. (Maybe I can combine the first three steps into one step by wet sanding the oil and using the slurry as wood filler?)</li>
<li>Few coats of Good Stuff to provide a nice hard durable finish on top.</li>
<li>Rub out the good stuff with sand paper up to ~1200 grit to get a satin finish.</li>
</ol>

<p>Any feedback on the above steps, combination thereof, and the proposed reasoning behind them would be helpful.  Perhaps there other other better ways to approach this as well.  A few notes: I'm doing this in a garage with minimal access to professional equipment so spraying isn't really an option for me.  I'm 100% an amateur/hobbyist so super expensive equipment probably isn't realistic (though I do have access to a tool library and would consider investment in low-medium cost tools).</p>

<p>-------  EDIT  -------</p>

<p>After trying several different permutations I finally finished the table.  I ended up making a test board of a piece I cut from the slab:</p>

<p>The combinations I tried were:</p>

<ol>
<li>1 part Boiled linseed oil 1 part mineral spirits</li>
<li>1 part Boiled linseed oil 1 part mineral spirits second coat wet sanded with the grain</li>
<li>Maloof oil (1/3 poly, 1/3 BLO, 1/3 tung)</li>
<li>Maloof oil second coat wet sanded with grain</li>
<li>Good stuff</li>
<li>1 part BLO 2 parts mineral spirits</li>
<li>Tung oil</li>
<li>1lb dewaxed blonde shellac to test as a sanding sealer</li>
</ol>

<p>I then top coated those with good stuff to see what the final effect would be.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/E4NSe.jpg"" alt=""test board""></p>

<p>The sample board below shows the work, but it's probably impossible to see any differences given the lighting and iphone camera.  Suffice it to say there was a notable difference between all options.  How much and who noticed is debatable, but if you looked closely there were lots of differences.  All the oil products definitely popped the grain much better than the good stuff.  Qualitatively I'd say that BLO darkened the wood (especially the sap wood) more than the tung oil.  Interestingly the 2 parts mineral spirits 1 part BLO came out darker than 1 part mineral spirits 1 part BLO.  Maybe the mineral spirits thinned it more so that it was able to penetrate deeper?  Wet sanding the second coat definitely did <em>something</em> to the pores.  I've read in a few places that it's debatable whether this technique actually fills the pores since you're wiping away after a few minutes anyway.  In any event those sections' pores were much more visible (e.g. darker) to a degree I didn't like.</p>

<p>The shellac absolutely sanded easier than the good stuff.  This was to be expected, but I was shocked at how much smoother of a surface I got from this.</p>

<p>In the end I decided that I liked what the BLO and tung did to the wood.  They both popped the grain and made it ""richer"", but in different ways.  Rather than picking/choosing/overthinking it I just mixed 1 part BLO 1 part tung and 2 parts mineral spirits.  That way I could tell myself I got the best of both worlds :)</p>

<p>I could have just used the maloof finish, but I didn't see much point of using the poly in the maloof finish since I was going to get a poly top coat from the good stuff anyway.  Also though the differences were slight I preferred the pure oil to the maloof.</p>

<p>I did use the dewaxed shellac as a sanding sealer, which I was happy with.  I got a much smoother surface than I think I would have if I used the good stuff, but who knows -- I'm sure it's possible to get a very smooth surface with the good stuff as well.</p>

<p>After that I used 4 coats of good stuff removing excess almost immediately.  I scuff sanded between coats.  Finally I applied neutral liberon black bison wax with steel wool and polished by hand with rags.</p>

<p>I'm really happy with the finished table.  I think it looks and feels great.  Compared to another larger table I did with just good stuff I think the grain pops a lot more due to the oil.  I get a much more ""3d"" look to the figure.  The oils appear to have definitely darkened the wood in a way that I like.  The wax finish over the good stuff leaves a really nice smooth surface, which I really like.</p>

<p>Obviously the number one driver for the look of the finished table is the wood itself.  That stated I could have probably done anything and it would have turned out nicely, but since I chose this route I'll say it was the best!</p>

","<p>Very thorough question, kudos.</p>

<p>Side point: finishing the undersides of tabletops doesn't appear to be as advantageous as most of us have assumed. Bob Flexner on the subject, <a href=""http://www.popularwoodworking.com/article/finish_both_sides_not_necessary"" rel=""nofollow"">Finish Both Sides? Not necessary.</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Good Stuff contains ""synthetic oils"" (whatever that means) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would be confused by this too. The only synthetic oils I'm aware of are mineral oils, which as they're non-drying I would presume would not be a desirable additive to any finish intended to dry, particularly not one intended to dry hard or tough.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1-2 coats of oil (either boiled linseed, tung, or something like a danish oil). The idea of this step is to pop the grain </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> just want to highlight here for anyone who is not aware that so-called Danish oil products are usually not oils. Almost all on the market are a simple mixture of oil, varnish and additional spirits, and then sold at an inflated price to consumers. </p>

<p>As to popping the grain, oils are great at this (so is shellac incidentally, although it won't deepen the tone like you're looking to do).</p>

<p>Whether this will give you a noticeably different look to just The Good Stuff going directly on to the wood I can't say as I haven't used the latter. Ideally you'd want to do some comparisons, but with luck you will get a better result with the BLO than with the poly. BLO excels at this. Even if you don't get a significant improvement you've only wasted a little oil and not much time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1 coat of dewaxed shellac. The idea here is to provide a sanding sealer, optionally use a darker shellac (maybe amber?) to help darken the wood as well (augmenting step 1), and provide an interface to other finishing products. (perhaps this step is unnecessary if the next step isn't needed?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously shellac isn't a sanding sealer here unless further sanding will be done. </p>

<p>Regardless if it will, it's still a viable step if you want to do a fast finishing job: you can oil, and then shellac over the top of it without waiting at all for the oil to dry or cure. Then once the shellac has dried (wait about an hour if possible but 15-20 minutes can do it) you can go straight to your first coat of varnish. Using this method you can go from oiling through to 3 coats of varnish in a single day.</p>

<p>I have also tried varnishing directly over still-wet BLO using poly thinned to wiping-varnish consistency (about 1/3 to 1/2 added spirits) and not had any issues with drying. But in this case the second application of varnish usually needs to wait until the following day.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pore filler. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is entirely up to you. The open-pored look and the filled look each have their fans.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From what I understand I think I'd want to use an oil based pore filler. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p>Since you've sanded with 220 you're in a good position to make your own pore filler if you're interested, by simply blending the sanding dust with BLO (boiled linseed oil) or varnish. Varnish is a better bet as it dries hard and dries faster, but many traditionalists have used BLO for this and are happy with the performance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Maybe I can combine the first three steps into one step by wet sanding the oil and using the slurry as wood filler?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In general I wouldn't recommend this as it's not the ideal way to fill grain. </p>

<p>However, from the photos it looks like your wood could be a very good candidate for this method. If you go ahead with this step be patient when waiting for the pore filler to harden up. Pause for at least a full day, but it can be worth waiting an additional 24 hours or longer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rub out the good stuff with sand paper up to ~1200 grit to get a satin finish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rubbing down would be to flatten off. If all you're seeking to do however is knock back the sheen you can do this in a single step, using fine steel wool or something like ScotchBrite. This can be done dry or with wax.</p>

<p>Some of the confusion comes from the fact that you don’t have to wait for a complete cure to apply additional coats.  However, the primary reason there is so much conflicting advice is that they are so many different types of products labeled as “Tung Oil”. There are the three major varieties:</p>

<h2>Pure, Unadulterated Tung Oil</h2>

<p>Probably the least common variation, pure, unadulterated tung oil is the most difficult to work with (that’s why the other variations are so common). It doesn’t penetrate into the wood as well as the others and takes longest to cure.</p>

<p>A full cure can take 15 - 30 days, depending on the nature of the application and the temperature, humidity, and air circulation of the curing atmosphere. However, you only need to wait one or two days between coats.</p>

<h2>Modified or Polymerized Tung Oil</h2>

<p>Because pure, unadulterated tung oil takes so long to cure and has poor penetrating properties, many companies sell tung oil that has been heated to encourage polymerization. Depending on for how long its been heated, the result may too thick to work with and so polymerized tung oil is often mixed with solvents by the manufacturer to aid penetration and workability.  Probably there are varieties out there that have solvents but haven’t been polymerized. Depending on the solvent, modified tung oil may not be food-safe like pure tung oil.</p>

<p>Note that even products labeled as “pure” tung oil can be polymerized and have different drying and penetrating behavior than pure, unadulterated tung oil.</p>

<p>The time between coats depends on the formula and amount of heating done by the manufacturer. You’re best bet is to follow the times listed on the can.</p>

<h2>Complete Impostors</h2>

<p>Many products labeled “Tung Oil Finish” are actually more like a wiping varnish than an oil. In my experience, these are often the only variety sold in the Big Box home improvement stores. They leave a finish that resembles tung oil but you’ll often read people complaining that they have no tung oil at all. Only the manufacturers know for sure because tung oil is not hazardous and therefore doesn’t need to be reported on an MSDS. They have much different food-safe and water-protection properties than tung oil.</p>

<p>Again, the curing time and time between coats for these products will depend on what the manufacturer uses. A good first approximation should be listed in the instructions on the can.</p>

"How to sharpen a circular saw or mitre saw blade","22988","","<p>I got a mitre saw second hand and I am not sure how long it was in service for. I don't want to just buy a 12 inch blade as they can be expensive. Ultimately, I will have to purchase one at some point. The blade in question looks like it has over-sized tips that suggest I could go at them with a file.</p>

<p>Are there any reasons I should not do this? Such as efficiency or more importantly safety concerns?</p>

<p>If I can do this, is there any technique for going around the blade?</p>

<p>The question <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/83/how-do-i-know-its-time-to-replace-my-circular-saw-blade"">How do I know it&#39;s time to replace my circular saw blade?</a> will tell me if my blade is truly dull. </p>
","<p>A 12"" miter saw blade of the ilk normally found on a miter saw or cut-off saw looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IA5tu.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The teeth on the saw blade are carbide material that is very hard. You will not want to take a file to those teeth as they will very quickly kill your file. </p>

<p>This type of saw blade has gained huge popularity in recent years because the hardness of the carbide material helps the saw to keep an edge for a long time. Another attribute of this type of saw blade is the extremely smooth cut that can be achieved with them. This smooth cut is possible because of the precision grinding of the carbide tips at the time of manufacture. </p>

<p>I do not recommend hand sharpening this type of blade because of the distinct possibility that hand sharpening will result in tooth shapes that are not perfectly uniform all the way around the blade. Variation of tooth shape, length, edge angles, and width will have a direct effect on how smooth and nice of cut that can be produced by the blade. </p>

<p>So find a seasoned professional saw resharpener that has the necessary power grinder equipment that can result in an almost factory equivalent sharpening job on a carbide tipped saw blade. Most blades of this type can be resharpened at least once or twice provided there are no teeth that are chipped, broken or missing.</p>

"How can I join two boards at the ends?","22057","","<p>I want to join two boards end-to-end, effectively making a longer board. Thus, the glue will be on the end grain of both pieces (highlighted blue.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qHIGK.png"" alt=""Joining boards end to end""></p>

<p>(Source: self)</p>

<p>I know that an end-grain butt joint is among the weakest joints, so how can I make this stronger? I could lose some of the length on some pieces, but on others I need the full length.</p>
","<p>Dowels and biscuits are <em>length-preserving</em>, cheap and common ways of generating some long-grain glueing surface. They're not quite as strong as other solutions, but usually entirely sufficient.<br>
For dowels, you only need a drill and transfer plugs (or a dowel jig, which is more expensive). If you don't even have transfer plugs, you can improvise them with a dowel and a nail, or even with a dowel and a felt marker (no joke, done that before...). For biscuits, there is a special kind of tool, the ""biscuit joiner"", which makes sawing the slits in an automated process (not exactly the Mount Everest of traditional craftmanship, but it works very well).</p>

<p>Tongue and groove is very slightly more work than the above. If you have appropriate tools (a router will for example do, but manual tools are perfectly fine), it's a matter of minutes. I'm using a plow plane for that since taking the router out of the box and assembling/adjusting everything takes about as long as it will take me doing the tongue and groove with the plow plane, and I don't need hearing protection, nor is there a lot of fine dust. Hand saw and chisel certainly works, too, for the patient and dedicated traditional craftsman.<br>
The tongue can also be loose (a separate piece of wood) which is basically like a single large biscuit going all the way through. The advantage of a loose tongue is that you do not lose length. Mind that the external appearance is different, you'll see end-grain at the tongue, which can be undesirable but can also be very desirable (indeed sometimes people deliberately use a completely different wood for contrast, it can look pretty cool).</p>

<p>Then of course there are about two dozen variations of joinery that you could use, all of which <em>do lose some length</em>, however.<br>
What to use is hard to answer, as it depends on how much work you want to put into this, how stable it has to be, in which direction the expected force will act, and what ""look"" you want.</p>

<p>A simple lap joint, for example, is perfectly fine if you do not have any ""special needs"" on stability. It can be made easily and quickly with no tools but saw and chisel, or with a rabbet plane (or, of course, if you have a router, with the router).</p>

"Best method for drilling a larger diameter hole at an angle","21037","","<p>I spent the weekend making a simple wine rack out of cedar for my mother as a gift.</p>

<p>I drilled 1.5"" holes in a cedar 2x6 to make something like this:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/163y4.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So to keep the bottles inverted (keep the cork wet) you have to drill down at a 45 degree angle or so.  I used a 1.5"" bit to drill the holes but it was real sloppy and well it just didn't go great. </p>

<p><strong>So.  What is the best way to drill a 1.5""+ hole at an angle through a 2x6?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Recommended tools/bits (not looking for a brand obviously) should be included unless there is an easy way to do this free hand...</li>
</ul>
","<p>Personally, I would use my drill press. The bed will tilt to any angle and then you just clamp the board to the bed.  You would need a piece of waste wood under the board so not to put the bit into the metal bed.</p>

<p>I think Forstner bits would be the better idea for doing this though using a spade bit might be possible, if you lower it slow enough, I don't think I'd recommend it.</p>

<p>45 degrees is pretty steep for a hand held drill, but by starting it and slow tilting the drill to the correct angle while keeping the tip in the wood might give you something close to what you are looking for, but I'd stick with a drill press, much safer and more accurate.</p>

"DIY honing oil?","20913","","<p>I can't find honing oil locally anymore.  My (chisel) sharpening is pretty low-end - I don't even know what kind of stone I have.  (I got it at Lowes, long ago.  It has 2 faces, one pink, one dark-ish gray.)  Mostly, I just need something to keep the stone from loading up.  I know I can order oil online; but, I never get around to it.   And besides, the shipping.  </p>

<p>So, I'm thinking to try to roll my own.  Hence, the question.  Things that I've heard can be used: mineral oil, vegetable oil, 3-in-1 oil, ATF, kerosene.  I'd probably just do one of the kerosene-mineral oil mixes, except my wife can't stand the smell of kerosene.  (Go figure.)  </p>

<p>I would appreciate any thoughts on this.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Things that I've heard can be used: mineral oil, vegetable oil, 3-in-1 oil, ATF, kerosene. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes these can all be used. ATF should be avoided as it can contain ingredients you don't want on your skin, and there are many reliably safe alternatives.</p>

<p><strong>Mineral oils</strong></p>

<p>Commercial honing oils are nine times out of ten just mineral oil (UK: paraffin oil or liquid paraffin), sometimes merely with a colourant added so that it's not quite so obvious that it's only mineral oil. All simple lubricating oils are based on a form of mineral oil (including 3-In-One), and so is baby oil. </p>

<p>If you don't mind the sickly-sweet smell of baby oil that's a perfectly good alternative and many woodworkers use it. Video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52pOLpz6BJs"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> from Graham Haydon showing him using baby oil on his India stone.</p>

<p>You can of course avoid the smell and just use straight mineral oil, but mineral oil alone can be a little heavy on some stones. As a rough guide the finer the stone the lighter the oil you want to use.</p>

<p>In place of kerosene you can use mineral spirits (UK: white spirit), which actually is a very very thin oil. On very fine, dense oilstones spirit works surprisingly well by itself, but is a little too light on many coarser stones, and as mentioned straight mineral oil can be a little too heavy. However a blend of the two can be made to hit the exact viscosity mark you're personally fond of or which best suits the stones you're using. </p>

<p><strong>Vegetable oils</strong></p>

<p>A great many vegetable oils can used successfully as honing oil. Most pose no problem at all (see note below on rancidity) but you do have to be careful not to accidentally choose a drying or semi-drying oil — which includes tung oil, flaxseed oil, walnut oil, poppy oil, safflower and some forms of sunflower oil. These can start to 'dry' and begin to gel, clogging the stone and making it nearly useless.</p>

<p>Older books often warn of the danger of using linseed oil (a drying oil) on your honing stones for this very reason. Note that flaxseed oil is linseed oil by another name.</p>

<p>Safe oils to use: corn oil, soya oil, most forms of rapeseed oil (canola) and peanut oil. You can also use almond oil, macadamia nut oil and olive oil, but given their higher price they're hardly a practical consideration.</p>

<p>Note: there's no need to worry about vegetable oil going rancid unless you're in the habit of completely flooding the stone and not wiping it down afterwards. Even at that the only real issue is a slightly stale or ""off"" smell, there's no other negative effect.</p>

"Why and when should I wear a dust mask?","20509","","<p>I'm a handy man with limited woodworking projects these days.  I mostly use a circular saw, jig saw, and orbital sander to make crude storage.  Sometimes I cut MDF, etc.</p>

<p>I've seen it mentioned several times on this site that you should wear a dust mask.  Then I saw <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/770/706"">this answer</a> which said, ""Dust collection is not an excuse not to wear a mask.""  </p>

<ul>
<li>Why does it seem mandatory to wear a dust mask?  </li>
<li>When is it not mandatory to wear a dust mask?  </li>
<li>I work mostly outside with a breeze as my dust collection, am I ok?  </li>
<li>Is wearing a dust mask more important when using certain tools?</li>
</ul>

<p>The types of wood that you should wear a dust mask for has <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/353/what-kind-of-wood-dust-is-toxic-dangerous-and-requires-usage-of-dust-mask"">already been discussed.</a>  I'm asking in particular about work environment, situation, and type of work.</p>
","<p>Short answer: always wear a properly-fitted, high-efficiency respirator so you can reduce your chances of developing respiratory problems or certain types of cancer of the respiratory system later in life.</p>

<p>There are many levels of protection when it comes to filtering the air you breathe, from cheap paper masks that provide very little protection, to slightly better disposable masks with or without breathing valves, to well-fitted half- or full-face respirators with rubber gaskets and P100 filters (HEPA-level, removing 99.97% of airborne particles down to 0.3 microns in size).</p>

<p>No matter how good your dust collection system is, some dust will always escape at the collection point and some may not be filtered at the filtration point.</p>

<p>To answer the various points in your question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why does it seem mandatory to wear a dust mask?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because inhaled dust can clog up your lung tissues. In the short term, you can become sensitized to certain types of material, and longer-term you can develop respiratory ailments and/or cancer. Not everyone is as susceptible to any of these negative outcomes, but there is not a way to predict whether you will be one of the unlucky ones who does develop some sensitivity or ailment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When is it not mandatory to wear a dust mask?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strictly speaking, never. If we all wore respirators 24/7 and never removed them, we could reduce the spread of airborne diseases, reduce inhalation of secondhand smoke and automotive exhaust, and generally keep our lungs cleaner.</p>

<p>But there's a point at which protecting yourself from future ailments becomes impractical or seems excessive (even ridiculous), given all the other hazards we face on a daily basis. And not everyone who is subjected to dust develops cancer or any other ailment. Only you can decide what level of risk you are willing to accept for yourself. Personally, I go by whether I can smell the dust, which means I almost always wear a respirator, even when working outside.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I work mostly outside with a breeze as my dust collection, am I ok?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You're certainly better off than being in an enclosed space in which the concentration of airborne particles increases the longer you work, assuming you are not wearing a respirator in either case. But you're not necessarily as well off outdoors without a respirator than you are indoors with a respirator, especially with tools that produce a cloud of dust around you when you use them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is wearing a dust mask more important when using certain tools?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, some tools produce more dust or finer dust, some tools collect less dust, and some tools eject more dust directly toward you. It all depends on the tool, application, and whether the tool was adequately retrofitted or designed from the start with dust collection in mind. For example, most circular saws have little or no dust collection, while most track saws at least have a dust collection port built in or available as an add-on. And most sanders these days have dust collection ports but some work better than others. Most miter saws currently on the market have terrible dust collection, but many table saws have pretty decent dust collection.</p>

"How to cut the centre out of a large round of wood","19200","","<p>I have a large round of wood (horizontal slice of a tree) which is about 20 inches across (circle diameter) and 8-9 inches deep.</p>

<p>I want to take the centre out of the wood, either by cutting a circle which is maybe 4-6 inches smaller in diameter than the piece (thus leaving 2-3 inches of wood around the outside) or by making some kind of cut that follows the shape of the wood (since its not a perfect circle).  The second option here would be my preference but I can work with the first.</p>

<p>I'd also like to avoid cutting it into pieces or cutting into it from the edge and then having to re-glue but if thats the only option that might be a possibility.  Even if I slice it in half somehow though I still have the problem of hollowing out two very large semi-circles.</p>

<p>Wherever possible I would like to keep the wood inside relatively intact so I can do the same thing to the centre-area I've taken out on a smaller scale (rather than it all being just wasted).</p>

<p>The options I have considered / tried are:</p>

<p>1) <strong>Bandsaw</strong> - I don't have one of these with a large enough throat I could actually cut the depth of wood on it.  Also this would mean entering from the side and manipulating a very heavy and large piece of wood accurately moving it around to place the cut along the side.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Drilling adjoining holes</strong> - I have tried to drill holes through with a spade bit but have had issues.  For one my spade bit is not long enough.  Assuming I could get an extender of some sort and get it through to the other side its very hard to keep it 'on track' while drilling an adjoining hole since the rotation of the bit seems to want to pull it into the adjoining hole drilled previously.  Once this happens it destroys the 'walls' separating the two touching holes I am trying to drill and makes it near impossible to keep on track.  I have a pillar drill that might be able to help with this issue but then I am back to manipulating a very large piece of wood on a drill platform which is much too small for it. </p>

<p>3) <strong>Drilling separate holes then cutting through</strong> - I have also tried to drill holes which are separated by a small distance (e.g. 10mm).  This is much easier to drill the holes and my plan was to use a keyhole saw to cut through from one hole to the other but making these cuts is very onerous, for one its hard to get the pressure required to get the cut through without trying to balance the wood so that the saw is cutting downwards (otherwise I'm trying to cut sideways or in some weird position) and I also have problems with the depth of the wood, particularly if the hole is not drilled all the way through.</p>

<p>4) <strong>Jigsaw</strong> - I have some quite long bits for my jigsaw but nowhere near long enough.  I bought a reciprocal saw as I was able to get a 12"" blade for it but it seemed to cut very slowly, suffer from absolutely <em>horrible</em> amounts of vibration, and I still had the problem of getting the blade through (admittedly could be resolved with an extender or a longer spade bit on my drill) and because the blade was so long I had my doubts about it being able to make the turns required to cut the circle.</p>

<p>5) <strong>Chainsaw</strong> - for a brief time (before I actually handled a petrol chainsaw) I had considered making plunge cuts with a chainsaw through the wood but now see a number of issues.  For one oil from the blade might affect the final finish on the wood and plunging a chainsaw into an 8-9"" cut just seems to be asking for the chain to bind and then either get perma-stuck in the wood or develop into some unanticipated and likely not very funny distribution of kinetic energy towards the delicate meatbag holding it.</p>

<p>6) <strong>Lathe</strong> - I don't have one but also I can't imagine it would take the weight of such a large chunk of wood.</p>

<p>7) <strong>Circle-cutter drill bit</strong> - I once had one of these that went maybe 10-11"" across maximum.  I haven't since looked or found a larger one but in any case the one I had wouldn't have been able to cut deeply enough to take the entire centre out, so all I would get is a circle groove which isn't much use.  My previous experience with hole saws and circle cutters is things get more difficult the deeper you get so I would think this would be problematic.</p>

<p>I'm running low on ideas at this point as to how I get it done.  The drill-and-saw-through method might work but it seems an inordinate amout of work.  Probably the best I can think of is to spend a lot of money on a large bandsaw with a large throat depth, then build some kind of large adjustable height platform which would allow me to make the cut from one side, turn it round and then exit from another or the same side, then re-glue.</p>

<p>If someone has a solution whereby I can cut it into two halves (also not easy, best I can come up with here is some major elbow grease with a long-blade handsaw or again back to a bandsaw with large throat depth?), and then hollow it out then that would be interesting for other reasons too since I seem to often find myself wanting to hollow out shapes/curves/semicircles of wood which wouldn't be doable on a lathe.</p>

<p><strong>Update for anyone interested:</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to try some of these options before accepting an answer but it's taken me a while to get round to it.</p>

<p>I tried my preferred option by making a bow saw from a modern blade and some custom wood.  The saw turned out OK and was able to saw a test piece no problems but because the depth of the cut it had to be able to make to cut the outer ring of the wood was so large it ended up being a very tall saw (around 80cm):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DTjz7.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DTjz7.jpg"" alt=""very deep bowsaw""></a></p>

<p>This made it <strong>very cumbersome</strong> to actually use.  If the saw is held higher up then its there's way too much leverage to force the blade along and make the cut and the saw blade just sticks and the whole saw tilts instead.  If held lower down then without the wrist strength of Hercules and Popeye combined the saw is just too hard to keep straight.  Cutting anything other than horizontally had similar problems of managing the weight and tilt.  I did eventually figure out a way around this by hooking a broom handle off a rafter and using it as a slide that I could lift and lower to adjust the angle of the saw.  With this I was able to get the saw going but found that for some reason it was very difficult to get it to follow the curve of the wood.  The back side of the cut seemed to curve slightly but the front side just wanted to go straight.   Even given quite significant torsion on the blade (see pic) there seemed to be no way to get it to curve.  Possibly the wood was just too thick for it to make the curve.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iGUHq.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iGUHq.jpg"" alt=""squint bowsaw cut""></a></p>

<p>What I did find worked somewhat were auger bits which tracked very well (distinct from forstner bits which I hadn't realised and haven't tried) but which did need a wall-powered drill to have the power to get them through repeatedly and successfully.  I also found drill bit extenders which would allow me to get them all the way through although the extenders themselves are quite wide and mean I have to use a wider auger bit than I would like.  Even so, drilling so many holes and trying to get them to link up all the way through the depth of the wood is not easy and is very likely to end up needing further efforts to join the holes up from the underside due to them not being perfectly straight.</p>

<p>Auger bits are probably the best way to get the job done given my original requirements but it seems the only relatively quick and easy option is a bandsaw with a large throat depth, although possibly cutting the whole thing in half with a chainsaw and chopping bits out with that might be a good way to go if the centre wasn't important.</p>
","<p>I think you've already hit on the best way(s) to remove the bulk of the material without going overboard on costs, but aren't using the right tool for the job. Drilling adjoining or adjacent holes I think are the best ways to approach this for the average user, just not using a spade bit. </p>

<p>I'd probably use an auger bit in a brace if I had to do a job like this, since this would be the cheapest option for me. For you, buying a suitable bit for your power drill that's similar to an old-style auger bit may be your best bet. These can be found with lengths in excess of 9"" / 23cm (in fact bits longer than 2' / 60cm are available) so you wouldn't have to resort to drilling in from both sides of the round.</p>

<p>If you wanted to go with separate holes followed by breaking through the web between them this type of bit will greatly aid the process because they track very well; their design is specifically to allow the creation of long straight holes, in this regard far far better than a spade bit. So you could go from a spacing of 10mm to just a couple of millimetres. But with auger-style bits you could probably successfully drill the holes adjoining if you go slow, that's how well they track.</p>

<p>Cleaning up afterwards is still going to be a lot of work! Probably best done mostly with hand tools, so this will be a slow, tedious job but hopefully worth it in the end.</p>

"When are pocket holes an appropriate joinery technique?","19003","","<p>I have come across a lot of designs and plans for things like outdoor furniture, kids' furniture, etc., that call for the use of pocket holes.  I can appreciate why this is enticing to a lot of people as it's a lot simpler that mortise and tenon joints or dovetails while still being concealed.</p>

<p>Matthias Wandel has an article on <a href=""https://woodgears.ca/joint_strength/pockethole.html"">Testing pocket holes against mortise and tenon and dowel joints</a> where he finds that they are indeed significantly weaker than other joint types.</p>

<p>With the exception of small objects, 99lbs as an average breaking force for a pocket joint doesn't seem very strong at all.  I could see a tabletop generate forces beyond this with just a few adults leaning on it.</p>

<p>Are there any times when this is an appropriate joinery technique to use, over alternatives? Or are they just typically used when someone doesn't have the skill, time (or maybe cost) to build a more robust joint?</p>
","<p>Bear in mind that that 99 lbs is for a single joint with pressure being applied in the manner of a first class lever in Mr. Wandel's experiment. You will have multiple pocket holes in a given construction. Let's look at your table example. Most of that pressure is being distributed through the legs and into the floor,  say you have four legs and four boards making up the frame that the tabletop attaches to. it's also being used in conjunction with wood glue (e.g. titebond), so you're not just looking at the strength of the screws but the glue as well.</p>

<p>Even disregarding the fact that you're going to glue your pocket holes, that pressure is distributed over at a minimum of two joints and much of the pressure from someone leaning on the table is going into the legs themselves, not into the class one lever directly applied to the joint like Mr. Wandel used for his experiment.</p>

<p>A pocket hole joint is great for face frames as rob mentioned. A friend of mine used a kreg jig to build his desk and it has not fallen to pieces around him. I probably wouldn't use it for a kitchen table as the sole joint, but I wouldn't be opposed to using them to help clamp mortise and tenon joints.</p>

<p>Frankly, I think Mr. Wandels' experiment is misleading in that it shows that a single joint is stronger, but the impression it gives is that you shouldn't use pocket holes because they're weak, and that simply isn't the case. I am curious to know why his experiment <a href=""http://www.rockler.com/how-to/pocket-hole-joinery-kreg-jig/"">disagrees with Kreg's claims from ""independent testing.""</a> Kreg claims that a pocket hole joint can sustain more shear load than a mortise and tenon joint. This may be true, since Wandel's test wasn't for a shear load. It might be interesting to see how that experiment was done.</p>

<p>Mostly I think there is opposition to pocket hole joinery because it isn't ""classy."" Woodworkers like to think of themselves as rustic traditionalists, carrying on a craft passed on for generations. Pocket holes may seem too much like a crutch, or being too ""modern,"" but they're frankly plenty strong for quite a few situations, including light tables and desks. </p>

  oil to penetrate the wood for about 2 hours. Wipe off surplus oil with
  a cloth or kitchen paper. During the first week of use the table top
  should be treated every second day and after that every third day
  until the surface is saturated (after about 2 months). Then treat the
  surface as required.</p>

  <p>Apply BEHANDLA with brush or pad in a thin, even film. Leave to

"Tips for recognizing aged pressure treated wood","18355","","<p>New lumber that is pressure treated will have tags that identify the chemical used. More noticeably is the green or brown colors from the treating process. So newer wood is easier to identify as treated. As the treated wood ages it can turn a grey colour. This might not be a good comparison but some cedars turn a <em>similar</em> grey colour over time as well.</p>

<p>Assuming I do not see tags and the (treated) colour has disappeared is there a way to tell if the wood was treated or not? </p>

<p>Sure I suppose I could cut into it but I have seen some wood where the colour was not obvious in a cross section. Another thought would be to do a test for arsenic but I don't know how good of a test that will be.</p>

<p>I don't want to take this wood if it can be avoided. For those that don't know I am a big upcycler and use reclaimed wood frequently. I have misidentified pressure treated in the past as was wondering about tips. </p>
","<p>Any wood left untreated and allowed to weather will eventually turn gray.  In the days before pressure treated lumber was prominent, people stained or painted their decks and other outdoor projects to protect them from rot and graying.   With the advent of pressure treating, the advice and common practice became to ""let it weather naturally"".</p>

<p><strong>Determine the history of the wood</strong></p>

<p>Assume the wood has been treated with CCA if you think the wood could have been processed prior to 2003 (the year that EPA said to stop this silliness).  Or if you have found an out-building from prior to about 1970, you can proceed to up-cycle with confidence.</p>

<p><strong>Look closely at the wood</strong></p>

<p>Surely there are places where part of the wood that was protected from the effects of weather by a lap joint or a piece of trim.  If you see any green in the overlap, it's CCA.</p>

<p><strong>Cut into the wood</strong></p>

<p>Don't plan on seeing tell tale green by cutting off an end; it will be too hard to see.  Instead, make a very low angle cut as though you are making a scarf joint.  You should might see a transition from gray (weathering) to green (CCD) to yellow (wood). The inability to see green is not a sure sign that there is no
CCD, but he presence is a positive indicator. </p>

<p><strong>Forget it if you really want ""clean"" wood</strong></p>

<p>Short of chemical or spectral analysis (expensive and I suspect a violation of up-cycler credo) , you cannot be certain that the wood is not tainted, but you might be able to confirm your suspicions that it is.

"Can I apply polyurethane over oil before oil cures?","17688","","<p>Specifically I am wondering about polyurethane (Rustoleum Ultimate) over boiled linseed oil, but in general polyurethane or other top coats with similar chemistry over any drying oil.</p>

<p>Question is: Can I apply polyurethane over an oil before the oil completely cures or do I have to wait?</p>

<p>I looked up linseed oil on Wikipedia and it led me to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drying_oil"">drying oils</a>. These oils polymerize by reacting with ambient O2. I also attempted to research the curing process of polyurethane but discovered there are many different types with many different uses, so it was difficult to find info. I <em>think</em> they cure by reacting with ambient moisture.</p>

<p>My knowledge of chemistry is too limited to be able to understand if polyurethane would allow O2 to pass through to react with the undercoating of oil as it cures.</p>

<p>The other random bit of info that I found is that <a href=""http://www.rustoleum.com/MSDS/ENGLISH/260163.pdf"">Rustoleum Ultimate polyurethane primarily consists of</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://msdssearch.dow.com/PublishedLiteratureDOWCOM/dh_00fc/0901b803800fc0f9.pdf?filepath=productsafety/pdfs/noreg/233-00468.pdf&amp;fromPage=GetDoc"">Dipropylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether</a> (DPM)</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone"">Methyl-n 2-Pyrrolidone</a> (NMP)</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of which I understand. I reached the conclusion that they are moisture cured from <a href=""http://www.garlandco.com/educational/ytr/catching-polyurethane-train.html"">this article</a> although it concerned types of polyurethane used on metal. Not sure if it's the same as wood.</p>

<p>So, can I apply polyurethane before the BLO cures? Will it continue curing underneath? Or do I have to wait? If I do have to wait, what will happen if I don't? Is it different for an oil-based polyurethane (it looks like the Rustoleum one is water-based)?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Can I apply polyurethane over oil before oil cures?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, broadly speaking you can do this and there is no real penalty. You do tend to see an increase in drying time, but contrary to many statement to the contrary online the oil <em>will</em> cure perfectly well under a coat of poly, because the varnish is not at all a perfect oxygen barrier.</p>

<p>However, polyurethane is by no means a single product and <em>the above does not apply to Rust-Oleum's Ultimate</em> as it's a waterbased poly! As a rule no waterbased product should ever be applied to an oily surface.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I do have to wait, what will happen if I don't? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You'll have significant application difficulties, as you'd expect applying a water-borne product to an oily surface. The most significant effect can be an uncontrollable beading, which prevents any sort of even coverage.</p>

<p>If you wait for the oil to cure however you can successfully apply the Ultimate onto wood treated with BLO. This curing time is at minimum a couple of weeks, but many users prefer to wait a month or so to err on the side of caution.</p>

"How do I drill a hole exactly in the center of a circle?","17291","","<p>I have a 2"" diameter, 11"" length dowel. I want to drill a 5/16"" hole exactly in the center of each end, 2"" min depth. It needs to be precise because it is for axles that the dowel needs to spin freely around without wobbling. I need to do both ends separately, not all the way through.</p>

<p>How do I find the center and drill a hole there? (Note: I have one handheld rotary drill. I do not have a drill press. I have access to one if necessary but it is not convenient. I also have <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0061FY004"">these guides</a>.)</p>

<p>I know how to find the center of rectangular boards, but not circles.</p>
","<h1>Finding the center</h1>

<p><strong>Using Geometry</strong></p>

<p>There are a couple of ways to do this. Since your dowel is big enough you can do this by hand relatively easy. </p>

<p>First would be to make 3 lines on the outside of the dowel the cross 2 different points along the circumference (each line). Then draw 3 perpendicular lines from the center of those lines. The point where all those lines intersect is the center of the circle. This picture makes way more sense than my words. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BZb36m.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BZb36m.png"" alt=""Unknown theorum""></a></p>

<p>That seems like more work than it is worth though. Something simpler, that requires a square (or anything with a known 90 degree angle), called <a href=""http://www.mathopenref.com/constcirclecenter2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Thales' Theorem</a>. This one is also easier to explain. Draw a right angle and the edge of the dowel. The sides from this angle will bisect the circumference of the dowel. Drawing a line between those two point will get the diameter. Repeating this process a second time (starting from another point.) will get you a second diameter. The point where the two diameters meet is your center. This is what I would do as I don't need to do this to often. </p>

<p><strong>Just use a tool</strong></p>

<p>A center square, <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/2838/128"">or similar tool like the one in Jason's answer</a> would work very quickly and efficiently and would take less time and be less error prone. If you need to be perfect every time and plan on doing this a lot than a center gauge, or similar tool, is the way to go. Press it up against the dowel and draw your line. Do this twice and you found your center. </p>

<p>Might even be able to make a home brew version of this depending on your acceptable tolerance.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/A0q8U.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/A0q8U.png"" alt=""Center gauge""></a></p>

<h1>Drilling the hole.</h1>

<p>This might not work for your case but in general I would recommend using a drill press for something like this where accuracy is important. Take a deep block and drill a hole, with the press, that is the same diameter as your dowel. Hopefully your table moves down far enough. The depth of your block, if possible, should be close to the length of your dowel. Keep in mind that you still need to clamp it to the table but the deeper the hole the less error you will get from the dowel moving. </p>

<p>Then place your dowel in this void. That will keep it perpendicular to the table. Use a punch to mark your center and then guide your drill into that hole. </p>

<p>Sure I <em>can</em> order the genuine article from the Kreg website but I am more interested in what other hardware alternatives are there to pocket screws? </p>
","<p>Not a direct answer to your question but thought I'd add that if you can find a screw of suitable overall form but it's unfortunately not self-tapping you can modify them so that they are. </p>

<p><em>Any</em> screw can be modified to make it self-tapping, and the process is surprisingly easy. All that's required is to create clearance and effectively a cutting edge, or more than one, and the existing threading takes care of the rest (just as it does on manufactured self-tapping screws).</p>

<p>This sounds like a lot of work but it can be a very quick operation, literally a few seconds per screw at fastest. So I'll concentrate on the fast-and-dirty method instead of those that create a groove similar to that seen on many commercial types.</p>

<p>Grip your screw in gloved fingers or pliers (pad jaws to prevent crushing the threads) and hold it against a grinder or belt sander to create one flat face on it, approximately 1/3 of the way up the threads. Ideally it should retain its original point, looking something like this when you're done:</p>

"Is PVC pipe safe to use for a dust collection system?","16486","","<p>I'm in the early stages of designing a dust collection system for my home shop.  My existing system, a dustpan and broom, is vastly inefficient for my setup, which includes a tablesaw, router table, planer, and various small power tools. Long-term, my goal is to plumb my shop to run ductwork to each of my three main tools from a centralized dust collector - I haven't yet mapped out a design for this, but the tool area of my shop is around 20x15, and I'd need to run to all three tools.  </p>

<p>When doing my initial research to get a feel for the costs, I've run into a variety of recommendations for materials to use.  Some sites insist that PVC pipe is the best ""affordable"" option, while others strongly warn against using it due to static buildup.  Most of the other options I read about are more expensive, often by a significant amount, so I want to know if it's possible to save money by using PVC, or if the risks outweigh the convenience.  </p>

<p><strong>Is PVC a safe material to use in a dust collection system, and are there any specific precautions I need to take in order to use it?</strong></p>
","<p>PVC is commonly used in dust collection systems. Typically for longer runs you should use 6"" or larger pipe, regardless of the material. If you're using PVC, the larger, less expensive pipe is commonly available as sewer drain pipe.</p>

<p>As of May 2015, there have been no known fires caused by a static discharge in a PVC pipe from a dust collection system.</p>

<p>Because PVC is an insulator, you are more likely to get a number of small static discharges than a single large static discharge.</p>

<p>Even if you want to ground your PVC anyway, simply running a ground wire through the PVC will not be very effective because--as I mentioned before--PVC is an insulator and charge does not travel across it very easily. Only the surfaces of the pipe in direct contact with the wire will be grounded, and any points not in <em>direct</em> contact will not be grounded. Grounding the outside is pointless because no charge will travel from the inside to the outside, or vice-versa. If you suspend the wire directly through the middle of the pipe, you still won't collect and ground much charge because air is also an excellent insulator. If you want to effectively ground the system, you need to entirely cover the inside of the pipe with a conductive coating, then ground the inside of the pipe to the components on either end of the pipe (dust collector and tool), as if you were running metal pipe. Suffice it to say, it's a lot less work to just trust physics and use PVC pipe as-is without any extra unnecessary precautions.</p>

<p>If you're still concerned, I'd suggest reading the following articles, which cover the topic in much more depth:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.rockler.com/how-to/exploding-pvc-dust-collection-ductwork/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Exploding PVC Dust Collection Ductwork?</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Lastly, keep in mind that if you are running a central dust collection system, you aren't going to get enough airflow or air velocity if you cheap out on the dust collector itself. Once you've planned out your pipe, crunch the numbers with <a href=""http://www.billpentz.com/Woodworking/Cyclone/staticcalc.xls"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bill Pentz's static pressure calculator</a> (Excel spreadsheet) to find the CFM and static pressure requirements, and use those as the minimum specs when shopping for a dust collector.</p>

<p>What are situations when you would or would not countersink?</p>
","<h2>Counter-sinking prevents murder.</h2>

<p>(that is, wood grain murder)</p>

<p>Driving a screw into a hole that isn't counter-sunk will have a very small point of contact, which exerts brutal sheer forces and tears the wood grain apart. Hammering in a nail is pretty much the only thing you could do worse.</p>

<p>A counter-sunk screw, on the other hand, has a large contact surface to a cleanly-cut wood funnel, and the resulting direction of the force is mostly downwards (where you want it to be):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZoPNs.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Forcing in the screw brutally murders the grain and reduces the wood's stability. Also, if you look close enough, you'll notice that it looks like rubbish:</p>

<p>By comparison, the counter-sunk piece of wood looks <strong>a lot</strong> healthier on the inside, even when doing a hustle job with a cheap sinker like I did here (and the exterior appearance is much better, too):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/v7Tf3.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Very often, the difference will not matter too much since both screw and wood will withstand 10 times as much as you are planning for anyway. But it might just make the difference between an intact piece and a broken one.</p>

<p>Also, it's a bit a matter of principle, too: You needlessly weaken the internal structure when you really don't need to (it really only takes 2 seconds and a 0.99 tool).  </p>

<p>Of course, for a quality work piece where you really mean it, you would rather use a 3-lobe HSS piece (which is in the ca. 25.00 range rather than 0.99) in a column drill. That's yet an entirely different ballpark of quality. But even a cheap hand-operated counter-sinker is an order of magnitude better than forcing the screws.</p>

"How can I determine the load capacity of a simple bench?","15416","","<p>I'm new to woodworking and I'm in the planning phase of making a bench like the one pictured below. I'm planning on storing very heavy boxes on this and would also like to use it as a stool to reach high shelves. </p>

<p>Is there a standard practice in determining how much weight a bench can hold? Is there any quick estimation practices that usually give accurate results? </p>

<p>The bench will be made all out of Douglas-fir 2x4 studs, except for the four legs which will be Douglas-fir 4x4 posts. The only fasteners I plan on using are steel 2.5 in. common nails. How can I find the weight this bench can realistically hold? </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1zkFcm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>The 4x4 posts used for the legs support virtually ""infinite"" weight longitudinally. Now, of course, given a naive design, each leg would only transmit force onto one 4x2 beam (which are then maybe nailed together with some kind of ledge or so), which isn't optimal. You most definitely want to connect the beams with a dovetail batten or a similar construct close to the legs, if stability matters. Four 10mm carriage bolts that go through each leg and the dovetail batten are a good solution.<br>
Glueing and nailing a thick batten onto the beams might also ""work"", but alltogether that's not such a great plan since it rigidly fixes the cross-piece which will put strain on the longitudinal bonding when the batten expands (and that's kind of inevitable).  </p>

<p>Something like this (that's my garden table, it confirmedly supports 8 adult persons dancing on top of it without shaking):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LdxkV.jpg"" alt=""dovetail batten on table""></p>

<p>Also, you need to make sure that the bench is somewhat resilient against sheering. The cross-beam that is shown in the picture is already a good approach, but nails as the only fastener <em>will not do</em>. No way.<br>
I would join every two distinct pieces with glue and two 10mm hardwood dovels <em>as the very minimum</em>. Preferrably though, mortise and tenon.</p>

<p>As for bearing capacity on the bearing/sitting surface, a single 4x2 douglasia beam that is 180cm long and supported at both ends easily sustains my body weight, so the easy answer on that account would be <em>""no worries, this will do""</em>. However, you can do orders of magnitude better or worse here too, with only ""small"" modifications.</p>

<p>As pointed out by rob, you will ideally want to make a laminate bearing surface by glueing the 4x2 beams together. A small ledge in the middle as shown in the picture will work as the absolute minimum, but will not be nearly as good.<br>
The reasoning behind this is that the weight is better distributed over all beams, not just on the ones the weight is on.</p>

<p>However, note that using the 4x2 beams in the way depicted in the image is not optimal for bearing capacity, and the horizontal laminate is sub-optimal from the point of view of stability.<br>
The bearing capacity of a rectangular beam is proportional to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub> · h<sup>3</sup>b which means that <em>a single</em> 4x2 beam (upright) equals <em>four</em> 2x4 beams (flat).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Whw6c.png"" alt=""4x2 = 4 * 2x4""> <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iBjj6.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You can therefore greatly increase (double or triple) overall stability and bearing capacity by simply laminating another one or two <em>upright</em> beams under the bearing surface. Or, you can laminate a thin ledge to one or several of the beams <em>longitudinally</em>, preferrably set back a bit so one can't see it.<br>
For this, it is absolutely important that the beams are glued together carefully on the entire length.</p>

I have a couple of drills so I don't have to change the bits often. I am aware that I can buy a new key for my drill but that does not help me at this moment. </p>

<p>What can I do to change bits in this drill until such a time that I can replace the key?</p>
","<p>Losing a key is definitely inconvenient but you don't need to pack up for the day just yet. This will also work for a drill press  </p>

<h1>What you need</h1>

<ol>
<li>Large flat head screwdriver</li>
<li>Drill bit that fits ( not the drilling end ) where the chuck key would have been placed. There are other items that will work just as well but the butt of a drill bit fits nicely in the hole so as to not damage the bit or the drill. </li>
</ol>

<h1>What to do</h1>

<p>Place the drill bit in one of the chuck key holes. Use a glove when holding the bit so you don't slice you hand.</p>

<p>Using the bit as leverage the screw driver can turn the chuck using the gear. Essentially mimicking the action of the key.</p>

<p><sup>The above picture is a still from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIegFURsGFE"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this video</a> showing the same procedure.</sup></p>

<h1>Another approach</h1>

<p>I have used this approach a few times however some people will warn you that it is possible to damage the chuck doing this. Certainly there can be cosmetic damage but I have older drill so this does not bother me. </p>

<p>For this you will need a set of locking, tongue and groove or interlocking pliers to grip the chuck and a drill bit just like in the previous solution. As <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/users/91/keshlam"">keshlam</a> points out a strap wrench would also work. </p>

<p>Use the pliers to grab the chuck. If you are worried about the jaws marking up the drill you can use a spare glove, piece of leather or something similar to wrap around the chuck first. </p>

<p>Place the drill bit in one of the chuck key holes. Again, use a glove when holding the bit so you don't slice you hand.</p>

<p>Once the have the above all set then it is just a matter of holding the bit still so that use can use the pliers to rotate the chuck. You can also move both simultaneously... doesn't really matter. Just whatever feels comfortable. That's it. </p>

"What woods take stain well?","14769","","<p>I'm just getting into woodworking, and I have a number of relatively simple projects (end tables, boxes, bookshelves, etc) that I would like to make, but I want them to match.  Water based stain is super cheap and comes in many colors, but I know that it won't work all that well on pine because it ends up splotchy.  So what woods work well for staining?  In particular,  I'd like to see a chart of woods from most to least splotchy, if that makes sense.

All are excellent sources of information. I would start with Minwax's guide-- it has great layout and is very beginner friendly.</p>

<p>In general, woods with tight grains don't take stain well. The stain will not penetrate maple well, for example.</p>

<p>They're usually in the form of pegs with a lip that sit in the pre-drilled dog holes and act as a stop. In the picture you included in your post, the brass pegs are the bench dogs. Note that they have a flat milled face to provide a better clamping surface. Other versions of wooden or plastic dogs are often square.</p>

<p>The reason there are multiple dog holes is so that varying length boards can be secured by selecting the right set of holes.</p>

It is thought to be derived from how a dog (the animal) can bite and hold something. Add on that it's used in a bench, and there you have it. (I still like my explanation better.)</p>

"Is a plunge router suitable for router table work?","14165","","<p>I mounted my plunge router to a new router table this weekend.  I discovered very quickly that it is difficult to adjust the router bit height, as the springs (the very heavy springs!) end up fighting my efforts.  Yes, I can use the micro-adjustment mechanism, but due to the awkwardness, I basically ended up taking the router and insert plate out of the table every time I wanted to make a change.</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong?  Is it okay to use my plunge router on my router table?  Is it safe?</p>
","<p>As others have said, yes it will work, but but...</p>

<p>1) It's more common to mount a fixed-depth base in the table, and switch the router motor between that and a plunge base for other work. Fixed bases are relatively cheap, which makes dedicating one to this purpose a good choice, and many routers are available as kits with one base of each type precisely for that reason. And it's a lot easier to move a motor unit from base to base than to attach and detach the base from the table or plate every time you switch modes of operation.</p>

<p>2) The advantages of a plunge base mostly don't apply when using a router table. The use of a table plate as a baseplate defeats many of the advantages of working handheld</p>

<p>3) Commercial router lifts generally don't use the manufacturer's base at all; they act as another base and you mount the motor directly in them. Homebrew lifts may do that or may use a base, but generally if they use a base it will be the fixed base.</p>

"How can I hollow out a square hole in a solid piece of wood to make a box?","14163","","<p>I recently made the main body of a box by taking a solid piece of wood and drilling out the inside with the largest drill bit I had. </p>

<p>I used the drill over and over until I had a squarish hole inside by accumulation of round holes. Then I took a chisel to the inside edges to knock off chunks. Finally I dremmeled and sanded. I didn't have a perfect cube of air inside my cube of wood - but it wasn't too bad. Just a lot of work and it felt amateurish. There must be a better way.</p>

<p>How can I hollow out a square hole in a solid piece of wood to make a box?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>How can I hollow out a square hole in a solid piece of wood to make a box?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are multiple ways this might be done, going back to a stone-age method where you'd burn out the hollow, but there are two main methods I think would be employed today depending on the philosophy or preference of the individual.</p>

<p><strong>'By hand'</strong><br>
The first manual method is actually exactly what you describe doing: drill out the bulk of the material and then clean up with a chisel (followed by use of hand-held router if a flat bottom is desired). So it is not an amateurish method at all. For example on almost all craftsman-made traditional oilstone boxes the recess for the stone was created in exactly this way as can be seen if you lift the stone: the flat bottom will almost invariable be peppered with holes from the lead screw of an auger or the spur in the centre of a Forstner bit used to hog out most of the material.</p>

<p>Boxes were not commonly made this way in the past, but square recesses or let-ins were; for lock bodies, hidden compartments and for mortises in mortise-and-tenon joinery of course, and I think it's likely this would have been one of only two methods used.</p>

<p>The only main difference today is that most would use a power drill to do the drilling, although doing it with a brace is still just as viable.</p>

<p>The other main manual method is pure hand work, that would be to cut the hole by chisel only. Obviously this represents <em>a lot</em> of effort and it's by no means the best way, but it is feasible if it was the only option open to the woodworker.</p>

<p><strong>Router</strong><br>
Today of course we have power tools so it's likely that a lot of modern-day woodworkers would choose to use a router for this. </p>

<p>There's more than one way to do this with a router. Firstly careful freehand work could be used to remove most of the wood, followed by clean up with a sharp chisel or two just as if you'd drilled many holes. Secondly by running the router against a number of battens or straightedges clamped firmly in place. And thirdly by creating a template which a bearing on a suitable bit would ride against, allowing the cutting of the full shape in one operation. In the second and third case round corners would result, which could be left if liked (not just for aesthetics, they make the corners of the box stronger) or squared up with chisels if preferred.</p>

<p>In case it needs to be stated if a router is used especially on a small box the workpiece <em>must</em> be very securely held to the table as the potential for it to be launched across the shop is high. </p>

<p>Note: for best results it's best to gauge or knife the perimeter of the recess to help ensure a clean, crisp edge is left after work. Even using a router this can help but it's almost mandatory when using hand methods.</p>

<p><strong>""Cheating""</strong><br>
There's another method to consider if it wouldn't harm the aesthetics as you see them: make the body of the box in two pieces. </p>

<p>One of the main challenges with this is forming the flat bottom, this method sidesteps that difficulty entirely. The main body of the box is one thicker piece of wood which you can drill straight through. After you're done cleaning up the edges you simply glue on a thin piece of wood for the base. </p>

<p>If you want it to look like the box was hollowed this base piece is sawn from the wood used for the body, and with some luck with the grain directed and care taken with the glue-up once glued back on the join can be virtually invisible. This is slightly easier on darker woods, more difficult on light-coloured woods.</p>

<p>I was thinking along the lines of using a hammer to drive a flat head screw driver in there and prying them away.
Any one with a more professional suggestion?</p>
","<p>If there is one thing I'm proficient at its pallet teardown. You have lots of options. It does all depend on the style of pallet you are working with and it some cases its wood composition (hard, soft, pine, oak.....). </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.albionpallets.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Pallet-Types.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pallet Styles http://www.albionpallets.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Pallet-Types.png</a></p>

<p>For argument sake lets say you are not using the close boarded types. </p>

<h1>Just a hammer</h1>

<p>Some pallets rely on gravity to hold them together. Putting the pallet up on its side and hitting boards from the bottom can also work. This is truer for staple assembled boards but it can work. Also helps if there is a block of wood to absorb the direct impact and distribute the force more evenly.</p>

<h1>Pallet Wrecking Bar.</h1>

<p>In some of the more open pallet styles a great way to save as much wood as possible is to use a pallet wrecker tool. You can <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Pallet-Breaker/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">make your own</a> and there are several now that are <a href=""http://www.cargo-cycles.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">commercially available</a>. They all work on the same principal. I had a welder make one for me with some spare angle and square iron I had lying around. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/g8Zuc.png"" alt=""Pallet breaker tool""></p>

<p>In your searched you can find plenty of variations of this tool. This works great at putting even pressure as close to the nails as possible to pry the board away from the pallet. <strong>Super Important</strong> make sure if you use something like this that you pry the board from the outside then the middle else you risk a board flying towards your face (<em>seriously</em>. I have smacked my face a couple of times thinking it wouldn't happen). Also, its hard to describe but you need to be sure you place your body on top of the pallet to counter the force you will be putting on it while you use a bar. You want the pallet, minus the board you are removing, to be immobile as much as possible. </p>

<h1>Using Weighted Blocks</h1>

<p>Before I made my own tool I used the technique from this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7oWaRPpdKU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">video</a>. It involves raising the pallet off the ground and resting a block of sorts under the board you are trying to remove. Then, dropping a large heavy object beside that board to push the pallet down thereby raising the board that was propped. <strong>Note</strong>: Your need to be very careful with your back doing this as there is a lot of heavy lifting. LIFT WITH YOUR KNEES!</p>

<p>Referencing the picture below you can see the brick underneath the board to be removed. The large block of concrete will be dropped on the smaller brick on top of the pallet (<em>beside</em> the board to be removed). That brick prevents the concrete block from damaging the pallet. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uOXCI.png"" alt=""Man with block""></p>

<h1>Tools to have on hand regardless</h1>

<p><sup>Mostly because you will have nails left over somewhere</sup></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Long pry bar</strong>: Removing nails from runners and stringers is much easier if you have more leverage. I use a 5 foot pry bar and they pop right out. </li>
<li><strong>Vicegrips</strong>: For when you have stubborn nails or if you pop the heads off when trying to remove them</li>
<li><strong>Crescent Impact Nail Puller</strong>: Another approach for stubborn nails. Very likely with hardwood pallets.</li>
<li><strong>Saw Horses</strong>: Might seem obvious but if you manage to get boards of clean nails can come with them. Using a hammer and some sawhorses is nicer to your back. </li>
</ol>

<h1>Cop out.</h1>

<p>Depending on the quality of the boards and how ""nail happy"" the assembler was lots of people just use a circular saw for the outside (close to the runner or stringer) to get the boards out. Still have to address the nails in the middle using one of the above methods. Your yield will be shorter boards but your risk for splits and cracks goes to null.</p>

<p>This video boasts easy pallet disassembly by just using a reciprocating saw to cuts the nails out entirely. This would leave nails in the stringers and boards so you need be careful of the next tools you use with that wood. </p>

"How do I properly dispose of a solvent like mineral turpentine?","12681","","<p>I have been using some mineral turpentine to clean paintbrushes and it's gotten quite dirty (it also got all gel-like, I think there was something else in the container it reacted with). Since these solvents are pretty toxic, how do I dispose of it correctly?</p>
","<p>Local regulations about how to dispose of small quantities of solvent vary widely, so expect that Answers may be only guides to how you <em>might</em> be able to do it where you live. </p>

<p><strong>Don't throw it out if it's still usable</strong><br>
Contaminated spirits is still potentially useful as-is for certain 'dirty jobs' like degreasing and cleaning up of old tools, engine parts etc. </p>

<p>I keep a jar of dirty spirits for precisely this reason, carefully labelled so I don't accidentally try to clean a brush in it. It has a little Vaseline, liquid paraffin (mineral oil) and various unknown lubricants dissolved in it from rinsing and cleaning of new and old tool parts and as far as I can tell it works just as well as fresh, clean spirits.</p>

<p><strong>Keeping it going</strong><br>
In addition to the above, dissolved contaminants will usually settle out of solution over time. Let dirty spirits sit in a jar for a while (a few days to a week or more) and see if the stuff will separate to a discrete layer on the bottom. It usually will, then you can decant the 'clean' spirits off the top. </p>

<p>If anyone reading needs to do this on a larger scale see the pic posted at bottom.</p>

<p>In theory spirits can be kept going indefinitely this way. If you never top up there will come a point when it becomes too dirty to continue to use (it will be in effect very dilute varnish) but even then, simply decanting to a fresh container and diluting with fresh spirits can be all that's needed for the gunk to settle out. To be frank though the volume is so low at that point that few would mind the waste of throwing it out, or otherwise disposing of it — see next point. </p>

<p>If you use the settling method you're left with a small amount of sludge in the bottom of the container (it can literally be just a spoonful or two from a large jar used to rinse brushes all year) which can be disposed of safely in your regular rubbish collection. It is safe, but may or may not be legal depending on where you live and how OTT the safety regs are there (anyone living in California, we feel your pain) but it should be legal to do this everywhere because <em>the residue can't be any more toxic than the original paint and/or varnish was</em>. So as odd as it might seem residue like this is no more or less dangerous than any dirty paintbrushes or rollers, paper towels or wiping rags used in the painting or varnishing process, and of course most people wouldn't even think ""toxic waste"" when disposing of those.</p>

<p><strong>If you still want to get rid of it but aren't sure how</strong><br>
This is going to horrify some people but a viable alternative approach for the typical small volumes of solvent we're talking about here is just to put it outside to evaporate (under cover as needed so pets etc. can't get to it). </p>

<p>This does sound environmentally very suspect but compared to industrial/commercial output of solvent vapours the amount of pollution this represents is irrelevant — even collectively for every leisure woodworker in the world, the amount would be insignificant on a global scale. </p>

<hr>

<p>If you need to work through a large volume of contaminated spirits on a regular basis you might want to rig up something similar to the below to make the settling and decanting processes a little more efficient:</p>

","<p>Less than thread diameter (8mm), minimum inner shaft diameter. The larger you go the easier it'll be to screw in but the less the threads will bite. Go as small as you can muster without splitting the wood.</p>

<p>For coach screws in particular, since you wanted a chart, <a href=""http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/91756.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this may give you confidence</a> (this isn't metric but the concepts are the same):</p>

","<p>If you call up Freud and ask, they'll tell you that you want one full tooth to clear the top of the wood, but no more. </p>

<p>There are a couple of reasons for that recommendation- first is safety. A tooth that clears the surface on the up swing then re-enters on the down swing may not follow the same planar path due to harmonics and vibration related physics. A tooth that is held firmly by the material it is cutting is less likely to catch.</p>

<p>The reason why you want a whole tooth to extend through the work surface has to do with the shape of a tooth and debris clearance. Circular saw blade teeth (even carbide ones) are often wider at the tip than they are at the base. This tapering allows for less binding and cleaner cuts than a straight tooth would.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_warping"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> has a nice primer on specific types of defects in wood which fall under the blanket term of warping:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/t3346.png"" alt=""common types of wood warping""></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>bow</strong> : a warp along the length of the face of the wood</li>
<li><strong>crook</strong>: (also called wain) a warp along the length of the edge of the wood</li>
<li><strong>kink</strong>: a localized crook, often due to a knot</li>
<li><strong>cup</strong>: a warp across the width of the face, in which the edges are higher or lower than the center of the wood</li>
<li><strong>twist</strong>: a distortion in which the two ends do not lie on the same plane</li>
</ul>

<p>Your strategy for dealing with a warp will vary depending on the specific type and severity of the defect. For less severe defects, you may be able to simply make the lumber square, flat, and straight.</p>

<p>In the best-case scenario, you joint one face and edge on the jointer, then rip the other edge parallel on the table saw and flatten the other face parallel with the first on the planer.</p>

<p>However, at each step along the way, you necessarily sacrifice some of the wood's thickness and/or width.</p>

<p>A board could be so badly bowed or twisted that there wouldn't be anything left if you tried to joint it straight. But if the components of your project require shorter boards anyway, you can crosscut a bowed or twisted board into shorter pieces, each of which may be flat enough that it does not require much jointing and planing to make it flat and straight.</p>

<p>Another option with a bowed board is to either resaw it or cut it into shorter sections (depending on whether length or thickness is more important, respectively), laminate the pieces (glue them together, one on top another), then joint and plane them. Just be aware of any internal stresses that you may be adding to the finished board, and try to avoid a glue-up that requires massive amounts of clamping force to close up gaps between the boards.</p>

<p>If you have a board with a crook or kink, you may be able to rip one edge straight, then trim and glue the offcuts onto the opposite side.</p>

<p>If your board is cupped, you have multiple options depending on whether it's more important to preserve the thickness or width of the board.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the cup is fairly shallow, you can joint and plane it.</li>
<li>If the cup is severe and simply jointing one face and planing the other parallel would make the board too thin, you can rip it into strips first. Each strip will have a less severe cup then the original board, so you can joint and plane the faces of each strip individually, then joint the edges and glue the strips back together into a panel.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have some combination of defects, you may have to employ several strategies to get workable pieces of stock out of a warped board. Whichever strategies you use, make sure you are practicing safe techniques. Also beware of any internal stresses that may be released as you cut a warped board, as they can result in binding, fragmentation, and/or kickback depending on the tool.</p>

<p>Again, some defects are easier to remedy than others, and even once you've remedied the problem it may return depending on the properties of the board. It's good to be familiar with the <a href=""http://www.finewoodworking.com/how-to/video/the-basics-of-flatsawn-riftsawn-and-quartersawn-wood.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">differences between quartersawn, plainsawn, and riftsawn boards</a> and each type of cut's inherent movement properties.</p>

"What kind of wood dust is toxic/dangerous and requires usage of dust mask?","11217","","<p>I have a dust mask but I wonder if it is worth wearing when working on pine wood. I do wear it when working a piece of oak or beech.</p>

<p>Would you consider cutting some wood species without a mask safe? Do you use a mask with every wood species? How long does dangerous dust stay in the air?</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>I've a dust mask but I wonder if it worth wearing it when working on
  pine wood. I do wear it when working a piece oak or beech.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First off, let's be clear: a disposable paper dust mask may be slightly better than nothing, but even a fancy $5 disposable P100 dust mask with a breathing valve will not perform as well as a properly-fitted respirator with replaceable P100 filters. If you have a beard, you should consider a positive-pressure respirator since a normal respirator may not be able to make a good seal with your skin.</p>

<p>Some woods are more toxic than others, and some people are more sensitive than others to certain types of wood. The <a href=""http://www.wood-database.com/wood-articles/wood-allergies-and-toxicity/"">Wood Database</a> contains toxicity information for many types of wood, including possible symptoms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would you consider cutting some wood species wood without mask safe ?
  Do you use mask with every wood species ? how long dangerous dust stay
  in the air ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I consider cutting any wood without a respirator unsafe, regardless of species. The length of time dust remains in the air will vary, but I've seen at least one magazine article recommend continuing to wear a respirator for at least 30 minutes after you stop producing sawdust in that room, assuming the air is not disturbed by a fan or air handling system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, is mask still necessary when using a central dust collector ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Would you rather have your lungs or a respirator filter the particles out of the air?</p>

<p>If you want to err on the side of safety, you need a properly-fitted respirator with P100 filter cartridges. Few, if any, dust collectors are capable of capturing 100% of the dust at every tool (it also depends on the tool's design), and very few dust collectors provide filtration adequate for removing sub-micron particles. Most inexpensive consumer-grade dust collectors only filter down to 1, 5, or even 30 microns. A dust collector outfitted with this type of filter will simply recirculate the sub-micron particles through the air, allowing them to increase in concentration as you continue to work.</p>

<p>If exhausting your dust collector to the outdoors is a practical option, you may want to consider that rather than spending a lot of money on HEPA-rated dust collector filters. The obvious drawback is that you will also exhaust all of your warm air in the winter and all your cool air in the summer. Also be certain to include an air inlet if exhausting outside. Otherwise, your dust collector won't work as effectively; and worse, negative pressure inside your shop can cause the combustion gases from a water heater or furnace sharing the same space to be pulled back into the space--for example, if your shop is inside your basement.</p>

"Is it better to store wood vertically or horizontally?","10883","","<p>Is it better to store wood vertically or horizontally? What are the pros and cons associated with both methods?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Is it better to store wood vertically or horizontally?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends a bit on the status of the wood when you store it, <strong>but generally it's better to store wood horizontally.</strong></p>

<p>When storing wood, you have to consider three of the major forces at work: moisture, heat, and gravity.</p>

<p>The moisture content of wood is ever-changing, generally starting from an oversaturated state when freshly-cut to a ""dry"" state when the wood reaches equilibrium with the ambient air.  This is influenced a lot by heat.  Warm air can absorb a lot more moisture than cold air (this is why winter air feels dry, even at almost 100% humidity, but 100% humid warm air feels like walking through a swimming pool).</p>

<p>When you store wood, you leave it subject to these first two forces, which are always at play (unless you live in a magical world with constant heat and humidity).  When initially drying wood, the third force, gravity, really comes into play.</p>

<p>Stacking and stickering wood is widely recognized as the best means of seasoning wood.  You'll notice in the image below that the wood is horizontal, with evenly-spaced <em>stickers</em> separating the layers of lumber.  These provide airflow between the layers for even drying.  The stickers are all placed at the same location at each elevation of the stack so that the weight of the lumber is transferred directly down the stack to the supports.  This reduces the bending in the wood, which means it comes out straighter when finally dry.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tzrq9.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tzrq9.jpg"" alt=""stickering""></a><br>
<sup>(source: <a href=""http://northernwoodlands.org/articles/article/lumber-pile"" rel=""noreferrer"">NorthernWooodlands.org</a>)</sup></p>

<p>Wood is much more pliable when wet, thus this sort of stacking scheme is crucial when drying lumber.  Once you dry a board in a deformed shape, it's hard to get it back to straight.</p>

<p>If you stack boards vertically, they have a tendency to bow or sag, simply due to the weight of the board.  Again, during the initial drying, this can be downright disastrous.</p>

<hr>

<p>Once you get wood nice and dry (seasoned), it makes less of a difference how you stack it (horizontal vs. vertical).  Most hardwood dealers I've been to arrange their stacks vertically since it's easier to pick through the boards, though they usually have pretty quick turnaround on their stock.  At home, I usually stack boards however is more convenient for the space since I generally work with kiln-dried lumber.  However, most wood I buy is 3/4 or thicker, so bowing isn't usually an issue in the short term.  For long-term storage, horizontal is the way that I go.</p>

<p>Assuming you're working with seasoned lumber, I expect that unless you plan on storing the boards for a long period or time or the boards are thin (less than 1/2"", say), it shouldn't make too much of a difference whether you store them horizontally or vertically.  Thinner boards I would tend to stack horizontally, but thicker slabs will be fine stored vertically.</p>

"How do you plane end grain?","10794","","<p>I tend to like power tools, because I need a lot less 'skill' to get the same quality product.  However, I do like learning hand tool techniques and sometimes they are just as good or better than power tools.  Sometimes faster if you only have one or two 'pieces' to do, instead of setting up the power tools to do it.</p>

<p>So I keep catching comments in different places about planing end grain.  Do you need special planes?  Special technique?  Just use a beltsander? :)</p>

<p>What kind of plane and how do you use it (them) to plane the end grain of a board and are there any gotchas to look out for?</p>
","<p>In Western woodworking at least low-angle block planes are favoured for planing end grain. These will generally give the best result, but any plane can do it if the iron is sharp enough and you take a very light cut. </p>

<p>Terminology note: a plane's blade is traditionally referred to as an iron, in older books sometimes as the cutter. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>are there any gotchas to look out for?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, tearout of the long grain at the edge of the board is always a concern. There are three common ways of dealing with this. </p>

<p>The first is to plane in from both ends, but I find this least satisfactory because you tend to see an obvious difference in the finish of the end grain when planed from opposing directions.</p>

<p>The second is possibly the simplest and most effective, which is to clamp a piece of scrap wood onto the edge of the board which supports the long grain at the end of the cut. This is the method I favour personally.</p>

<p>The above techniques are shown in this image.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hKLrl.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The third method is to plane a small chamfer onto the end of the board, then plane down to meet it. </p>

<p>Another general tip that can help regardless of the technique used is to dampen the end grain, which makes it softer and therefore easier to shear through. You can use water, although you risk raising the grain on the faces of the board, so some woodworkers use denatured alcohol.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just use a beltsander? :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joking aside that isn't the worst way to deal with finishing end grain on a board, as long as you can hold the 90° angle accurately. Although you will commonly want to sand beyond the grit that belts are available in.</p>

"How does one properly mount a breadboard end?","10702","","<p>Given the below design which really violates the mechanical use for a breadboard, assuming that I were otherwise building a farmhouse table with pocket screws, what would be the appropriate way to mount a functional breadboard end in this scenario?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XWZ9q.jpg"" alt=""picture of false breadboard end""></p>
","<p>I can think of a couple options for mounting a breadboard, which you will have to adapt to suit your tools and skill set:</p>

<li><p>Use biscuits to join the breadboard to the rest of the top (not necessarily the best option since you have a continuous glue line across the width of the top) (source: <a href=""http://www.popularwoodworking.com/wp-content/uploads/9855_5F00_061.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Popular Woodworking</a>)

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bY4lu.jpg"" alt=""M&amp;T""></p></li>

<p>As you probably know, when you make the joint, you want to keep the width-wise expansion of the top in mind so that the breadboard ends don't crack the top.  This usually means you positively-attach the breadboards in the middle (with glue or fasteners) and allow the ends to float.</p>

"What kind/style of respirator is appropriate for someone with a beard?","10526","","<p>In <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/353/what-kind-of-wood-dust-is-toxic-dangerous-and-requires-usage-of-dust-mask/355#355"">this answer</a>, it is noted that a woodworker with a beard should consider a positive airflow respirator due to the beard preventing a good seal. I have also seen (on metalworking forums) the suggestion of a full face respirator.</p>

<p>How much does having a beard affect the effectiveness of a ""normal"" respirator like this one?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/v2KGF.jpg"" alt=""Respirator""></p>
","<p>A beard will cause leakage around a standard half-mask ""passive"" respirator. The respirator's effectiveness will vary depending on how thick your beard is and how tightly the respirator fits over your beard, but keep in mind that air will follow the path of least resistance. Your beard won't provide anywhere near the filtration of a P100 cartridge which removes 99.97% of particles 0.3 microns and larger. Some air will probably still pass through the filter, but if it's easier for the air to flow through your beard than through the respirator's filter, the respirator won't be very effective.</p>

<p>You should consider using a positive pressure respirator, also called a Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR). This type of respirator pulls air in through a filter and exhausts the filtered air inside the respirator, producing continuous outward leakage.</p>

"What is the difference between a sabre saw and a jig saw","10478","","<p>This is more out of curiosity. I came across the term <code>sabre saw</code> and tried to figure out what it was. </p>

<p>Searching the internet turned up results for both a jigsaw:</p>

<p>...and a reciprocating saw:</p>

<p>This leads me to wonder if <em>sabre</em> is a descriptive word to describe a reciprocating blade mechanism found in both jig saws and reciprocating saws. Or is it another type of saw?</p>
","<p>Questions like this will lead to contradictory answers. There are some main points I would like to make to aid in everyone's answers. </p>

<h1>Experience</h1>

<p>Experience plays this role very well. As you are introduced to tools you will typically accept what you are being taught. If my dad handed me a jigsaw and called it a <em>Lemon Mutilator</em> that is what I would have called it. </p>

<h1>Location</h1>

<p>I had mentioned this in comments but your region plays a big part in this. A simple example would be: trunk and boot. They are the same thing but it depends which word you use in which region (US and UK respectively). </p>

<h1>Time</h1>

<p>Time also changes things. I had a question about quarter-sawn lumber and the meaning of that term meant something different decades ago. If you asked wood workers of different generations what a piece of quarter-sawn lumber was they could give you two different answers that are both right. </p>

<h1>The ""Sabre"" Saw</h1>

<p>I have a theory that both of the saws you have pictures are the spiritual ancestors of the ""sabre saw"". As the tools evolved into their respective uses, intricate and rough, the naming might have become convoluted. </p>

<p>I would like to come to <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/1424/128"">CharlieHorse</a>'s defense at this point. I found an old advertisement for a Weller Sabre Saw. Its the tool Mr. Mantle is holding. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VUTtN.jpg"" alt=""Old Advert""></p>

<p>If you look it is making intricate cuts much like a jigsaw would. Modern jigsaws don't have the same design as they do in that picture. Those changes might have driven the name change as well (<strong>Warning</strong>: This sentence contains speculation). Mostly trying to show that time changes things. </p>

<p>Here is another one just to show that its not just one manufacturer.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GXhv9.png"" alt=""Another Ad""></p>

<h1>At the End of the Day</h1>

<p>I have always seen the tool above, in your question, as a jigsaw and the other a reciprocating saw. Until today I have never even heard the phrase Sabre Saw. If it gives context I am 33 at the time of writing this. </p>

<p>What kind of wood would you recommend and what would be the best way to build it?</p>

<p>I am guessing it would need to be reinforced from the back?</p>
","<p>Generally-speaking, you can use whatever type of wood and finish appeal to you.</p>

<p>Depending on your application, you may want the door to be either lighter or heavier. If the door is closing off a movie room, you may want a more solid, thicker, heavier door to better absorb and deaden the sound. Of course, if you really want to block sound, you'll probably also want to seal off gaps around the doorway between the wall and the door.</p>

<p>If the door is simply closing off the kitchen from the hallway and you will need to frequently open and close it but preventing sound from passing through is not a major concern, you may prefer some more lightweight type of construction.</p>

<p>The metal straps in your picture may be critical to the door's structure, but it's highly likely they are only aesthetic. Ideally you would drill oval horizontal holes in the faux metal straps, cover the holes with washers, and avoid overtightening the screws. This will allow the wood to expand and contract across the width of the door (across the grain, as pictured) as the humidity changes with the seasons.</p>

<p><strong>Solid wood</strong></p>

<p>You can assemble the door panel <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/241/49"">as you would any typical panel or tabletop</a>, then install the faux metal straps for visual enhancement.</p>

<p>If you use solid wood, quartersawn lumber will be less prone to warping. If you prefer the appearance of flatsawn/plainsawn lumber, be sure to alternate the end grain as discussed in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/241/49"">https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/241/49</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Plywood/MDF</strong></p>

<p>You could build the door using plywood or MDF (or even MDF-core plywood), using veneers that give the appearance of a solid wood panel, if preferred. If you use plywood, be sure to use a high-quality, many-ply type of plywood such as Baltic birch.</p>

<p><strong>Torsion box</strong></p>

I am wondering (assuming I have my choice of plugin's in a shop) is one better than the other.  I've heard that 220 will actually use less energy and be easier on the motor.  </p>

<p>If I can convert to 220, should I?  Is it more efficient and easier on the electric motors?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I am wondering (assuming I have my choice of plugin's in a shop) is one better than the other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It all comes down to wattage. P = IR; i.e., Power (Watts) = Amps * Voltage. If a given tool draws 14A on a 120V circuit, the same tool will draw 7A on a 240V circuit. The more amps you send through a wire, the thicker (higher gauge) the wire you need, as touched upon by Steven. Your tool will draw the same wattage whether it's wired for 120V or 240V.</p>

<p>Let me run through the rest of your question's components before coming back to the first part of your question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've heard that 220 will actually use less energy...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason we use high voltage transmission lines for power distribution is that power is transmitted more efficiently over long distances at high voltage. For a given amount of power, you'll lose a certain percentage due to the resistance in the line itself. As current (amperage) increases, the resistance increases (resulting in a voltage drop--giving you an overall power loss), but if we decrease the current and increase the voltage, we can transmit the same amount of power with less line loss.</p>

<p>That said, for all practical purposes, if you're running 1-phase power in a hobby shop or even a small production shop, the line losses from your breaker box to the tool will be insignificant and it won't make a noticeable difference whether you're running 120V (110V) or 240V (220V). Your electric bill will be the same either way.</p>

<p>One might be inclined to think that you should be using less energy because you're drawing fewer amps, but you're actually drawing power on one hot 120V leg and returning it on another hot 120V leg which is 180 degrees of phase with the first. The phase offset effectively doubles the voltage differential between the source and return, giving you 240V. A convenient (though technically incorrect) way to think about it in terms of what you see at your electric meter is that you're ""drawing"" that many amps from two 120V legs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...and be easier on the motor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not so sure about this, but I doubt it. Maybe this is a misunderstanding of the difference between differences between different types of motors, or single-phase vs. 3-phase motors.</p>

<p>A 3-phase motor is simpler in design than a 1-phase motor because, as Steven mentioned in his answer, the 3-phase motor does not require a separate starter coil. 3-phase motors are also considered inherently more reliable by design.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I can convert to 220, should I? Is it more efficient and easier on the electric motors?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If all your existing equipment does what you need it to do on 120V and you don't need any other equipment, there isn't really a compelling reason to install 240V circuits and switch your equipment over. However, if you plan on upgrading your table saw from a 1.5hp motor to a 3hp motor, for example, you will need to run it on a 240V circuit.</p>

<p>When you're shopping for tools, you'll often see that a tool can be wired to run on either 120V or 240V. If it's advertised as being 120V-capable, be sure to also check the amperage.</p>

<p>Usually for 120V, you need a 15A or 20A circuit. The maximum load allowed by code on a 20A circuit is actually 16A. Usually if the tool draws more than 16A, a 240V circuit is recommended since 120V circuits greater than 20A are not commonly installed in residential construction (at least, in the US). Upgrading a circuit from 20A to 30A isn't as simple as swapping out a breaker and receptacle, because to carry more amps, you also need a thicker wire.</p>

<p>Getting back to tool and voltage options--some tools, such as a bandsaw I was looking at a while back, are advertised as 120V/240V. However, in the case of that bandsaw, the tool actually required a 30A circuit in order to run on 120V. If you ever look at a tool like this and have to install a new circuit anyway, it makes more sense to go with the 240V circuit because it's more common to have a tool that's certified to run on 240V than one that's certified to run on a 30A, 120V circuit.</p>

"Is there a reference for how much weight a dowel rod can support before breaking?","9399","","<p>I realize I am still in the beginning phase of designing this but I want to make a guitar wall hanger.

Since even the most expensive dowels are vastly cheaper than the even the cheapest guitars, I want the dowels to be strong enough to not shear off while the guitar is hanging.  SO, is there a reference for how much weight a dowel will hold when inserted into a board?  If it helps, I doubt the dowel on the finished piece will be longer than 3 inches sticking out from the wall, and the guitar will likely be inserted as far back on the dowels as possible.

"Riving knife options for table saws which came with splitters?","9110","","<p>Many older table saws came equipped with a splitter, which is not as <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/21/how-do-i-prevent-dangerous-kickback-on-a-table-saw"">safe as a riving knife</a>. I have one such saw, a Powermatic 64, but there are many others.</p>

<p>What are some options for equipping a riving knife on to a table saw which came with a splitter, but not a riving knife?</p>
","<p>Since 2009, every new saw sold in the US is required to include a riving knife. However, prior to 2009, many saws had traditional splitters which are not as effective at preventing kickback as riving knives, as discussed in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/q/1013/49"">What is the difference between a riving knife and a splitter on a table saw?</a> (which you also referenced in your question).</p>

<p>If you do have an older saw, your options will vary based on the popularity of your saw, but there are at least a couple commercially-available aftermarket riving knife options on the market; for example:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.theborkstore.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BORK</a> (Bolt-On Ripping Knife)</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.thesharkguard.com/sharksplitter.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Shark Guard</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You also mentioned these in the original version of your question, and I haven't run across any other commercially-available aftermarket riving knives that I recall.</p>

<p>In addition to commercially-available options, some people have also crafted their own custom riving knives for their older saws.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://workshop.electronsmith.com/content/making-my-own-riving-knife/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://workshop.electronsmith.com/content/making-my-own-riving-knife/</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.garymkatz.com/ToolReviews/riving_knife.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.garymkatz.com/ToolReviews/riving_knife.html</a> - In this example, it looks like the saw basically had support for a riving knife already but probably only included a riving knife-style splitter with a permanently-attached blade guard. Many saws sold today include either a standalone riving knife and separate riving knife-style splitter with integrated blade guard and anti-kickback pawls, or a convertible riving knife with a blade guard and anti-kickback pawls which can both be easily added and removed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on one <a href=""http://ggober.com/shop/p66splitter.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> I found, it seems the design of the arbor assembly on the original Powermatic 66 cannot be modified to accommodate a true riving knife, which raises, lowers, and tilts with the blade. If you cannot retrofit a riving knife on your older saw, there is a less convenient but somewhat viable workaround. This involves making several zero-clearance throat plates, each with an integrated splitter at a different location based on the hight of the saw blade. In addition to custom solutions, there is at least one commercially-manufactured option.</p>

<p>The obvious downside is that you basically need a separate throat plate for roughly each height you want to cut, and even then you can only handle cuts with the blade set to 90 degrees. Perhaps you could also make custom integrated splitter throat plates for other angles, but it may not be practical or advisable.

<ul>

<li><p>Is it before I join the pieces, or after once everything is assembled?</p></li>
</ul>
","<p>I recommend you apply any finishing products before final assembly, but after any gluing or other permanent assembly.</p>

<p>Surfaces that are going to be glued together don't need (and shouldn't have) finish as this will weaken the bond, and the glue itself and adjoining wood should protect the wood (choose a suitable glue for the environment).</p>

<p>Surfaces that will never be taken apart but will not be glued (some joinery, for instance) probably don't need finishing prior to joining them. This is a gray area, and will depend on the joint. The primary goal is that exposed wood that isn't intentionally exposed will be protected.</p>

<p>However, other parts that are fit together using other fastening methods should be finished before assembly.  Even small spaces admit moist air, and those spaces may expand or contract based on humidity, so may admit water or other environmental contaminants.  Without protection on the interior facing pieces of the wood you risk visible damage over time in some environments.</p>

<p>Finishing as a step to preserve the wood in the environment it is going to be placed should help guide your decision as to when to finish.  If you do it solely for looks, you may be happy with the results if you perform it after assembly, but time may show that protection should have been your goal during finishing, and not just looks.</p>

"Why are metal lathes not used for woodturning?","8364","","<p>I'm an engineer and have designed several parts that are made on metal lathes.  I'm wondering why metal lathes aren't used for turning.  In particular I'm wondering why woodturners don't use a tool holder on a stage or tools that resemble metal lathe tools.  What is the advantage to manually holding your tools and using a tool rest?  Without knowing much about woodturning I would assume that it's next to impossible to get repeatable/super accurate results (or perhaps better stated I'd assume it must take years of experience to get the hand eye coordination down to get good results).  Perhaps the ""one of a kind"" nature of the process is part of the appeal?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I'm wondering why metal lathes aren't used for [wood]turning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my mind, it comes down to 3 Cs: cost, convenience, and creativity.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> From what I've seen metal lathes cost more than wood lathes when you consider similar capacities and features.  This is not surprising given the additional tooling necessary to work a metal lathe.  One might argue that buying woodturning tools can also be expensive compared to buying HSS or cobalt metal lathe keys.  However, the metal keys still need to be ground to different shapes to achieve different profiles, so there is still plenty of cost associated with the metal lathe tools.</p>

<p><strong>Convenience:</strong>  Setting up a metal lathe can be a pain, especially compared to a wood lathe.  You have to get your tooling set up all in the right places and adjust your tools to feed in the proper direction, at the proper rate.  Wood lathes, you just chuck your piece, set the tool rest, and go.</p>

<p><strong>Creativity:</strong>  I challenge any metal lathe user to create a Windsor chair leg more efficiently than an experienced turner.  Sure, the metal lathe user could make the first one and set up a template for his keys to follow, but I suspect that doing so would result in a fairly rough finish with a lot of woods.  Good turners can make a chair leg that's finish-ready (no sanding) with just a skew chisel.</p>

<p>Having manual control of the cutting tool means that you can feel when the wood is having issues cutting, which could be a sign that it's about to fail, that your edge is dull, or that you're just using the wrong cutting angle.  You're more intimate with the actual piece and can better feel what's going on, instead of plugging it into a machine.</p>

<p>Also, with the cutting tool in your hands, you can much more easily make changes to your design on the fly just by flicking your wrist (this is an exaggeration, don't flick your wrist when turning or you'll suffer a catch).  I know the way I work a lathe, having to have a metal lathe tooling setup have to play catchup to my brain's creativity would be incredibly frustrating.</p>

<hr>

<p>It's worth noting that one may combine both worlds in a way.  I've made a couple Oland Tools (image below) that make use of metal lathe keys.  It's nifty since you can change out the tool heads easily and have quite a few profiles open to you.  Basically, you drill a hole in the end of a metal rod large enough to fit an HSS key and hold it in place with a set screw.</p>

"How do I shop for lumber to use in home wood working projects?","8239","","<p>When I took wood working as a student, I learned to finish rough wood - cut it to rough size, joint it, plane it, rip and cross/cut on a table saw, etc.   As much as I'd love to own large versions of all these machines, it's not practical for the size of my home shop.</p>

<p>I looked around at my local home improvement store and none of the dimensional lumber was of the quality I'd want to use in a project like building children's furniture or enclosures for electronics projects - nothing looked straight or flat.</p>

<p>What should I expect when purchasing lumber to use in home wood working projects? Do most home wood workers buy rough material and use smaller machines to finish their wood, or should I expect to find a supplier who provides higher quality cut and finished lumber?</p>
","<p>It can very difficult to find wood that requires minimal milling, but it is possible. The tradeoff is that you may need to spend a lot of time searching through every board to find the one or two that are straighter than others.</p>

<p>Look for wide, 4/4 (1"") or thicker boards with few knots. These come from larger trees and are generally more stable.</p>

<p>Look at the end grain, ideally searching for quartersawn material where the wood grain is perpendicular to the face (wide side) of the board.</p>

<p>Generally, the lumber used in construction is not suitable for fine woodworking without additional milling. Some home improvement stores also sell pre-glued panels and hardwood lumber (sometimes wrapped in plastic), but it usually costs significantly more than buying dimensional or rough-sawn lumber from a hardwood dealer.</p>

<p>If you do not have the tools to mill lumber on your own, call some local cabinet shops. Often they will sell you lumber and may even do some milling at little or no additional cost.  You can also buy your lumber directly from a local sawmill or hardwood dealer, and they will typically surface the lumber on 2 or more sides for a small additional charge.</p>

<p>If you're tight on space, hand milling your lumber is always an option. If you prefer power tools, you may also want to consider looking into a combination jointer/thickness planer. Also, depending on what you're building, you may be able to build jigs to do most of your milling. A taper/straight-line rip jig will do the edge jointing, and you can build a separate jig to joint the faces of boards to about 6"" wide (assuming you have a 10"" table saw and can raise the blade to a little over 3"").</p>

<p>Also look into community shops and rental stores. If you live near a community college or university, they may have a wood shop with all the tools you need to mill your lumber. My local university offers daily or monthly options, and larger cities have MakerSpaces where you can buy a membership and use the equipment. There is also a Habitat for Humanity ""ReStore"" in a town near me which rents out all kinds of woodworking equipment (including table saws and planers), though you must first purchase an annual membership.</p>

","<p>Those are screws that are made to drill their own hole. The cutout bit at the tip is specifically made to bite into the wood more effectively.</p>

<p>One tip with screws like this: a <em>lot</em> depends on the amount of pressure you're going to be able to apply in the actual screwing-in.  If this is something where you can directly press on the driver, then typically you should have no problem with these kind of screws without pre-drilling, as long as you're not screwing a very difficult hardwood.  Pine or similar will be no problem.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, if you're screwing these in a weird position where you can't easily apply pressure on the driver, say directly overhead where gravity is fighting you, or a tight fit where you have to use a 90 degree angle bit, you're much better off pre-drilling first if you want your screw to go in straight.</p>

  <p>When glue is applied to end-grain, the grain acts as little straws and
  draws a lot of the glue up the wood, away from the joint (similar to
  how the grain draws water up the tree when the tree is alive). In

","<blockquote>
  <p>it sounds like the consensus is that gluing end-grain just doesn't work well. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has long been acknowledged to be the weakest joint. However, that doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't do it, ever.</p>

<p>The issue is actually whether it's <em>strong enough</em>, not strong per se. In a picture frame for example a simple glued mitre is not considered strong enough, and for good reason because the mitre would be the only joint responsible for holding the piece together, the glue surface area is small and the combined weight of picture, matt and glass can be considerable. And note the orientation of the joint faces to the load — pulling it directly apart. Failure in this situation could be considered likely, not just possible.</p>

<p>But if the mitre is at right angles to the load, and the weight it must bear is small (e.g. the weight of just the pieces of wood themselves, as in a crown moulding), then a simple glued mitre could easily be sufficient. </p>

<p>To be honest though, given how easy it is to reinforce the mitre, even a single staple across the joint adds a lot of strength, it hardly seems worth taking the chance that it might separate on its own. I should also mention corrugated fasteners here, although they're looked down upon by many woodworkers as being crude they should be considered for this as they stabilise the joint immensely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this true for all glues – even epoxy and CYA?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mostly yes. </p>

<p>CA/superglue is a particularly poor woodworking adhesive anyway as it is too brittle to deal with movement, and it's poorly suited to highly-absorbent materials which of course end grain is (neither of which stop it being sold for this purpose).</p>

<p>Epoxy on the other hand is a much stronger class of adhesive and it deals better with unusual surfaces or textures. To glue end grain best with epoxy you would want to pre-wet both joint faces with the adhesive and then apply additional glue to the surface before bringing the pieces together. There is a problem however, as strong as epoxy is it is not a good thin-film adhesive (thin like woodworkers want, nearly invisible) which is why you don't want to use very firm clamp pressure with epoxies. So to be at maximum strength the mitre joint would end up quite visible.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The absorbency of the end grain was identified by craftsmen as the problem and sealing of the end grain prior to final glueing to fix it was theorised a long time back, possibly before the 19th century. Certainly by then there was mention in woodworking handbooks of 'sizing' the end grain (painting with thinned glue) prior to application of the full-strength adhesive to the mitre and then bringing the joint together. Done correctly this does create a far stronger union between the mitred pieces than otherwise, but even with that it is not as strong a joint as is sometimes desirable. Bear in mind the context here: the strength of other joints in woodworking is <em>as strong as the material itself</em>, which is quite a high standard to meet.</p>

<p>Using modern PVA-type woodworking adhesives if you want to avoid using any kind of additional reinforcement then this is the method to adopt. In bullet points for clarity:</p>

<ul>
<li>The glue for sizing is normally slightly thinned; by how much is open to debate, but it seems likely the absorbency of the wood species should be the deciding factor.</li>
<li>The size is painted on the end grain and left to partially dry.</li>

<p>To put it simply a dead center is just that - dead. It has no moving parts. It is really nothing more than a metal shaft with a point.</p>

<p>A live center is similar, but the shaft has a bearing that allows it to turn. For example, in my lathe, the tail stock has a Morse taper, in which I put a live center. The tenon fits in the Morse taper, and it has a bearing assembly with a conical point on the other end that is free to spin. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the functional differences between a live/dead centers?</p>

<p>The live centers are great in that they don't have really any friction and allow your piece to spin freely. 
Dead centers are more often found in treadle or pole lathes, which are often built to be ""period correct.""  The use of a modern live center would be anachronistic in this case. A turner would use the dead center with some grease or oil on the point to keep it from squeaking in use.  I've also heard that ear wax or the skin oil on the side of one's noise was historically used, but don't quote me on that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would there be a practical reason to choose one of the other?</p>

<p>If you're not worried about being ""period correct,"" the live center is really the way to go. I think most modern lathes ship with one standard, anyway.</p>

"How can I cut a partial groove in the center of a piece of wood without going through the ends?","7581","","<h1>Background</h1>

<h1>Problem</h1>

<p>Now I want to cut some grooves into a sort of frame but I will not have a false front to hide the end of the grooves like a drawer would have. I need to cut the grove into the board minus about 1"" on each end. See example below built in sketch-up.</p>

<p>After watching several tutorials about table saws I'm starting to think it might not be the right tool for the job (between kickback and cutting my fingers off). </p>

","<h1>Power tool</h1>

<p>For a simple, efficient power tool approach I would consider a plunge router using a known straight edge as a guide. Using a straight bit you could cut in where you want and exit just the same. Use the guide to keep your cut true. </p>

<p><strong>There is a way to still use the table saw</strong></p>

<p>If you only have the table saw or want a way for that too work there is something you could do. Take a board that is of the right height and make it 15 inches long. Cut your groove from end to end using the tips you found. Then what you do is add the stops (appear to be about an inch) and glue them / screw them onto the ends. In case I lost a reader here the picture belong can help show where the how the 3 pieces would be attached. </p>

<p>You can do that all with a table saw. If you use different wood then you can create interesting accents on the drawers.</p>

<h1>Hand tools</h1>

<p>I love traditional tools and techniques so if I had the time I would be using chisels that are of the same width as you groove. To clean out the bottom of the groove you could use a router plane or <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/2536/128"">poor man's router</a>. You would use a knife wall to cut your edges and use those as a guide to keep it straight as you work.</p>

<p>The techniques I talk about in the <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/2395/128"">second part of this answer</a> would be applicable here as well.</p>

<p>For your project you would have an acceptable margin for error which would allow to make a few mistakes. If these are for drawers then errors could easily be hidden. </p>

<p>Both bits are rated for more or less the same materials. It is true that titanium coated should outlast a black oxide coated bit.

"How to restore old files?","7052","","<p>I have accumulated quite a few old files over the years.  Some are not very effective, but I have never thrown them out.  I have tried cleaning them with wire brushes and have even tried solvents, but without much improvement.  </p>

<p>Is there a way to sharpen/restore old files?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a way to sharpen/restore old files?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. The classic old method to sharpen a file is <em>vinegar sharpening</em> which is exactly what the name suggests, soaking the files in vinegar. </p>

<p>Now that we know the active ingredient in vinegar is acetic acid we can make the obvious educated guess that it's an etching effect from an acid. And it is known that other acids do the same job and were used in the past. Two of the best alternatives because of easy access are citric acid and sulphuric acid (e.g. battery acid). It's best not to use hydrochloric even if you already have some, many sources speak of the risk of <em>hydrogen embrittlement</em> when using HCl so it's best not to risk it since files are already brittle enough.</p>

<p>Acid etching works best on files where they are not heavily worn but are just rounded from use and no longer cutting well. Where there is any scoring/scratches or the teeth are worn down so far that there are flat shiny patches (hard to believe but you do occasionally see old files that had been used that hard!) you won't recover a usable surface. But files are nearly always double-sided and because this is inexpensive and largely a hands-off process that mostly requires patient waiting it can be worth it for a file even if it only has one side worth salvaging.</p>

<p><strong>Degreasing</strong><br>
You say you've used solvents and that is one good way to start the process off as a file must be thoroughly degreased before soaking in acid to give it unimpeded access to the metal, ensuring even results. </p>

<p>In addition to organic solvents you can also soak in oven cleaner, or a hot solution of washing soda. Both will eat any form of grease and pose no harm to the steel. </p>

<p>If you want to use solvents I wouldn't rely on mineral spirits/white spirit alone, soak in spirits to begin with then dry off and brush down or soak in acetone or lacquer thinner. </p>

<p><strong>Cleaning</strong><br>
If the files have any clogging this should be removed before etching, again to give the acid full access to the surface of the file. </p>

<p>In addition to using a 'file card' (a type of brass-wire brush specifically intended for cleaning swarf from files) there are other methods, including pushing in the direction of the grooves using the corner of a scrap of hardwood or the edge of a piece of brass. But some material clogging files can be very tenacious (a good example is aluminium) so you will sometimes have to resort to picking bits out of the teeth patiently with a needle or another sharp steel tool. If using a needle your hand muscles will thank you for chucking it up in a pin vice or permanently mounting it in a wooden handle rather than just gripping the needle in your fingers. </p>

<p>This picking away is just as tedious as it sounds, and can take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour of concentrated work per side, but it's worth every second of the effort. </p>

<p>You may want to quickly degrease a file again after cleaning, especially if you've done the work with bare hands.</p>

<p>Note: you can clean first prior to the degreasing step, but I've found that clogging residue (esp. wood) can be much easier to remove from a file that was thoroughly degreased first, and it's easier to see it all anyway. </p>

<p><strong>Rust</strong><br>
As you might expect if the file is rusted soaking in acid will simultaneously clean the rust from it, so this is a very useful technique for secondhand files picked up from various sources since you'll clean them of rust while also improving how they cut. But don't expect too much if the file has any heavy rust encrustations, after the rust is gone some pits can be left behind. While on some tools pits can be merely a cosmetic issue on files they can impact performance, in the worse cases leading to irregular abrading of the workpiece or scratches.</p>

<p>After soaking in vinegar or another acid even after rinsing thoroughly the files may start to rust again very quickly (flash rusting) so it's advisable to give them a quick spray of something like WD-40 immediately after to help halt this process. </p>

<p>So here are the steps:  </p>

<ul>
<li>brush off any loose matter</li>
<li>degrease </li>
<li>clean off all debris</li>
<li>degrease a second time if thought necessary</li>
<li>soak in your chosen acid*</li>
<li>rinse <em>thoroughly</em> then give the file a quick scrub with a stiff brush (a toothbrush is ideal) using common hand soap </li>
<li>pat dry</li>
<li>shoot with WD-40 or another water-displacement agent, or dry thoroughly using a hairdryer or by placing in a warm oven</li>
</ul>

<p>*No real guidance can be give on the time needed to soak a file. Using vinegar for example while you can typically get some improvement with just an overnight soak, with some vinegars, on some files, you may need to soak for <em>two or more days</em> before you judge it has done all it can.</p>

<p>The strength and concentration of the acid being used, the coarseness of the file and the amount of wear all have a huge impact on the time needed. So for stronger acids on finer files you may want to remove them from soaking after just an hour to check progress, with a weaker vinegar on a coarse file leave overnight to begin with and expect that it might take much longer to achieve the desired result.</p>

<p>When the process is completed the file should be quite uniformly dull and grey, and rubbing a thumb over the teeth it should feel very 'grabby', much more so than many files are straight from the factory.</p>

<p>Here are some self-explanatory pictures of the restoration of some files I bought last year:</p>

<p>Note the characteristic dull grey appearance of files treated this way. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Commercial sharpening</strong>  </p>

<p>There are commercial file-sharpening operations out there in the world and some people rave about the quality of the work. Some users are so impressed by the results — often stating that files treated this way are sharper than any you get straight from the factory, irrespective of cost — that they buy new files and send them straight to be sharpened before ever being used. </p>

<p>It seems fairly certain that these companies don't do any sort of re-cutting of the file teeth as one might first think, but instead they all use some form of acid etching. Although they may have any number of additional steps (including post-etching treatments to improve rust-resistance) there's no reason to suppose you can't get results similar to or as good etching your files at home in the manner described.</p>

What is a planer sled, and how is it used for removing twist?</p>
","<p>A planer sled is a flat, rigid box or piece of material that supports your workpiece and holds it in a specific orientation as it passes through a thickness planer.</p>

<p>By holding a twisted or otherwise warped piece of lumber in a fixed orientation as it passes through the planer, the sled allows the planer to chop off the high spots, effectively jointing the top surface flat. Afterward, you can flip over the workpiece and send it through the planer again (with or without a sled) for one or more passes until the other side is flat and parallel to the first (flat) surface.</p>

<p>Most designs use shims, wedges, or screw levelers to fix the piece in one orientation and prevent it from rocking or from being bent flat (e.g., if the board is cupped or bowed) by the planer's pressure rollers. Most designs also use hot glue, screws, and/or a stop at the leading edge at the front of the sled to secure the workpiece in place and keep it from sliding off the sled.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples...</p>

<p>The simplest designs often involve a thick slab of MDF or particle board, with hot glue and business card or playing card shims to secure the workpiece in place:</p>

"Is it safe to resaw on a table saw?","6890","","<p>I have been under the impression that if you want to resaw lumber, the tool of choice is a bandsaw. I don't have a bandsaw, but I do have a contractor-style table saw. However, I have read elsewhere that it isn't safe to resaw lumber on a table saw.</p>

<p>But looking through Mathias Wandel's site, I found a couple places where he resaws lumber using his table saw; like <a href=""http://woodgears.ca/box/small.html"">here</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Is this considered safe? If so, what are the rules of resawing on a table saw? I presume I should treat it like a rip cut. Is there a minimum safe length of board, where going shorter would become unsafe? Are there other safety considerations specific to resawing I'm not aware of? (Obviously all the standard rules of table saw safety should still apply: Don't stand directly behind the board being cut, use push sticks, etc.)</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Is this considered safe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can be done safely. A tall fence, featherboards, and good push stick make a big difference. Not everyone takes the time to set all that up, though, so it's worth pointing out that (like any TS operation) it can also be done unsafely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If so, what are the rules of resawing on a table saw?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Equipment:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>tall fence:</strong> The big difference between a normal rip cut and resawing is when you're making a regular rip cut, the wide part of the board bears on the surface of the saw. If you're going to stand a board on edge and cut it, you want a similar surface for the board to bear against. A normal TS fence is maybe 4"" tall; if you're trying to stabilize a 8"" board, you want something taller.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>featherboards:</strong> Use them at least to keep the bottom edge of the board tight to the fence. If you can manage a tall featherboard to keep the board flat against your tall fence, even better. Remember that featherboards should be set up <em>before</em> leading edge of the blade -- you want to push the stock against the fence, not against the blade. Featherboards also add some kickback protection, which is important when making a non-through cut and you don't have the benefit of anti-kickback pawls. (A riving knife is great if your saw has one, but not every saw does.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>push stick:</strong> Excellent for exerting control over the stock while keeping your fingers well away from the blade.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>zero clearance insert:</strong> If you're resawing, you're likely creating thin stock that could slip into the gap in a regular throat insert. A zero clearance insert will avoid that.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>infeed and outfeed:</strong> Featherboards and a fence control the lateral motion of the stock. If you're working with long boards, you'll also want help controlling vertical motion. An outfeed table or rollers keep things safe by eliminating the need for you to reach over or behind the blade. Something on the infeed side, even just a single roller, lets you comfortably manage the board from a fixed position at the saw instead of trying to feed the first part of the board from several feet back.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>clean, sharp blade:</strong> Heat is always a concern when ripping, but even more so when half the blade is spinning in an enclosed space. If your blade is dull and/or covered in pitch, it's going to run a lot hotter than a good clean and sharp blade. A blade lubricant made for saw blades helps too. A rip blade is the right tool for the job here.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Technique:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>straight, flat stock:</strong> Don't try to resaw a board that curves in any direction; work only with straight, flat boards that are well dried.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>work in steps:</strong> If you try to make a 3 1/2"" cut down the length of a board, you're probably going to run into trouble. Typical home shop saws will bog down trying to make such a deep cut in hardwood. Even if you have a saw with plenty of power, you run the risk of generating a lot of heat, possibly scorching the wood. Instead, take smaller bites, raising the blade after each pass; you'll be able to feed the stock faster, which means things stay cooler.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>cut from both sides:</strong> Even if you're resawing stock that's narrower than the capacity of your saw, cut partway in from each side rather than trying to cut all the way from one side. This reduces the risk of pinching the blade as internal stresses in the wood are released. Just remember to always keep the same face of the board against the fence so that both cuts are the same distance from that face.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>don't cut through:</strong> If you leave a little wood (maybe 1/4""-1/2"") in the middle rather than completing the cut, you'll be able to manage both halves of the board together through the entire operation. It's easy to finish the cut with a handsaw, and you're going to clean up the cut sides of each board with a planer (or a plane) anyway.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>stay out of the line of fire:</strong> Standard TS operation advice, but always worth repeating: don't stand in the way of a potential kickback.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The main idea, as with any TS operation, is that you want to keep everything well controlled and keep your body parts out of harm's way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a minimum safe length of board, where going shorter would become unsafe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As with ripping, I'd want the width of the stock to be a good deal less than the length.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pure Tung Oil will take 7 to 10 days for a minimum cure and 15 to 30 days for a full cure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this the same thing? If not, what is the difference? Can the same finish have a curing time <em>and</em> a drying time?</p>
","<p>While it's correct to say these terms can be used interchangeably they should not, the meanings when used technically are quite distinct. </p>

<p>The problem begins with the word drying being overused in product descriptions for paints and other coatings; that is, ""drying"" is used loosely and therefore will always be inaccurate in some instances. But the concept of paint or varnish ""drying"" as a catch-all for any process of hardening is far too entrenched to change.</p>

<p>Drying literally means <em>drying</em>, an actual drying process where at the simplest water is lost by evaporation. For other coatings it is merely a different solvent (or mixture of solvents) that is evaporating.</p>

<p>Curing on the other hand is less of a populist term and should have its correct use maintained so as not to muddy the understanding of its meaning.</p>

<p>Most paints and varnishes, as well as many lacquers, undergo both drying and curing processes. Drying is the initial phase, where the coating shrinks due to the loss of the solvent component. Curing is the second (usually <em>much</em> longer) phase where the coating changes physically and/or chemically; it may swell slightly during this process. </p>

<p>Where there is a chemical change during curing it can be components within the coating combining and reacting, or a reaction with oxygen (or water) from the atmosphere. An example of the latter occurs with oils such as linseed oil and tung oil, which undergo oxidative polymerisation, changing from oils into a type of natural polymer by reacting with oxygen.</p>

<p>Where a coating <em>only</em> has a drying process, such as with watercolour paint or shellac, it is chemically unchanged and therefore remains soluble in the original solvent. This is why even decades later watercolours are water-soluble, and why shellac can be re-dissolved in alcohol.</p>

<p>When a coating cures its chemistry changes from that of its original liquid form, so that for example a paint that was soluble in mineral spirits (white spirit in the UK) at the time of application will, after curing, no longer be soluble in it. </p>

<p>I recently purchased a digital caliper to make more precise measurements than a basic variety vernier and it works great. I wanted them to measure the width of my table saw for making my sled runners. </p>

<p>After watching a video on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbG-n--LFgQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">making an accurate table saw sled</a> I started to notice more instructional videos using dial calipers. </p>

<p>Of course this could just be a case of <a href=""http://www.psmag.com/books-and-culture/theres-a-name-for-that-the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon-59670"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">frequency illusion</a> but it begs the questions: </p>

<ol>
<li>If you were given a choice between dial, digital and vernier calipers which one should you pick? </li>
<li>As far as woodworking is concerned what would make one preferential over the other or is this just a matter of personal preference?</li>
</ol>
","<p>After doing a fair bit of research the <em>general</em> consensus is use whatever you have available and you feel comfortable with. That being said, there are several points worth making about all three tools and it's important to note the differences. </p>

<h1>Dial</h1>

<ul>
<li>Works mechanically and usually in 1/1000th of an inch increments.</li>
<li>Assuming the rack and pinion are free of debris the accuracy can almost always be trusted. </li>
<li>Some would claim getting a reading takes getting used to as you are reading a dial as supposed to just values.</li>
<li>Since it is mechanical many trust the readout more in comparison to digital. This could easily be subjective and comes down to the quality of the tool. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Digital</h1>

<ul>
<li>Digital readout is instantaneous and requires no affiliation with the tool for a quick readout. Many support switching between metric and imperial.</li>
<li>Since it is an electrical component extra care needs to be taken. Moisture and battery life need to be accounted for. </li>
<li>At times need to be re-zeroed before use although this is a simple process and a feature if you want to do relative measurements.  </li>
<li>The value that is presented can <em>sometimes</em> be inaccurate whether it be due to pressure used or the general quality of the tool (read below on how to deal with that). </li>
</ul>

<h1>Vernier</h1>

<ul>
<li>Getting values requires a few seconds of thought more than just reading of a display or dial however it is just basic math. </li>
<li>Most don't go to the decimal places that dials and digitals are capable of. </li>
<li>Make no mistake they can still take simple measurements that are more than satisfactory for woodworkers. </li>
<li>Minimal moving parts. Only inaccuracy in results is that of the user making a calculation mistake. </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>With any tools their precision can be a direct result of the tool's quality. Not to say that cheaper tools cannot do the job just as well as their more expensive siblings but manufacturers tolerance for error should be smaller with the higher end tools. </p>

<p>People will have their own personal preference that might have a certain bias but either caliper can perform the job for wood workers at least*. </p>

<p>Point I am trying to make is that it should not matter which tool you use beyond what you are comfortable with and have available. In either case having a set of gauge blocks on hand will remove any trepidation of the tools potential inaccuracy. </p>

<p><sub>* That is, most woodworkers would not need the same level of accuracy that a machinist might.</sub></p>

"When is it best to use kiln-dried vs. air-dried vs. green wood in a project?","6333","","<p>Kiln dried wood is usually recommended for woodworking projects since it's more stable than green and air dried lumber.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I've been told kiln dried wood is bad for lathe work, and in fact green wood is best for turning.</p>

<p>Air dried lumber seems to be considered workable but perhaps not ideal for anything.</p>

<p>Does this pretty much sum it up, or are there other applications such as carving in which a certain moisture level is ideal? Is there any case in which air-dried lumber is preferable over both kiln-dried and green wood?</p>
","<p><strong>Green</strong> — Very fun to turn and it's like shaping butter, however, the greener it is the more likely you will get cracks as it dries and quite possibly a bit of warping.  for building projects (book shelves, tables buildings etc) Green is a terrible choice unless you are going for a specific affect as the wood dries.</p>

<p><strong>Kiln (fast kiln)</strong> — Very dry and stable, good for building projects, harder on lathe chisels, and requires more sharpening.  Kiln drying is also hard on the substructure of the wood damaging it and does not last as long as air dried (slow kiln) wood.</p>

<p><strong>Air dry/slow kiln</strong> — Takes much longer to be at a usable moisture content for building projects, but for turning is much more stable than green and not as hard on the chisels.  For furniture it is best because it doesn't have the damage caused by fast kiln drying and it will be much more stable than green wood.</p>

<hr>

<p>When I say fast kiln drying I'm referring to commercial systems that dry the lumber very fast (in a matter of hours).</p>

<p>Slow kiln drying refers to something like my solar kiln. It heats up during the day, releasing moisture.  At night the moisture in the center of the wood has an opportunity to dissipate evenly throughout the wood. This results in a more even drying and puts less stress on the wood substructures.  Most of my wood is air dried and then I finish it in my solar kiln to get it down to 10% (or less) moisture content.</p>

"Are systainer tool cases of different companies compatible with each other?","6317","","<p>My router came in a plastic tool box called a <em>systainer</em>.</p>

<p>It is made in a way that the bottom could interlock with the top. this means I could stack multiple of these boxes and lock them together for transport. I thought that this is a way to convince me to buy more tools from the same manufacturer.</p>

<p>But recently I noticed that the tool boxes of a professional carpenter from festo look similar and I wondered if they would be compatible with mine.
In a store I that visited today I saw that tool boxes from hitachi had a suspiciously similar shape and locking system.</p>

<p>Are all these boxes in fact the same box system that different manufacturers use? Is this some kind of open standard like screw heads, bit diameters, etc.?
Are the <em>systainers</em> from different brands compatible with each other? What other ""features"" does a systainer have?</p>
","<p>It depends.</p>

<p>The most notable feature of these storage systems is that you can stack one case on top of another and engage one or more latches to securely fasten it to the case below. The idea is that you can stack as many as you want, though stacking them in this manner quickly becomes impractical in terms of actually accessing your tools. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/D9HbQ.jpg"" alt=""Systainer stack""></p>

<p>(<a href=""http://festoolownersgroup.com/workshops-and-mobile-vehicle-based-shops/festool-stack/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>)</p>

<p>For the purposes of this discussion, I'm going to use the term <em>compatible</em> to refer to cases that were designed to latch together with strategically-placed latches, recesses, and tabs. When two or more cases are latched together, you can lift a stack of them with a single handle.</p>

<p>Systainer is the brand-name for interlocking tool cases manufactured by Tanos. Systainers included with Festool and Fein tools are compatible with each other, as well as with other Systainers manufactured by Tanos. The current line is called T-Loc, but these can still be stacked on top of the older Classic Systainers.</p>

<p>There are several competing lines of interlocking storage containers which are not compatible with Systainers. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bosch's L-Boxx line of tool cases is compatible with other L-Boxx cases manufactured by Sortimo, but not with Systainers.</li>
<li>DeWalt has two different lines of interlocking toolcases, Tough System and Tstak. Unfortunately, you cannot mix-and-match between the two lines.</li>
<li>Stanley also sells its own interlocking tool cases, but their line is not as consistent--for example, the smaller-size Stanley cases are not compatible with the larger sizes, even though they use similar interlocking systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you aren't sure whether a case will be compatible with your existing case(s), you can usually tell just by looking at the product dimensions. With most of the systems, the footprint is the same for all the cases in a product line, and the cases only vary in height.</p>

","<p>Your saw may be poorly adjusted.</p>

<p>A properly tuned band-saw has the wheel axles exactly parallel and the wheels in the same plane. The axles can be adjusted using the tilt screw on the upper wheel. </p>

"Glue spots under stain","6208","","<p>I have two pieces of plywood that I joined with biscuits and wood glue (wiping away all excess glue after joining the two pieces. I then sanded the whole piece down to 220 grit.  After staining there is a large light streak where (I'm assuming) glue was left.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zfsyF.jpg"" alt=""Can&#39;t stain over glue""></p>

<p>Can this be fixed, and if so how?</p>
","<p>The problem appears to be that glue has sealed the pores of the wood, preventing stain from penetrating. In order to fix the stain, you'll first need to get to wood that's not sealed. I can think of two options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Remove the glue from the wood.</strong> You might be able to use a solvent appropriate to the kind of glue you used to loosen and weaken the glue, and then scrub with something like a Scotch-Brite pad. How well this will work will depend on whether the glue is really absorbed into the wood or just layered on top. I've heard that vinegar can work as a mild solvent for PVA (wood) glue, so you could try that.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Remove the wood that has been sealed to get down to bare wood.</strong> In other words, sand or scrape more of the wood away. With plywood projects, though, it's very easy to sand right through the top layer of veneer.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Until you get down to bare wood, the stain won't be able to penetrate evenly and you'll continue to have problems.</p>

<p>Here are some strategies for avoiding this problem in the future:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Use less glue.</strong> If there's less glue, there's less to squeeze out and cause problems, but it's hard to get enough glue on the joint without having some squeeze out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Protect the wood.</strong> People sometimes use clear packing tape to cover the wood near joints during glue up. This (mostly) prevents the glue from contacting the wood. Glue and tape can then be removed after the glue has set enough that it's no longer liquid. Sometimes the glue still seeps under the tape, though, so this isn't entirely effective.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid wiping.</strong> If you don't use too much glue, you can usually just let it squeeze out and form little beads along the joint. When the glue dries (or nearly dries), it's easy to remove by running a sharp chisel along the joint.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wipe effectively.</strong> If you want to wipe the glue away, use sponge or towel that's quite damp. PVA glues can be cleaned up with water before they dry, so you can wipe excess glue away with water. You need to be really thorough if you go this route since any glue you miss will likely be pushed into the wood, resulting in the same problem you have now.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>One of the big hassles with glue stains, as you've discovered, is that they can be hard to detect until you stain or finish your project, and they're a pain to fix at that point. If you have this problem a lot, you might be interested in Titebond II Fluorescent glue, which glows under black light so that you can clean up before the glue dries.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Is working MDF bad for your health? </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Yes</strong> but only if you are ignorant of your tools and materials. </p>

<p>It certainly can be. However the answer of ""Yes"" is misleading as the concerns surrounding MDF are more than just the <em>potential</em> presence of hazards such as the release formaldehyde. Working MDF creates dust particles much like any other wood. It is true though that some formaldehyde will be located on those particles and that has the potential to enter the body. </p>

<p>Articles and blogs that discuss the harms of formaldehyde usually miss some key points. Namely that it is a naturally occurring organic compound that is found in the air, plants, animals and our own bodies. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Formaldehyde is normally present at low levels, usually less than 0.03 ppm,(parts per million) in both outdoor and indoor air.</p>

<p>Large point to make about MDF is that the common binding resin urea-formaldehyde, for which the concern derives from, is not the sole binding agent used in the manufacture of MDF today. Many <a href=""http://www.buildgp.com/mdf-ultrastock-free"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">suppliers offer formaldehyde free or no added-formaldehyde options</a>. </p>

<p>Another thing that some people forget is that the compound urea-formaldehyde has also been used in the creation of plywoods and other sheet goods. Therefore its use in the engineered wood market is not new. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I avoid its use?</p>

<p>There are certain safety precautions that need to be taken <em>regardless</em> of the work you are doing. I like this <a href=""http://www.props.eric-hart.com/safety/is-mdf-really-that-bad-for-you/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">quote from a prop makers blog</a> that captures this well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like any other substance or material used in [the workshop], the safety of using it is dependent on <strong>knowing the risks and possible hazards and taking the appropriate precautions</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In that video that was linked I don't think I see a mask at all in use. Sawdust is a known carcinogen from MDF or otherwise. As discussed in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/353/what-kind-of-wood-dust-is-toxic-dangerous-and-requires-usage-of-dust-mask"">What kind of wood dust is toxic/dangerous and requires usage of dust mask?</a> the answer is you should <em>always be wearing the appropriate dust mask</em>. </p>

<p>Also need to be aware that reaction to different materials can be individual. Some people are just naturally sensitive to dust and particles. That does not mean MDF is a bad material on that justification alone.</p>

"What is a crosscut sled used for?","6187","","<p>I've read various references to people using a crosscut sled on their table saws.  Google brings up hundreds of pages on how to make one but I haven't found much background on them.</p>

<p>So what exactly is a crosscut sled used for and when/why would I want to use one over the miter gauge and fence on a saw?</p>
","<p>Let's tackle the second part of your question first.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>when/why would I want to use [a crosscut sled] over the fence on a saw?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is <em>extremely</em> unsafe to use your table saw's fence for crosscuts because such a small surface is registered against the fence. It would be easy to twist the workpiece and cause a kickback, or at the very least ruin your workpiece.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what exactly is a crosscut sled used for</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As its name implies, you use a crosscut sled to make crosscuts on a table saw. But that description doesn't even begin to scratch the surface.</p>

<p>You use a crosscut sled to <strong>safely</strong> make <em>perfect</em>, repeatable crosscuts on a table saw. I say <em>perfect</em> because the cuts are dead-accurate without tear-out, and are extremely safe with a well-designed sled. A typical crosscut sled is fixed at 90 degrees, has a zero-clearance kerf, and provides backer support through the blade and for several inches or even feet on both sides of the blade (depending on the size of your crosscut sled and back fence.</p>

<p>You can also add stops and clamps to a sled to improve its versatility; for example, to cut other angles or even to rip small parts. You can also quickly crosscut many parts of the same length simply by clamping a stop block (any small scrap piece of wood) to the sled's fence. A sled can ride in a single miter slot like a miter gauge, but many designs use two miter tracks.</p>

<p>Because both the workpiece and the offcut move with the sled and are backed by a fence perpendicular to the blade, there is a much smaller chance of kickback than with a miter gauge, and neither the workpiece nor the offcut will have blowout as the blade exits the piece.</p>

<p>It's not uncommon for a woodworker to build multiple crosscut sleds for different purposes--for example, one for large parts, one for small parts, and perhaps if you make boxes, one for cutting the sides of a mitered box with the blade tilted 45 degrees.</p>

<p>Although you cannot use a blade guard with most crosscut sled designs, you can and should still use your riving knife. Some designs include polycarbonate guards integrated into the miter sled, and many designs include features which ensure your hands remain far away from the saw blade, such as designated hand holds or a windowed box that fully encloses the blade as it exits the back fence.</p>

<p>The crosscut sled's cousin is the miter sled, which similarly makes perfect miter cuts. It's easy to adapt a crosscut sled to a miter sled with the addition of some hold-down clamps, stop blocks, and a scrap piece of wood cut to the exact angle of your miter joint.</p>

"How to repair missing chunk of wood from cabinet door?","5995","","<p>I have a nice wood cabinet that lost a small chunk of wood from the front door in a recent move. (Photos below.) Naturally, that chunk of wood was on the exterior where it's plainly visible <em>and</em> where the lower hinge attaches, thereby rendering the door inoperable. </p>

<p>The missing piece is thin, about 1/4 inch deep at most. All I can think to do is replace the missing piece with wood filler, sand and stain, and drill new holes for the hinge screws. </p>

<p>And then hope for the best and pray everyone is very gentle with that door. It seems unlikely to me that wood filler will hold well because it's a surface repair and therefore wouldn't stand up under the strain of being attached to a hinge.</p>

<p>Are there other options? How can I repair this piece?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well there's wood filler and there's wood filler. There are few commercial varieties that would be suitable for a repair of this nature, but that's simply because they're primarily intended for filling of minor surface defects that don't require anything in the way of structural strength.</p>

<p>Although there are better solutions than filling as a general principle, if you did want to try filling a far stronger compound than most commercial wood fillers can be made at home very easily, by mixing wood flour (sanding dust) with standard two-part epoxy glue. At best this bonds extremely well and is incredibly tough (much harder than the wood it replaces in actual fact) but it's still not the ideal fix in a location like this. </p>

<hr>

<p>Replacing missing wood with wood is far preferable as a rule where strength is required. </p>

<p>Although it seems like taking a step in the wrong direction the first step is to remove more wood, but you have to create neat clean edges that allow for an exactly matching repair patch to be successfully glued to. In this case sawing out a rectangular piece just long enough to remove all splintered wood is probably the way to go. </p>

<p>Instead of marking out two rectangles, on the door and on the replacement wood, and then cutting both it is better to cut the notch from the door first and then <em>mark your replacement wood directly from it</em>; this is far more likely to result in a tight-fitting repair.</p>

<p>Although a repair of this nature is quite simple to do there are two main difficulties usually encountered: </p>

<ul>
<li>stock selection </li>
<li>finish repair</li>
</ul>

<p>Finding wood that matches the existing furniture can be challenging at the best of times and is impossible at others, so sometimes you have to resign yourself to a close-enough match that is lighter in colour and then use wood dye or stain to achieve a closer colour match before final finishing.</p>

<p>Finish repair is actually the largest hurdle in some ways. Many film finishes, such as this is likely to be coated in, are considered unrepairable so that stripping the whole panel would normally be the minimum that is advised, or the entire piece of furniture in some cases. </p>

<p>I would suggest that you try the former first and strip the door (which would already be removed from the cabinet making stripping easier), then try to match the existing finish across the door and its patch. </p>

<p>How best to match the existing finish would be a good follow-on Question. To best answer it more (and ideally better-quality) photos of the piece may be required.</p>

"How should I dispose of sawdust safely?","5877","","<p>My workshop is more accurately termed my garage, with a small table saw, radial saw and a router table that I built. I don't have a central dust collection, and only the radial saw has any dust collection built in.</p>

<p>When I do any projects, I end up sweeping up a pile of sawdust. Most of my projects involve plywood of various thicknesses, poplar/pine up through oak for hardness. I don't work in anything harder/exotic (Such as purpleheart, cocobolo, etc). I know that it can be used as mulch, but I don't really have any plants that would need mulching. </p>

<p>How can I safely dispose of the bag or two of sawdust that I generate when working on a project?</p>
","<p>One good use of sawdust is to make into a fire starting device.  Sawdust is quite flammable, and obviously has a lot of surface area.  </p>

<p><strong>WARNING: Be safe. Certain glues (such as may be used in plywood), most finishes, and most pressure-treated woods may be dangerous to burn, due to the release of poisonous chemicals. Be sure that you are only burning wood that is definitely not toxic.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.woodmagazine.com/woodworking-tips/techniques/dust-collection/sawdust/?page=1"">This article from Wood Magazine</a> explains how to make them; basically, put them in a cup of some sort (such as a muffin tin) and add paraffin wax or some other flammable substance (I've seen homemade biodiesel used, for example).

"Should I do many shallow quick cuts or a single deep slow one with my router?","5855","","<p>Most cutting tools have a certain removal rate of material at which they should operate.</p>

<p>You don't want to go too slow because it takes forever.
And if you go to fast the tool heats up too much.</p>

<p>This question is concerned with the latter one on a router.
I heard that the usual technique is to plunge the bit only a little and not the full depth of the cut. Then make several cuts plunging deeper every time.</p>

<p>That makes sense. It reduces how much material is removed in one go.</p>

<p>Couldn't I achieve the same thing by doing one single cut with the bit plunged to the final depth, cutting very slowly?</p>

<p>The problems that I see with the first approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>it only uses the top part of the bit, which will become more and more
dull while the rest of the bit is not used that much</li>
<li>doing that same cut over an over again is could cause marks of the
different cuts to be visible</li>
</ul>

<p>What's the better way of doing it?</p>
","<p>Always make sure your bits are sharp and take small bites with the router.</p>

<p>If the router bit travels too slowly, it can burn and/or burnish your workpiece. Heat from taking too large a bite or moving slowly can also destroy the temper on the router bit, causing it to dull faster and/or break. Carbide bits are more resistant to heat than high-speed steel bits, but both can dull and break under high heat. Also, larger-shank bits are able to dissipate the heat more readily than smaller-shank bits. For example, all else being equal, a bit with a 1/2"" shank will stay cooler than the equivalent bit with a 1/4"" shank.</p>

<p>Often you should remove the bulk of the waste with a different tool first--for example, a saw or drill--then finish up with shallow passes with the router.</p>

<p>Sometimes you might also use one router bit for the first ""hogging out"" pass, then switch to the bit that has the final profile you want. For example, when routing dovetails, a common recommendation is to remove the bulk of material with a straight bit, then finish up with the dovetail bit.</p>

"When should I use a spiral router bit?","5781","","<p>Straight-cut router bits come with blades with three broad shapes: straight, down-spiral, and up-spiral</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pBcaE.jpg"" alt=""Straight blade router bit"">

<p><sup>from left to right, straight blade, down-spiral blade, and up spiral blade, from <a href=""http://amazon.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">amazon.com</a></sup></p>

<p>When should you use a spiral blade instead of a straight blade? When should you use an up-spiral instead of a down-spiral?</p>
","<p>The main advantage of using straight bits seems to be that they are cheaper, and easier to re-sharpen. They are perfectly fine for a number of uses though, especially where finish isn't particularly important.</p>

<p>Downcut and upcut bits generally give a better cut and are easier to use when working with a handheld/manual-feed router. This is because instead of the cutting edge hitting the timber all at once (as with a straight-fluted cutter), there is only a single small point of contact between the cutter and the workpiece when edge-routing, and a more constant contact when slot-routing. Consequently you get less ""chatter"" of the router during use. If you're using a CNC router then you can also typically use a faster feed speed when cutting with a spiral bit just because of the superior chip clearance and the lessened chatter. The chip clearance with an upcut bit also means that they're good for plunging into the centre of a workpiece if this is important to you.</p>

<p>Upcut bits give good chip clearance as they bring the chips up and out of a slotted cut, but they may cause the top cut surface to chip away more than a straight bit or a downcut bit. If you're cutting a composite, laminated or veneered board in a situation where the top surface finish is important (e.g. a kitchen worktop) but the bottom isn't, then a downcut bit can be better, as the downward spiral pushes down on the veneer/coating rather than pulling it upwards and causing the surface to chip away.</p>

<p>When using a downcut bit for partial-depth slotting (i.e. not going through the full depth of a board, and routing in the middle of a board rather than edging) you will have to go slowly as the chip clearance for these cutters is not as good as upcut/straight fluted bits.</p>

<p>If you're edging a board which is laminated on both sides, and you don't want either side to chip, you can actually get what's called a ""compression cut"" or up-down spiral blade where the lower part of the cutter is an upcut, and the upper part is a downcut, so chips are pushed towards the middle of the cutter. This means that neither the top or bottom of a board will experience major chipping. There's an example of a compression bit <a href=""http://cuttingtoolschicago.com/metalcuttingtools/amana-tool-compression-spiral-router-bits/"">here</a>.</p>

<p>For completeness, if you want to get <strong>really</strong> advanced then you can also get upcut, downcut and compression-cut bits with chip-breaking edges which look serrated and break the chips into very small chunks, which will give you super-fast cuts with little resistance. With these cutters you'll see some lines from the serrations, so they're typically only used for roughing or where surface finish isn't important. </p>

<p>If you want to get <strong>really really</strong> advanced then you can get cutters which are combined roughing/finishing cutters where you have one edge which has a ""chip-breaker"" profile followed closely by a continuous (straight-edged spiral) finishing edge which would more or less take a cutter from a 3-flute spiral to really being a 6-flute spiral. These are also available in compression-cut bits! If you look <a href=""https://www.vortextool.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=category.display&amp;category_id=2"">here</a> you can see some of these bits (scroll to near the bottom and look at the ""Tornado"" cutter). They're pretty advanced and not cheap, but if you're looking to do CNC routing of melamine-faced or ply boards at blistering speeds, then that's what you'll need. A bit outside the realms of what's used in the home-shop though!</p>

","<p>Use epoxy resin, thinned with acetone, and brush it on. Use a very thin mix for the first coat, then if necessary, come back with a second coat.

"What is the old-school way of smoothing a curved surface?","5622","","<p>I have heard that the old-school way of creating a flat surface is to use a hand plane, and that if you use the right tools, you may not even have to sand because the surface is so smooth. Can I use a flat hand plane to smooth an flatten a curved surface? Is there a tool specifically for it?</p>

<p>The surface in mind is a U shaped stool top, so there is only a single curve, though I have to handle both the inside and the outside.</p>

<p>I know I can just sand it, and that's what I plan to do if I don't have an alternative. Is this the easiest/classical way of handling such a surface?</p>
","<p>This is a tangential point to your main question but has a bearing on my suggested solution:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have heard that the old-school way of creating a flat surface is to use a hand plane, and that if you use the right tools, you may not even have to sand because the surface is so smooth. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>While that can be true it does tend to get overstated by some planing enthusiasts. It was actually quite common in the past for even the surface left by a ""smoother"", or smoothing plane, to be further refined. Be it by scraping and/or with some abrasives (even before the advent of sandpaper).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can I use a flat hand plane to smooth an flatten a curved surface?<br>
  The surface in mind is a U shaped stool top, so there is only a single curve</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I'm presuming this is dished, i.e. has a concave surface. Generally speaking a regular flat-soled plane can only be used on convex surfaces, not on concavities because the flat bottom will 'bridge' from toe to heel and prevent the cutting edge from contacting the wood. </p>

<p>There are a number of other edged tools that can be use for concave surfaces. In terms of smoothing the surface specifically (rather than creating it in the first place) the main one is the <em>compass plane</em>. </p>

<p>The all-metal version had a flexible steel sole whose curvature could be adjusted to match the surface you were working on:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hY2uc.jpg"" alt=""Record compass plane""></p>

<p>Wooden versions are also an option and these can have soles that curve in one or both directions, the latter allowing work on compound curves (a surface dished both front-to-back as well as side-to-side).</p>

<p>Compass planes are specialised pieces of kit and can be quite expensive, but are of course purpose-made for the job and do it well and efficiently. </p>

<p>There is a simpler option, one much better suited if only a small amount of smoothing is needed and that is the curved card scraper. Card scrapers are widely sold in sets of three shapes, and this may be the ideal way to buy them as all three shapes will prove useful. For use on a hollow seat the best choice is the one that looks a little like a stylised comma:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FUF7D.gif"" alt=""Card scrapers""></p>

<p>All card scrapers can be used in either a pulling or pushing motion depending on user preference and the demands of the shape being worked.</p>

<p>After scraping you may end up with a surface you deem finish-ready, but this isn't always possible (due to vagaries in the wood as well as how sharp the scraper is) so don't feel any embarrassment if you need to do final smoothing using sandpaper.</p>

<p>Without experimenting I have a feeling that spreading glue with a brush might be a good idea, but when the gluing setup is finished and one has time to clean the brush it is already set. </p>

<p>So every such gluing would cost a brush.</p>

","<p>Many of the brushes you see people use online to spread glue <em>will</em> actually be disposable. The type I'm thinking of are something like 50c each, and although they can be cleaned and reused they're cheap enough that probably the majority of users are comfortable using each brush once and discarding it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>but when the gluing setup is finished and one has time to clean the brush it is already set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most PVA-type glues have an 'open' time of between 20 minutes and about an hour, depending on local conditions. Even if you're doing a complex glue-up and you can't leave the work to get the brush to a sink for cleaning you could have a jar of water near the workbench to dunk brushes into to stop them from drying out until you've finished clamping up.</p>

<p>Once you get to rinsing out the brush it's advisable to use warm water, it really makes quite a bit of difference compared to using cold water; so where available use warm water. After thorough rinsing, washing the brush with soap and water can help remove the last traces of glue although this isn't absolutely needed.</p>

<p>While you can use brushes of nearly any kind to apply glue I would recommend you confine yourself to those with synthetic bristles. Synthetic brushes are generally stiffer and easier to control (nothing is worse than trying to spread glue accurately on a joint face using a very soft and bendy brush, I speak from experience!) and their bristles are more forgiving of trace amounts of glue being left in them from incomplete rinsing.</p>

<p>In addition to paintbrushes silicone rubber brushes (intended for basting meats or glazing pastry) are used by some woodworkers to apply glue. Although these are great in that hardened glue doesn't stick to them and it can just be peeled off the next day, I don't like them because they're too floppy. But silicone rubber spatulas on the other hand are well worth experimenting with as glue spreaders, they work brilliantly IMO.</p>

<p>I can't recommend any technique for cutting straight lines freehand on a table saw because <strong>you should not do that.</strong> You should <em>always</em> use the fence to guide rip cuts and the miter gauge or a sled for crosscuts. <strong>It's a safety issue:</strong> if the work happens to catch the back of the blade, the saw won't have any trouble lifting the workpiece up and throwing it at you in the blink of an eye, and that's one way that <strong>people get hurt.</strong></p>

<p>If the workpiece is too large to fit between the blade and the fence at its widest setting, it's too large to cut on your table saw.

","<blockquote>
  <p>How do both techniques compare? In terms of result, cost,
  applicability to different kinds of wood, different shapes of work
  pieces and cleanliness of process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good question.</p>

<p>As a preamble to an in-depth  comparison between scraping and sanding let me frame my answer in terms of '<strong>surface preparation</strong>' which is what you are doing when you are either scraping or abrading or both.</p>

<p>The goal is to prepare the surface of the wood or veneer for a final finish, or in the case of unfinished wood pieces (shoji comes to mind) to achieve a final surface before use.</p>

<p>The benefits of one method vs another are best defined in terms of what type of finishing you are going to pursue and any cost or time restraints which your project may have (an important consideration).</p>

<p>Bear in mind you are omitting planning, which is another very viable method of surface preparation, but I will limit this answer to the two methods that you have mentioned.</p>

<h2>Abrasives</h2>

<p>Abrasives are pretty freaking awesome. But they are a fairly new method of preparing wood surfaces in the long history of working wood. Nowadays however, you will be hard pressed to find a hobbyist or professional who has not spent their share of time 'sanding'.</p>

<h3>Strengths</h3>

<p>Abrasives excel in a few areas that scrapers cannot begin to compete with.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first of which is time. If you are preparing case-goods, cabinetry or solid wood surfaces then you will most likely gravitate towards an electric or pneumatic sander.</p></li>
<li><p>Abrasives can achieve very consistent surfaces that will allow your finishing process to be quite predictable. If you properly work through the girts on your way to your final surface you can have a very well prepared surface indeed, with a little practice.</p></li>
<li><p>Versatility is another area where abrasives can really shine. If you are making a custom moulding or preparing a concave or convex surface, sanding with a custom backing pad or by hand is almost the only way to go unless you want to make custom scraper blade profiles.</p></li>
<li><p>Ease of use. I think this one speaks for itself.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

<p>Abrasives have several drawbacks that you are probably already aware of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Abrasives produce both wood and abrasive media dust which is considered an occupational hazard of woodworking. This is kind of a big deal if you are a professional. Even for the hobbyist, you will want to take measures to limit your exposure to sanding dust by using a good quality respirator of some kind and ventilating your shop. Even afterwards, this dust can irritate your lungs when you are long done with sanding and so regular cleaning is also required.</p></li>
<li><p>Abrasives are expensive. I mean they won't break the bank, but you will be spending money on sandpaper for sure. And like most things you get what you pay for.</p></li>
<li><p>Flatness. If you are looking for a superiorly flat surface for whatever reason, abrasives may let you down. Due to variations in wood hardness, sandpaper tends to inconsistently remove material from most wood types. An extreme example is what is known as 'heart pine'. The difference in hardness of the early and late wood of the annual rings is tremendous. Sanding this wood improperly will produce a very undesireable result without care.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Scrapers</h2>

<p>Once the method of choice for wood surface prep, now the scraper has been relegated to the tool cabinet for most applications.</p>

<h3>Strengths</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Flatness. A properly burnished scraper can easily produce a high degree of flatness in a surface. But lets expand this to a curved scraper and you will find that a scraper can hold a very 'true' profile as well - good for custom moldings. But don't necessarily get the idea that the scraper is exceptionally good at flatness, as a hand plane will beat the scraper every time.</p></li>
<li><p>Veneer and burls. Where a hand plane would be a totally bad option, before abrasives came into vogue a scraper was the only other method. It is still a very viable way to quickly bring a freshly veneered surface (don't think plywood as this has already been commercially sanded) into the neighborhood of ready for finish. Scrapers are easier to control when preparing veneers and will let you avoid 'sanding through' which is all to easy to do with a power sander of any variety.</p></li>
<li><p>Ease. Think of this strength of the scraper as a byproduct of not having to sand a surface through 4 consecutive grits. A good scraping and most hardwoods no longer have tool marks and may need only a light sanding (320+) to be ready to sand. If you are removing planner marks with a power sander you probably need to start at at least 180 grit and work your way up.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Getting a scraper ready to use is a bit of a trick. But don't let this fact cause you to think that using abrasives involves less skill. I have seen far more pieces of furniture that were improperly sanded.</p></li>

"How long should I wait for staining a new deck?","5504","","<p>I recently built a deck in my backyard with pressure treated wood and was also planning on staining it for color and weather proofing. However all of the wood came very wet, cutting through the pieces produced globs of wet sawdust even. So I asked a friend about his experience staining his deck and he advised me to wait a year for it to dry before I stain to avoid any complications due to trapping moisture. I would like to apply the stain asap for both aesthetics and for the weather proofing, as the coming 8 month long winter hits -40 Celsius. the deck has been complete for about 1 month which has also been quite hot, so it did dry out and contract a little bit already by the way.</p>

<p>Should I wait a full year for the deck to dry out or stain sooner rather than later?</p>

<p>Unfortunately this will relate to the irregular use of the word 'stain' in woodworking circles, and by manufacturers, which can and often does lead to confusion. By definition a stain should be a colouring agent <em>only</em>, but the word stain is now used, often without qualification, for products that are in essence coloured varnish or another protective finish. </p>

<p>A true stain can in theory be used on wood that isn't fully dry without much issue, except for preventing the wood from taking the colour as strongly as it would otherwise. If the 'stain' is on the other hand a coloured varnish or other finish you would not want to do this as there could be significant problems with adhesion, leading to excessive weathering down the line (irrespective of whether the stain is oil-based or features water cleanup).</p>

<p>It's likely not much help but the ideal way to check how dry your wood is would be to take a piece that has been outside and cut through it, see firsthand how wet it is in the interior. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would like to apply the stain asap for both aesthetics and for the weather proofing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For what it's worth, a year's exposure to the elements shouldn't harm most woods to any significant degree. You will get some degree of surface discolouration (greying/silvering) that you're likely not going to be happy with, but the wood's structural integrity should be unaffected.</p>

<p><strong>Drying times for wood</strong></p>

<p>Re. the year to dry out that your friend mentions, that sounds excessive but there's a guideline timeframe often mentioned in woodworking circles in relation to wood drying of about a year per inch (25mm) of thickness. </p>

<p>This is a <em>very</em> broad generalisation however, and is actually really for hardwoods specifically, but the drying times for wood species vary hugely due to the differences in their structure and density. And anyway that relates to wood drying out from green (freshly cut).</p>

<p>With your decking material, whatever it is, presumably it was kiln-dried wood initially that then became waterlogged due to less-than-ideal storage conditions. So even if the moisture content of the wood when it was delivered was the same as green wood this is actually quite different (because the water is stored in the wood's structure differently). </p>

<p>As a result there's no reason to suppose that your wood wouldn't get to an acceptable moisture content — perhaps 14-18% — in a far shorter timeframe than the suggested year, exposed to good ventilation and dry, sunny weather.</p>

<p>If the weather where you are seems set to stay good it wouldn't hurt to wait a bit longer, but a month of drying in good conditions could be enough. </p>

<ol>
<li>Oil-based finishes (e.g., tung oil, boiled linseed oil). Very low in hardness, moderate in water resistance, easy in reversibility.</li>
<li>Lacquer. Moderate dent resistence, lowish in water resistance, easy reversibility. Reverses with lacquer thinner. </li>
<li>Shellac. Same as above. Reverses easily with denatured alcohol.</li>
<li>Water-based polyurethane. Better dent resistance than lacquer or shellac but harder to reverse. (It requires a chemical stripper, but it's doable). Good water resistance. </li>
<li>Oil-based polyurethane.  Less prone to wear than water-based poly and more water resistant. Like water-based, it too requires a chemical stripper to reverse it. </li>
<li>Two part epoxy. This is what restaurants use on their tables. Really good wear and resistance but practically impossible to reverse (should you need to repair the wood beneath the finish). </li>
</ol>

<p>Bob also gives a series of tests you can do to determine which sort of finish works for your particular project. To determine its scratch resistance, for example, you can buy art pencils (e.g., HB, 2B, 3B) and attempt to make tiny scratches in the finish. Also, to determine water resistance, (if I remember correctly), he suggests placing a drop of water on a finish then covering it with a mug for 24 hours. </p>

"Wood conditioner between stain layers","4994","","<p>When putting multiple coats of stain on a piece of wood, should wood conditioner be applied between each coat or only before the first coat?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>should wood conditioner be applied between each coat or only before the first coat?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only before the first coat. </p>

<p>Pre-stain wood conditioners are to help (note: not solve) with <em>blotching</em>, which is the irregular absorption of stain into the wood. </p>

<p>Most woods have some variation in absorption from earlywood to latewood, but for blotch-prone woods the absorption is irregular even across those zones and it's this in particular that leads to the ugly results that pre-stain conditioners are intended to help with. </p>

<p>Before there were commercial products for this purpose craftsmen obviously had to contend with blotching. The wood might be <em>sized</em>, painted with a thin layer of dilute glue, or have a dilute layer of shellac or varnish applied, a little later diluted lacquer was used in exactly the same way. This is called a spitcoat or washcoat.</p>

<p>This should give some pointer to what commercial wood conditioners might be, and in fact many oil-based pre-stain conditioners are nothing more than thinned polyurethane varnish... which of course the woodworker can make for themselves at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p>Here is a good example of the improvement that pre-stain conditioning can provide:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zz8WO.jpg"" alt=""Stained conditioned and unconditioned wood""><br>
But unfortunately results are not always this good. </p>

<p>Since the commercial products are much the same as what was (and still is) used by craftsmen it begs the question: why were there results better? The main reason is that the application recommendations on commercial wood conditioners can be incorrect. The instructions on the tin may suggest you apply conditioner and then within a short period apply your stain, but this is wholly wrong.</p>

<p>I'm sure this is in part to make the product seem more user-friendly in this I-want-results-now era, but it does the purchaser no favours. If instead you do what craftsmen did, and still do, and apply your per-stain conditioner (or thinner shellac or varnish) and wait for it to fully dry, results will be far better and more consistent.</p>

<p><strong>An alternate approach</strong><br>
These days many of us can take advantage of a newer type of colouring finish, gel stains. </p>

<p><strong>Gel stain</strong> is essentially thicker coloured varnish, and because of its gelled consistency it is not readily absorbed into the wood fibres but sits on top as a coloured layer. And for this reason it nearly completely prevents blotching, even on woods particularly prone to it such as pine. </p>

"Why does my workpiece become rough again after applying polyurethane varnish when it wasn't before?","4905","","<p>I am in the process of applying polyurethane varnish to a finished workpiece and have been sanding between coats as advised by the manufacturer instructions. I initially wondered why this was necessary until, after applying the first coat, I noticed that the wood was bumpy where it hadn't been previously.  Why does this happen, (am i doing something wrong?) and surely sanding between coats ruins the finish of the varnish?</p>

<p>Edit: I used this varnish: <a href=""http://www.woodoc.com/products/24"">http://www.woodoc.com/products/24</a>. </p>
","<p>Usually when varnish makes a surface rough, it's either that it's picked up dust during the drying process, or it was being brushed/wiped too long after application.</p>

<p>Gently sanding between thicker coats is necessary to ensure the peaks and valleys of the finish don't interfere with adhesion of future coats, and so their appearance isn't exacerbated by future coats. But keep it gentle, and don't be afraid to use a higher grit than the manufacturer's specs.</p>

<p>I highly recommend thinning. Thinning a varnish to wiping consistency (about 50/50 with OMS) and applying twice as many thin coats (that dry twice as fast) eliminates a host of issues with finishing. </p>

<p>Fix:  ensure the drying environment is relatively dustless, and don't overwork the application (wipe and say goodbye till it's dry)</p>

<p>As this would be something that you would be doing to dozens of screws, in theory, the process should be rather simple to repeat.</p>
","<p>Any screw can be modified to make it self-tapping and the process is surprisingly easy. All that's required is to create one or more cutting edges and the clearance needed for the swarf, and the existing threading takes care of the rest (just as it does with manufactured self-tapping screws).</p>

<p>The modification necessary can be a very quick operation, literally a few seconds per screw at fastest. Even the slowest method really only requires a modest effort, taking at most a couple of minutes. </p>

<p>This simplest method it to sand or grind the side of the screw; grip your screw in gloved fingers or pliers (pad jaws to prevent crushing the threads) and hold it against a belt sander or grinder until a flat face has been created that is approximately 1/3 of the way up the threads. Ideally it should retain its original point, looking something like this when you're done:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dEkX2.jpg"" alt=""Screw converted to self-tapping""></p>

<p>Another method more directly copies the form of commercial self-tapping screws, where you create a groove down the side of the screw somewhat like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8imZw.jpg"" alt=""Screw converted to self-tapping, type 2""></p>

<p>As most screws are made of mild steel this can be done using any common triangular needle or warding file, or a Western saw-sharpening file. For those with a Dremel-type mini drill a cutting disk/slitting disk can be used to do a similar job but care must be taken not to cut too deeply.</p>

<p>Once modified in either of these ways a screw can usually (not always) be driven in and left there as the fastener, without any compromise in holding power. But alternatively the one screw can be used repeatedly, i.e. used as a threading tool. After driving home it can be backed out of the hole and an unmodified screw of the same type driven in its place; so within reason this modification might only need to be done once per screw type for any project.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> it is probably best not to try to convert brass screws, it is likely they will not be strong enough to take the strain and they could easily snap in half when being driven into the wood.</p>

<p>As I was pulling together images for this Answer I discovered that, no surprise, this tip is nothing new. Here's a mention of it in <em>Popular Mechanics</em> from November 1923:</p>

<p><strong>Bonus related point — threading holes</strong><br>
A similar process can actually be used on <em>anything with a thread</em> to allow you to tap a thread in a drilled hole of suitable diameter. This can be done with bolts of course, but just a length of threaded rod (including acme-threaded rod as commonly used in bench vices) can be modified in the same way, to tap wood and other softer materials such as the harder plastics used for some jigs and accessories, as well as aluminium. </p>

<p>Although some modern guides suggest grinding substantial grooves down the length of your bolt/threaded rod, it is far simpler and easier to file, sand or grind 2-4 flats onto the lower portion of the bolt or threaded rod, as in either of these examples:</p>

","<p>The good news is that, according to the <a href=""http://www.woodbin.com/calcs/sagulator/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sagulator</a>, your design should be able to hold a static load of 120kg just fine, and the combination of butt joints and angle bracket reinforcements should support that unmoving, static load as long as you use lag screws or heavy-duty construction or wood screws. Do NOT use drywall screws; they are too brittle and are more likely to shear or break.</p>

<p>Now for the bad news.  Your structural design is rather weak, and with 120kg moving around a little on top, I would be very concerned about the whole thing starting to lean toward one side (racking) before catastrophically collapsing.  I'll cover a few improvements you can make to make your design stronger.</p>

<p><strong>Screws into endgrain do not hold very well</strong></p>

<p>That section title is pretty self-explanatory. If you drive a screw through one board and into the endgrain of another board, the screw will be much more likely to pull out of the endgrain than it will if you drive the screw into the face or edge of the second board. Toenailing or its fancy cousin, pocket hole joinery, takes advantage of this concept and basically runs the screws in the opposite direction (but at a slight angle, since that's more practical than growing a tree so it will have screws sticking out of its end grain).</p>

<p><strong>Reinforce against racking</strong></p>

<p>Simply put, racking is any lateral motion where the top and bottom of a structure are moving in opposite directions relative to one another. If you don't properly reinforce against it, racking force can exert tremendous force on your joints, especially right-angle joints, causing the joints to fail.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend adding some diagonal braces across the back and sides to reinforce against racking.  Or you could install plywood or MDF panels across the sides and back to make the structure more rigid.  You could miter the ends and add them in place of the small angle brackets. Or you could use a much larger angle bracket that extends out further from the corner. Either way, you want your structure to be made of big triangles or you want to fill in the rectangles to resist racking.</p>

<p><strong>Upgrade your lumber</strong></p>

<p>The boards you've chosen seem a bit undersized for a bed, even though they certainly can support the static 120kg load.  Certain dense wood species will be fine, but if you're using common construction lumber like Douglas Fir, I'd scale up to a larger size. I'm not sure what lumber sizes you have available in your region, but 48mm x 68mm is roughly the size of a 2x4 here in the states. I personally would opt for the metric equivalent of a 2x6 (1.5""x5.5"") or even a 1x6 (0.75""x5.5"") over a 48mm x 68mm, i.e., a 2x4 (1.5""x3.5"").</p>

<p>In addition to the greater load-bearing capacity, you can spread out your screws a little more, which will help strengthen the bed somewhat against racking forces.</p>

<p><strong>How are you going to get it in and out of the room?</strong></p>

<p>You probably don't want to build a complex structure like your design entirely in the room, and even if you did, you aren't going to want to completely dismantle it in order to get it out later.  If you examine mass-produced wooden frame beds, you'll notice that the bed often comes apart very easily by lifting and removing the sides, leaving you with two sides, a headboard, and a footboard. Redesign your loft bed so it's made up of a few components that can be easily carried through a zig-zag hallway, up twisting staircases, and through a person-sized door. Consider using knock-down furniture connectors such as the bed rail brackets I mentioned in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/899/49"">another furniture design answer</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Upgrade the butt joints</strong></p>

<p>You can replace the butt joints with doweled or mortise-and-tenon joints, pocket hole joints, half-laps, or any number of other joints or combinations of joints. Pretty much anything is stronger than a simple butt joint, though with some of the other reinforcements I've mentioned above, the butt joints will be strong enough.</p>

<p>That said, you can add cleats on the inside corners of your butt joints so that you can screw into the edge or face grain of both pieces, rather than relying on a screw holding in endgrain without splitting the wood.</p>

<p>Also note that these other types of joints either require glue or can be further strengthened by adding glue. Granted, you may need to make special considerations for glue joints if you also want to make the bed knock-down, but it won't be too difficult.</p>

"Substitute for Pocket Hole Jig?","4842","","<p>Pocket Hole jig is really expensive for me and I don't plan to buy one right away. So, as a newbie I was searching for any alternative. 
I have seen many videos and stuff over the net but as a fresher woodworker <strong><em>it would be better with some professional advice so that I could build one of my own.</em></strong></p>

<p>Any help or reference is appreciated</p>

<p>Tools I have right now : Drill machine, saw, set squares, clamps.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>I'm glad someone finally asked a Question about alternatives to these jigs.</p>

<p>In the US at least, and probably in other parts of the world by now, pocket holes have become synonymous with Kreg. While they make good products that work exactly the way you'd hope, they can be expensive and their dominance of the market has led to a pervading belief among new woodworkers that the <em>only</em> way to do pocket holes is with a commercial jig when in fact pocket-screw joinery pre-dates the foundation of the Kreg company by several centuries. </p>

<p>Yes centuries, this isn't a new method at all. It's just that the technique was used very selectively back when joinery was all made by hand.</p>

<p><strong>Working freehand</strong><br>
The simplest way to do this is probably the historical way, using only one gouge and a drill, in some cases fitted with only a single bit. There can be no jigging involved, just careful judgement of the correct screwing angle. Of course a bevel gauge can be used to help reference the angle or if preferred, a very basic jig (e.g. a wedge of wood) can be fashioned to ensure consistent results.</p>

<p>A little more about the history and alternative methods here:<br>
<a href=""http://www.popularwoodworking.com/woodworking-blogs/editors-blog/pocket-screws-with-fine-furniture"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pocket Screws with Fine Furniture</a> by Glen D. Huey on Popular Woodworking.  </p>

<p>These days the simplest non-jigged method is probably to use just a drill, sometimes using multiple bits to form the various holes needed — a face hole (using a Forstner or sawtooth bit), the clearance hole in the first piece (this goes into the side of the hole formed by the Forstner) and the pilot hole in the adjacent piece.</p>

<p>Building a jig for this can be a very simple operation, requiring no more than a few minutes of work if you're fast (but take as long as you need to make it right). Here's one of the simplest types, originally published as a reader's tip on Fine Woodworking:</p>

<p>Metal inserts (bushings) can be glued in place to extend the life of any wooden drilling jig, but even without those you can expect a lot of use before wear makes a jig such as this inaccurate enough that you have to discard it, even if made from pine or another soft wood. If made from a strong hardwood like oak or maple I think you can realistically expect it to last for a few years of regular use if you're careful. </p>

<p>I would fit metal inserts if you'll be using your jig very frequently, or alternatively make yourself three or four of the all-wood type in one go so that as soon as one wears out you can throw it away and immediately swap in a replacement.</p>

Can anyone help with a better screw, better drill,  better bit, or better technique? </p>

<p>UPDATE... Thanks everyone. 1) I learned the difference between hammer and impact and have switched to an impact for screws. 2) I am starting to use Roberson and square head fasteners and the difference is amazing. 3) I felt wasteful going through the Philips bits but they sure are cheap in bulk and the old ones can be used as pins/rivets or tossed in the recycling.4) A bit of beeswax or petroleum jelly on the screw sure makes the 2.5""+ screws go in smoother. Thanks again!</p>
","<p>This is an extremely common phenomenon and there's nothing you can do to prevent it entirely. </p>

<p>You seem to be well aware of the standard bit of advice going back to the days of slotted screws, that it is vital to press hard to fully engage the driver with the screw. But unfortunately with power driving and Phillips-head screws it is virtually inevitable that you will experience the head slipping out at least some of the time (called 'cam out') which will always cause some damage to the screw, to the screwdriver/driver tip, or quite commonly, both.</p>

<p><strike>Why is it so easy? The ugly fact is that Phillips screws were purpose-designed to cam out! </p>

<p>They were not intended to become consumer-level fasteners but rather were for industrial use, the intent being that on production lines where speed was essential the driver should cam out rather than risk the screw being over-tightened, to prevent them being set too deeply, or snapping. And also to help reduce wear and tear on the power drivers themselves (the motors and gearing, not the driver tips — these are a cheap consumable in industrial settings, literally available to buy in boxes of 100 and more).</strike></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> provided by the Comments below, Phillips screws being designed to cam out is apparently a persistent myth, the result of a misunderstanding based on the different use of the term by Phillips in his patent application (<a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/US2046837"">Phillips 2,046,837</a>) and in modern usage.</p>

<p>The patent application actually states that the design intention was the exact opposite, particularly in the context of power driving, going so far as to claim:</p>

<p><em>""Moreover, by reason of the perfect fit between the driver and the screw, the screws may be driven and removed innumerable times without the slightest indication of mutilation to the head.""</em></p>

<p>Now this may be true if both driver and screw have perfectly matching geometries corresponding with the patent but unfortunately in the real world, for whatever reasons, Phillips drivers do cam out very easily and begin to strip the screw (even without a power driver being used).</p>

<hr>

<p>The problems associated with them led directly to the development of Pozidriv, a linear descendent of the Phillips head designed to have the same benefit (auto-centring) but by providing more facets the tip of the driver engages much better with the screw, and as a result it will cam out far less easily.</p>

<p>So if you need to continue to use Phillips screws buy your driver tips in bulk and simply throw out the stripped ones as soon as they're too worn to work well. But ideally if possible switch to better screws: Pozidriv, Robertson or Torx.</p>

","<p>Your milage will vary.  I think it will depend on a lot of factors beyond the wood - type of screw used, screw head, method of driving them, temperature, etc.</p>

<p>Some ways to make it easier to drive and avoid snapping the screw are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Larger pilot hole</li>
<li>Larger screw, if possible (with a larger pilot hole)</li>
<li>Lubricate the screws - a bar of soap works well</li>
<li>Select a screw that does not cam out (slip out and strip the head) easily - robertson, torx, pozidriv</li>
<li>Choose a screw made from a harder material - avoid brass</li>
<li>Use an impact driver to drive the screw</li>
<li>Use a screw with a higher number of threads per inch</li>

<p>I've heard of people using a router bit in a drill press, but I've never heard a reputable source recommend doing it. Personally, I wouldn't try it myself. A drill press runs 10-100x slower than a router, so I wouldn't expect a smooth cut on the drill press.</p>

<p>With what I have available this would be easier than constantly stopping my saw to adjust my fence to enlarge my dadoes. </p>

<p>I could easily see this being a bad idea since the blade kerfs <em>could</em> touch while the saw is operating. Also sawdust might get stuck between the blades. Has anyone tried this before?</p>
","<p>There's another factor you're not considering: torque requirements. There's a reason the majority of dado sets are 6"" or 8"" in diameter. Most table saws won't have the power to run a 10"" set. A 10"" set will require 25% more torque than an 8"" set, and 67% more torque than a 6"" set.</p>

"How do I temporarily attach two pieces of wood together for machining?","4704","","<p>How do I temporarily attach two pieces of wood together, face to face, in a way that's strong enough that I can, say, run it through a saw, but that doesn't leave marks on the wood or get in the way of the tool?</p>

<p>For example, let's say I have a piece of wood with jagged edges and I want to temporarily stick it on another piece of wood with a straight edge so I can guide it along a table saw or router fence.</p>

<ul>
<li>Clamps get in the way of the table, and are sometimes hard to position accurately.</li>
<li>Wood glue is permanent.</li>
<li>Screws and nails leave holes.</li>
<li>Two sided tape is thick and squishy (has some play, no good esp. on a router), leaves residue.</li>
</ul>

<p>How can I do this? I have this struggle a lot.</p>
","<p>As sketchy as it sounds masking tape and superglue (cyano or CA) can work very well for this type of thing. Many people have relied on types of double-sided tape, carpet tape being particularly favoured for its strong hold, for this sort of job for many years, but the hold can tend to creep with continual strain especially during warmer weather. And as you also mention it can leave a bothersome residue on the wood. Masking tape and superglue almost completely resolve both issues.</p>

<p>What you do is put tape on both pieces and simply superglue the tape together. Shown better than I can describe it in words in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub6PsY4cgwg"">this YouTube video</a> from Crimson Custom Guitars.</p>

<p>Masking tape is of course purpose-made not to leave residue and the thinner glue layer means it's less subject to creep. And the hold of the superglue is very strong and rigid, but despite this you can pop the two pieces apart with minimal prying. The masking tape then peels from the wood with ease.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wood glue is permanent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Something to help with this is to glue a piece of paper in between the two pieces of wood. This is often done with corner blocks to allow conventional clamping of mitres for example. I'm not actually a big fan of this method overall (works best if using hide glue for one thing) but I thought I'd mention the tip.</p>

"What is special about wood glue?","4696","","<p>Whenever I'm joining wood together, no matter what type of joint, I turn to wood glue. But there are other glues out there, such as epoxies and Gorilla Glue. It seems the alternatives are very strong and capable, but people only turn to them under special circumstances.</p>

<p>What is it about wood glue that makes it the best choice for common joinery?</p>
","<p>I assume you're talking about PVA glue. I think it just has a lot of desirable properties. Off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li>Water-based and non-toxic - no nasty fumes or health risks. This also means that it is easy to clean off of benches, brushes etc.</li>
<li>Dries quickly enough that you don't have to leave parts in clamps for several days, but not so quickly that you have to work too fast with it. This also means that if necessary then you can clamp pieces together, then pull them apart and reposition them if needed within 15 minutes or so. In colder temperatures you may still be able to reposition the parts for an hour or more.</li>
<li>Is pre-mixed, single-part (i.e. not a two-part epoxy or powder which requires mixing up in batches to use). This means that there's no real preparation of the glue needed - just pour some out of a bottle and use it for a couple of hours (again depending on temperature).</li>
<li>Is at a good viscosity to soak into the wood by the right amount to form a strong joint. Also means you can brush it onto a joint in the correct amounts and it won't just run off over your shop floor.</li>
<li>Dries clear - joints do not have obvious glue lines.</li>
<li>Is relatively cheap.</li>
<li>Is stable enough in different environments (heat, humidity) when cured.</li>
<li>Is flexible enough not to be too brittle when cured.</li>
<li>Gives no risk of gluing fingers together unlike cyanoacrylate (""super"") glues.</li>
<li>Versatility - can also be used as a sealer or primer for certain finishes / applications.</li>
<li>Has been used reliably for many years.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other glues which may be stronger etc. but these are often epoxy or animal glues which take time to mix together and once mixed have a limited working life, otherwise they may be toxic or have nasty fumes, require special preparation or be more expensive.</p>

<p>In summary, PVA is good (strong etc.) enough for most applications whilst also being cheap and easy to work with.</p>

<p>One negative that may be little-known is that PVA joints can ""creep"" which means that the glue stretches and the joint moves under long term load. For most applications this is not a significant issue though. It's for this reason that animal glues are more useful for things like gluing guitar necks where the joint is under near constant pressure and any movement in the joint would ruin the product or assembly.</p>

<h1>Common/Uncommon Type Breakdown</h1>

<p>There could be a lot of bleed over between these categories but I think we could cover some good ground if we look at the different plane <em>types</em> (Although I have never heard this term they can also be called <em>type studies</em>). So that way if you see a plane you can get an idea of its purpose and know whether or not you need it in your collection. Again, this list is not meant to be extensive as there are many other types and some specialty types. The webpage <a href=""http://www.supertool.com/StanleyBG/stan0a.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Patrick's Blood and Gore</a> covers them more then we ever could in this format. </p>

<p><strong>Block</strong></p>

<p>These planes are smaller in size (Not to be confused with finger planes which are even smaller) and many can be worked with one hand. Usually easy to spot because of their size and the handle is also usually the cap iron/chipbreaker (at least for metal construction variety.) so you hand, while working the tool, would rest of over the iron. They specialize in end grain.</p>

<p><strong>Jack</strong></p>

<p>Hopefully it is safe to say that this would be one of the most common plane type you will run into. The ""Jack of all trades"" plane is what you would picture when you think of a plane. Metal ones should have a knob and a tote(handle) and the body would hide the plane iron inside ( as supposed to something like a rabbet plane.). Wooden one might not have a knob but would be about the same length. They are also shorter than a jointer plane but tend to be larger than the smoother. This is a general roughing plane. used before a jointer or a smoother depending on the project. </p>

<p><strong>Jointer</strong></p>

<p>These are some of the easier ones to spot as they are the family of long planes given there nature of true up panel faces and edges. You can expect these to be near or exceeding 20 inches long. The plane in your picture surely is a corrugated jointer plane.</p>

<p><strong>Smoothing</strong></p>

<p>These can be seen as slightly smaller jack planes. As far as metal planes the anatomy of these and jacks are very similar. Smoothing can be also seen in how the blade is sharpened. In that the edges are <em>slightly</em> curved as to prevent making grooves in the work. The blade is sharpened, in such a way, does <em>not</em> solely mean that plane is a smoothing plane. The iron can also be placed at a much higher angle. It is designed to make very fine shavings. </p>

<p><strong>Finger</strong></p>

<p>This one is fairly simple. These are <em>really</em> tiny planes. Some of them are functional but there a number of novelty ones out there. Meant for really detailed work like on carvings. </p>

<p><strong>Rebate/Shoulder</strong></p>

<p>Rebate planes and shoulder planes have the same basic design characteristic. The blade is the same width as the body. The body will have opening on both sides to allow the blade to extend the width of the tool. Rebate/Shoulder are not really tool synonyms while they perform the same function the shoulder plane has a more acute angle so that it can cut end grain better (Like that of a tenon shoulder).</p>

<p><strong>Router</strong></p>

<p>Plane with a large, typically round, sole. Blade can be moved up and down in the mouth of the plane. Modern varieties have can be two knobs for handles. The large sole acts as a fence so the tool can move about in a recess.</p>

<p><strong>Compass</strong></p>

<p>Plane with an adjustable sole that can cut uniform convex and concave surfaces. Adjustable sole is the key identifying feature here which is just a thin plate. </p>

<p><strong>Moudling</strong></p>

<p>These planes are easy to spot as well. There are a wide variety of planes that are called moulding planes. Most blades are not simple rectangular blades with flat edges. Used for making curves, hollows, beads and other more complication moudling cuts. Blades would have the same shape as the cutting edge of modern bits for a powered router. This is huge category. </p>

<p><strong>Scraper</strong></p>

<p>This one works just like a card scraper except that there is a body and handle to hold the card/blade as supposed to free hand. Blade is installed in near vertical position.</p>

<p><strong>Grooving/Plow</strong></p>

<p>Similar type of planes that can be used to cut tongue and groove (Older wooden varieties came in a matched pair) and rabbets. The blades were not that wide and the had fences to govern depth of cut and help run along a boards edge. The tongue blade would have a gap in the center and the matched blade sized for aforementioned gap. </p>

<p><strong>Combination/Universal</strong></p>

<p>If you were to spout the phrase ""I like planes and plane accessories"" you most definitely own a combination plane. Easy to spot, if the set is near complete, as you will find many additional parts depending on what you want to do with it at any given moment in time. </p>

<p>These planes can usually be identified by the multiple fences and fence attachments. More easily spotted if you see the interchangeable blades. The blades, depending on what is available given the planes manufacturer, would be able to do moulding, rabbeting, beading, ooges, grooves.... the list goes on. </p>

<p>These names are likely different / vary between regions. If another name comes up we should edit the post to cover the varieties. </p>

"What is the difference between hardwood and softwood?","4689","","<p>I never really thought about it until after reading some of the questions in this forum. </p>

<p>What is the difference between hardwood and softwood. To clarify I am not interested in their applications but understanding where it comes from and 
how it is classified. </p>
","<p>Hardwood is usually from a deciduous tree and softwood is usually from a coniferous one. Hardwoods typically have a higher density(hence hardwood).</p>

<h1>Seriously?</h1>

<p>For the most part that is the <em>general</em> accepted (although broad) definition and yes there are several exceptions. </p>

<h1>Little more than that please</h1>

<p>Much like identifying wood species; determining if a particular wood is soft or hard depends on the kind of tree it came from. More specifically </p>

<p><strong>Hardwood</strong></p>

<p>Comes from <em>dicot angiosperm</em> which mean the tree reproduces with flowers and most have broad leaves that are shed in response to natural climate change or drought. There are several species of evergreen that fit into this category as well. These evergreens are usually located in more tropical/subtropical zones.</p>

<p>Hardwood trees have large vessels for transporting water. These pores are responsible for the grain appearance in hardwood and are best seen under microscope.</p>

<p><strong>Softwood</strong></p>

<p>Almost all softwood comes from <em>gymnosperm</em> plants such as conifers or also known as coniferous trees. Where hardwood tree use flowers for reproduction softwood trees use seeds, such as cones. Conversely to hardwood, water and sap are transported via <em>medullary rays</em> and <em>tracheids</em> which can appear corrugated (like cardboard).</p>

<h1>Comparison</h1>

<p>As mentioned before, the best way to be sure is to examine the wood under microscope. In the hardwood you can see the ""pores"" shown as large holes (In the diagram below it is the picture on top). Softwood does not have visible pores. </p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Hard_Soft_Wood.jpg/250px-Hard_Soft_Wood.jpg"" alt=""Wood Under Scope""></p>

<p><sup>Picture comes from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardwood"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a></sup></p>

<h1>Notable exceptions</h1>

<p>Just because a wood is classified as soft does not mean it is necessarily softer than a hardwood. There is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janka_hardness_test"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wide range</a> of hardness when it comes to the <strong>many</strong> species of trees.
I mentioned earlier that there are a couple of exceptions as far as the generic hardwood/softwood definition are concerned. </p>

<li><p><strong>Yew</strong>: Is actually a hard softwood.</p></li>

I've heard of people using beeswax on cast iron, so that might be an option. Do I need to be concerned about wax applied to the table surface rubbing off on workpieces, possibly causing finishing problems? Does a wax coating last, and does it provide adequate protection against corrosion?</p>

<p>Are there any other protective coatings for iron that I should consider?</p>
","<p>Various people swear by different rust prevention products for cast iron tops, but unfortunately not everyone is able to achieve the same results. In 2012 Fine Woodworking did a <a href=""http://www.finewoodworking.com/how-to/article/the-best-rust-preventers.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">torture test</a> on tool steel and cast iron, and found that many popular ""tried and true"" rust prevention products did ok on tool steel but many did not perform as well on cast iron. Some of the results even seemingly contradicted the previous results published in FWW--for example, a <a href=""http://www.finewoodworking.com/how-to/qa/camellia-oil-outscores-other-rust-preventers.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">different article</a> highly recommended camellia oil over anything else, but in the torture test many other treatments outperformed it, even on tool steel. In fact, if you look at the Amazon reviews for the products that did do well in FWW's test, you'll see that many people's results were inconsistent with Fine Woodworking's findings. Unfortunately, there's no guaranteed winner.</p>

<p>Silicone-free paste wax is a common recommendation. Silicone can come off on your wood. If this happens, it can cause birds-eye spotting when you go to apply finish, and according to George Vondriska of the Woodworkers Guild of America, it can also prevent glue from adhering properly.</p>

<p>The typical recommendation for any type of protective finish is to strip and reapply protectant every 2-3 months. If you're in a humid region, I'd suggest going no more than 2 months. If you're in a dry region, you may be able to go a long time.</p>

<p>Personally, I've been using Boeshield T9, which is a pain because it dries tacky and requires a coat of wax on top to allow wood to slide smoothly. I'm not convinced T9 is any better than any other treatment. Even with that double treatment, my saw top started to show light rust in one place after just barely 2 months. However, I reapplied after removing the rust, and through the entire following winter it was fine without any additional treatments.</p>

"Should I finish before, during, or after assembly?","4598","","<p>I'm building some pretty basic bookshelves. I intend to assemble them with glue. I also intend to sand them, apply stain, shellac, and polyurethane.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I finish after assembly it's hard to get in tight places, or e.g. apply polyurethane on vertical surfaces without it thickening at the bottom, etc. It is also hard to sand in corners. But if I finish first it interferes with glue and I sometimes damage the finish. I can't find a good technique.</p>
","<p>Yes, yes and yes. I think some pre-finishing should be done almost routinely, but doing so is not nearly as common as it could be. </p>

<p>It should be said that the type of the finish plays a big part in how important pre-finishing can be, if you're wiping on a penetrating finish for example it's far less beneficial than it would be if you were spraying lacquer where hard-to-reach can in fact become impossible-to-finish.</p>

<p>Regardless of finish type though, one very important aspect of any degree of pre-finishing is protecting your mating surfaces as you touch on in the Question. Joints <em>must</em> remain bare wood or the strength of the glued join is severely compromised.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I: Dry fit, glue, sand, finish? Or dry fit, sand, stain, glue, shellac, polyurethane? Or some other order? In your experience what order leads to the least amount of mistakes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It very much depends on the size and complexity of the piece. For a simple jewellery box for example no finishing prior to final assembly will generally make it any easier to complete the box. </p>

<p>Since you asked about bookshelves, on shelving units that have moveable shelves the shelves are commonly finished ahead of the case, simply because otherwise you don't have access to all six sides of the board. And if doing that it makes sense to finish the interior while the shelves aren't there to get in the way, and then of course there's no reason not to tackle the outside surfaces while you're at it. Last step then would be to install the finished shelves into the finished case. But on a shelving unit with fixed shelves applying finish after final assembly wouldn't be unusual; that's not to say it should be done this way, pre-finish if you find it beneficial.</p>

<p>Frame-and-panel work is a good example of where some pre-finishing really has to be done for a good result. If you don't finish the panel prior to fitting it into the frame any shrinkage later on it will reveal unfinished wood at the edges which is very unsightly:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6AyJj.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6AyJj.jpg"" alt=""Panel, unfinished edge revealed""></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But if I finish first it interferes with glue </p>

<p>As mentioned above this is very important, the joint faces must not have finish on them. Being careful with how you apply the finish is a start, but if you want to be thorough then it's worth taking the time to protect them (<em>all</em> of them) with tape prior to the application of any finish.</p>

<p>So you tape as much as the project requires, from a little:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ucGt6.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ucGt6.jpg"" alt=""Taped joints 1""></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and I sometimes damage the finish. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the area where I think pre-finishing presents a definite challenge. There's always the chance of some slight damage while manoeuvring pre-finished parts, particularly since we'd normally be handling the pieces long before the finish has achieved its final hardness (this can take weeks).</p>

<p>Obvious advice is to work very carefully and mindfully but everyone can make a mistake so some precautions can certainly be advisable. One that is sometimes used is to cover the bench or assembly table with something soft, e.g. with a clean scrap of carpet or a blanket. This should slightly overhang the front edge so that a bump there isn't a wood-on-wood contact. Some woodworkers even have carpet-lined vice jaws (as part of a set of removable jaws) to be able to hold finished pieces in the vice if necessary.</p>

<hr>

<p>Couple of bits unrelated to the main question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>apply polyurethane on vertical surfaces without it thickening at the bottom, </p>

<p>Highly recommend trying wiping application. Simply thin your regular poly in a clean container and you convert it into ""wiping varnish"". Then wipe it on. </p>

<p>Technically you don't have to do anything to it, many people have MDF benchtops with no finish on them. The moisture in the air is basically a non-issue for MDF, it's only liquid water that you need to be concerned with. </p>

<p>On a separate durability issue however, the edges of MDF are fairly friable and prone to damage. If you're OK with your bench taking its licks and showing it that's fine, use it as-is. But many people edge their MDF benchtops with strips of wood (hardwood or softwood, your preference):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EexHj.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EexHj.jpg"" alt=""MDF workbench tops""></a></p>

<p>As I think you can see the MDF in these benches appears to be without a finish.</p>

<p>In addition to adding durability to knocks and scrapes solid wood edging strips effectively cover the cut edges of the MDF and hence add quite a bit of water-resistance at the same time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>light spillages</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you do expect you'll spill water on the bench then it is a good idea to apply a finish. Many people use a traditional workbench finish: a couple of coats of oil (usually BLO or tung oil), but you'll be better off if you use varnish as it is far more waterproofing (and the MDF far more prone to damage from water than the traditional solid wood). </p>

<p>Dilute at least the first couple of coats of your varnish by about 1:1 with added spirits to improve penetration, then two full-strength coats if you want very high levels of water-resistance.</p>

"How to make a recess in a board","4530","","<p>I want to make a wood board where I can place my phone in the middle, and the screen of the phone will be flush with the surface of the board. Basically the phone would be recessed inside the board.</p>

<p>For example, if my phone is 10mm thick and my board is 20mm thick, I want to make a recess 10mm thick to match the phone and have a 10mm backing behind it, and preferably no other markings anywhere on the board.</p>

<p>I can't seem to think of a way to make the recess. Any advice?</p>
","<p>The recess you're looking to make is in essence a shallow mortise, much like the type used to hold the stone in a traditional oilstone box.</p>

<p>The most basic way to do this is with a chisel and mallet, after carefully marking out and, ideally, knifing the edges of the recess you want to make (the knife-cut lines help produce clean edges). </p>

<p>It must be said, this is easier said than done and getting a flat, horizontal bottom to the mortise in particular is challenging to do just with a chisel. For this reason the bulk of the material is often taken out by chisel and the final flattening of the bottom is done using a router. This is a hand router, not a modern power tool. Where one is not available the chisel router or ""poor-man's router"" is a cheap, reasonably effective alternative than can be made in just minutes.</p>

<p>The above method is shown well on <a href=""https://paulsellers.com/2014/11/steps-to-making-a-traditional-oilstone-box/"">this page</a> from Paul Sellers.</p>

<p>If the bottom of the mortise doesn't need to be absolutely featureless a lot of the grunt work can be done by drilling away the excess wood, as mentioned by Paul above. The most-used bit for this purpose these days is a Forstner bit, which will leave a small hole in the centre of an otherwise flat circle as you can see in the link below. </p>

<p>This method is shown in brief on <a href=""http://norsewoodsmith.com/content/oil-stone-boxes"">this page</a> of the Norse Woodsmith site.</p>

<p>Note that Forstner bits are best used with a drill press or with a power drill held in a drill stand. </p>

<p><strong>Router</strong><br>
If a modern power router is available it is simplicity itself to cut a recess like this, you can freehand the cut to close to your marked lines and then trim the edges by hand, carefully chopping with a chisel. </p>

<p>Or you can make a template and with a suitable bearing bit in the router you'll cut a near-perfect rectangle through the hole in the template. The corners will naturally be slightly rounded and normally these would be squared up, again using a chisel, but for a phone it may actually be favourable to have rounded corners. </p>

<p>Note: you may want to provide a cutout on one of the straight sides to allow you to lift the phone from the recess. Especially in the case of a very neat fit the phone might be very difficult to remove from a deep recess otherwise!</p>

"Should I pre-drill before nailing?","4499","","<p>I know that pre-drilling before screwing has many advantages but am wondering if pre-drilling is also useful for nailing. Pre-drilling for nailing seems to make sense because nailing also causes wood splitting. But, it may be disadvantageous because it may reduce the power to grip the nails, making them loose. </p>

<p>Should I pre-drill before nailing or not? </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Should I pre-drill before nailing or not? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately the answer to this is, it depends. </p>

<p>With certain woods, particularly when nailing near the ends of boards, pre-drilling can be advisable. A different fix when nailing near the end of a board is to leave the board over-long (where possible) and then cut to length after the nails have been driven home. This is often done on decking boards.</p>

<p>When nailing along the length of a board another way to lessen the tendency towards splitting is to stagger nail positions so that you're not driving the nails in aligned with the grain:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VzcmP.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VzcmP.jpg"" alt=""Staggered v. unstaggered nailing""></a></p>

<p>In case you're unaware, the type of nail matters here. Nails with blunt tips, perhaps counter-intuitively, split wood less than sharp nails because they crush wood fibres as they go in rather than parting the wood ahead of them (working like a wedge). And oval nails are better than round nails as long as the long axis is oriented correctly, in line with the grain.</p>

<p>Where the nails you're using are sharp and you'd like to take advantage of the effect of a blunt tip a very old tip is to put the head of the nail on a hard surface and tap the tip with the hammer to blunt it, but it's very easy with soft wire nails for this blunting blow to bend the nail slightly. So it's much more reliable to snip the tip off the nail with side snips or pliers. Nails are commonly only mild steel wire and even with a beefy nail this isn't too difficult to do.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But, it may be disadvantageous because it may reduce the power to grip the nails, making them loose. </p>

<p>If the hole is drilled full size that will occur. The drilled hole should be undersized, roughly 75% of the diameter of the nail.</p>

","<p>The faceplate you use screws to secure the piece you are going to turn.
some people will glue a waste piece to what they are turning so they don't have to put screw holes in their work piece.</p>

So you either need to drill/turn one of two things.  A tenon for the chuck to clamp down on, or a recess to put the chuck in and expand it to hold.</p>

<p>Now the faceplate holds very well with the screws, so if you are doing heavy work by rounding out the bowl a face plate is very nice.  A chuck is more likely to let the piece go if it is really rough or lopsided.  </p>

"How do I de-nib polyurethane after it dries but still maintain its finish?","4134","","<p>Sometimes when I apply polyurethane, for whatever reason, it's not completely smooth. Maybe a brush mark here and there, or a couple little nibs, etc.</p>

<p>The advice I see often is to sand the area lightly with a high grit sand paper.</p>

<p>When I do this, even when I sand <em>very</em> lightly, like one low pressure pass with 400 or 600 or even 1000, the texture comes out nice and smooth but the polyurethane is always scuffed with little white marks.</p>

<p>How do I avoid or remove the scuffing? How do I actually smooth nibs and other small irregularities out of polyurethane? The frequent advice to sand lightly is either incorrect, incomplete, or I'm missing something. I have never had success.</p>

<p>Also does the technique vary for gloss vs matte/satin?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>How do I avoid or remove the scuffing? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically you can't. Until you get to really high grits (way above P1200) you <em>will</em> see the scratches and these are not suitable for de-nibbing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do I smooth polyurethane after it dries but still maintain its finish?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In general you don't <em>just</em> sand, you then polish the surface. Wet-sanding will reduce the scratch pattern somewhat as well, compared to sanding at the same grit dry, but the main 'secret' is that you then use some polishing agents to buff/polish the surface. </p>

<p>Traditionally the polishing of a dry finish was done with something like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_stone"" rel=""nofollow"">rottenstone</a>. This is still in use today by some, particularly traditionalists, some high-end woodworkers and professional finishers/restorers. </p>

<p>You can in theory do this entirely with abrasive paper or film, but you have to go to extremely high grits and these can be quite costly. While that is how some do it it's really not necessary, today I think most people use something like an automotive finish polish e.g. Simichrome, Flitz or T-Cut to rub out the finish to its final high gloss.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do I actually sand a nib out of polyurethane? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can use the abrasives you're already using, but another tip you might like to try is to use the rough side of brown paper. This is just abrasive enough to take most nibs off without the risk of rubbing through the finish. It will leave the surface visibly less glossy, although if you buff hard you can get some polish back (essentially giving you something like a satin or semi-gloss finish with care).</p>

<p>The ideal situation might be considered to be where you don't need to sand any nibs or imperfections, and if you set up a dedicated finish room or zone where fluff or dust are kept to a minimum that's theoretically possible. But in practice this is something you will have to deal with sometimes so it's good to have a process ready to tackle it when it does occur.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> wiping on varnish can nearly eliminate problems with dust nibs (also brush marks, runs and drips). The downside is that because you're applying the varnish so much more thinly build is much slower and it can take many more coats (7+) to get to a fully-built finish.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also does the technique vary for gloss vs matte/satin?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You're not supposed to work over the surface of reduced-sheen varnishes, anything from matt to satin or semi-gloss should ideally be applied and left alone. </p>

<p>At the pro or high-end level the goal with these is to get a smooth build using gloss and then apply one coat, two at the outside, of the reduced-sheen varnish as a final coat. Obviously you take great pains to try to ensure you don't have any dust in the environment before the final coat goes on.</p>

<p>A better way to achieve a sheen below fully glossy is to scuff the surface of gloss varnish. You can easily get anything from a subtle satin to full matt depending on the coarseness of the abrasive used (powdered pumice, fine grades of steel or bronze wool, Scotch-Brite or an equivalent).</p>

Although they have not brought a product to market as of April 2015, a <a href=""http://www.whirlwindtool.com/2012/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=88&amp;Itemid=75"">press release</a> states that Whirlwind Tool is looking for someone to buy or license their technology. According to the press release, the company was apparently tied up in litigation from 2012 until possibly early 2015 (the press release is not clear on the end date). This is the only active safety device for a table saw that can be retrofitted onto an existing table saw, and the company has named the device <em>Black Box</em>.</p>

<h2>How each system works</h2>

<p>SawStop's namesake safety system uses a one-time-use spring-loaded cartridge to push a perforated piece of aluminum into the blade and causes the blade's transferred rotational inertia to pull the blade below the table. The blade brake stops the blade in less than 5 milliseconds, but it can damage the blade and must be replaced after each activation.</p>

<p>Bosch's REAXX system uses a two-sided cartridge (reportedly based on Bosch's airbag deployment technology) to push the blade below the table while the blade spins down naturally. Bosch's system does not damage the blade and the cartridge can be flipped around and used a second time before it must be replaced.</p>

<p>The Whirlwind Tool Black Box differs from the other two systems in that it does not sense flesh contact directly through the blade. Instead, it <a href=""http://whirlwindtool.com/2012/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=78&amp;Itemid=64"">detects the proximity of flesh</a> to a blade guard. When the blade guard detects flesh within a certain distance, it triggers a non-destructive blade brake which stops the blade in 1/8 second (which may be fast enough to prevent an injury since the brake is supposed to activate <em>before</em> flesh contact with the blade).</p>

"What is the best way to cut pergola ends?","4071","","<p>I want to cut some of those decorative ends in a pergola that I'm making. I know that I can trace a pattern onto wood, cut with a jigsaw, rinse and repeat. I'm looking for a way to speed it up, and make the cuts more uniform. I was thinking perhaps I would make a template, use that template to route a shallow guide line, then quickly saw through all of the rest of it using the jigsaw. Any more  suggestions?</p>
","<h1>It depends on your pattern</h1>

<p>Most of the suggestions on the web refer to using the jigsaw for cutting patterns. It is the ideal choice for this work as some patterns are intricate with arcs and what not. </p>

<p>What you could do with the jigsaw is use your template as a guide. If your arcs or curves are simple enough you can shift the template down from where the cut will be. This might be difficult depending on the plate of your jigsaw and angles in your design.</p>

<p>That does not mean you are limited to just the jigsaw and the hand cramps that might ensue. Depending on your pattern you might be able to use some other tools to do the work as well.</p>

<p><strong>Mitre Saw</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rW5Tq.jpg"" alt=""Mitre Saw helping the pattern""></p>

<p>The jigsaw cuts a full arc across the board and then the mitre saw cuts the 45 degree angle. Yes you could have done this all with the jigsaw but this is cleaner and faster. The pencil mark on the saw is a guide so you don't need to measure every time. </p>

<p><strong>Circular Saw</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QHWwQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>A simple pattern like that could <em>almost</em> be done just with a circular saw. I doubt that is your pattern but one of the cuts might be. </p>

<p>You could make a simple jig for the saw using another board as a cutting guide. </p>

<p><strong>Pattern Bit on a router</strong></p>

<p>If your boards are thin enough, and you have a appropriately sized bit, you might be able just to use a pattern bit on your router (assuming it's big enough). I have never tried a router as of yet but depending on how many cuts you need to make this might be over-kill for the router. </p>

<p>Even if your bits were long enough you could flip the board and template to cut from both sides. In theory giving you that perfect cut you are looking for. </p>

<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>

<p>You didn't show us what <em>you</em> are doing. Hopefully there might be a way of incorporating other tools into your template to help with that repeatable precision you are looking for. Much like <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/1511/128"">Caleb suggested</a> your jigsaw and pencil will be your main tools here. </p>

<p>From the ground though I don't think people are going to be paying attention to the intricacy of your cuts. Using a router I think is wasted effort.</p>

<p><strong>What is the strongest join for splayed legs?</strong></p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>What is the strongest join for splayed legs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As is almost always the case with this type of question there is no one clear winner. There are numerous joints — including some unconventional/less seen choices — that would be <em>strong enough</em>, which is all that's needed. </p>

<p>Also, the particular joint chosen would be dictated by the form of the apron (if any) and that is an open question in the overall design of the piece....</p>

<p>In the two images posted <em>neither</em> table appears to use an apron.</p>

<p>In the second if you look closely it seems that there is an X-shaped brace centred on the tabletop, with the legs attached to the end of each arm of the X (maybe with a bridle joint) and then possibly pegged in place, although those could be wood plugs hiding a metal faster of some kind.</p>

<p>In the first it looks like there might be an X-shaped brace also, although flat to the table. Or possibly just a flat plate or flange attached to the tops of the legs. In either case, they could be screwed onto the leg tops from above, then the edges of the X or flange could be screwed to the table from underneath.</p>

<p>Of these two the system in the second image is the stronger option by far, so if the choice were between these two then go with that.</p>

<p>If a more conventional apron is preferred then the apron/leg joint should probably remain what it is most commonly: a mortise and tenon. Somewhat like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GaFiK.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GaFiK.jpg"" alt=""Splayed mortise and tenon""></a></p>

<p>Note: if the splay on the legs is fairly pronounced I think an open-topped mortise should be avoided here (possibly also a haunched tenon if you want to be extra-cautious). A regular enclosed tenon would provide maximum strength for the forces applied to the joint by the splay of the legs.</p>

<p>Another alternative worth considering is the type of joint often used on commercial splay-legged coffee tables and sideboards:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KvJ4T.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KvJ4T.jpg"" alt=""Angled cleat for splayed leg""></a></p>

<p>These rely on a ""pre-installed industrial strength fastening system"" (just a large threaded insert) so could be strong enough for the legs on a dining table, as they are for quite sizeable sideboards; albeit these have much shorter legs they are substantially heavier than a tabletop, even without things stored inside.</p>
","2594"
"How can I ensure my threaded inserts go in straight?","3919","","<p>I'm putting threaded inserts into a MDF base.  When I start to screw the insert in, the thread digs in at an angle and pulls the entire insert in at that angle.  I thought it would straighten out when it got further down the hole, but it still managed to go in kattywompus.  Now, the knob and bolt look like some tower in Pisa.</p>

<p>What tricks can I use to ensure a threaded insert goes in straight?  Is this just a problem because I'm using MDF instead of hardwood?</p>
","<p>There are specialised drivers for these which might help -- or you could make your own by using a bolt with one or two ""jam nuts"" to keep the insert from gravelling up the threads. Use a long enough bolt to make any tilt more visible, hold it straight, drive the insert, and back the bolt out of the insert (backing off the jam nuts if necessary).</p>

<p>Promised illustration: I didn't have an insert handy, so you'll just have to imagine that the dark cap nut is the insert. Assemble like so, preferably with a longer bolt</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HdviRm.jpg"" alt=""bolt with jam nut and mock threaded insert""></p>

<p>Then tighten the nut down firmly against the insert. This will force the nut to press up against the bolt's threads while pressing the insert down; that outward pressure should produce enough friction to lock both against rotating on the bolt. Now drive this assembly into the wood as if it were a screw, using the bolt as both guide and lever to make sure it goes in straight. Once the insert has been set, you should be able to hold the bolt in place while loosening the ""jam nut"", releasing the bolt and nut from the insert.</p>

<p>If you're driving several, a slightly more elegant version would be to use two nuts, locked against each other, at the right point for a washer (optional but can't hurt)and the insert to slip on below them. This is driven the same way, but you should then be able to back the bolt and locked jamnuts out of the insert as a unit without having to do anything special to the nuts; just leave them locked. Obviously that means your inserting tool is immediately ready to be loaded with another insert.</p>

<p>(Feel free to use a bolt with another head design, whatever you've got a good driver for -- this is just what came to hand first.)</p>

<p>As I said, there are commercially made drivers which operate on the same principle: thread the insert on, drive, back the threads out. If you're doing a lot of these that might be an investment worth considering. But for just a few, this does the job.</p>

<p><strong>Late Addition:</strong> Some inserts are designed to be driven with a hex key, which has many of the same advantages.</p>

"Can I run pressure treated deck boards through thickness planer?","3870","","<p>I inherited a deck with my new house.  I'm thinking about resurfacing the deck because the boards are badly discoloured, although they appear to be structurally sound.  </p>

"How can I fabricate a wooden cone?","3859","","<p>I need to make a wooden cone that is slightly smaller than the smallest traffic cone available commercially.  My guess is that it will definitely require a table router.  Is that correct and are there any other tools that would be necessary in the process.  I would use a roughly 12"" piece of 6x6 to carve it out of.</p>
","<p>If you don't have access to a lathe, you can cut a series of wedges with a band saw and/or a table saw. connect them all together in an ""almost cone"" and sand down the edges until it's fairly conical. The narrower your wedges, the more conical you'll get. The angle for each wedge is easily calculated. Where N is your number of wedges, 360/N gives you the inner angle.</p>

<p>From here you have a near-conical blank. You can either sand down the edges or use a router jig like in  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUA3lryix64"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this video</a>: a spindle in a box with a router sliding on top. To get a cone, you could angle the spindle. Perhaps if you wanted to get fancy, you could make the spindle adjustable to make different angled cones/tapers.  </p>

<p>TX Turner's comment has another good reference for a <a href=""http://customfurnitureandfab.com/how-to-make-fluted-or-beaded-columns"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jig meant to go on a lathe</a> which could be modified to do tapers, but I don't think it would be too difficult to fabricate something similar as a standalone contraption.</p>

<p><strong>In short:</strong><br>
1: Cut a bunch of wedges from rectangular blocks. If you glued them together at this stage, it would make a near-cylindrical drum.<br>
2: make a diagonal cut into each wedge to make the triangular size of the cone   you need.<br>
3: Glue them together into a conical blank.<br>
4: Sand the corners down or use a router jig.

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qHMdv.jpg"" alt=""alternating clamps for a panel glue-up""></p>

<p>Another solution is to clamp boards down across the panel as Drew suggested, although an even better variation on this solution is to use cauls, which start out curved but evenly distribute the pressure across the surface as they are flexed flat against both sides of the panel.</p>

<p>But even if you use both of the above solutions, your panel can still bow and warp with changes in humidity, so it's important to let it acclimate first, as Matt suggested, by letting it sit for at least a week or two, assuming the lumber was already kiln-dried or adequately air-dried. If possible, let it acclimate to the environment in which it will ultimately be used--for example, if it will be in your dining room, let it acclimate inside your house.</p>

<p>You can also minimize movement by using quartersawn lumber and cutting out the pith. If you're stuck using the typically low-quality lumber from a home center, the best you can do may be to look at the grain direction and alternate it every other board, so one board will cup downward, the next will cup upward, the next downward, etc.</p>

<p>In the past I have always used brackets but this is because the shelves were normally in the middle of a wall and not spanning it from one side of the room to the other. However, in this project the shelves will be just as pictured above although the length of each shelf will be greater. Also, I had never heard of cleats until now.</p>

<li>Used for holding a couple of large bottles of detergent and then smaller odds and ends</li>
</ul>

<p>Is this the correct usage of cleats and, assuming it is, are there advantages to using them that make them a better choice than using brackets?</p>
","<p>My comments were running long, so I figured I'd make an answer out of this.</p>

<p>If you have a nook that you're putting the shelf in, similar to your ""cleats"" link, then you should be able to use the cleat method, just like in that link. Since you're spanning from one side of the room to the other, you should be able to put your edge cleats on the side walls and fully support your shelf. The front rail of the shelf will help prevent bowing of the board, but for a 2m run, you'll end up with more than a bottle of detergent and a couple of odds-and-ends up there, and you'll need more support.</p>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://www.woodbin.com/calcs/sagulator/"" rel=""nofollow"">Sagulator</a>, your 2m x .3m x 1cm shelf in Eastern White Pine (just a random guess on the wood - you said softwood), with a 2.5cm x 5cm (1x2 inches) edging strip (along the front) and an evenly space 30 lbs (14-ish kg) per foot is going to give you .75cm of sag in the middle. </p>

<p>Doubling your shelf thickness to 2cm will reduce that sag to .46cm which they deem an acceptable amount.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use any manner of decorative wooden or metal brackets at stud spacing (18"" (45cm) US) and you should have more than enough support. I went back to the 1cm thick board and increased the load to 45Kg <em>per 30cm</em> to get a 0.002"" deflection.</p>

<p><strong>What should you use?</strong> Whatever is most aesthetically pleasing to you, yet suitable to the load and situation.</p>

<p>If your shelf is not running wall-to-wall, there is no way a single cleat along the rear of the shelf will hold up the shelf itself, to say nothing of the load on it. You'll have to use brackets in that situation, just as you've done in the past.</p>

"Is vertical storage of sheet goods causing my boards to warp?","3563","","<p>I have a consistent problem with warped sheet goods, particularly plywood and MDF. They always seem flat when I buy them, but by the time I use them they are always curved or twisted. It's a source of constant frustration. Even 3/4"" stuff gets a slight curve.</p>

<p>The way I've always stored everything is simply to lean piles of it against a wall. I don't have a lot of space.</p>

<p>After a recent comments discussion it dawned on me that this might be the problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Totally off topic, but how did the MDF warp in the first place? I have this problem where none of my MDF stays straight, and it frustrates me because all I hear about is how stable MDF is. – Jason C </p>
  
  <p>The piece was stored vertically and had leaned a bit in the storage rack causing a slight twist. – Ashlar</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is: Could this be my problem? Can storing these sheets vertically be causing all the warping?</p>

<p>If so, is there a way to store sheet goods vertically without damaging them? I don't have the space to stack them horizontally.</p>
","<p>MDF is heavy and we all know that. Like keshlam says if it is not supported across its vertical span then it will pull itself down slowly warping it. Gravity is a [w]itch.</p>

<p>Now if you cannot store it <em>perfectly</em> vertical then you are not out of options. I couldn't imagine the space needed for some larger sheets however you should be able to get away from perfect verticals as long as you support it. A half a-frame comes to mind in an effort to take up less space. Idea being to discourage as much movement as possible. I could hang onto wood for years until I know what I am doing with it. This should be an efficient use of near vertical space. Depending on design you <em>could</em> hide boards inside the frame as well if you are not up to wasting space.  </p>

<p>Lean the sheet but brace it as much as possible so as to not allow movement. I suppose if you are worried about the edges, which can damage easily, then you could put down some cloth along the bottom to cushion it.</p>

<p>Depending on the size of your sheets this might not be realistic though. Laying it flat also comes to mind but that is not something most workshops can entertain.</p>

  <p>Under what circumstances would I choose which bit? and why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Different bits excel at distinct tasks:</p>

<h2>Forstner/Saw-tooth Bits</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qc8jp.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qc8jp.jpg"" alt=""Forstner""></a> <br>
<sup>(source: <a href=""http://www.leevalley.com/US/wood/page.aspx?cat=1,180,42240&amp;p=45533"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lee Valley</a>)</sup></p>

<p>These bits are excellent if you need a relatively shallow hole with a flat bottom and crisp, clean sides.  The center spur keeps the bit on track to your chosen centerline without walking into porous grain.  Forstner bits are best suited for using in the drill press where they can easily be kept on track.</p>

<p>Forstners are suitable for hogging out waste in mortises.  I have also seen them <a href=""http://blog.lostartpress.com/2013/02/26/unsung-hero-my-drill-press/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">used for half-blind dovetails</a>.</p>

<p>Note that these can have a tendency to follow an adjacent hole and be pulled off course if there is too much overlap.  However, they are more forgiving in this aspect compared to the other bits described below.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Auger Bit</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HLbo8s.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HLbo8s.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Augers have the advantage of having the small screw ""snail"" tip that draws the bit into the wood you are drilling.  They have a tendency to be a bit coarse compared to brad-point bits, though chairmakers do use them for drilling tenons.  Non-powered ones are used quite often with <a href=""http://www.traditionalwoodworker.com/Auger-Bits-for-Hand-Brace/departments/328/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">braces</a>, and I can attest that they can give great results for furniture.</p>

<p>Personally, I have used these for drilling holes in my workbench for holdfasts.  Contractors use them all the time for drilling holes in wooden studs for running wiring.  Since they have a lead screw to draw the bit into the wood, they work best at low RPMs and can be downright dangerous at high RPM.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Spade (Flat) Bit</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lU9Yos.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lU9Yos.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Spade bits are great for quickly cutting a hole through a board.  They are very coarse, but man, do they chew through wood fast.</p>

<p>Generally not used in fine woodworking due to the coarseness.  Also, they are very prone to falling into adjacent holes, so bear that in mind if you have any overlaps.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Brad Point (Spur-tipped) Bit</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sf8ECs.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sf8ECs.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>These bits are great for drilling smaller-sized holes with minimal tearout.  The brad point ensures that the drill centers where you want it instead of skittering around to stick in porous grain.  The edges of the bit on the pointy end have spurs that shear through the face of the wood, leaving a nice, usually tearout free surface.  Also, the sides of the hole will be very crisp and clean.</p>

<p>The brad point is also useful for drilling so that the brad <em>just</em> sticks through the other side, then flipping the piece and completing the hole.  This way, you get tearout-free sides on each face.</p>

<p>These bits have a strong tendency to deflect into adjacent holes if there is overlap, so bear that in mind.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Other Considerations</h2>

<p>Drill bit sets seem nice since you have a wide variety of sizes to choose from all in one place.  However, most craftsmen will use only a portion of the bits and never touch some.  There is something to be said about only buying the tools you need for the job - often you end up spending less in the long run since you buy less tools.  However, if the price is right, then a kit is a good choice.</p>

"I accidentally used woodglue that doesn't stain. How do I fix it?","3545","","<p>I used hidden screws and wood glue on the joints of the legs and supports of a table*. When I started to stain the piece of furniture with a very dark stain, it simply would not take on the areas right around joints and a couple spots where wood glue had dribbled, and I had wiped it off before it dried.</p>

<p>To my despair, I realized that I had accidentally purchased wood glue that does not stain (<em>Titebond Original Wood Glue</em> to be precise). The stain ""beads up"" like water on a hydrophobic surface, and can be just wiped away.</p>

<p>What are my options for fixing this? The several of the ""unstained"" spots are in very visible areas.</p>
","<p>Almost every glue commonly in use won't take stain, and one or two that are said to stain don't stain as well as you'd like (similar story with 'stainable filler' incidentally) so it's good practice generally when glueing to take steps to prevent squeeze-out being left on the surface of the wood. </p>

<p>The main ways people do this include wiping up the glue while it's still liquid, removing the glue when it has partially hardened to a sort of rubbery consistency, waiting for it to fully harden before scraping and/or sanding it off and last but not least taping surfaces to prevent glue getting on them in the first place.</p>

<p>This previous Q&amp;A has more information on this, <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1368/glue-spots-under-stain"">Glue spots under stain</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are my options for fixing this? The several of the ""unstained"" spots are in very visible areas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very thorough sanding or scraping are nearly your only options here, although you could also switch to using 'gel stain' which despite its name is not actually a stain in the conventional sense as it sits on the surface of the wood and doesn't colour it by soaking in.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How deep do I need to sand to make sure the glue is gone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Deep enough</em> is the only guide here. </p>

<p>Glue penetration varies with species and cut of wood, the glue type and how liquid it is, temperature and humidity and perhaps other factors too but even if by some means you could find out the exact level of penetration, e.g. X thousandths of an inch, this wouldn't be of help anyway as there's no way to sand or scrape off exactly that much wood. </p>

<p>So you sand or scrape until testing reveals you've done enough, that's pretty much it.</p>

"How does one aggressively sharpen chisels and plane irons when damaged?","3544","","<p>I have a lot of finds from garage sales and from picking out tools from my grandfather's old shop. While he mostly keeps his tools in great working order he had some that I would guess he didn't feel comfortable throwing out (He kept EVERYTHING.)</p>

<p>So let's say you hit metal or otherwise caused a dent in the tool or found a tool in damaged state. For argument's sake say maybe at least a 2-4 mm dent or chip. The following is an <em>extreme</em> example of both.</p>

<p><a href=""http://lumberjocks.com/projects/1502"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chipped chisel http://lumberjocks.com/assets/pictures/projects/5375.jpg</a></p>

<p>From what I remember the sharpening techniques discussed here already at WW.SE govern sharpening dull tools.</p>

<p>What does one do in the case of this type of irregular, severe damage? Another example of just a chip which could likely happen. Do you just do more of the roughing step (like standard sharpening) or is there something else that should be done first?</p>

<p>I understand that some options are listed in the pages I linked but I wanted the community here to have a go. </p>
","<p>Obviously both of those cases are quite severe examples of edge damage, but even for single chips smaller than this re-grinding the bevel manually can be challenging. </p>

<p>This level of edge repair is generally considered a job for power grinding. It is possible manually, I've done it entirely by hand on 'rescue chisels' using a combination of diamond plates and a coarse waterstone, but it's not something you'd want to do routinely. It's <em>a lot</em> of work and if you're sharpening freehand because you have to stop and check for square frequently (and then adjust as needed if you're going out of square) it takes even longer than you expect.</p>

<p>If you do this with any frequency you'll probably want to use some kind of powered grinding/honing tool for the bulk material removal, a small bench grinder as least. It doesn't have to be an expensive grinder and it <em>doesn't</em> have to be a low-speed model or have a cool-cutting aftermarket wheel, although both of those are advantages. But at higher speeds using a typical aggressive wheel (often grey in colour) you will want to have a container of cold water immediately to hand to dunk the chisel tip into periodically to cool it before continuing. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> some sharpening gurus (e.g. Leonard Lee in his book on sharpening) say this dunking leads to microfractures that damage the steel near the tip and make it prone to chipping, however, cooling in cold water periodically during grinding is extremely common practice and most users experience no issues. Myself, I've seen no evidence of it when cooling metal cutting tools (knives, gravers and chisels in various metals) during various grinding operations. However, it is probable that the key thing here is the size of the temperature change. So dunk early and often, and after the first dunk pay attention to the drops of water on the back of the chisel — they give you a read on how the temperature is rising. </p>

<p>As with all grinding, don't press hard. Let the stone do the work, it should almost be the weight of the chisel against the stone pressing it home. Even doing this the tip will heat up and pauses or dunking in water may be necessary.</p>

<p>Your first thought might be to just work on the bevel, grinding back at that angle until the chips are gone. This is a mistake because there's a high potential for the thin edge to overheat (thin metal heats up <em>fast</em>). It's a bit scary but it's actually better to grind the edge 90° and straight across until you've removed the chips, then work to re-establish your desired primary bevel angle.<br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3ka0l.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3ka0l.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This way you're grinding at or near a thin edge for minimal time.</p>

<p>Although the chisel can be held in the fingers for both grinding operations once you get to grinding the bevel itself a jig can be a big help. Even without dunking you need to pause periodically to inspect the progress of the grind on the bevel and it can be difficult to maintain the same angle accurately, so some sort of jig is highly advisable. </p>

<p>This jig doesn't have to be complex or elaborate to work well:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1FYpr.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1FYpr.jpg"" alt=""Basic chisel-grinding jig""></a></p>

<p>As you can see you can knock up something that will work well from shop scrap and a few bits of inexpensive hardware. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Doing this by hand</strong><br>
If a powered grinding tool of any kind is not in the budget, or you simply enjoy the hard work and challenge, I'll include a basic guide to doing this manually. </p>

<ul>
<li>First off I would highly recommend using a coarse or extra-coarse diamond plate for the bulk removal. The difference in grinding speed of diamond is quite noticeable when doing this level of material removal.</li>
<li>A coarse waterstone can be used, but it will take much longer. </li>
<li>A coarse oilstone can be used, but it will take longer still.</li>
<li>If doing this on a waterstone, even being conscientious about working over the entire stone, expect that you might need to re-flatten the surface after doing this amount of material removal. Most particularly with any very hard chisels with waterstones wearing quickly it's possible you may need to re-flatten once <em>during</em> the operation.</li>
<li>Not due to the risk of overheating, again it seems like it's best to grind the tip flat across until the chips are gone and then to set to work grinding the bevel much as you would doing regular sharpening. It's hard to explain why this works better but I've tried both ways and I highly recommend it as the way to tackle this sort of major re-profiling. </li>
<li>If using stones <em>grind the edge flat on the side of the stone if possible</em>; it's very easy to dish the face of the stone otherwise.</li>

"How can I tell if my green wood is dry enough?","3532","","<p>I understand different woods age at different rates and the chosen drying process itself is a factor.</p>

<p>How can you tell if green wood, in general, has aged enough? Is there a visual aid? Do you make test holes and measure the moisture in some way?</p>

<p>I could see this being closed as too broad but there must some basic guidelines to consider. </p>
","<p>No, there is not a visual aid; you must measure or calculate the moisture.</p>

<h2>Measuring with a meter</h2>

<p>To measure the moisture directly, you can use a moisture meter. Pin-type meters require you to drive a set of pins into the wood, while pinless meters just need to be pressed against the surface of the wood.</p>

<p>Delmhorst, a manufacturer of both types of meters, <a href=""http://info.delmhorst.com/blog/bid/355339/Pin-or-Pinless-Moisture-Meters-Which-Kind-is-Best-for-You"" rel=""nofollow"">explains the pros and cons</a> of each type on their website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For wood, both pinless and pin-type moisture meters have their uses.
  Pin-type meters, in particular, have the advantage of being able to
  tell you the depth at which a moisture pocket in wood occurs. To do
  this, simply push the pins in partially, take a reading, push them in
  a little more and take another reading, repeating until you hit the
  moisture pocket in the wood or reach the maximum penetration depth of
  the pins.</p>
  
  <p>The major drawback to using pin-type meters is that they can only
  measure the moisture content of the material between the pins, so if a
  moisture pocket falls outside of that area, it can go undetected.
  However, this same focus is what allows pin meters to give users a
  precise location for moisture pockets and the depth at which they
  occur.</p>
  
  <p>Pinless meters, on the other hand, are very good at scanning large
  areas of an object quickly. With these meters, there are no pins to
  constantly and carefully push in and out of the wood. Simply press the
  scanning plate against a flat piece of wood, push the button, and you
  have a moisture reading in seconds. This process can be repeated over
  different areas of a single piece of wood to give a thorough reading
  of the %MC of that piece of wood without leaving pin-holes in it.</p>
  
  <p>There are, however, a few drawbacks to pinless meters:</p>
  
  <p>A pinless meter requires a flat surface on which to press the scanning
  plate. Without such a flat surface, readings cannot be taken.</p>
  
  <p>Pinless meters have a fixed scanning depth. If a piece of wood is too
  thick, the pinless meter will not be able to take a reading of the
  deepest layer of the wood. If the wood is too thin, you may actually
  get readings of the material behind that piece of wood, rather than
  for the wood itself.</p>
  
  <p>Metal objects in piece of wood can cause a false positive. Pinless
  meters emit electromagnetic waves to scan a piece of wood, and use the
  distortions of returned waves to calculate the %MC of that wood.
  Foreign objects such as nails interfere with the electromagnetic waves
  emitted by the meter, creating a false positive reading.</p>
  
  <p>When choosing a type of moisture meter for woodworking, take into
  account the size and shape of the wood you’re working with. For
  example, floorboards and other thin pieces of wood might not be thick
  enough to get reliable readings from a pinless meter, whereas big
  lengths of lumber would be perfect for pinless moisture meters.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Calculating moisture content</h2>

<p>To calculate the moisture, you take a sample of the wood and weigh it. Record this as the <em>initial weight</em>. Then dry the sample in an oven set to 217 degrees F  for 4 hours and weigh it again. Repeat this step until you've recorded the same weight several times in a row. This final number is the <em>oven dry weight</em>. Then use the following formula:</p>

<p>moisture content = (initial weight - oven dry weight) / oven dry weight * 100</p>

<p>More specifically, a <a href=""http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/5190/Moisture_Content_ocr.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">study from Oregon State University</a> recommends the following procedure:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Performing the Test</p>
  
  <p>It is simple to do an oven-dry test, but the devil is in the details. The test is
  performed by cutting the sample to be tested, weighing it, drying it to a constant weight,
  reweighing, and doing the calculation. Now the details.</p>
  
  <p>Sample Selection</p>
  
  <p>The samples need to be representative of the lot of wood from which they are
  taken. Thus, they should come from throughout a pile or shipment, not just the top or
  sides. After a board is chosen, the sample should be cut at least 2 feet from the end of
  the board because wood picks up and loses moisture very rapidly through the end grain.
  The samples should either be weighed immediately after cutting or each sample
  should be stored in a separate plastic bag. After the initial weight is obtained, no
  particular precautions for storage need to be observed and the sample can be oven-dried
  at your convenience.</p>
  
  <p>Weighing</p>
  
  <p>Either a data sheet with sample numbers should be used or sometimes the
  weight can be written directly on the sample. Once the initial weight is taken and the
  sample begins to dry, there is no going back so it's important to keep a good record.</p>
  
  <p>Drying</p>
  
  <p>The time to dry is typically about 24 hours for a one- to two-inch sample cut from
  dimension lumber or boards. The correct method is to dry to a constant weight, meaning
  that the weight change over a four-hour period is less than twice the sensitivity of the
  scale. This means less than about 0.2 grams for a 100 gram sample.
  Do not add wet samples to the oven when other samples are almost dry. Water
  will evaporate from the wet samples and be picked up by the drier ones causing an error
  when they are weighed due to a temporary increase in moisture content.
  If the oven temperature is too low, the relative humidity in the oven will not be
  low enough. The ambient air contains moisture and raising its temperature simply lowers
  its relative humidity causing a lower equilibrium moisture content. For example, if the
  ambient air is at 70°F and 50% relative humidity, the relative humidity in the oven will
  be about 1% with an equilibrium moisture content of about 0.1 to 0.2%. On a humid day
  the samples won't dry as much, but at 217°F the variability due to ambient conditions
  is minimal. An oven in a humid tropical country will give results that are within 0.3 or
  0.4% moisture content of and oven in a cold dry climate as long as 217°F is used.
  If the oven temperature is too high, some of the wood components can be driven
  off. When these are counted as moisture, the indicated moisture content is too high.
  Do not overload an oven. Good air circulation around the samples is needed to
  reduce the risk of fire.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Is it dry enough?</h2>

<p>Whether you measure the moisture of your lumber with a meter or by calculating it yourself, you might find general moisture content recommendations ranging from 6%-12%. The truth is, this figure will fluctuate with temperature and relative humidity. What you really need to aim for is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrium_moisture_content"" rel=""nofollow"">equilibrium moisture content</a>, or EMC, which is the moisture content at which the wood is neither losing nor gaining moisture from the air. Suffice it to say, this is not quite as simple a formula, but there are several calculators and charts you can use, such as the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.csgnetwork.com/emctablecalc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csgnetwork.com/emctablecalc.html</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.woodworkerssource.com/moisture.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.woodworkerssource.com/moisture.php</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If your wood has not reached equilibrium, you need to let it continue to dry. Ideally this involves <a href=""http://www.woodmagazine.com/materials-guide/lumber/how-to-succeed-at-air-drying-lumber/"" rel=""nofollow"">stickering</a> the lumber and air-drying it or drying it in a commercial kiln or a homemade solar kiln.  The typical rule-of-thumb for air-drying fresh-cut lumber is 1 year per inch of thickness, but you can continue to check the moisture content periodically since the type of wood and environmental factors can accelerate or lengthen the drying process.</p>

<li><p>Use a router to create one or two grooves almost the entire length of the table (making sure that the groove is in only one piece of wood), then insert a ""spline"" along that length that will be 4/4 stock; basically a long mortise and tenon to attach an apron in the middle of the table.  I figure if I glue this in, it will strengthen the table length-wise and not cause problem due to wood movement because the groove will run with the grain.  I would probably do this several times because I don't want the ""apron"" to stick out from the bottom too much, so it would not be super thick</p></li>
<li><p>Do the same grooves but instead epoxy in metal splines</p></li>
<li><p>Don't do anything to strengthen it lengthwise, because 8/4 cherry over that length may just be strong enough?</p></li>
<li><p>Attach wood strips across the grain using cleats to strengthen table across the width</p></li>
<li><p>??  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm looking for any good suggestions/critiques here.  Googling has lead me to believe that nobody really does this, but I've seen huge tables with only the 4 legs for support, so I'm guessing it can be done.</p>
","<p>The apron on a four legged table serves a number of functions, and you may not have considered them all. The apron:</p>

<ul>
<li>stiffens the top, helping to keep it flat</li>
<li>transfers the load to the legs</li>
<li>connects the legs to each other and keeps them vertical</li>
<li>connects the top to the base (i.e. legs + apron)</li>
<li>in a large table, supports stretchers that support the top in the middle</li>
<li>provides aesthetic balance for the legs (a 1"" top on 3"" legs would look funny)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can ignore the aesthetic function if you choose, but if you want your table to last you have to consider the structural functions. For example, without aprons to support the width of the table, the joints between the boards in the top would experience much more stress than they do in a regular table. Breadboard ends could help here, but they're not a complete solution.</p>

<p>What do you think would happen over time if you screwed legs to the corners of a 3/4"" sheet of plywood? Plywood has very good rigidity both lengthwise and crosswise, and there are no joints to worry about. I don't think it'd be long before the top began to sag and the legs started to splay outward. As soon as that happened, there'd be a lot of lateral force on the legs which would cause them to become loose.</p>

<p>Your ""spline"" idea isn't a bad one, but I think you'll need more than just one down the middle, and it doesn't solve the problem of supporting the top crosswise or bracing the legs.</p>

<p>One possibility is to connect the legs diagonally, forming an X that would support the top. If you want to hide that structure as much as possible you could build it out of square steel tubing, welded at the center, with vertical bits welded on at each corner to support the legs.</p>

<p>On the aesthetic side, now is the time to start making some drawings that will let you really see how your table will look. That'll also force you to think more carefully about the structural aspects of your design.</p>

"What should I use to apply a water-based varnish?","3459","","<p>I've used in the past foam brushes to apply my water-based varnish.  I'm wondering if there's other types of brush that can be used and what are the advantages and disadvantages.</p>
","<p>Generally, besides foam there are synthetic bristle brushes and natural bristle brushes (as well as sprayers, air-brushes and rollers, which I'm not going to discuss). There is great debate over which to use for what; that debate rages from house painters to fine artists. </p>

<p>Most agree synthetic bristle brushes for water-base varnishes, acrylics and the like and natural bristles for oil-based mediums (the solvents can damage some synthetic bristles).  For me, both types work well but have slight differences in how much paint is held, how the paint leaves the brush, etc. I find I 'get use to' how the brush handles fairly quickly. </p>

<p>There is the question of shape, which for most furniture folk, is less of an issue unless you are doing decorative painting, stenciling or similar work. For transparent finishes, a flat tipped brush is most common. But if you have something else that you like, great; use that. Your experience with foam will guide you regarding shapes you like (for getting into corners, for example) and widths.</p>

<p>While slightly off question, it is worth noting that you can tweak your finish to work with your brushes. For example, by adding more thinner (water in your case) you can create a thinner coat that dries with less visible brush strokes. This also applies to binders and in the case of paints, the pigments as well. </p>

<p>I am currently sanding my desk, which has become dirty over time. If I look at the sandpaper, it's got brown spots on it, like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qCs4i.jpg"" alt=""brown spots""></p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>What are these and should I worry?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is called <em>corning</em> and yes it is something to pay attention to. </p>

<p>Corning is distinct from normal clogging — notice the dark colour, as opposed to dust clinging to the paper which is usually very light. </p>

<p>Corns are generally formed of either resins from the wood itself or a finish in or on the surface, such as varnish of course. <em>All</em> finishes that dry hard can lead to corning, including drying oils, shellac, varnish and lacquers. And as well as that glue residue can cause it too.</p>

<p>The reason you don't want to continue to use corned paper is that the corns 1, interfere with proper sanding (because they sit higher than the surrounding grit they reduce sanding efficiency since less grit is in contact with the wood) and 2, they can actually scratch or bruise the wood surface in the worst of cases.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention is better than cure</strong><br>
It's best to try to avoid corns forming although this is not always possible. </p>

<p>Corns tend to form most when you press down hard on your paper — which experts tell us not to do anyway, regardless of sanding method; <em>""let the paper do the work""</em> as the saying goes — and/or if you sand very quickly. Both pressure and speed means the paper can generate a lot of heat which softens or actually melts resins, which can then cling to and harden on the paper.</p>

<p>The problem with speed as a cause is that it is inherent to most powered sanding operations, which is why it's not always possible to completely avoid this happening. So it's vital that you not press hard, no matter how tempting it is! For vibratory or rotational sanders you want the weight of your hand resting on the sander to be the only pressure, no muscle power should be used to press the sander onto the surface. </p>

<p>Also try to move the sander in a measured, even way, not exactly slow but definitely not fast.</p>

<p><strong>What to do when you do get them</strong><br>
Corns can be robust enough that they're very difficult to dislodge from paper. One old technique recommended in older guides is to drag the sanding block (or the pad of the palm sander in your case) sharply over the edge of a piece of wood, hardwood preferably. This is worth trying still but I've found it isn't that effective.</p>

<p>A better method is to brush over the paper with a wire brush. Brass-bristled or bronze-bristled brushes are sufficient for this, but you can use steel brushes if that's all you have. At best this brushing will remove all or almost all corning and you can then continue sanding. </p>

<p>If brushing doesn't remove enough it's worth trying to scrape the remainder off using the edge of something like a 'beater' chisel that you keep around for rough jobs, or with a stiff-bladed putty knife (probably the better too for the job). Either way there is a chance you'll tear or cut through the paper, in which case you should toss it and apply a fresh piece.</p>

<hr>

<p>Although they're not always available for power sanders I should mention there are papers that are purpose-made to help prevent clogging and these will tend to be more resistant to corning as well. These papers generally are of one of two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>lubricated (usually with a wax-like material, these are called stearated papers)</li>
<li>open-coat abrasives, which have a wider spacing of the grit particles</li>

","<p>For strength, a good glue bond is all you need.  If you want to minimize clamping, you could use pocket screws, but I would recommend against it.

<p>You could use biscuits or dowels (or dominos) to aid in the alignment, but none of those will replace clamping.  I find it is really fastest, and easiest to just glue and clamp.

<p>For arguments sake lets assume the paint is not lead based. I still plan on testing it but that is not the focus of the question. </p>
","<p>Assuming that it isn't lead-based, I would probably tend to use an old set of blades if you have them.  Some of that paint was incredible.  </p>

<p>I would recommend running all of the boards through on an old set of blades at the smallest cut to take off the paint.  If it isn't a latex based paint it will likely ruin a set of blades.  Basically you just want to skim off as much paint and as little wood as you can get away with. (this will also save your good blades if there is any metal pieces hiding under the paint too)  Then after they have all been run through put in new blades in and run them through to give them a nice clean cut.</p>

<p>I generally try other means myself but I have put some painted and stained boards through to save me some time and it will work, it helps if you have your planer hooked up to a good dust collection system, otherwise I would highly recommend using a high quality dust mask even if the paint isn't lead-based.

<p>When using oils with stains are there any generalized guidelines that should be followed? This question is dependent on my assumption that <em>stains and oils both work by penetrating the wood</em>.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>With that in mind am I making the oils less effective by applying them over a stain? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Broadly speaking that should be a no. Waterbased and alcohol-based stains leave the wood 'open', essentially as if it hadn't been stained. </p>

<p>Oil-based stains do somewhat close up the surface (much as a layer of finishing oil does) but in general they're not recommended to be used when doing an oil finish.</p>

<p>Note here that an oil finish doesn't 'build' in the conventional sense, instead <em>it's the application process itself</em> that makes most of the difference.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question is dependent on my assumption that stains and oils both work by penetrating the wood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes they both penetrate the surface fibres of the wood, although under normal circumstances very very shallowly (this is why it is so easy to damage a stained surface if you inadvertently sand through a film finish).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps I am just ensuring that I will need to provide more coats of oil?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There should be no difference. The number of coats of oil you were intending to apply should stay the same, but how you do it may change after reading the below.</p>

<p><strong>Oiling as commonly done today</strong><br>
Many people are happy with just a few coats these days — as few as two, and three seems to be quite commonly recommended as a sort of ideal minimum. This is in part because of the long-winded application required for oils, where at best you're able to apply one coat per day. And given certain weather conditions waiting longer is definitely advisable, in the winter in an unheated workshop applying a half-dozen coats could easily require longer than a fortnight.</p>

<p><strong>How it used to be done</strong><br>
The full traditional oiling regimen could take <em>an entire year</em> from the point the woodworking was finished: one coat per day for a week, a coat per week for a month and then one coat per month for the rest of the year.</p>

<p>Yes, that is 21 applications of oil. </p>

<p>And in addition to that, traditionally you were supposed to oil once per year forever to maintain the finish. Any wonder why varnish was embraced as a significant step forward when it became widely and inexpensively available? </p>

<p><strong>How we should be doing an oil finish</strong><br>
In the modern world it makes sense that woodworkers are unable or unwilling to devote the time necessary for this, but another element of the traditional application method has also fallen by the wayside and it is something that should come back as it's more important than ever: what you do <em>after</em> you've oiled the wood. </p>

<p>All guides to oiling will say that you have to wipe off the excess oil from the surface but these days, with the emphasis on how easy an oil finish is to do, very often they say you're done at that point. And that's responsible for the lacklustre surface on much modern oiled furniture. Traditionally, after the excess oil was wiped away you then rubbed down the piece, <em>hard</em>, and for a long time. There was no danger of leaving excess oil on the wood in the old days after buffing the surface for half an hour!</p>

<p>It is this, the hard buffing, that is largely responsible for the true look of an oiled piece, not actually a build-up of oil within the wood fibres.</p>

<p>I've searched a bit online and people are suggesting a high teeth count blade.  I'm thinking of using a cheap circular saw blade of 7¼"" with 100 teeth or so.  Will that give me an appropriate cut?</p>
","<p>Although you do want a high tooth count for a higher-quality cut, an ultra-high tooth count can be detrimental. With a 100T 7-1/4"" blade, you'll have to cut more slowly and may burn the plastic.</p>

","<p>While you can sand dowels to reduce their diameter it's not the most efficient method even to take off just a millimetre or two, and it's difficult to ensure consistency along the length.

","<p>No you don't need to thin BLO, or any other drying oil, to apply it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From what I've read, thinning the BLO will let the finish penetrate the wood deeper</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's the theory! But it's one of the most persistent myths in finishing. In reality it doesn't appear to make any real difference (except possibly in end grain). </p>

<p>People have run tests that have shown that it increases penetration and other tests have been run that show zero difference* and it's important to note that where deeper penetration was measured the improvement was minuscule. That kind of thing might be important to a luthier working in thin sections of wood, but for a bulk item like a piece of furniture or a mallet it's hard to imagine that an extra 0.1mm is going to make any appreciable difference! </p>

<p>From trying it both ways I can say that, empirically, the wood looks <em>exactly</em> the same, there's no difference in durability that I can notice and the surface feels no different, <em>as long as you go on to apply enough coats in total</em> — there is a massive difference in all three of these if you wipe on three dilute coats of BLO versus three undiluted coats.</p>

<p>Another option you might like to experiment with is to gently heat the BLO to reduce its viscosity (best done in a double boiler or some similar arrangement, not over direct heat). This supposedly increases penetration too. If you try this it's quite evident it does reduce viscosity, the oil is visibly more runny, however once applied to the wood it again appears to make little or no difference in how deeply the oil is absorbed. I'm actually a fan of doing this, especially during cold weather, but only as a means to easing application. I don't delude myself that the oil is going in any deeper.</p>

<p>*What these tests may inadvertently have proven is that the type of wood is a key factor in relative oil penetration, but that shouldn't have been any surprise anyway.</p>

<p>The shank size is only the first indication.  I haven't seen any 1/4"" bits that 'Need' to be mounted in a router table.  However that doesn't mean that you can't benefit from doing so.</p>

<p>The larger shank bits allow for a larger torque to be placed on them and to be used in larger machines.  They also will tend to have less vibration movement for a cleaner cut (At least that is what I have read).  </p>

<p>When it is easy to use my Shaper (like a mounted table router but slower and more powerful) I will.  Bits that cut the 'tongue' in tongue and groove, raised panel bits, shapers for moldings and such should really be mounted in a table for best results and safest practices.</p>

<p>But just because it's a 1/2"" shank doesn't mean you have to use it that way.  If it is a 3/4"" straight bit on a 1/2"" shank it will be just as safe as a 1/4"" shank, and will likely have a cleaner cut.  I would like to replace all my bits with 1/2"" shank bits (at least the ones that I can) </p>

"Is glue the best permanent join?","3039","","<p>My understanding of modern wood glue is that, if the proper glue is used and wood surfaces are properly prepared, it will form a bond stronger than the wood itself.</p>

<p>Is this true? If not what are the exceptions to that statement?  If so does that mean that complicated and/or elaborate mechanical joints &mdash; e.g., dovetail joints &mdash; are now more decorative than practical?</p>
","<p>Indeed, when done properly, the glue is stronger than the wood itself when both of the glued faces are edge-grain or face-grain. </p>

<p>A few circumstances come to mind when glue alone is not stronger than the wood:</p>

<h1>End Grain</h1>

<p>When glue is applied to end-grain, the grain acts as little straws and draws a lot of the glue up the wood, away from the joint (similar to how the grain draws water up the tree when the tree is alive). In these cases, the majority of the glue is pulled away from the joint and (without more elaborate joinery techniques) a strong joint cannot be achieved, no matter how rough you sand or how tight your clamps are.</p>

<p>Joining with an end-grain face is unavoidable for 90-degree joints, such as when making boxes or drawers. This is why you'll often see dovetail or finger joints used in these cases. These joints not only provide physical limitations to how the wood can move, but also allow the glue to be applied to a greater surface area <em>and</em> along edge-grain faces, creating a  much stronger joint.</p>

<p>Joining end-grain faces is also unavoidable for 180-degree joints, and a good round-up of techniques to strengthen this joint can be found at the question, <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/q/707/10"">How can I join two boards at the ends?</a></p>

<h1>Wood Movement</h1>

<p>There are a lot of factors that determine how a piece of wood reacts to changes in humidity or contact with water. These include the type of wood, its density and shape, the direction of the grain, and its age. Therefore, the two pieces of wood that make up the joint will often react differently to the changing environment, putting unique stresses and tension on the joint. Furthermore, the direction of the tension is often different than what is  expected under typical use of the joint.</p>

<p>When significant changes in moisture are anticipated, glued joints can fail as the different pieces of wood react differently to the change in moisture.</p>

"When making a box joint, how do I calculate the width of the board so that the teeth appear even?","3034","","<p>I have made some box joints and thus far I've found it difficult to ensure that the teeth are evenly spaced; there's usually a pin that is cut down a bit.  Is there an equation or method of determining what the board's width should be?  Is it as simple as ""always ensure board is a multiple of 2x the kerf of the dado set?</p>
","<p>Start by taking a multiple of the pin width, then add a little extra and cut all the slots/kerfs on all sides of the box. Once you're done, trim each side flush with the edge of a pin or slot. If you prefer, you can trim it to size after assembling and gluing it.</p>

<p>To guarantee that the teeth are evenly-spaced, use a jig. Popular Woodworking has a great <a href=""http://www.popularwoodworking.com/projects/tablesaw-box-joints"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a> on how to build a box joint jig, and Fine Woodworking has a nice <a href=""http://www.finewoodworking.com/interactive/finger-joint-jig-for-the-tablesaw/"" rel=""nofollow"">interactive demo</a> illustrating how a box joint jig works.</p>

<p>Note that FWW calls it a finger joint jig because many people use the terms <em>finger joint</em> and <em>box joint</em> interchangeably, but personally I like to differentiate the right-angle joining version as a box joint and the straight joining version (e.g., to ""lengthen"" a board) as a finger joint since the straight joining version also often has tapered fingers.</p>

<sub>Image from Flickr. <strong>Note</strong> that there are many other cuts that exist but still fit in same general categories</sub></p>

<h1>Plain</h1>

<p>Also known as bastard sawn, through and through, and tangent sawn. It the most common way to mill lumber and arguably the cheapest. The log orientation is not typically moved during this process. The widest boards are made in this way since you cut across the entire diameter.</p>

<h1>Rift</h1>

<p>Rift or radially sawing produces the most consistent strength across all boards since each board is cut perpendicular to the grain. Commercially, it is not common as there is a lot of waste wood. Custom woodworkers milling their own logs may use this when making furniture, for example. Visually all the boards look <em>very</em> similar giving projects the same look and feel. </p>

<h1>Quarter</h1>

<p>Quartersawn (quarter-sawn) or quartered sawn is with the rings 90 degrees to the face. The quartered sections are individually cut with not attempts to waste wood. The block can be rotated repeatedly so the saw will remove the wider portions of the quarter. </p>

","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There's nothing essentially wrong with your plan, but there are some minor modifications that will make it go more smoothly. </p>

<p>On a substantial glued panel like this, made of so many parts, it can be advisable to work in stages. This is because the first glued surfaces can have dried quite a bit by the time you get to the very last glue application at the end, before the clamps are even on much less fully tightened. If this occurs it will lead to a weaker join on the drier joints, no matter how firmly you clamp. So unless you can do the whole thing very swiftly it would be better to plan on doing it in thirds, maybe even quarters, and once those have dried you can glue the three or four sections together with ease to make up your full width.</p>

<p>Even working in narrower sections like this you should probably use cauls (a batten clamped down firmly onto the surface of the boards) to help ensure they dry as flat as possible. The flatter you can make the surface during glue-up the less time and effort you will have to expend making it perfectly smooth and flat later on.</p>

<p>If you're working on the floor you should cover it with something the glue won't stick to. Any sheet plastic including rubbish bags (US: refuse sacks) and plastic food wrap works well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>approximately 1/2"" thick</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also have to mention in case it's not obvious: the boards really have to be of uniform thickness for this glue-up to go smoothly. </p>

<p>You don't mention whether you've surfaced and jointed the pallet wood. In case you haven't done so, to ensure a proper joint between the face of each board every one <em>must</em> be sanded or planed smooth. This is vital, even if the pallet wood looks perfectly clean and appears quite flat. The jointed edges aren't to aid the glueing operation, they are to ensure the eventual top surface is as flat as possible before any further work is done on it. </p>

"How can I tell if leather is vegetable tanned?","2921","","<p>In my continued effort to learn more about sharpening I see that the last step always involves stropping. Purchasing one seemed folly as <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/2065/128"">someone mentioned that</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>woodworkers who buy strops should hand in their woodworking cards</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When it came to leather selection it would mostly come down to availability since I had no intention of buying a strop. Unanimously people have suggested that if I used vegetable tanned that I do not have to treat it with something like chromium oxide before I use it. </p>

<p>That got me thinking: I have plenty of leather from previous projects. How do I identify a piece of leather as vegetable tanned vs. the most popular chrome tanned? Colour used to be a tell tale sign but with all the dyes available that is no longer a perfect guide. </p>
","<p>So you found some scrap of leather from a manufacturer or some clothing (like a belt). </p>

<p>The trouble can come from leather, that has been processed using vegetable tannins, but that was previously chromed tanned and reprocessed. </p>

<p>Assuming that you can't get that information from wherever you are acquiring the leather or you want to verify the sources authenticity you have two simple tests at your disposal. </p>

<h1>Burn/Ash Test</h1>

<p>While both tests here are simple this one has the smallest time involvement. In an open air environment take a small strip or piece and bring it close to flame. Vegetable tanned leather should take longer to burn and when it does turn black/grey. Chrome tanned leather should have a bluish greenish colour when burned. The colour comes from the reaction of the chromium in the leather.</p>

<p>A source as a simple reference would come from <a href=""http://www.carryology.com/bags/identify-superior-leather-oppermann-london/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Carryology.com</a> where half way down the article the burn test is mentioned. </p>

<h1>Boil Test</h1>

<p>Another simple test is to put a thin strip of the material into a pot of boiling water. 100% veg tanned leather will curl up instantaneously. Chrome leather will just float in place. While both will go limp, chrome leather will not have the same initial reaction as veg. A <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMfbTnfotkg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">video</a> about the self-proclaimed the ""Siegel Effect"" shows the test in action. I stress self-proclaimed as this test has been used for quite some time before this video was released.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/23SM1.png"" alt=""Boiling leather""></p>

<p>In the picture above there are two strips of leather in the pot. The one ""on top"" is confirmed vegetable tanned as it curled up when it was place in the pot. The second strip was known chrome tanned leather that just went limp and did not curl in nearly the same was as the other strip.</p>

<p>An <a href=""http://www.hewit.com/skin_deep/?volume=7&amp;article=2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article on the manufacturing of leather</a> supports up this test by stating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a normal vegetable tanned leather shrinks in water above 70ºC</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>While both of the test are not perfect they are both easy indicators. It is worth noting there are other tanning processes in used but chrome tanned is the most widely used. </p>

<p>Aside from stopping, vegetable tanned leather is also sought after for making holsters and covers for axes and other tools (So as to not have a reaction with the metal). That could be another source to consider or another motivation to perform the tests. </p>

<p>Most sources from around the web just say that ""try square"" is another name for ""square"", and describe what a square does. But I'm thinking there must be something that a square with one arm thinner than the other is better at than, say, a Swanson square or a framing square.</p>
","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>A try square is similar in that respect: the handle is thicker than the blade, so it's easy to push the inside of the handle up against the edge of a board and mark (or verify) a line perpendicular (square) to the edge. And you can easily stand a try square on the outside edge of the handle to check that your table saw blade is at 90° to the table. You can check inside corners with a try square or a speed square, but due to its triangular shape a speed square can't be used to check outside corners the way a try square can.</p>

<p>A speed square is a rugged, rough tool that is built to be tossed in a bucket of tools and which you can always count on to get you close enough to square for construction purposes. A try square is less rugged and should be treated more like a precision instrument — take care not to drop it, give it a safe home in your toolbox, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Spotting? Blemishes (I've heard it gets cloudy with moisture)?</p>

<p>Yep and yep.  Besides the aforementioned issues with flaking/peeling, shellac does not like getting wet.  If you've ever left a hot or a sweating beverage on a bare shellac-ed wood surface, you've seen the dreaded ring in the finish.  Now imagine that, but all over, and most likely non-uniform.  The clouding eventually disappears (or lessens), but that takes a while of non-wet conditions and low enough humidity or high enough heat to make it happen.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Varnishes (and other varnish-like finishes) just don't hold up well outdoors.  The constant battering by UV rays and weather wreaks havoc on the film, which requires quite frequent maintenance to keep in anything resembling decent shape.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>I have tried in the past to make precision cuts using a hand saw and always have issues with the blade sticking or hopping out of the cut.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If by sticking you mean that the friction between the blade and the wood is very high, that could be one of a few problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The wood you are sawing is closing the kerf and pinching the blade, </p></li>
<li><p>Your cut isn't straight,</p></li>
<li><p>The set of the saw teeth is not large enough, so the kerf created by the blade isn't wide enough to allow the saw room to pass without undue friction, or</p></li>
<li><p>Your saw teeth are too fine for the wood you're sawing.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For the first, you can try to hold the two sides of the cut apart with your off-hand and see if the saw goes easier.  Or, you can stick a little wedge at the top of the cut to keep the kerf open.</p>

<p>For the second, cut straighter!  (Note: the cut can wander if the set of your teeth is uneven, regardless if you're sawing correctly)</p>

<p>For the third, ideally you'd use a <a href=""http://www.leevalley.com/US/wood/page.aspx?p=32956&amp;cat=1,43072,43086"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">saw set</a> (pictured below) to increase the set of the saw's teeth.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tvnLt.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tvnLt.jpg"" alt=""saw set""></a></p>

<p>However, if you bought the saw new at a big box store, there's a high likelihood that it has induction-hardened teeth.  These don't bend very well, and will likely snap off if you try it.  I can't find a good image of these these of teeth, but they have a slight bluing from the temperature change in the metal.  In this case, you might be out of luck.</p>

<p>Finally, for the fourth, you might need to use a saw with coarser or finer teeth.  Generally, if the blade is sticking in the kerf, you need a coarser saw.  If it's hopping out, you might need a finer blade.  Greener wood needs coarser teeth than dried wood.</p>

<hr>

<p>Some other things to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A dull blade will want to jump out of the cut.</p></li>
<li><p>Rip teeth blades sometimes have trouble staying in the start of a cut just due to their tooth geometry.  In these cases, I like to start the cut with a crosscut saw to get the kerf established and finish with the rip saw.  The link below the image has probably more information that you ever need to know on saw tooth geometry.</p></li>

"What is the best finish for wood in a bathroom","2817","","<p>I have nearly finished making a small table which will be placed in a bathroom. I am concerned about protecting the wood in a humid/damp environment.</p>

<p>The bathroom can get quite humid while people are having showers etc, and in winter it can take some time to fully dry out. I want to avoid any mould growth or other damage from moisture.</p>

<p>The table is made from softwood - partly reclaimed pine from an old patio door, and partly non-specific softwood from a big DIY store. I want to keep a natural wood look, so no paint or opaque finishes. Ideally, I would go for something not too glossy - a silk or mid-sheen finish.</p>

<p>I have had good results with Danish oil before, but for this I want something more hard-wearing.</p>

<p>I see polyurethane varnish used as the default finish for a lot of things these days. However, I find that (where I live anyway) there's a wider range of non-poly varnishes available than polyurethane varnishes.</p>

<p>Specifically with regard to protection from moisture, what are the advantages or disadvantages of polyurethane or other kinds of varnish? Are there any differences between oil based and water based varnish? Are there any other kinds of finish that I should consider?</p>
","<p>As always ""what's the best xxxx"" is not a good Question. In almost all cases there isn't <strong>a</strong> best but instead multiple good options to pick from, and that is very much the case here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am concerned about protecting the wood in a humid/damp environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don't have to be. People worry about this sort of thing a lot these days (I did too early on) but there's no reason to — things were made from wood and used in damp, sometimes <em>very</em> damp, environments for centuries before modern finishes came along and they lasted well. </p>

<p><em>You can even leave the thing bare and it'll do just fine</em>. Although obviously most people would prefer the wood to look 'finished' and for it to be protected a bit from stains etc. the wood itself just sitting there won't be harmed by steamy air once or twice every day and the occasional splash of water.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I see polyurethane varnish used as the default finish for a lot of things these days. However, I find that (where I live anyway) there's a wider range of non-poly varnishes available than polyurethane varnishes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Poly is nearly the default choice these days because most consumer-level varnishes are poly, including when it isn't specified on the labelling. And it is the toughest of the common varnishes (by quite a margin) anyway, making it the superior choice if durability and waterproofing are desired.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Specifically with regard to protection from moisture, what are the advantages or disadvantages of polyurethane or other kinds of varnish? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm presuming here you're asking largely about protection from water vapour/humidity rather than liquid water, and there isn't a lot between varnishes <em>at a typical coat thickness used today</em>. But referring back to my earlier point you don't need to worry about this particularly so it doesn't matter much here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there any differences between oil based and water based varnish? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Very broadly speaking the former are better and the latter not as good. But, waterbased finishes have improved greatly over the years and some are now much better than they used to be, equalling the performance of oil-based varnishes in direct comparative tests..... old timers take note!</p>

<p>In addition to the functional aspects of the finishes, waterbased finishes are mostly ""water white"" once dry and change the look of wood minimally as a result (on pine and other lighter woods, they can give a 'cold' cast to dark woods).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there any other kinds of finish that I should consider?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think so no. Totally a judgement call of course but there's no reason you need to look beyond common consumer-level finishes for something like this. I'm not a fan of them but commercial ""Danish oil"" finishes would probably be fine for this, unless where it's sited it will be frequently splashed with water in which case varnish would be a better bet. </p>

<hr>

<p>Just a final bit on this since it has more general applications to finishing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ideally, I would go for something not too glossy - a silk or mid-sheen finish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All gloss finishes can have their surface modified after they've hardened to a desired sheen level. This was commonly done on shellac in the past and it works just as well today on varnishes and other coatings. I've even done it to paint. </p>

<p>The idea is very simple, you're just scratching the surface very finely, usually following the grain, and being careful at corners and along edges not to rub through. The coarser the scratches (this is relative, they're still tiny so you won't perceive them as scratches if you do it well) the more matt the finish. </p>

<p>For a satin or semi-gloss finish you can sometimes merely buff the surface with a cloth to knock sheen back one notch from fully gloss. On fully cured polyurethane varnish because it's very tough you'd usually have to resort to abrasives, so a gentle rub over with 0000 steel wool or the finest grade of Scotch-Brite will do the trick. </p>

<p>For something more mid-sheen and approaching matt you can use 000 / 00 steel wool or a coarser grade of Scotch-Brite. </p>

"What are the different uses for plain sawn (flat sawn), rift sawn, and quarter sawn boards?","2807","","<p>When <em>shopping</em> for lumber, how do you identify each type of board, and what are some examples of when you would choose to use each one?</p>

<p>In other words, what are the visual and physical characteristics that may make a board desirable or undesirable in certain types of projects (or even different parts of the same project), and once one selects a type of board for a project, how would that person go about identifying the correct type of board when looking through stacks at a store or hardwood dealer?</p>

<p>Note: for the purposes of this question, I am <em>not</em> interested in the different cut patterns that can be used to mill a log into the various ""cuts"" of lumber as discussed in <em><a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/400/what-are-the-common-cut-patterns-used-to-mill-a-log-into-boards"">What are the common cut patterns used to mill a log into boards?</a></em>, because I purchase my lumber already-milled and do not mill my own logs.</p>
","<p>While named the same, the milling processes and resulting boards are two different things. It would be easier to say that each of the milling processes can yield boards of different types. There is confusion that stems from this. Presently the following is accepted.   </p>

<p><strong>Understand</strong> that it would be inaccurate to expect that a specific milling process would produce boards of all the same type.</p>

<h1>It's Always the Grain</h1>

<p>The answer is the grains appearance and the growth rings on the face. It is common to expect that the face of a board or plank is where you will find the end grain. The rings on the face and grain along the length of the board will have distinct characteristics. Following all the descriptions will be a comparison image.</p>

<p><strong>Flat/Plain Sawn</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Appearance</strong>: The growth rings have the most extreme angles are should be within the range of 0 to 30 degrees. The length of the board will have a unique look referred to as cathedral or arrow. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Properties</strong>: The angle of the end grains major drawback is that it will dry faster and can absorb moisture faster. That of course is dependent on the wood location. That is the reason this wood is most unacceptable to warping ( mostly cupping). Even so, it's appearance makes it very desirable and is usually cheapest to acquire. </p></li>
<li><strong>Uses/Application</strong>: Common applications include hardwood flooring and decorative shelving among others.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Quarter Sawn</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Appearance</strong>: Growth rings on the face/end are perpendicular/90 degrees to the boards width. At is acceptable for the growth rings to be withing 60 to 90 degrees and still be considered Quarter sawn. These rings run parallel the whole length of the board. Some woods, particularly oak, when cut this way display a fleck pattern which has no special property other than appearance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Properties</strong>: Considered the most resistant to warping and has the least water absolution when compared to the other cuts. Make quarter an ideal choice for making furniture or applications where wood expansion is important element.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Uses/Application</strong>: You would see quarter used for musical instruments as well where you want the shape to persist throughout the instruments life. Usually the most expensive to acquire but can be justified given its long term properties.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Rift Sawn</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Appearance</strong>: For the board to be considered rift you will see growth rings on the face/end that have angles between 30 and 90 degrees. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Properties</strong>: Considered the compromise of the two cuts. More resistant to warping than flat/plain sawn and absorbs less moisture. The grain that runs the length of the board will be parallel as well but not near as exact as it would be with quarter. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Uses/Application</strong>: This would be considered general use if you don't need the appearance of flat or if true quarter is not economically viable.</p></li>
</ol>

"Is a climbing cut on a table-saw ever justified?","2806","","<p>Having seen the expression ""climbing-cut"" used in several questions on routers and once in comments about table-saws, it finally registered on me that I didn't know what the heck a climbing cut is.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, with a router, a climbing cut occurs when the cut occurs as the cutting edge of the bit enters the cutting path, whereas the normal way to rout is with the bit doing its work as it leaves the cutting path.</p>

<p>On a table-saw, a climbing cut is when the wood is introduced to the blade as the teeth are coming upward rather than downward as we normally would cut wood.  That is, the wood is introduced from the rear of the saw instead of the front.  Here I am calling the position where the operator normally stands (probably near the on/off switch) the front.</p>

<p>So, basically, it seems that a climbing cut is one that's made backwards. </p>

<p>Does it ever make sense to use a climbing cut on a table-saw?  If so what are the safety precautions that should be followed?</p>
","<p>Despite all the no, No, NO, <strong>NO!!!</strong> I have just done it. I needed to cut a slot/dado in piece of wood and the only way to properly align the cut was to lower the piece onto the blade and then do a climbing cut for a cm or two before sawing the normal way. Since it is a dangerous cut I stood to the side of the table.</p>

<p>It worked just as planned.<br>
Dangerous? no.</p>

<p>To experiment, I put sideways pressure on the piece and it flew away, just as suspected/planned. I still not consider this dangerous since I was to the side of the table and the piece would have to fly 2 meters before bouncing of the ground, 2 meters back and then manage to hit me.</p>

<p>So the answer the the question is <em>It depends</em>.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Is it possible to get this look by artificially distressing lumber and if so how would this be accomplished?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, and depending on exactly the character you're after it can actually be quite straightforward, although involved. What I mean is the techniques are individually very simple but there may be quite a number of them used in sequence (and the sequence is very important — changing it can dramatically change the effect, and this is something you may want to do deliberately for variety).</p>

<p><strong>Texture</strong></p>

<p>Starting with wood that is not smoothly milled already can be very advantageous here, but it's possible to add certain textures to wood that is completely smooth, e.g. by sanding, brushing with a wire brush, tapping with wire brushes and generally bashing the wood to make it look old. </p>

<p>Species of wood matters here. Softwoods, which their notable hardness difference between earlywood and latewood, respond in a specific way to some abrasion techniques and that look is not really replicable using a smooth-grained hardwood. So to a degree the species you can use may be dictated by the exact look you're aiming to replicate.</p>

<p>Marks from a mill's circular saw blade can also be mimicked using the tablesaw or a circular saw but there is great potential for personal injury, anyone taking that on does so at their own risk. Careful sanding with coarse paper (60 grit or lower) is a much more advisable method to simulate this texture.</p>

<p><strong>Colour</strong></p>

<p>On to the colouring, just focussing on the overall look it's obviously fairly grey. So getting the wood grey by some means is the first thing to aim for. This can be done using nothing more sophisticated than a wash of heavily thinned paint, either oil-based (including artists' oil paints) or waterbase (including craft acrylics). The colouring possible with both types of paint is very similar, but because of their differences certain specific variations are easier or faster in one or the other, e.g. taking advantage of the paint being wet for a long time for easy blending or feathering, or relying on a paint's fast drying to overlay effects quickly.</p>

<p>There are also a number of commercial stains specifically intended to give these sorts of colours.</p>

<p>In addition to introducing a colour to the wood the wood can itself be coloured, for example using the vinegar + steel technique very commonly seen online for artificially ageing wood (see Note bottom for more on this).</p>

<p>After a base grey colour is achieved a second slightly different colour can be applied in more than one way to introduce some variation (note: because wood is inherently variable some variation will occur naturally anyway). Examples of how you might apply this 'character' paint layer, using paint that has been heavily thinned to a creamy or milky consistency:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brushed liberally over the wood, allowed to soak in for a short while then a damp cloth is wiped over the surface in the direction of the grain.</li>
<li>Same as the above except that the wiping is done at an angle. This can simulate saw marks to a degree.</li>
<li>Either of the above except that a dry cloth is used. This will give a subtly different effect, usually more hard-edged.</li>
<li>The dilute paint is applied by a foam roller or by dabbing with a sponge and is allowed to dry, then worn down selectively with either a nylon mesh adhesive (e.g. Scotchbrite), steel wool or fine abrasive paper.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these sorts of techniques the wood prepared with the base colouring can be used both as-is or sealed, with a dilute coating of waterbase poly, blonde shellac or even thinned PVA glue. In all cases the seal coat should be allowed to dry thoroughly (overnight ideally) before progressing to the next step. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the vinegar + steel wool technique is often poorly described in online guides. To begin with steel wool is not the only thing that can be used, old rusty nails or really any small pieces of iron or steel will work here as long as enough time is given for the vinegar to react with the metal. What this is doing is creating iron acetate, which is what then reacts chemically in the surface wood fibres to produce colour. </p>

<p>This reaction is with tannins in the wood, which some species (notably oak) are high in and give the most pronounced effect usually. This creates iron tannate which is black so the more tannic acid present in the wood the darker the colour. Obviously testing is important with this to gauge effect! If the colour achieved is a little darker than desired a portion of the vinegar solution can be diluted with water and tried again.</p>

<p>Where you're using a species that does not naturally contain much or any tannic acid (particularly softwoods) it can be introduced to the surface of the wood. While tannic acid can be bought online to make a very concentrated tannic acid solution, a strongly brewed tea can work quite well. And for the true DIY devotees a 'tannin tea' can be made using oak leaves, bark and particularly oak galls if you can find any</p>

"What are some efficient and effective ways to remove rust on old hand saws?","2774","","<p>I have quite a few hand saws that I have bought from antique stores, garage sales, and ebay.  They all have some amount of rust, ranging from occasional spot rust to full-on rust on the entire saw plate.</p>

<p>My usual rust removal routine is to use a wire wheel</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ZruQ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ZruQ.jpg"" alt=""Wire wheel""></a></p>

<p>to remove as much surface rust as I can, followed up by sandpaper to get rid of scratches.</p>

<p>As an added wrinkle, hand saws often have etches in the plate that may be destroyed by some means of rust removal (i.e., heavy sanding and other abrasive means).  The image below (source: <a href=""http://www.disstonianinstitute.com/16page.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Disstonian Institute</a>) illustrates such an etch.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5sEeZ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5sEeZ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><strong>What other effective and efficient means are there to remove rust from a hand saw?</strong></p>
","<p>Rust removal basically falls into three camps: abrasive, chemical and electrical. </p>

<p>Many people use a little of two of these, for example by abrading most of the rust away and then using certain polishes which have some chemical action in addition to the fine abrasive particles that physically polish the metal.</p>

<p>An additional point, it's worth degreasing (washing or solvent degreasing) any metalwork prior to getting at the rust, regardless of the method used, but it's particularly vital when using chemical or electrical means as without it you can get much slower or patchy results. It can be surprising just how much surface rust is removed by giving it a good scrub! </p>

<p><strong>Abrasive</strong></p>

<p>Fairly obviously this includes using wire wheels, abrasive paper/cloth/film/mesh or powders and steel wool, but this category also include physically scraping off bulk rust, e.g. with a hard steel or carbide scraper. This last is of particular application to saw blades since the large uninterrupted flat surfaces makes for an ideal canvas for scraping to quickly and relatively easily get the bulk of the rust off, prior to using a finer technique to remove the last of it.</p>

<p>There's no denying the effectiveness of abrasive methods since you can sometimes see the rust come off before your eyes, so the technique is high on the list of many users because of the quick payoff and satisfaction. But they also come with some risks. The most obvious risk is to the tool itself and that is scratching of the metal — at even moderate speeds a <em>brass</em> brush can mark softer steel, so great care should be exercised when using a steel-wire wheel at any speeds. You may inadvertently introduce texture that is difficult or impossible to erase; regardless if it can be removed not scratching it in the first place is obviously desirable.</p>

<p>An under-publicised risk to wire-wheel work is that of the tool being snatched by the rapidly spinning wheel. The danger of this, not just to the tool but to the operator, should not be underestimated. If you must use it read up on the technique and practice at lower speeds! </p>

<p>And <em>always</em> wear eye protection when using a wire wheel to remove rust, no exceptions.</p>

<p><strong>Chemical</strong></p>

<p>To begin with there are the commercial rust removers (most based on phosphoric acid) — including the Internet favourites Evaporust, Naval Jelly and Ospho — and while these can be very effective, and some very fast, the cost of using them rises steeply in the long term.</p>

<p>The more budget-minded tend to favour one or more home solutions, including muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid), battery acid (sulphuric acid), phosphoric acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, vinegar and my own personal favourite when I'm not in a rush, a solution of <a href=""http://www.homercidal.com/molasses/"">molasses in water</a>. </p>

<p>This last sounds bizarre if you've never heard of it before but it does work and very well, although it is relatively to very slow. It can take a couple of days for light rust to a few weeks for heavier rust encrustations. However it is extremely safe; people have literally forgotten about parts soaking in molasses solutions for <em>months</em> and the metal has come to no apparent harm.</p>

<p>The strong acids, hydrochloric and sulphuric come with some dangers (not just of personal injury) so they should be used with great care and careful reading up on their use should be done prior to attempting any work with them. Also note, many metalworking sources state that hydrochloric acid can lead to what is called hydrogen embrittlement, which can fatally weaken the steel. How bad this is in practice or how pronounced the effect can be is the subject of heated debate, however I think it's best to avoid its use entirely for this purpose as there are other methods which are just as effective, just a little slower. And nobody should be in that much of a rush to get the rust off an old tool!</p>

<p><strong>Electrical</strong></p>

<p>This a great method, quick, inexpensive (in the long term) and fairly simple to do, and the results can be everything you'd wish for as far as rust removal goes, leaving at best pristine steel. </p>

<p>The proponents of electrolysis confidently state that it is the cheapest, safest and quickest rust-removal method going. They're slightly overstating things on all counts. It <em>can</em> be very safe, but steels vary and bottom line, varied results are regularly seen. Sometimes it's merely a cosmetic difference but other times some etching or pitting occurs. And unfortunately it's impossible to preview the effect, you have to use the technique to see the results.</p>

<p>An important point in relation to saws, electrolysis can nearly erase the etch because it indiscriminately cleans the steel (the etch is still there, just the black is removed). So additional steps may be needed to restore the etch to visibility if this is desired.</p>

<p>Note: if using electrolysis don't bother with lye/caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) as some guides call for; the process works perfectly well with washing soda (sodium carbonate) which is far safer to handle.</p>

"Can clamps be too tight?","2773","","<p>When gluing pieces together, I've always used an abundance of clamps and tightened them with all my might. Is it possible to tighten them too much? At some point, could I squeeze out so much glue that the joint becomes weaker?</p>

<p>I can see how tightening too much can cause warping or damage to the wood. Here, I'm mostly curious about the effect the tightness has on the performance of the glue.</p>
","<p>Hoping to run into some more tests and calculations but this is a good start.</p>

<h1>Yes</h1>

<p>Clamps can be too tight and the joint could weaken or even warp, in a sense, if too much pressure is applied. </p>

<p>I found this out by accident using spring-style clamps to repair a break in a board. I left it out overnight for the glue to set with 3 spring clamps keeping it in place. The spring tension increased <em>slightly</em> during that time and it started to pull the piece away. While it still bonded, the extra tension was enough to set the break at an angle. I had to re-break and reset but the damage was done and the joint was never perfect. </p>

<p>I now use C-clamps for most of my gluing since I can control the amount of pressure exerted from them and I know that I can leave them alone long term and they wont move. </p>

<p>I would suggest using a <em>non-spring</em> clamp for gluing. The amount of glue is important as well as you don't want sliding to occur.</p>

<p>To continue on how much glue to use that would depend on your wood you have. Softer woods can be more porous and take in more glue than some of the harder woods. </p>

<p><strong>Gluing SCIENCE!</strong></p>

<p>A post from <a href=""http://woodgears.ca/joint_strength/glue_methods.html"" rel=""nofollow"">WoodGears.ca</a> performs a series of experiments using some maple and varying amounts of pressure. </p>

<p>If you scroll to the bottom you will see the overall results. The pictures are very telling as you would see excessive pressure removed most all the glue from the joint. </p>

<p>The summary findings from that post.</p>

<blockquote>
<li>Only applying glue to the mortise of a mortise and tenon joint is a bad idea
<li> Excessive clamping force can weaken the joint strength by up to 20%
<li> A very smooth scraped surface is just as good, if not better than a sanded surface, as long as not clamped excessively hard
<li> Gaps in a joint, as long as they are filled with glue, do not adversely affect joint strength.

","<p>In short: <strong>No, no, no</strong>.</p>

<p>You can technically do this, unluckily, but it is <strong>highly inadvisable</strong>. It is a pity that it just looks like one could do it (1/2'' is not far off compared to 12mm, and 1/4'' is even closer to 6mm) and that with some luck, it indeed <em>seems</em> to ""work just fine"".<br>
That is true for the other way around, too. You can hardly tell a difference with the naked eye, and the bits will fit in ""just fine"" either way.</p>

<p>I've seen people do it, too, and they so far got away without accident or even physical injury (which makes the whole matter worse because that ""proves"" that it works).</p>

<p>However, using an imperial bit in the corresponding (well, almost corresponding) metric collet is dangerous <em>both</em> during the operation <em>and</em> when using the collet with your 6mm bits as intended afterwards.</p>

<p>What happens is that you irreversibly widen your collet by a tiny amount (too small to see, but certainly enough to be on the dangerous side). If you are unlucky, the whole thing blows to smithereens at 25k RPM with shrapnels flying all over the place and the bit come off flying in a random direction.<br>
If you are lucky, it ""works fine"", but now the collet no longer grips the original bits firmly and safely, so you have the risk of a bit flying away in a random direction every time you use the tool ""properly"" with the correct bits. Plus, you never know if the collet isn't going to break a month or two later, anyway.</p>

<p>The same is true for the opposite case, using a metric bit in an imperial collet. Only in this case, you force the clamps together much more than originally intended. There is a bit of tolerance, so you can certainly fasten the screw harshly enough to do those extra 0.3 millimeters, but it's not what the tool manufacturer intended you to do, or planned in.<br>
The bit isn't going to have a sufficiently firm, safe grip, and you cannot be sure whether you have structurally damaged the collet by bending the little clamps too harshly.</p>

<p>How can I create spalting artificially? I would like to take either a raw board, or a finished piece, and somehow ""spalt"" it, under controlled conditions.</p>
","<p>I have had a good read on this and the best intro I could find comes from <a href=""http://www.finewoodworking.com/how-to/article/spalt-your-own-lumber.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fine WoodWorking</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Spalting wood is a lot like growing plants. With the right amounts of food, water, and heat, you should end up with good results, but success is by no means guaranteed</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Which wood?</h1>

<p>Elitists in spalting don't have a consensus on what wood are good for spalting. Some suggest hardwoods, like maple, so that the process won't soften the piece too much. Other suggest it does not matter. One thing is for sure that all wood can rot. This whole process is based on time and experimentation. You will never end up with the same looking piece twice (hence the allure to spalting).</p>

<h1>Stage your environment</h1>

<p>Spalting, as mentioned, comes from fungi. Fungi likes to grow in warm and moist conditions. You will need a container that can close but does <em>not</em> have a complete seal. Oxygen needs to get in to allow the fungi to grow. Try and fill your container with some soil and humus (dead plant matter) to encourage fungi growth.</p>

<p>A <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/turning/comments/2xpcuc/spalting_your_own_wood_tips_tricks_and_a_little/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">redditor</a> suggested adding cold coffee into the mix to raise the PH level to encourage fungus growth as well.</p>

<h1>The Fungi</h1>

<p>Green wood or fresh timber most likely already have some fungus present so adding more might not be required. Add more anyway can help expedite the process and ensure overall success.</p>

<p>It is possible to use wood that is already covered with fungi to put into your container. Sections of fell tree for example. Coming across already spalt<i>ing</i> wood should be just as easy. In the event you cannot get any (fungi) you can, like <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/users/91/keshlam"">keshlam</a>  says, purchase spores. Although I don't have any specific suggestions as to where to acquire them. </p>

<p>There are some other suggestions such as simply picking mushrooms. I would suggest if you are going to do that you should refer a guide that has information about mushrooms in your local. </p>

<p>Either way, once you have a source, place it around the container as much as possible.</p>

<h1>Adding the wood</h1>

<p>Some people will allow the fungus to start before putting wood in by waiting serveral weeks. This is an experiment so depending on your environment (temperature and humidity) there is no wrong approach so try and see what works best for you. You can add the wood and fungi at the same time.</p>

<p>So that you do not disturb the growth over time it is a great idea to have some smaller test pieces in the mix. That way you can check the overall progress without moving your large/main wood.</p>

<p>At a minimum get some of the fungus around the end grain of your pieces. Fungi will favor there over the center of your wood.</p>

<h1>The Waiting Game</h1>

<p>Assuming that you have the right conditions for growth it is recommended that you check your container after the first 5-6 weeks. If there is measurable progress then keep checking every 2 weeks after that until the desired effect is found on the wood. </p>

<p><strong>Be careful not to leave the wood in too long</strong> as the process can penetrate the wood to the point where it is too soft to work. This is why you are checking it periodically.</p>

<h1>Your Spalted Wood</h1>

<p>When it looks like you have a piece that has the right amount of flair from spalting remove it from the container and clean its surface from soil and other debris. Let the wood air dry before you use it. Once dry you can safely work the wood by sanding, planing or turning etc. Once the wood is finished there should be no way for the fungi to continue growing and they would remain in a dormant state. </p>

<h1>Safety</h1>

<p>The are a number of potential safety concerns when it comes to spalting wood since you are encouraging the grow of fungus which in turn creates spores. Several sites suggest that your bathroom is a good place because of the humidity. While that might not be the best idea, as long as you have good ventilation it should not be harmful. The first link, in references below, contains some good general knowledge concerning your experiment and your safety. </p>

<p>For spalting, just like all woodworking, <strong>WEAR A MASK</strong>! If are lucky enough to live in a warm and wet climate: Spalt outside. Also, avoid doing your own spalting if you have respiratory disorders. </p>

<p>Polyurethane is the most common recommendation these days although there are other varnishes on the market. To be honest even the cheaper products will give good performance — in terms of application, and the finish and protection provided — but as with so many things it is worth paying a little extra for one higher up the food chain.</p>

Like other blade, most chain saw chains are designed to cut across the grain, and when you use those to cut along the grain it takes more work for you and the saw.  </p>

"How can I accurately cross-cut a board that is too wide for my table saw?","2591","","<p>I have some 0.75"" x 14"" wide boards that I'm trying cut to lengths in the 50-60"" range. It's important that the cuts be precise, and true.</p>

<p>However, 14"" is too wide for any of my sleds or miter slides on my table saw. I'm having a very difficult time cutting these.</p>

<p>The closest I've got so far is to attach the miter slide to the board and slide it through. The problem is it's 1) very difficult to position the edge of the blade at the cut line while also positioning the board on the slide, and 2) at the start of the cut the slide is barely in the track, maybe a half inch or so, and it doesn't stabilize until it's about 6"" in, so it's extremely difficult to keep the cut straight (this also makes problem #1 even harder):</p>

<p>What are my options? I don't mind building other sleds, I'm just... not sure what to do.</p>

"Will a beam of laminated boards be stronger when the members are vertical or horizontal?","2545","","<p>I'm planning construction of a simple gymnastics balance beam which will be 12' long x 4"" wide x 4+"" deep. Based on various plans found online, I've purchased 6x 1x6 pine boards which I'll laminate to gain the dimensions I need. They're mostly straight, but I'll have to cut them down a bit in order to even the edges after laminating, which I expect will leave me with 4-5"" in one dimension.</p>

<p>I'm aware that e.g. floor joists are installed vertically to maximize stiffness, but if the joined width of this beam ends up equal to the depth, would it sag least when the boards are in a horizontal or vertical orientation?</p>
","<p>Mechanical engineer here. The answer is it depends. The glue strength, wood strength, and beam dimensions will all play a factor in determining which orientation is stronger.</p>

<p>For <a href=""http://www.conradfp.com/pdf/ch4-Mechanical-Properties-of-Wood.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Eastern White Pine (PDF) </a>, modulus of rupture is 59,000 kPa.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.titebond.com/product.aspx?id=21051713-5cce-4925-a653-3bff0a0f71ab"" rel=""nofollow"">Titebond II</a> lists its bond strength (I'm assuming shear) as 26,500 kPa.</p>

<p>You'll often hear that the wood will fail prior to the glue failing, which is true for stress perpendicular to the grain. Eastern White Pine's cross-grain modulus is a mere 2,100 kPa.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending"" rel=""nofollow"">Beam stress</a> is calculated by moment (torque) on a beam section, multiplied by the distance from the neutral axis (center of beam for a rectangle), and divided by the cross sectional moment of area, ""I"". For a point load at the center of a simply supported beam (person of weight ""W"" in the middle of a balance beam of length ""L""), the maximum moment will be 1/4*W*L.</p>

<p>The moment of area is equal to 1/12*h^3*w, where h is the thickness of the beam, and w is the width.</p>

<p>So your maximum stress at the bottom of the beam would be 3*W*L/(2*h^2*w). For a laminate beam made up of six 19mm x 140mm boards stacked vertically on top of each other (5.5"" wide, 4.5"" thick), with a 150 lb gymnast in the middle of the 16' beam, your maximum stress at the bottom will be 2,681 kPa. That gives a safety factor of 22 (keep in mind that's for a static loading, not dynamic).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> </p>

<p><strike>However, your stress at the bottom laminate surface (one board thickness up) will be 1,790 kPa, which is only a safety factor of 15, since the glue strength is the new weak point.</strike> I took a bit more time to <a href=""http://www.rosboro.com/pdfs/techguide060326.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">research glulam properties (PDF)</a>,  (after reading LeeG's answer) and thought about it some more, and realized I had oversimplified the problem. Wood is anisotropic with many defects, and the grain isn't always parallel to the board length. I also didn't account for the lumber and the glue to have different <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%27s_modulus"" rel=""nofollow"">moduli of elasticity</a>, which could allow one to stretch a bit and the other to take up some of the stress.</p>

<p>Glulam beams can also use stronger or flaw-free boards on the top and bottom (where the highest stresses are) to increase the overall beam capacity. A good analogy would be an I beam, with the web in the center mainly dealing with only shear loading. I also suspect glulam beams are laid up face to face, since it's much cheaper to use many narrow boards than a few very wide boards oriented vertically.</p>

<p><strong>END EDIT</strong></p>

<p>For the other option, turn the beam on its side, with the boards standing on edge, and the strength of the glue is no longer a factor. It merely holds the boards together for an additive effect from width, not a square effect from thickness. This puts less critical dependency on your glue up technique and the glue strength. Plus, it will be 5.5"" thick, and 4.5"" wide, which will be even stronger in bending.</p>

<p>So since you're dealing with a beam that's roughly the same dimensions in width and height (a big plus is the ~1"" extra in thickness gained by standing them on edge), the boards you're using are all the same grade of lumber (I assume), and you may or may not have flaws in your glue up technique (no one's perfect), I'd stick with standing the boards on edge and gluing them side by side. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: For this application, laminate boards standing on their edges, because science.</strong></p>

<p>And note that 'sandpaper' is especially a misnomer here since this type of paper isn't, and has never been, made from sand. The most common abrasive used for paper like this is silicon carbide (sometimes shortened to SiC, so the paper may be referred to as ""SiC paper""). Usually when someone says SiC paper they mean wet-and-dry paper<sup>1</sup>. Also, since the abrasive is a dark grey or black in colour they'll sometimes be referred to by colour<sup>2</sup>.

<p>In general, not for sanding wood. It can of course sand wood and it'll do it well, since the abrasive is sharp and <em>very</em> hard, but some finishing gurus say that it shouldn't be used for sanding wood because of its dark colour, which can be obvious on certain lighter-coloured woods if any abrasive particles get stuck in pores or grain and can't easily be removed when you're done sanding. </p>

<p>Final quick note, it's important to bear the following in mind when reading American woodworking and finishing guides when using P-rated papers.</p>

<p><strong>P-rated paper</strong><br>
There are two main classification systems used for abrasive paper, CAMI and FEPA. CAMI is the American system which uses a plain number, FEPA is from Europe and has the P before the number. </p>

<p>P-rated papers generally produce a slightly more uniform scratch pattern (fewer scratches that are deeper than expected) because the abrasive grit is more accurately screened, so there can be a much narrower range of grits bound to the paper than on a CAMI paper. Obviously good results are possible with papers classified either way, but in general it's more feasible to skip grits when sanding using P-rated papers.</p>

<p>While the two systems share most of the same numbers they don't unfortunately correlate across the whole span of grits :-( Within the narrow band of grits used most commonly in woodworking they are roughly equivalent, so 220 and P220 are nearly the same, but once you get to higher numbers (finer grits) they begin to diverge and for example 600 grit paper is actually nearly equivalent to P1200!</p>

<hr>

<p>1 It's possible that all abrasive papers or cloths that use silicon carbide can be used wet, so regardless of the name used it may <em>always</em> refer to a waterproof abrasive even when that is not specified. </p>

<p>2 Not all grey papers use silicon carbide however. Light-grey papers, usually fine to very fine, are sold for smoothing/flattening finish and these are made from aluminium oxide (more commonly seen in abrasives in its red form, as used on most sanding belts and sheets for powered sanders of all types).</p>

"What is a wedged through tenon and how is it used?","2454","","<p>What is a wedged through tenon and how is it constructed? How is it different than a ""standard"" mortise and tenon? When should it be used?</p>
","<p>This is where you mortise right through the timber, and hammer wedges into the joint from the other side, in order to mechanically wedge the tenon into the joint. You still use glue as you normally would.</p>

<p>See <a href=""http://www.craftsmanspace.com/knowledge/wedged-tenon-and-mortise-joint.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""wedged through tenon"">here</a> for examples.</p>

<p>I'll include the images here for future reference:</p>

<p>Outer wedged:

<p>Inner wedged:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FN7Dx.jpg"" alt=""inner wedged through tenon""></p>

<p>They're typically used when making doors, and are good because they form a good strong joint, and they look nice from the front (better than a mitre joint), however they're not all that nice to look at from the edges, and the timber of the mortised piece can shrink or swell around the tenoned end or the wedges and leave them sunken in or sticking proud after some time. You'll also need to play around a bit with the width of the tenon vs the mortise and the taper angle of the wedges etc. the first time you make one, to get it just right.</p>

<p>Note that (as with just about any type of joint) there are many variations for different situations. See <a href=""http://www.craftsmanspace.com/knowledge/mortise-and-tenon-woodworking-joints.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""mortise tenon variations"">here</a> for many more examples. Probably the most important and commonly used variation is the ""haunched"" joint which is where you cut part of the tenon away, to space it away from a corner (e.g. the top or bottom of a door leaf):</p>

"Water-based polyurethane Vs. Oil-based polyurethane","2450","","<p>What are the key differences between a water-based polyurethane and a oil-based polyurethane? How would one be better than the other? What lasts longer on wood, penetrates, Etc. When should there be one used over another (for a given project)?</p>
","<p>Unfortunately this is an <em>it depends</em>.</p>

<p>There are some broad generalisations that can be made but waterbased polys have been steadily improved over the years (the early ones were pretty bad according to some accounts!) and now some have qualities that rival the oil-based counterparts. This, along with their inherent advantages, makes them well worth trying out when some years ago I would have recommended staying well away.</p>

<p><strong>What are they?</strong><br>
First off before going any further it's important to describe what each of these actually is. Neither of these products is a polyurethane product in the way that you might be thinking, i.e. made from polyurethane only. Instead both are other coatings with <em>some</em> polyurethane added.</p>

<p>Waterbased polys are usually acrylic or co-polymer suspension coatings (not true varnishes).</p>

<p>Oil-based polys are modified alkyd varnishes, or uralkyds as they're described in the industry.</p>

<p>Knowing this goes some way to explaining why oil-based are generally superior and why some polys are much tougher than others, simply put they add very little to some versions and more to others.</p>

<p>The more they add the better the scratch-resistance, waterproofing and resistance to heat. So in no way can you think of ""waterbased poly"" and ""oil-based polyurethane"" as each being one uniform thing because they can vary <em>enormously</em> from brand to brand. But some broad generalisation can be made all the same.</p>

<p><strong>What are they like?</strong><br>
Oil-based first since this came first:</p>

<ul>
<li>Naturally coloured, from a light yellow to something more amber.</li>
<li>Because the oil base discolours over time these varnishes discolour, going slightly more yellow/ochre after a number of years (how much and how fast depends on total light exposure and the thickness of the application so normally there's no reason to panic that ""Your varnish is going to turn yellow!"").</li>
<li>Noticeable chemical or solvent smell (depending on formulation). Not only is the smell strong to very strong it's also one that people often find offensive or nauseating.</li>
<li>Odour dissipates slowly and is noted for lingering in enclosed spaces. </li>
<li>Slow drying, relatively.</li>
<li>Slow to fully cure, again relatively.</li>
<li>Cleanup with mineral spirits (UK: white spirit). You can also use turpentine if you wish, but it doesn't make any difference to the varnish itself just to the user.</li>
<li>Dilution with spirits. Oil-based varnishes can be thinned as much as wanted to provide anything from improved brushability (1:10) to a watery penetrating liquid (10:1) and anything in between. What's now called wiping varnish is a dilution of regular varnish of approximately 1:3 although you can go thinner or thicker as you prefer or as needed (some varnishes are thinner than others).</li>
</ul>

<p>Waterbased polys:</p>

<ul>
<li>Won't yellow.</li>
<li>Lower odour (also a very different type of odour that people tend not to find offensive).</li>
<li>Odour dissipates quickly upon drying.</li>
<li>Fast drying to very fast drying.</li>
<li>Fast curing, relatively. This process still takes <em>much</em> longer than the drying time, but is only a couple of days or so versus a week to 10 days.</li>
<li>Water cleanup (although you want to use soap and water ideally, and warm water where available).</li>
<li>Prone to bubbles drying in the finish. The product is inherently prone to bubble formation and the fast drying can easily lock tiny bubbles in place, where with oil-based varnishes the slower drying gives more time for bubbles to rise to the surface and burst.</li>
<li>Not as easy to apply to a really good standard as the oil-based type, in part because of the fast drying and being prone to bubbles.</li>
<li>Can't be diluted like oil-based can. A small amount of added water can be added if and when needed but the manufacturers and industry pros warn that over-thinning can introduce problems with film formation so it's generally not advised to thin this type of product to any great degree if you want it to provide good protection, and adding water can greatly increase the tendency for bubbles to form which is a huge headache.</li>
<li>Can't be wiped on like oil-based poly. You can literally wipe it on, use a cloth to wipe the stuff on the surface, but it doesn't work at all the same way and the fast drying time means you can't wipe away the excess reliably even a short time after application.</li>
</ul>

<p>You'll notice that I don't list above that they're colourless or ""water clear"" because that's no longer universal. Because the colour traditional varnishes impart is considered desirable to some users some tinted waterbased polys are now available.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Notes on drying</strong><br>
All the comments above about drying and curing times are based on average conditions. Where it's warm and dry everything dries and cures faster and people who live in such a climate tend to benefit greatly from this, although it can lead to frustrations working with fast-drying waterbased products.</p>

<p>Where it's cool and the humidity is high drying times can be greatly slowed and in the worst cases high humidity can prevent proper curing because the finish won't dry fully, resulting in a finish that's seemingly permanently sticky. Note that even if it's warm high humidity can retard proper drying.</p>

<hr>

<p>The best of both types are excellent coatings, providing good to very good water-resistance and good to excellent scratch-resistance, but the worst of the waterbased type are still weak and not really worth using if you're hoping for good performance. So it's important to shop around and seek a product with good independent test results (can't go by what the maker says about the product!) and an abundance of good user feedback.</p>

"Why aren't belt sanders with sanding frames available anywhere?","2430","","<p>I'm not sure if this question is a fit for Stack Exchange, but I'll try to make it fit.  </p>

<p>I bought a Bosch 1274DVS 10 years ago and I was able to get an accessory 'guide'.  The guide was a frame that went around the belt sander to help prevent 'digging' into a large work piece and helping keep it level.</p>

<p>My dad would like a belt sander with this optional guide, but my model is no longer available and last year I was able to find 1 that had it as an option.  I cannot find any right now.  While this isn't how people primarily use the belt sanders, I wonder why this VERY useful accessory isn't more widely available?  Do people feel confident enough to sand a large cherry tabletop unguided?  or are there other tools that have replaced the need for this?</p>

<p>Edit: Right after writing this question, I found the guides are called 'sanding frames'...</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, frames are a relatively rare accessory, but they do exist. I started with all belt sanders currently available at the time of this writing at Amazon (with good reviews) and Home Depot (in stock in stores or online), then looked for sanding frames. I have built a list <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cmuIlqmQAieNVtJEliVgOdNH50Fl5ZXDk2lQc7U1y-o/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. In this list:</p>

<p>Couple of notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>DeWalt, Milwaukee, and Bosch no longer manufacture belt sanders, at least not under those names (DeWalt and Black &amp; Decker are the same company).</li>
<li>There are sanding frames available for out-of-production sanders (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=sanding%20frame"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon has some</a>, for example), I did not include those.</li>
<li>Porter-Cable, Ridgid, Ryobi, and SKIL don't seem to have frames for any of their current sanders and the internet is full of people who are sad about this.</li>
<li>Makita refers to sanding frames as ""sanding shoes"" instead, while Porter-Cable uses ""sanding shoe"" to refer to the base plate behind the belt.</li>

<p>The Black &amp; Decker one is listed as a ""replacement part"" so I'm not sure if it actually comes with the sander or is an optional accessory.</p>

<p>At the current time, vendors for all of the above can be found fairly easily by searching the internet for the relevant model numbers.</p>

<p>Evidence suggests that sander / frame pairs come and go, so it's entirely possible that the future will have a completely different set. There does not seem to be any historical consistency to which lines of sanders have frames available. Also, the prices vary wildly, from $15 USD to $150 USD, so you might want to shop around a bit.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are frames for out-of-production sanders floating around as well. E.g. <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00002232Q"" rel=""nofollow"">here is a DeWalt frame</a> for the DW430 and DW431 belt sanders. <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0000223H7"" rel=""nofollow"">Here is a Bosch frame</a> that fits the 1276D and 1276DVS. </p>

<p><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0000223HA"" rel=""nofollow"">This frame</a> reportedly fits the <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0000223HB"" rel=""nofollow"">1274DVS</a>, which I'm assuming is the same setup you purchased in the past. </p>

<hr>

<p>A note about sanding frames in general: While I've never owned one myself, reportedly the gotcha with sanding frames for large surfaces is that one side of the frame ends up sitting lower on the already-sanded part of the material. The <a href=""http://www.skileurope.com/ie/en/diyaccocs/accessories/1165/471/accessories-for-belt-sanders/_equalizer_-sanding-frame/"" rel=""nofollow"">SKIL ""Equalizer""</a> presumably solves this issue (it's only half a frame, a fact they seem to be extremely proud of as <a href=""http://www.skileurope.com/general/en/products/innovations/patented-equalizer-sanding-frame/patented-equalizer-sanding-frame.html"" rel=""nofollow"">they patented it</a>). So I guess you have to be careful about where you apply pressure, trying to prefer the unsanded side.</p>

<p>There is strength in numbers so it is best to have several along the length of the join. I have not found a good reference for how many. I should think at least 1 every 3 feet with a minimum of one on each end (<strong>Speculation</strong>). Using some dowels a spacers will help stop lateral movement and are and easy addition. If you do use dowels remember to only glue one end ( if any ) to allow for dis-assembly.</p>

<p>Matching the holes is important but you are allowed some margin for error as the bolt will assemble to the nut at a <em>slight</em> angle.</p>

"Hollowing out a piece of timber","2352","","<p>Wood, well most wood, is heavy. Is there any such thing as people ever hollowing out the inside of the wood to make the finished product lighter? </p>

<p>For example, let's say I have a 4in. x 4in. x 8' piece of timber to make 4 desk legs out of. Instead of having four square desk legs of solid wood, could I hollow out the inside of the timber leaving only about a 1/2 inch thickness on each of the four sides? This would save wood for other projects, and accomplish making the desk lighter while hopefully still providing a pretty sturdy, un-wobbly base.</p>

<p>What tools and method could I use to hollow out the inside of this piece of timber?</p>

<p><sup>Source: me</sup></p>

<p>Dark gray areas are waste. This assumes you have a .1"" thick blade.</p>

<p>Basically, you would take off 1/2"" from opposite sides, then take 1/2"" off from the remaining uncut sides. To bring the hollowed piece back to square, you remove two blade thicknesses from the edge of each wider piece.</p>

<p>This leaves you with a decent sized ""core"" that can be used elsewhere.</p>

<p>If you make clean cuts and align everything well when gluing it back together you will have a piece that looks like a 4x4, but is 60% lighter.</p>

<p>To glue the pieces back together, you could just butt join them, but ideally you'd probably use a biscuit joiner to both align the pieces, and give them a little extra strength.</p>

"Why is my countersink bit making hexagonal holes?","2345","","<p>Every time I use my countersink bit, it creates a hexagonal hole.</p>

<p>Yes I believe that's partly it. But it's almost certainly not the only issue and the main one I think is that it's not sharp enough — this type of countersink rarely is from what I've seen. </p>

<p>I have three of what looks like <em>exactly</em> the same countersink and every one of them was not sharp straight from the package, and I have seen many others on sale that appear to be just as (not) sharp. </p>

<p>Definitely sharpen the bit if you can manage it as a first step to solving the problem.</p>

<p>Sharpening mine did improve performance, although it wasn't an absolute fix. In use the technique that seemed to help the most for me was to run the drill fast and use light pressure, with a very firm hold on the drill. This worked far more reliably than using low speed and firm pressure.</p>

<p>Another tip I read just the other day that you might like to try: <strong>countersink before you drill the clearance hole</strong>. I haven't been in a position to try it myself or I'd report on its effectiveness firsthand but apparently it makes a big difference. </p>

"which direction does wood expand?","2335","","<p>I know that wood expands due to seasonal changes in humidity and temperature, but that's the extent of my knowledge about it. </p>

<p>In which direction do wood boards expand? In the same direction as the grain? Perpendicular to the grain direction? Both? Does it matter if it's a quarter sawn board or not?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>Wood is made of fibers.  Think of wood as a bunch of soda straws or flexible rubber tubes bundled together.  When you add water, the fibers expand to hold the extra water.  When it dries, they contract.  So you will see expansion across the width of the grain, and very little along its length.  </p>

<p>There are two types of wood, heartwood and sap wood.  Sap wood is what actively carries the water, and heart wood which is 'dead' wood does not.  So the fibers in the sapwood expand much more readily than the fibers in the heartwood.   </p>

<p>All boards will expand as moisture increases, the difference between plainsawn and quartersawn wood is the direction of the expansion.  Plainsawn wood will tend to cup, while quartersawn wood will just get wider.   </p>

"Drilling a straight, centered hole down square-cross-section bar stock?","2313","","<p>I'm trying to drill a centered, straight hole in a piece without a big drill press and a bunch of clamps and brackets, which seems to be the usual way to do it. <strong>I can manage straight, but centered is eluding me</strong>.</p>

<p>I'm very new to working wood and I'm working on an umbrella swift for my partner to wind yarn on. Part of this involves an axle (in this case, simple dowel) and a couple of square-sided blocks that rotate around it. A bit of friction is actively desirable, so this isn't even going to get a sheave bearing, let alone anything fancier.</p>

<p>I'm having a lot of trouble drilling a straight, centered hole down the square stock, and tend to get a hole that's off center and/or not straight.</p>

<p>With a <a href=""http://www.bunnings.com.au/sontax-43mm-collar-drill-guide_p6350091"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">basic drill guide (collar style)</a> I can get it pretty straight, but setting the work piece perfectly perpendicular is tricky since the edges from where it's cut off the bar stock aren't quite square after hand-sawing. (Maybe I should be using a mitre box?). I'm dealing with this by mounting it in a vise and measuring it carefully before tightening.</p>

<p>Getting the hole centered is just not working though. I drill a small pilot hole with a 2-bit, but it still tends to wander half a mil off center once it bites and starts drilling. I suspect it might be because of the soft pine I'm working with and the fact that I'm drilling down the line of the grain, not across it, but I don't have much choice about that. Widening the hole tends to make the situation worse, as the bit again tends to wander before biting properly.</p>

<p>If I go straight to the 12mm spade bit for the full width cut it tends to wander more, rather than less.</p>

<p>I'm also getting a hole that's usually not quite round - slightly distorted on three sides. Is this because I'm drilling with the grain?</p>

<p>Please forgive my ignorance. I've been hunting around for info, but mostly finding things focused on drilling down the center of round stock like dowel, where you can spin the stock in a drill and use a fixed bit. That's not an option here.</p>

<p><em>(I suspect this is like those programming questions I get on SO, where someone wants to know ""how to build a dynamic website with PostgreSQL"", where the answer is ""let me write a book"" or ""where do I start""... but I'm hoping there are just a few simple tricks I'm missing here.)</em></p>

"Can you make a small wooden sail boat from cedar?","2300","","<p>We have a lot of trees we've been removing from our property for one reason or another. Instead of throwing them on the burn pile, I thought I might be able to make something of them. </p>

<p>I've always wanted to make a small wood sail boat. Something along the lines of this:
<img src=""https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e8/22/ab/e822aba14ec3b4324de78f13f078554b.jpg"" alt=""https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e8/22/ab/e822aba14ec3b4324de78f13f078554b.jpg""></p>

<p>That's probably not what I'm going to start on as I'll most likely screw something up and have wasted a massive amount of effort. I'll probably start with a canoe.</p>

<p>My question is what type of wood can I use from my property, properly dried of course. I'll either let it air dry or build one of those drying boxes you can build that act like a kind of oven. I love the look of cedar and we have a lot of it, but we've taken down a lot of oak as well and I know it's strong. It would probably be good for the ribs and the big beam along the bottom. (Transom?)</p>

<p>I'm really just starting to look into this, so I don't know the right questions to ask. I assume with the wood, it's simply a strength issue, because it gets coated in fiberglass sheets. I've seen videos where they do that to seal it and when the coating goes on, it makes it look like there is nothing on the wood. This sailboat will only be run on a fresh water river. Thanks for any help. Feel free to include references.</p>
","<p>Yes, provided you use fiberglass, and the technique is often called ""cedar strip construction"". This method of construction is a very forgiving method of building small boats compared to other techniques.</p>

<p>Pretty much any wood will work, though cedar and other rot-resistant woods are better because when you invariably bump into rocks or other stuff, and expose the wood through the fiberglass, that it doesn't rot away between when it gets damaged and you get around to fixing it.</p>

<p>The reason why the wood doesn't really matter is because virtually all the strength of the construction comes from the fiberglass. The wood only serves to keep the two layers of fiberglass separated, in what's known as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich-structured_composite"">sandwich structured composite</a>. In typical fiberglass boat construction, foam is used between the layers, instead of wood. </p>

<p>After the fiberglass is applied, without a gelcoat, it dries to be almost completely transparent.</p>

<p>With all that said, this works well for canoes and kayaks, however sailboats have many extra steps involved as they need to be much more rigid, are much bigger, and have hull shape needs that are challenging to accomplish with cedar strip construction such as provisions for a keel or centerboards.</p>

<p>Plunge cuts with a chainsaw are made all the time with chain mortisers, like the one pictured below made by Makita.</p>

<p>However, you will notice that this mortiser has a sturdy frame to control the saw and has a controlled rate of feed provided by the plunge handle.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the potential kickback on entry hard to avoid or control?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the contrary, a chainsaw that is controlled by your arms has neither of these very necessary things.  Chainsaws are quite powerful and can very easily overpower the confining power of your arms.  Couple this with the variable feed rate your non-mechanized arms supply, and you have the recipe for disaster.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the wood more likely to bind onto the chain in this case and/or break it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without the control of a supporting frame, I'd say it's easier to twist the chainsaw bar and bind the chain.  Therefore, your risk for breakage is higher.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is not to say that you <em>can't</em> do plunge cuts with a chainsaw (I've done it myself on rare occasions where I had some sort of physical barrier keeping the saw from flying into my face).

  <p>What is the best way to divide these boards evenly (and close to level)? What tools to I need to buy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you requested I'll concentrate on a handtools-only approach but fair warning, even on smaller boards this can be a lot of work and difficult to do accurately. On boards 15"" wide it will also pose a great challenge physically — hard work, and for some hours.</p>

<p><strong>Traditional method</strong></p>

<p>The splitting of an existing board you're looking to do here is referred to as <em>re-sawing</em>, because you're sawing again what was previously sawed in a mill.</p>

<p>The traditional way this would be done, the method that would be recommended in older woodworking books, would be fairly simple in outline: you begin simply by marking or gauging your cut line across the middle of both long edges and the board ends, then, holding the work in a vice, begin sawing using the right saw (a <strong>rip saw</strong>, which is made specifically for sawing along the grain). </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o7xVl.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o7xVl.jpg"" alt=""Traditional ripsaw""></a></p>

<p>So the minimum toolkit for this would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>ruler and pencil, or marking gauge</li>
<li>panel saw, sharpened for ripping</li>
<li>a vice to hold the workpiece </li>
<li>one or more small wooden wedges to keep the kerf open</li>
<li>one or two hand planes to flatten the sawn surface</li>
<li>scraper and/or sandpaper to smooth the board faces</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: the vice must be attached to something fairly stout and heavy, ideally immovable, in order that energy is not wasted in moving the table as you saw. This is one of the reasons for the great heft of traditional woodworking benches.</p>

<p>The above description of the method makes this sound fairly easy and straightforward but in practice it's anything but, especially on boards of significant width and/or length.</p>

<p><strong>Modern method</strong></p>

<p>There's a significant improvement to the above possible but unfortunately it requires quite a bit more work or your behalf as you need to build the #1 item on the tool list, the <strong>kerfing plane</strong>. Read more about that <a href=""http://www.theunpluggedwoodshop.com/the-kerfing-plane-part-one.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> on the Unplugged Woodshop site, with video to go along with it.</p>

<p>The job of the kerfing plane here is create a starting groove along all four edges of your boards. Saws naturally want to track in existing grooves (taking the path of least resistance) so this makes it much easier to saw straight and true through the length of a board. It's not a 100% fix, but it's a big help so if you're re-sawing a lot by hand one of these is worth making.</p>

<p>So the toolkit would now be:</p>

<ul>
<li>kerfing plane </li>
<li>multi-purpose panel saw (see note below)</li>
<li>a vice to hold the workpiece </li>
<li>one or more small wooden wedges to keep the kerf open</li>
<li>one or two hand planes to flatten the sawn surface</li>
<li>scraper and/or sandpaper to smooth the board faces</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: these days it can be very difficult to find a good ripsaw, and expensive when you do find one. As a result many woodworkers actually buy multi-purpose panel saws with different tooth geometry to the traditional Western saws which were for ripping OR crosscutting. One example:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iK20R.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iK20R.jpg"" alt=""Modern tooth geometry, panel saw""></a></p>

<p>This is a disadvantage as they neither rip nor cross-cut as well as dedicated saws for these jobs, however they have advantages too. Their teeth are ""impulse hardened"" or induction hardened making them <em>much</em> harder than those on traditional saws, so blunt far less quickly even in hard and tough woods, but most especially when cutting manmade boards such as plywood and MDF. And the modern tooth geometry means they do some cutting on the pull stroke (as well as the main cutting done on the push stroke). They're also significantly cheaper, perhaps 1/5 the price.</p>

<p><strong>Japanese saws</strong></p>

<p>A lot of Western woodworkers today use Asian-style saws (in practice nearly all Japanese) for some or all of their cutting. These saws can be very effective, tracking well and cutting very cleanly and swiftly because of the tooth geometry. </p>

<p>But I don't think you should consider one because of the maximum length of cut. Many of these saws feature blades of 250-300mm, one foot or less, and as soon as you saw at an angle the length of the cut becomes significantly longer than your starting length of 15"". So in order to do your cuts you'd need to saw the entire length of the board <em>twice</em> (working in from each long edge), in essence nearly doubling the work!</p>

","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This depends on the depth of cut you take with the jointer.  If you take a pretty shallow cut (1/32"" is probably about right) and have very sharp jointer blades, the finish should be ok cutting cross-grain.  However, you will still likely get some blowout on the back end of the piece (the last part to be fed through the jointer).  This is because the jointer knives will want to spilt the cross grain off the corner.  This can be alleviated by chamfering that corner before planing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would you use a jointer on end grain?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would avoid it.  As @rob said, it's very dangerous, and the risk-vs.-reward is not in your favor.  Just imagine the knives splitting off the chunk your hand was using to feed the piece through, and then there being nothing between your hand and that rapidly-rotating, very sharp set of blades.  Even if you're using push blocks, the push blocks could catch in the blades and be flung across the shop (if you're lucky) or flung into your face/gut/crotch (if you're less lucky).</p>

<p>I have found success using a <em>very</em> sharp hand plane to level off end grain on cutting boards.  The success of this approach is very dependent on your ability to glue up the blank mostly level/flush in the first place so you have less to remove.</p>

"How do I cut a 45 degree bevel on a table saw with consistent dimensions?","2189","","<p>I tried making consistent 45 degree bevels to create a cube.

<p>What are the finer points to using a table saw for bevel cuts?</p>

<p>How do I cut a 45 degree bevel on a table saw with consistent dimensions?</p>
","<p>I do this a lot. That is, I cut 24 bevels on 6 squares of wood.</p>

<p>The first trick is get your blade set at a 45 degree angle.  Since I started using a digital level (Wixie Digit) it has made the task much easier. Otherwise, you would need to make repeated cuts on scrap until you get your angle. (Two pieces placed bevel to bevel will form a right angle that you can check with a try-square.)</p>

<p>The next trick is to use a dedicated sled with the slot cut at 45 degrees to the saw table top. It doesn't have to be a full size sled unless you are making large cubes.  My sled also has lever-clamp and an adjustable stop (held in position by the two wing-nuts).  It's hard to see the piece under the clamp, but it's there.  Notice I have stop block clamped into the saw slot to prevent overrun and the blade guard behind the sled fence. The blade has not been lowered, yet, since it was raised to set the tilt angle.</p>

"Mortise and tenon joint proportions for 3 wooden beams corner","2181","","<p>I'm designing a cabinet with drawers and I would like to use 60mm (roughly 2 and 3/8"") wide beams for the frame. The frame with one side panel visible looks like that:</p>

<p><img src=""https://cl.ly/3F0A2a1c0L2Z/Image%202016-04-09%20at%2010.21.56%20am.png"" alt=""cabinet frame""></p>

<p>I would like to use mortise and tenon joints as they seem like a simplest solution and are relatively easy to cut. The problem is I'm not sure how to size them. You can find multiple rules for such joints in the internet, one of them being (this is from Christopher Schwarz):</p>

<ul>
<li>tenon's thickness should be one third the thickness of the stock being mortised</li>
<li>tenon's length should be 5 times its thickness</li>
<li>tenon's width should be half the width of the stock you're cutting it in</li>
</ul>

<p>This doesn't make a lot of sense in my situation, because one third of 60mm is 20mm and 5 times that is 100mm, which is longer then the beam width. And even if the beam was wider there won't be as much place, because there will be 2 horizontal beams connected to the vertical beam. I found three simple ways to do the joint in such situation:</p>

<p>1) Making ends of both tenons slanted:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4bjeP.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4bjeP.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>2) Cutting a through dado in one of the tenons:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yRinB.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yRinB.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Would any of these joints be suitable for the situation? What would be best proportions then? I can't find any good source of information on joining beams in such a way. If any other type of joint (dovetail?) is more suitable for such situation, I'd love to hear about it too.</p>
","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think it's important to remember that these, as in <em>all</em> similar general guidelines about how to size a joint, are just rules of thumb and no rule of thumb needs to be followed slavishly. That's what makes it a rule of thumb, and not a Rule :-)</p>

<p>It's also worth pointing out that most traditionally joinery in cabinetry is actually over-engineered, resulting in individual joints that are much stronger than truly needed. This is no bad thing for longevity, but where you're not making something to last for a century or longer you can make certain concessions and not suffer any penalty.</p>

<p>With regard to mortise-and-tenons joints specifically, these are inherently strong, and you can definitely use very different proportions for the tenon and achieve a strong joint — just look at stub tenons for example, the length can be as little as 1/5 that suggested! Just to clarify, this isn't to be <em>preferred</em>, but it does show the kind of thing you can get away with.</p>

<p>Also worth comparing those proportions to dominoes and even biscuits, which are a simulation of M&amp;T joinery without the need to actually cut tenons. These are in the main shorter (sometimes <em>much</em> shorter) and often thinner than a tenon or a pair of tenons would be.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I found three simple ways to do the joint in such situation:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of the three options shown I would go with #1 in the sense of having the mitred ends, from my reading that would be by far the most common solution. However, I wouldn't necessarily use a small, square tenon. It would be better to have the tenon like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2e5Eg.jpg""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2e5Eg.jpg"" alt=""Mitred meeting tenons""></a></p>

<p>[Source: <strong>The Joint Book</strong> by Terrie Noll]</p>

<p>But I think most common traditionally (or at least most commonly recommended in texts) would be to use haunched tenons:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gbJVG.jpg""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gbJVG.jpg"" alt=""Haunched meeting tenons""></a></p>

<p>Obviously these are much more effort to cut and like I refer to above are likely to be an example of over-engineering. I include them here more for completeness rather than as an actual recommendation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If any other type of joint (dovetail?) is more suitable for such situation, I'd love to hear about it too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could in theory at least use a dovetailed housing joint (short dovetailed tenons at the end of each rail, with a matching housing or dado in the corner post). I've seen it done once or twice but I couldn't locate an image. Again this would be more work to create than the simple mitred tenon shown first and probably provides no real benefit at the end of the day.</p>

<p>Very much yes. You're not drilling pilot holes here, you're drilling <em>clearance holes</em> which are completely different. See more in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2708/are-there-specific-types-of-screws-i-should-use-for-woodworking/2714#2714"">this previous Answer</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This applies elsewhere in your proposed build as well, it would actually be much better if the plan didn't call for screws to be driven into the sides of the plywood. </p>

<p>The hold of screws in ply is <em>much</em> better if driven in through the face and not into the edges. The difference is so great that it can be worth the trouble to cut smaller pieces of plywood and then glue them together in a stack to achieve a sufficient thickness. Alternatively you can use the trick posted at the end of the Answer linked to above where you drill a hole and glue in a dowel for the screw to bite into but this may require buying a larger bit (sized to the dowel used) as well as possibly a suitable saw for cutting the dowels flush with the surface. Some sanding will probably also be required to make them completely flush with the face of the plywood.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am trying to minimise screws showing. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the sides you can do what's called a counterbore (see <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3612/what-joining-methods-would-be-best-for-the-legs-and-other-areas-of-a-height-adju/3613#3613"">this previous Answer</a>) and plug those with wood or fill with wood filler to hide the screw heads.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will this setting be strong enough? I am concerned about 2mm acrylic panel wobbling especially.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Four screws holding the acrylic in place is very likely not sufficient to prevent it sagging. I think the ideal for this is for a slightly larger piece to be used where all four edges would be set into a groove or rabbet/rebate, similar to how the bottom of many boxes are done. If you do want to secure it with screws a few more should be spaced around the perimeter.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> for the top screws holding the polycarbonate not to sit proud of the surface the drilled holes need to be countersunk and if you don't have a combination drill/pilot/countersink bit you will need to buy a countersink separately. </p>

<p>Countersinks are not all very well made and many cheaper ones are not very sharp so you might want to practice doing the countersinks on a scrap of the acrylic to ensure a clean and even result (e.g. oval holes are easy to create by accident). In addition to the possibly unevenness a blunter countersink will begin to heat the plastic and it could actually melt at worst. So controlling the speed of the drill is vital. Also be very careful how hard you press during both the drilling and countersinking.</p>

"Is Frank Howarth's homemade table saw splitter safe?","2133","","<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNXuYlwI8N0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Frank Howarth made a splitter</a> by creating a zero clearance insert, and then extending the kerf all the way through the back of the insert, towards the back of the table saw. He then glued thin strips of wood inside the kerf behind the blade.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wzBad.png"" alt=""Custom splitter""></p>

<p>I plan to create a zero clearance insert for my Powermatic 64, and also want to add a splitter. Frank's method would kill two birds with one stone.</p>

<p>Is Frank's design safe?</p>

<p>Note, there is no possibility of attaching a riving knife for my particular saw, which would be better than a statically mounted splitter.</p>
","<p>The main issue with this splitter is like any other splitter - it has a fixed distance from the table. Since the saw blade is raised or lowered depending on what is being cut, the distance between the spiltter and blade will decrease or increase. Since the safest splitter is one that is closest to the blade as possible, when making shallow cuts this splitter will be less effective.</p>

<p>However, if this is used as a zero-clearance-insert with splitter for every common height setting (for example, 3 inserts for 1/4"", 1/2"" and 3/4"" stock), this could provide better safety.</p>

<p>From the video, it doesn't seem like he is chamfering the edge of the splitter that is facing the blade. You should - it will prevent the wood from bumping into the splitter in case the wood gets even a little twisted after the saw blade.</p>

<p>Finally, making the splitter out of wood is probably prone to breaking the splitter. The kerf of the saw blade is narrow (even more so with a thin-kerf blade), and such a thin piece of wood is not strong. A piece of plastic or metal would probably be stronger, or maybe some high quality thin plywood (I'm not sure they even make plywood this thin though).</p>

","<p>Anything tool that rotates is generally something to avoid using gloves with. Tools to definitely avoid glove use for incude:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lathes</li>
<li>Circular saws (including table saws, miter saws, and radial arm saws)</li>
<li>Bandsaws</li>
<li>Routers</li>
<li>Planers</li>

<li>The list goes on...</li>

<p>Gloves can give you a false sense of security. They will do little to protect you from a cut, and pose a huge hazard of getting caught in the tool and pulling your hand in to get mangled.</p>

<p>The only tool off the top of my head that I'd consider using gloves with would be an orbital sander, since it may help with vibration absorption, and the sander doesn't provide a big risk of mangling your hand. If you need a minimal amount of protection from splinters, you could try nitrile or latex gloves, which will cut/break away before pulling in your hand.</p>

<p>In addition to gloves, the following can also be a hazard around power tools:</p>

<li>Rings</li>
<li>Watches</li>
<li>Long hair</li>
<li>Loose clothing</li>
<li>Ties</li>

<p>The best way to protect your hands is to be very deliberate about every movement you make around the saw, and keep your hands away from the blade by using a push stick or push block. If the cuts you are making are simple straight lines, get a miter gauge that slides along the miter slot that is present in most saw tables.</p>

","<p>The easiest way is to use a table saw. </p>

<p>If you don't have a table saw, then yes, a circular saw would work pretty well. If you want a nice straight edge clamp another straight board or other straightedge to the board so that it guides the saw.</p>

<p>To set up, first measure the distance from the edge of the saw's sole plate to the blade and then add the width that you want to remove from the board. Clamp the guide board at that total distance from the edge of the workpiece. For example, if it's 3 1/4"" from the edge of the sole plate to the blade and you want to remove 1/2"", you'd clamp the guide board 3 3/4"" from the edge of the workpiece. Then you 1) put on your safety glasses and 2) run the saw down the board with the sole plate riding along the guide board.</p>

<p>If you have a hand plane and a way to clamp the board on edge, that'll work too. Draw a line 1/2"" from the edge of the board and just plane to the line.</p>

"jointer cutter head : segmented spiral vs traditional knife design","2106","","<p>I'm looking to replace the blades on our Powermatic Model 60 jointer, and was considering carbide blades.In particular I saw <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00M0NSNFE"" rel=""noreferrer"">this cutterhead</a> for the Powermatic Number 53, which is a 6 inch vs. the model 60's 8 inch.</p>

<p>Assuming that I can find a helical cutter head that will work for the Model 60:</p>

<p>How does this type of cutter compare to a traditional knife design? In particular I'm concerned with the quality of the cut: it appears as though it might leave a cut that isn't perfectly flat.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HkOw8.jpg"" alt=""6 inch cutter head""></p>
","<p>The cutterhead you pictured in your question is a Byrd Shelix cutterhead, which produces a shearing helical cut using square, 4-sided carbide inserts. There are also other configurations of segmented cutterheads with carbide inserts which produce cuts of varying quality.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, helical cutterheads--even the widely-acclaimed Byrd Shelix cutterheads--do not produce perfectly smooth cuts. In fact, the surface is ever-so-slightly scalloped, as you will see if you rub chalk on it or apply finish without sanding first. However, it is easy to remove the scallops by sanding, using a card scraper, or with a light pass of hand planing.</p>

<p><strong>Long-knife cutterhead</strong></p>

<p>Typically these are referred to as straight-knife cutterheads, but there are also some machines on the market that have long helical knives which run the entire length of the cutterhead. I would consider those machines more similar to straight-knife cutterheads than segmented helical cutterheads.</p>

<p>Advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Less expensive up-front</li>
<li>On many machines, knives can be resharpened several times before replacement.</li>
<li>On many machines, you can eliminate nick tracks by shifting one or more knives side-to-side so the nicks are staggered.</li>
<li>On machines with disposable knives, it's easy to replace the knives and you don't have to reset the height because the knives are indexed.</li>
<li>Often produce a slightly cleaner cut than segmented cutterheads on straight-grained wood.</li>
<li>Less demanding on motor</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Produces tearout in figured wood</li>
<li>Can be more expensive to maintain long-term.</li>
<li>Knives can be difficult to set properly.</li>
<li>If you trash your knives, you need to buy a whole new set.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Segmented cutterhead</strong></p>

<p>There are numerous configurations of segmented cutterheads, from 2-sided segmented knives to 2- or 4-sided square inserts. In addition to the cutter configuration, there are multiple cutter placement/alignment configurations. Byrd's cutter inserts are skewed to follow the helical alignment, producing a shearing cut; and the edges are slightly rounded to prevent gouging due to the cutting/skew angle. Other cutterhead designs align the cutters in either a helical or V arrangement, but typically the entire edge of each cutter slams into the wood at once (as with a straight-knife design), rather than producing a shearing cut.</p>

<p>Advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Produces less tearout in figured wood</li>
<li>Cutters are easy to rotate or replace</li>
<li>You can usually (always?) rotate the each cutter at least once before needing to replace it</li>
<li>Cutters index directly in place and don't need to be fine-tuned</li>
<li>Inserts are often carbide and last as much as 10x longer than steel inserts</li>
<li>If you trash the cutters (e.g., by hitting a nail), at worst you probably just need to replace the ones that were damaged; you don't need to replace all of them</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Square-insert segmented heads produce a slightly scalloped surface (though they are easy to remove with light sanding, and some configurations are worse than others)</li>
<li>More expensive up front</li>
<li>More demanding on motor</li>
</ul>

<p>Contrary to conventional Internet wisdom, side-by-side comparisons have found helical heads to be more demanding on the motor. In the tests, machine fitted with a helical head drew more amperage than an identical machine fitted with a straight-knife cutterhead. The current explanation for this is that a cutter is always engaged with the material, producing a constant load on the motor.</p>

<p>According to Bob Hunter of WOOD Magazine, upgrading a benchtop planer to a segmented cutterhead is an iffy proposition for two reasons: (1) the motor may not be up to the task, and (2) segmented cutterheads produce better results with a larger cutterhead diameter than what is available in a benchtop machine.</p>

I've been looking on youtube.com at the owl houses and being one of those people who tend to go a little overboard with detail, I see all kinds of things I don't like. I saw one woman build an owl box where she designed the top with vents that would literally direct rainfall down into the box. I also saw lots of other things I didn't like, such as screws in the roof that will allow an entry point for water and many other things.</p>

<p>I'd like to put vents up the side, but I don't want rain running in. To accomplish this, I'd like to make them angle up into the box at a roughly 30-45 degree angle. I'd like to know the best way to do this. My first thought is to take a circular saw and set the angle on its blade. I'm not sure if mine is capable of that or not. I also have access to a table saw. It seems like it'd be simple to set the angle and cut a line, but how do you get the blade into the board? You can easily make and interior cut with a table saw or circular saw by setting it down into the board, but at an angle, it doesn't seem like it'd work the same. Can anyone tell me how to do this?</p>

","<p><strong>About the saw idea you have</strong></p>

<p>Unless you have some sort of safe jig I would recommend against using something like a table saw to push the board onto the blade <em>especially</em> at an angle. I don't personally see a way that it is not dangerous. If the board kicks back you could fall onto the blade. (Sorry if I misinterpreted what you meant/intended. It just seemed like a bad idea)</p>

<p><strong>Have the vent located on the side</strong></p>

<p>If instead of making a contraption, like I will suggest below this, it occurs to me you could just cut the slats in from one side or both. Make as many as needed with the angled cuts on the table saw. Optionally you could glue a small board on the end to seal it. I think the blades are 1/8"" inches so several of those at an angle should provide ample circulation. A just grabbed a junk board and cut into it with my mitre saw. Could easily do this with a table saw and some measuring. The picture on the right shows what it would look like ""assembled"" after it was cut.</p>

<p>If I was experimenting I would cut the hole in the board, with a jigsaw or something similar, where the vent would be and make a separate unit that I would insert into the hole.</p>

<p>To make that insert, use the table saw to make <em>straight</em> small boards that will make up the vent ""slats"". Then a small box the size of the hole that will house these slats. Depending on how big the house is you might be able to skip making a separate box and use the board to continue with the next step.</p>

<p>The box will have dadoes to hold the slats in place. You can use your table saw with a miter gauge, miter sled, or crosscut sled with stop blocks to cut the dadoes in the sides. I'm terrible at describing things. Look at this picture to get an idea. </p>

"How can I create a planked wood table top with a plywood core?","2074","","<p>I was looking at this table made by Harp Design company <a href=""https://www.harpdesignco.com/product/melissa-table/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Melissa Table"">Melissa Table</a></p>

<p>The description describes the top's construction as: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each top is crafted from reclaimed old growth pine which is planed down to approximately 5/8″ thickness. It is then joined together using ship lap joinery on top of a solid plywood core to make the finished top approximately 2″ thick.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was wondering how I could make a table similar. For example, if I used 1x4 pine planks and joined them, how could I properly attach the planked top to a 3/4"" plywood sheet? (I'm thinking about how to allow for wood movement).</p>

<p>And, how could I trim out the edge of the table. It looks like in this table they used veneer or really thin wood to cover the edges of the planks and plywood.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eERcq.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eERcq.jpg"" alt=""Melissa Table""></a></p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I was wondering how I could make a table similar. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can't really, and shouldn't try. Making a table that looks similar is easy enough, but actually laminating solid wood to plywood is inherently a flawed methodology. Even when you do this <em>with veneer</em> it can cause bowing if it's not done correctly, and veneer is extremely thin, so it's easy to imagine the problems that might arise with a much thicker wood bonded to the plywood.</p>

<p>That is not the only issue with this design if we can see the details of the construction correctly from the pictures (the other major one shows up at the edges). As a result I very much doubt examples of the Melissa Table won't see structural problems down the line, it seems a certainty.</p>

<p>Off-topic but I also think the ""reclaimed old-growth pine"" thing either describes just some of the wood, perhaps individual tables in the series, but possibly none of them at all... unless their definition of 'old-growth' is wood from tract houses from the '60s or '70s! Look at the short lengths, the abundance of knots and most importantly, the wide growth rings in the example pics on the site. The lack of narrow growth rings alone is suspicious, but taken all together you can be certain someone is fibbing or at least stretching the truth :-/</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It looks like in this table they used veneer or really thin wood to cover the edges of the planks and plywood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That does look like how they did the edges but even at that it's not sound construction, the short sides are the particular concern.</p>

<p>So how to build a table that does look somewhat like this, but do it stably? The three best ways I can think of are:</p>

<ul>
<li>use solid wood of the full thickness (thicker wood is more costly but in pine this wouldn't be exorbitant);</li>
<li>laminate thinner boards to the final thickness (there shouldn't be issues with movement as each layer will have approximately equal response to changes in moisture level);</li>
<li>use plywood that you veneer with shop-made veneer (and importantly, counter-veneer also), then do the edges just as this table appears to have done it.</li>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>
","<p>Drill 2 holes (brace and bit if you're being serious about ""hand"" tools) with a forstner bit (or hole saw), then connect them with a cut using a coping (or jig) saw. Chisel/file/sand as needed.</p>

<p>To expand a little... in order to help with tearout, drill from both sides by marking centers on each side and drilling halfway through each. Those look like 1"" to 1-1/4"" holes, if you're buying deliberately, but really, any old size should work well enough. (Bonus attribute if you're doing this with a hole saw is that the wooden plug is really easy to remove when there's half of it already sticking out of the hole saw.) Personally, I wouldn't use a spade bit, as they seem to tear a lot, which would require more cleanup.</p>

<p>The very attractive pictures were of fairly thick stock. If your project isn't quite as thick, I'd leave a bit more meat at the edge of the hole.</p>

<p>Everybody has a different preference for setup with the coping saw, but if you haven't tried it already, set it up to cut on the pull stroke. You might find you have better control and less blade deflection.</p>

<p>Cleanup on the inside would be easiest with a round or oval rasp, followed by something a bit finer. (You could also rough it with a sharp chisel or gouge.) After roughing, transition to sandpaper. If you roll the sandpaper into a cigarette sized roll, it'll hold shape fairly well and be able to knock down the edge to perfection.</p>

"Are there any serious and non-obvious disadvantages to thermally modified wood?","2069","","<p>A local wood trader has shown me some thermally modifid ash planks (never seen that before!) with a stunning coloring that almost seduced me to immediately buy a table and two benches worth of it and build some new massive garden furniture.</p>

<p>Now, the wood is <em>thermally modified</em>. Which basically means it went into a kiln at a somewhat higher temperature and underwent a heat-induced chemical reaction. I had never seen such a wood (if you can still call it that) before. It's apparently a rather new thing (less than 20 years old) too.  </p>

<p>From what I could gather from various (partially contradicting) sources, this means:</p>

<ul>
<li>Greatly improved resistance to fungi and parasites, suitable for outdoor</li>
<li>Even woods like beech and oregon pine are resistance class 1-2 after treatment</li>
<li>Best invention since the invention of the wheel</li>
<li>Wood almost doesn't work any more (50-75% reduction in shrinkage/growth, nearly no water uptake)</li>
<li>No treatment needed</li>
<li>Treatment recommended (... OK?)</li>
<li>Varnish needed, oiling before varnish recommended to give the wood back its elasticity (how would that work???)</li>
<li>Insufficient data for close-to-earth placement, might not be good (WTF?)</li>
<li>Darker color (very obvious, and good looking, main reason to buy!)</li>
<li>Harder, but somewhat more brittle</li>
<li>Need to pre-drill big screws (Wow, I wouldn't have guessed that!)</li>
<li>Not recommended to have too sharp edges in the open (Again, wow, what an insight!)</li>
<li>Slightly less stable (slightly? how much?), not suitable for construction (why not, if it's just <em>slightly</em> weaker?)</li>
<li>Glue might take up to 10 times as long to dry (... but, will it <em>hold</em>?)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what does that mean in summary? And does one of you maybe have experience working with that and can confirm or deny any of the above?</p>

<p>For example, when someone tells me ""hard and brittle"", I come to think of mineral substances. As in, giving that ultra-fine dust that causes lung cancer when being worked. Not exactly what I'd like.<br>
When someone tells me ""controlled, partial combustion, chemical change"", I come to think of ""easily flammable"" and ""unknown evaporations"".</p>

<p>Are there some obvious and maybe not-so-obvious reasons why one wouldn't want to use such a kind of wood?</p>
","<p>Lee Valley has begun using what they call ""<a href=""http://www.leevalley.com/US/wood/page.aspx?p=72116&amp;cat=1,41182,72240&amp;ap=1"">torrefied wood</a>"" in their plane totes and knobs, which seems like the same thing as what you're explaining above.  To quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All totes are made using domestic torrefied maple – wood treated with a heating process that changes the structure of the wood at the cellular level, stabilizing it against the swelling and shrinkage caused by humidity changes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See <a href=""http://newbiomass.com/our-products/torrefied-wood/"">this site</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrefaction"">Wikipedia</a> for an explanation of torrefaction.</p>

<p>If I had to guess, heating the wood to a higher temperature than normal might begin crystallizing the sugars leftover in the wood or making them react chemically with the rest of the wood fibers, essentially turning them into something more mineral-like than organic.  I'm imagining something like petrification, but not to such an extreme extent.</p>

<p>This, in turn, would make the wood harder and more brittle since you are changing the fibrous nature of the wood.  I imagine this is why it's recommended against for construction - brittle failure of structural elements is generally to be avoided since it's a sudden failure as opposed to a gradual (i.e., noticeable ahead of time) failure. I speak as a structural engineer here.</p>

<p>As far as your comment about partial combustion being more prone to future flammability, that's not necessarily true.  Historically, wood was sometimes pre-flamed on the outside before use in building.  This resulted in an outer skin that was initially more resistant to fire than raw wood.  Also, since the torrefied wood is made harder and less fibrous, it would naturally be less prone to ignition.  This is why it's easier to light a bundle of fluffy grass (loose, very fibrous) than a log (dense, not so fibrous).</p>

<p>One perhaps non-obvious disadvantage might be that since the wood is denser and having a slightly different chemical composition, it could be more abrasive or just harder on tool edges.  Think of the difference between working pine and working a much harder wood like purpleheart or a siliceous wood like teak.</p>

<p>Within reason I don't believe there is. Many picture frames are made of pine of course so anything like a glazing point or finish nail can be pushed or lightly hammered into the surface without difficulty. But even with oak and beech frames points can usually be pushed in using only the pressure provided by a flathead screwdriver tip. Although a better tool for doing this is a firm-bladed putty knife. </p>

<p>If there is some difficulty they can be squeezed in. There are a variety of commercial tools made to do this but any wide-mouth pliers (e.g. Channellock pliers) can be used for the purpose, with some card or scrap wood on the outside surface to protect the frame from bruising or denting:</p>

"Applying shellac smoothly without a sprayer","2035","","<p>How can I apply a smooth coat of dewaxed shellac without a sprayer?</p>

<p>Whether I use a brush, sponge, or rag, I always end up with tiny raised beads of shellac at the borders of my previous brush stroke. This mostly happens between dips into the can. Trying to fade them down with brush strokes makes it worse.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong and how can I avoid this?</p>

<p>It's difficult to sand when it dries and in all my sanding attempts I still end up reducing the beads to smooth but visible rough lines. I can cover with another coat but then I am back to square one.</p>

<p>It's obvious that it shouldn't be overbrushed, it even says that on the can. It tacks up so quickly that I have problems just keeping it smooth across brush strokes. I have tried thin coats, thick coats, fading the brush strokes, slopping it on and hoping it levels, waiting a bit and trying to buff it, quick second coat while still wet, all with poor results. I even tried just dumping it out of the can and quickly spreading it around (which sort of solved the problem but made some messy new problems...).</p>

<p>I have a good bit of experience with paint and everything in my bag of tricks is failing me.</p>

<p>The effect is much less pronounced for the first coat on a soft unfinished material, because it soaks in quickly, esp. things like poplar and MDF. But for the most part it always happens no matter where the coat is.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>This mostly happens between dips into the can. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's your problem right there. Actually there are three problems here: working directly from the can, the cut and the brush.</p>

<p>Ideally you don't apply any finish by dipping the applicator into the original container. Yes it is extremely commonly done, but it's still bad practice. This is just about OK for waterbased paints, just about, I wouldn't recommend it literally for <em>anything</em> else. It's an especially poor idea for any fast-drying finish, particularly those with a fast-evaporating solvent like shellac has — at the end of a long working session what is in the can is not the same as when you started, it is now more concentrated.</p>

<p>Secondly, just because shellac comes in a can readymade doesn't mean that's the ideal dilution to apply (same thing with varnish, which is regularly diluted to make it more user-friendly). In fact pre-mixed shellac can be quite a strong 'cut', the traditional term for the dilution rates of shellac, and it can benefit greatly in being diluted to a less-concentrated version for application, a 'lighter cut'. I don't know how universal this is but some common tinned shellacs are sold as a 3lb cut (very strong), and it's frequently preferred to apply it as a 1lb cut, requiring that you thin the commercial product quite significantly which obviously can't or shouldn't be done in the original container.</p>

<p>Thirdly, shellac can be applied by brush and for certain jobs this is the right way to apply it. But it's not the ideal application tool for shellac when tackling large, flat surfaces. Shellac is the classic finish for being applied by a traditional method, commonly known today as French polishing. Now this is one of those OCD/I-have-way-too-much-time-on-my-hands techniques, but it was developed to give stellar results and it still can. It's just loads of work. Doing this full-on is not something for the faint at heart, a proper French polishing job requires hours of effort over at least a few days; the results are considered worth it by some, but to be clear I am not recommending it because shellac is no longer the only way to get that sort of look. Which leads me to...</p>

<p><strong>Why use shellac in the first place?</strong></p>

<p>In a way shellac is now obsolete. What it was relied upon for historically is no longer the case — it was the best finish available for fine furniture then, that's no longer true. If the finishers of the early 19th century had had access to sprayguns and lacquer that's what they would have used and <em>that</em> is what would now be considered ""the most beautiful finish in the world"" by traditionalists and connoisseurs, not shellac.</p>

<p>I'm not anti-shellac, I like it myself and use it regularly where I value its fast drying time. But it can be a troublesome finish to work with (other readers see <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2629/applying-shellac-in-high-humidity/"">this previous Question</a> on issues related to shellac and humidity), it is tricky to apply to a high standard on larger pieces, but perhaps most importantly it provides relatively poor protection to furniture: </p>

<ul>
<li>it is hard, but a little <em>too</em> hard (it is brittle);</li>
<li>it is very prone to damage from water (you get clouding, and note it can be almost instantaneous);</li>
<li>and of course any alcoholic beverage will soften or dissolve the finish depending on the strength of the drink, leaving visible ripples or raised rings in the finish once it dries. </li>
</ul>

<p>None of those are issues with even an inexpensive varnish as available in any hardware store! These are scratch-resistant but not brittle, almost totally waterproof and alcohol doesn't bother them. And varnish is far easier to apply to a high standard, in large part because of the relatively slow drying time.</p>

<p>So, my advice would be to use shellac for jobs where it is a useful <em>part</em> of a finishing regimen (e.g. acting as an intermediate coat between dissimilar finishes, as sanding sealer), or when used alone primarily for smaller jobs where its very fast drying time isn't so hard to deal with. This is one reason shellac is still an excellent choice of finish for woodturners and it's why I use it as a final finish on tool handles where I want a glossy finish, such as the handles on these files I restored:</p>

<p>I know from reading around that size wise this would roughly equate to the UK's 44 x 96 and 25 x 44 but it is my belief that in the US if someone refers to 'Using a bit of 2 x 4' then more is understood than just the size. It is also known what the type of wood it is, the cut, whether it is sawn / planned and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Does the UK have a piece of wood that is universally commonly used for hobby / domestic projects that it is simple referred to by a common name and is this typically a suitable substitute for the US 2 x 4?

<p>One weird thing about dimensional lumber is that the size (ex. 2x4) is <em>nominal</em>, meaning that it's only the approximate size.  For example, a 2x4 is actually 1.5"" x 3.5"" (38mm x 89mm) in cross-section.  There are various rules depending on the size of the member, so check out Table 1B of the <a href=""http://www.awc.org/pdf/codes-standards/publications/nds/AWC-NDS2015-Supplement-ViewOnly-1411.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">NDS Supplement</a> for Standard Dressed Size (of North American dimensional lumber, at least).</p>

However, when you're dealing with something small that has either just started, or clearly will - smoldering in a pile of scrap or sawdust or instance - it would be nice to have an extinguisher to at least <em>try</em> and put it out before things get out of control, rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak. I have kids - I'll err on the side of getting to build a new shop rather than using up my life insurance to save a PC and a bunch of saws.</p>
","<p>There are certainly oils and other flammable liquids, plus possible electrical malfunction, so I would indeed suggest an ABC, preferably a larger one. Remember that you always aim an extinguisher at the <em>base</em> of a fire, not at the flames.</p>

<p>Things are replaceable. You aren't. In case of fire, save people first.</p>

<p>Also, if you are asking this question: Do you have a first aid kit in the shop, openable with one hand, preferably where you can reach it even if you can't stand up? Ditto for phone? Are you keeping volatiles tightly sealed and preferably in a metal cabinet where a fire would have some chance of smothering itself? Are you keeping the workshop clear of sawdust, tripping hazards, and the like? Do you have an air filter and dust collection if you are producing sawdust, ventilation if you are producing fumes?

<li>Make a on a test piece. Label this piece so that you'll remember that it's not scrap. Make sure that you mark the side of the piece that was against the router's base plate.</li>
<li>Switch to the other cutter, using the first test piece to eyeball the height.</li>
<li>Make a cut on another test piece.</li>
<li>Measure the error using a dial indicator or a set of digital/dial/vernier calipers, i.e. anything that'll let you measure small distances accurately.</li>
<li>Adjust the bit height according to the error.</li>

<p>Now you've got two test pieces that you can use as gauges in the future. For either cutter, you can use the corresponding test piece to set the height. Install the cutter and, with the test piece on the base plate, adjust the height until you can turn the cutter by hand through the test piece with as little resistance as possible. Lock the router height and proceed.</p>

<p>It might help to point out that most routers have some means of measuring changes in height. A Porter Cable 690, for example, has a collar with a series of tick marks that correspond to 1/128"". If your router doesn't have something like that, you can also use a tool like a dial indicator to measure changes.

"Help needed to decide between a miter saw or sliding miter saw","1934","","<p>I occasionally do some wood project for fun.
I already have a 10” table saw and I have a limited budget to buy a 10” miter saw. </p>

<p>My budget allows me to either buy a Dewalt DW713 or a lower brand sliding miter saw with a laser for the same price.</p>

<p>I personally like the Dewalt DW713. However, I wonder how important the sliding feature is? I don’t want to regret not having the sliding feature in future.</p>

<p><strong>Update and Final Thought</strong></p>

<p>I thank you, everyone, for sharing your though here. While I got my answer from this post, I think it highly depends on the usage scenario, preferences, and brands. Therefore I don't think there is only one answer here.</p>
","<p>Rather than a higher quality miter saw I purchased a low end sliding miter saw years ago and have not regretted the choice.</p>

<p>I did try out several sliding miter saws before making my choice, however, as I found that very low end saws were extraordinarily imprecise.  The import shop, for instance, had something that cost half as much, but when manipulating it in the store it was obvious that it moved out of the cut plane easily when pulling it forward.</p>

<p>The brand name sliding saws had a much more solid feel, but in the store with the brand name saws I found a lower cost off brand name saw that felt good, and had the features I wanted.</p>

<p>As others have pointed out, though, a sliding saw is much larger and heavier, and honestly it fits in a little bit of a niche if you only plan on buying one miter saw:</p>

<ul>
<li>A moderate amount of repeated miter cuts on wide material</li>
<li>Want to move it occasionally, but not frequently</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have few cuts to make with wider material, get a regular miter saw and use a circular saw or hand saw for the rare cut that is wider.  If you never plan to move it, you might want to consider a 12 inch non-sliding machine, but if you're always moving it, you should probably go with a miter saw, and consider a track saw for the longer cuts. If you need precision then this is the wrong area to save money - most of these saws are designed for construction work and 1/32"" or 1/16"" precision is just fine for the intended use.</p>

<p>If you do get a sliding miter saw, make sure that the sliding and miter action feel good and solid before you buy one, it should be pretty obvious if it's flimsy.</p>

"What are the different grain directions, and how do they affect joint strength?","1929","","<p>What are the differences between edge grain, face grain, and long grain (and why not throw end grain in there while we're at it)?</p>

<p>And which of these grain directions results in the strongest glue joints?</p>
","<p>Edge and face gain are both <em>longitudinal grain</em>, where grain runs along the surface. Long grain = longitudinal grain, just less of a mouthful, much easier to type quickly too!</p>

<p>The structure of wood, its grain, can be visualised as being like a bundle of straws tightly packed and bonded together. In longitudinal grain we're seeing the side of the straws. </p>

<p>End grain is anywhere where the cut exposes the ends of the straws. So the two ends of nearly every board has exposed end grain. Many diagonal cuts in wood also expose end grain, but the shallower the angle of the cut the more it involves longitudinal grain (this is why very shallow angles are chosen for scarf joints, to maximise glue surface area as well as increase the innate strength of the glue joint).</p>

<p>There are in essence three glueing situations in woodworking:</p>

<ul>
<li>long grain bonded to long grain</li>
<li>end grain bonded to end grain (as in a classic mitre joint)</li>
<li>long grain bonded to end grain</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Long grain | long grain</strong><br>
All long-grain to long-grain joints (regardless if face to face or edge to edge, or a combination of the two as in some 90° joints) should be the strongest possible glue joint, if done well exceeding the strength of the wood. So a fairly well-worn adage of woodworking ""creates joints stronger than the wood itself"" can literally be true<sup>[1]</sup>. </p>

<p>The glue industry's own testing, independent lab tests and any well-run test done in the workshop will invariable show this, where if a piece is broken apart you can expect that splits will largely happen in the wood and will essentially ignore the joint lines<sup>[2]</sup>. </p>

<p><strong>End grain | end grain</strong><br>
End-grain to end-grain joints are the weakest glue joint. They can be made much more secure by very good surface preparation and by <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/840/gluing-end-grain/851#851"">sizing</a> the end grain ahead of final assembly, but in general for any joint requiring good strength simply glueing together end grain won't be strong enough<sup>[3]</sup>.</p>

<p>Visualising the grain in wood as being like straws and end grain as being like the ends of these straws helps explain why it bonds poorly normally, because those open ends of the straws are very absorbent and capillary action transports glue away from the surface, leaving too little behind to form a good bond.</p>

<p>What sizing does is seal or partially seal the straws, preventing over-absorption of the glue.</p>

<p><strong>Long grain | end grain</strong><br>
Long-grain to end-grain joints are naturally somewhere in between the above two. They were/are considered fairly weak, and woodworking guides will nearly often say that they need to be reinforced in some way — by nails, screws or dowels. </p>

<p>Without reinforcement they can be too weak to rely on <em>in isolation</em>, but, if done properly (which would involve sizing the end grain prior to final glue-up) they can actually be strong enough in some situations without any mechanical reinforcement, e.g. because other joints in the piece will help hold things in place and everything mutually supports itself. </p>

<p>[1] This is sometimes erroneously expressed as ""glue is stronger than the wood itself"" which is not strictly accurate. In general it is only <em>the glued joint</em> that is stronger, NOT the glue, and it's important to bear this in mind so that you don't make the mistake of expecting glue to support gaps ""because it's strong"" (usually it's not). Epoxy if one of the few glues commonly used by leisure woodworkers where you can rely on it to fill gaps strongly.</p>

<p>[2] Because this is so universally shown to be true it can be used as an acid test of glueing procedures by any woodworker. If in their testing the glue joints fails they can be confident that either they've done something wrong, or the glue is at fault. Possible causes of a weaker long-grain to long-grain joint include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The wood not being smooth enough — rougher surfaces don't normally bond well with most glues used in woodworking, a notable exception being epoxy. As a rule you want <em>very</em> smooth surfaces on your wood for the best glue joint, smooth <em>but not burnished</em>.</li>
<li>The joint faces are not flat enough, e.g. the angle is off so the edges don't make good contact along their entire length.</li>
<li>Insufficient clamp pressure. With most wood glues you want to clamp hard enough that all excess glue is squeezed from the joint, which in practice means you want to clamp <em>very firmly</em>.</li>
<li>Glue is too thin.</li>
<li>Glue is too thick (too dry).</li>
<li>Glue has has 'gone off' in some way, by being frozen or because it's aged.</li>
<li>Not enough glue was applied (an excess of glue should <em>always</em> be applied for maximum bond strength). </li>
<li>Another cause is just a failing of procedure, so that even with perfectly jointed wood and new glue you don't get a good joint. The classic reason for this is where glue was applied but then the joint wasn't brought together in time, so the glue dried out too much to form an adequate bond (either to the other piece of wood or to the glue already applied to the other piece of wood).</li>
</ul>

<p>[3] This is not to say that end-grain to end-grain joints are never strong enough. The classic small box has mitre joints on all four corners and because of the small size and the lack of stress on the structure of the piece these joints can be perfectly acceptable and are in fact widely used. But once a box needs to hold any major weight or needs to be robust enough to withstand lots of movement or rough handling then either the mitres need to be reinforced (e.g. with a spline) other joints should be used instead (e.g. finger joints/comb joints, box joints or dovetails).</p>

"Is there any such thing as sanding something *too* fine for finishing?","1916","","<p>I know you can get sandpaper in super-high grits, like 2000 grit and higher. I guess there's a point of diminishing returns for sanding wood projects, but is it possible to use too <em>high</em> a grit prior to applying the first coat of finish? If so, what problems can it cause, and do these problems apply to all types of finish and wood or just certain types or categories?</p>
","<p>That's a great question. Typically, the purpose of the <em>first</em> round of sanding is to hide surface blemishes in the wood (e.g., machine marks, dents, scratches). The purpose of the subsequent rounds of sanding is to hide the scratch marks from the first round. Usually, you only need to go to about 180 before the scratch marks become invisible. </p>

<p>As you mention, there's diminishing returns, so there's no need to sand even higher. However, if you <em>love</em> sanding, I only see one problem: if you're staining, the stain will not take as well for wood that has been sanded with much higher grits. See the image below (from <a href=""http://www.popularwoodworking.com/techniques/rules_for_sanding_wood"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Popular Woodworking</a>).

","<blockquote>
  <p>What sander should I use for something like this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need tools that can sand contoured objects. There are a number of options, and given the varied nature of your work you'll probably use more than one tool. Here are some choices:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>flap wheel:</strong> Basically <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B003N9BTQY"">a wheel with pieces of heavy duty sandpaper</a> or abrasive cloth inserted around the circumference parallel to the shaft. They come in different sizes, but you'll usually chuck one in a drill press, lathe, or handheld drill. They range in aggressiveness depending on the grit, stiffness of the flaps, and number of flaps.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>sanding star:</strong> Same idea as a flap sander minus the wheel and with the sandpaper turned perpendicular to the shaft. A star is more appropriate for broad, gently contoured surfaces.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>sanding mop:</strong> A <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00SNMM6A4"">sanding mop</a> has about a zillion abrasive fingers. It's constructed like a very thick star that you use from the side, like a flap wheel. What you end up with is a softer version of the flap sander that's far better at conforming to contours. It'll smooth the entire surface and round off sharp edges without being too aggressive. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViFzlabVinM"">Here's an interesting video</a> demonstrating construction and use of a shop-made mop.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>sanding brush:</strong> This is again similar to a flap wheel with narrow finger-like flaps, but in this case the fingers are backed up with brush bristles that let them push a little harder. <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0000DD2WL"">Here's one from Grizzly,</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKt5KFHKPCQ"">here's a video showing one in use.</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>pneumatic drum:</strong> Similar to any other drum sander, but the drum is inflated with air. You can vary the pressure to change the amount of give in the drum to make it more or less friendly to contours. <a href=""http://www.leevalley.com/us/wood/page.aspx?cat=1,42500&amp;p=45190"">Here's one from Lee Valley.</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>buffing wheel:</strong> The piece in your photo shows a pretty glossy surface, so you might want to do some buffing after you apply a finish. There are lots of <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00LYVFA1S"">buffing wheels</a>, mops, and other polishing tools available for use with a lathe or bench grinder, and many will work well for contoured work.</p></li>

","<p>Assuming you are talking about stain only (no integral top coat of varnish or similar), there is no reason an interior stain won't work in your garage, nor is there any reason an exterior-grade stain is unacceptable.</p>

<p>As far as I know, exterior-grade stains contain extra UV and weather resistance, with a corresponding increase in price. You have no concerns from that front in a garage, hence indoor stain is fine. Exterior stain is fine as well, just maybe a little overkill.</p>

<p>@Graphus brings up a good point about foot traffic, which should be kept in mind for your stairs.  Per <a href=""http://www.curtislumber.com/choosing-stain.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">this website</a>, deck stains have scuff resistant compounds for extra resistance to foot traffic, which may be beneficial for your staircase.</p>

<p>For sealer/finish, it depends on what in particular you're talking about.  For the stairs, you'll probably want some sort of deck sealer similar to <a href=""http://www.thompsonswaterseal.com/waterproofing-products/waterproofing-stains/waterproofing-wood-protector-clear"" rel=""nofollow"">Thompson's Water Seal</a> or any of its <a href=""http://www.thompsonswaterseal.com/waterproofing-products/waterproofing-stains/waterproofing-stain-transparent"" rel=""nofollow"">tinted varieties</a> for some additional color.  I wouldn't recommend the use of a finish like a varnish on the stairs due to the expected wear.</p>

<p>For the shelves, you can go with a traditional stain and finish routine.

I feel like they obscure the grain of the wood too much (granted, these are pine shelves in a garage, so you might not care a lot).  So, now you're looking at staining the wood first, letting it dry/cure, then applying a varnish of some sort on top.  For ease, I would use an oil-based stain, if you desire to stain the shelves.  If you allow the stain to properly dry/cure, you can use either an oil- or water-based polyurethane varnish, as discussed in this <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2068/can-i-apply-water-based-polyurethane-over-an-oil-based-stain/2069#2069"">Question</a>.

","<blockquote>
  <p>I understand it's a matter of taste vs effort</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually not as much as people tend to believe. </p>

<p>Sanding to 320 grit may itself be too high, and above 400 you can definitely run into problems. Some woods <em>burnish</em> when rubbed with higher-grit papers and this can prevent the proper penetration of finish, which helps ensures a more even colour and the formation of a proper bond between it and the wood. Burnished wood can resist finish, even to the point that it will bead on the surface sometimes and to fix this you need to re-sand at a coarser grit to 'open' the surface of the wood again.</p>

<p>What determines the grit you <em>need</em> to sand to is not so much personal preference but rather whether you are finishing the wood and with what. </p>

<p>Oiled finishes require a more meticulous approach to final smoothing because they don't build a film and after oiling minor surface imperfections are magnified, not hidden.</p>

<p>With a film-building finish (shellac, varnish, lacquer) you get a filling-in of minor surface imperfections, including sanding scratches. This is why you can get away with sanding up to a coarser grit and still achieve a very smooth final surface. </p>

<p>Using a film finish, depending on the species, even 150 can be high enough. But the normal range to finish sand is between 180 and 240. </p>

<p>If you do not intend to apply a finish — which can be used for dense hardwoods, particularly tropical species with a naturally high resin content — then you can sand to very high grits indeed because you're actually polishing the wood itself. Even beyond the 600 you mention, I've seen the results of sanding past P1600 and you do get increasing shine, up to a limit dependent upon the density and resin content of the wood.</p>

Here's a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5I2Yph57FI"" rel=""nofollow"">video</a> of it in action.</p>

<p>And of course as BrownRedHawk pointed out, turning a bool green(ish) it will warp and be very asymmetrical.  The biggest trick here to keep it from cracking is to make sure that the wood is a very even thickness all around (and still fairly thin), that way it dries at about the same rate and less likely to crack.</p>

"How to scorch to darken a part of a piece of wood and not the other?","1837","","<p>I intend draw a dark line 50mm / 2"" large using a blowtorch on a piece of pine wood, but how to have a nice &amp; clean line border ?</p>

<p>I thought of using sacrificial wood pieces or aluminium sheets as flame barrier but honestly I've no idea where to start.</p>

<p>I don't need the line to be black but just darker.</p>

<p>I've seen a ""hot sand"" trick but it's effective for edges only.</p>

<p>I'm targeting a rustic style, but I've no metal bars big enough to heat.</p>
","<p><a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/959/281"">bowlturner's answer</a> is correct, and will probably give you the results you are looking for. But it inspired me to experiment, mostly to see how sharp an edge I could get.</p>

<h3>Hardwood Guide</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jwHNl.jpg"" alt=""wood burning with hardwood guide""></p>

<p>As you can see, just setting down a piece of hardwood makes an obvious, if not sharp, line. The main problem is getting into the corner. I tried to only scorch the pine, so I couldn't wait for the flame to burn the inside edge.</p>

<h3>Metal Guide</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0lslu.jpg"" alt=""wood burning with metal guide""></p>

<p>This time I slowed down and concentrated on getting the flame into the corner. I also used a steel guide, but I didn't see a difference from the hardwood guide.</p>

<p>As you can see, this one is quite well done (burnt), but it does have a sharper edge.</p>

<h3>Masking Tape</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gYbXA.jpg"" alt=""wood burning with masking tape guide""></p>

<p>Not great, but not as bad as I thought. The heat melts off the adhesive and it's easy to burn through the tape a little bit, but it made an okay line. I cleaned off the adhesive with mineral spirits.</p>

<h3>Routed Recess</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/G2KQs.jpg"" alt=""wood burning with routed recess""></p>

<p>I also tried routing out a shallow area to receive the burning, with the intention of planing off the high spot. This didn't work though, because it creates another inside edge that the flame can't reach. But if you could somehow get the burned part right up next to a freshly-planed edge, I'm confident that this would give you the cleanest, sharpest edge possible.</p>

"What's a bench hook?","1831","","<p>Comments in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1315/what-is-a-shooting-board"">What is a shooting board?</a> have taken me further down the rabbit hole. </p>

<p>What is a bench hook and how is it used?</p>
","<p>A bench hook is quite simply the most useful simple woodworking jig/appliance that the handtool user can make. As Chris Schwarz says about them, <em>""After working with one for a couple weeks, you will wonder how you ever got by without it.""</em></p>

<p>In addition to its main purpose as a sawing aid a bench hook can function as a basic shooting board, the large surface can be used for chopping with a chisel (why they're sometimes also called chopping hooks) and the bar can also be used as a backstop for planing, so in essence larger bench hooks can convert any suitable flat surface into a temporary woodworking area, with sawing, planing and chopping functionality. Which is a neat trick for just three pieces of wood glued together. </p>

<p>There are many minor variations in design for bench hooks as you'd expect for an accessory like this which is so commonly handmade by the woodworker. The one in the photo in the response by WhatEvil is actually more suited to a left-hander, a right-hander's would more commonly have the stop offset to the left like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QyChi.jpg"" alt=""Chris Schwarz bench hook""></p>

<p>Some have a stop that spans the whole width, which can be low-profile to allow planing of thinner stock:</p>

<p>And with a minor modification a bench hook can function as a mitre block as well:</p>

"How do experts make dovetails by hand that fit so well?","1811","","<p>I keep coming across various YouTube videos of experts making dovetail joinery by hand, and they get tolerances of the 1/16"" of an inch or less.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is how they get such accuracy in the templates of each piece of wood. After cutting the dovetails they fit together perfectly.</p>

<p>I have a dovetail jig for my router and my machined results don't fit as nicely as the experts done by hand.</p>

<p>My question isn't how to make dovetails, but how do you ensure the best fit when making them by hand?</p>
","<p>I'd say that 1/16'' tolerance, or 1.5mm respectively, is actually pretty bad. You should rather aim for 0.1mm tolerance, not 1.5mm. The final piece should have no visible gaps.</p>

<h2>How to do that?</h2>

<p>First of all, of course diligence, proper tools, proper technique, and practice (well, duh). But second, there's a few tricks you can apply, too.</p>

<p>As a beginner, use softwood (pine, for example). Do not make your life harder than it needs to be while you are still learning. Softwood is not only <em>a lot</em> easier to work with and more tool-edge-friendly, it is also <em>a lot</em> more forgiving to little mistakes that you may make, and will make.<br>
When in doubt, you can always make a softwood tail slightly rather too large than too small, and fit it in with a little <em>persuasive force</em> (hammer). That's not the correct way of doing it, but up to a surprisingly large limit, it will work. You can't really do that with hardwood.<br>
If you have visible gaps, even rather huge ones, you can almost always fix the problem with a clamp. You can also do that with hardwood, but the tolerances are much, much smaller.</p>

<h2>The proper tools</h2>

<p>You need a sharp pencil and a mortise with a precise, sharp edge in the right size.<br>
Which kind of saw to use is somewhat of a matter of taste, but I daresay Japanese saws are superior to western ones. They are usually much, much thinner (like 0.5mm) and have finer teeth, and they cut on pull, which lets you control the saw a lot better. There's nothing like a Dozuki for cutting dovetails.</p>

<p>A jig will help you big time. Commercial jigs <a href=""http://www.leevalley.com/us/wood/page.aspx?p=41718&amp;cat=1,42884"" rel=""nofollow"">like this one</a> which not only guide the saw but also hold it with a magnet give you perfect precision even on your first ever dovetail. However, they make cutting dovetails almost too easy, and they do cost a bit of money. But even a simple small block of hardwood somehow clamped onto the work piece will help big deal doing a perfect perpendicular cut along a defined line.</p>

<h2>The proper technique</h2>

<p>First, you want to do one half of the joint, do not touch the other piece of wood yet. It is simply not possible to produce something that will fit if you mark the second piece before having finished the first. Decide whether you want to do tails or pins first- there is no right or wrong. Half of the woodworkers will tell you to do pins first, the other half will tell you to do the tails first. Do whichever you feel most comfortable with.</p>

<p>Use a marking gauge to mark the length of your pins/tails so you have the same length everywhere. Copy the required thickness from the board, do not measure. Some gauges have a micrometer screw that lets you adjust the setting. Those are normally not very useful, but here they can be really handy: You can optionally make the tails/pins a tiny bit longer if you want by giving the micrometer screw one or two turns.<br>
The rationale behind that is that if your tails/pins are a tiny amount too short, the joint doesn't fit properly, it looks really bad. Which sucks because there is nothing you can do about it except spend 4 hours on the sander thinning the whole board down. On the other hand, if they are a tiny amount too long, it takes two strokes with the smoothing plane, or 15 seconds with sand paper, and it looks absolutely perfect. Preferably, of course, tails/pins should be exactly as long as they should be, but very slightly too long is harmless whereas slightly too short is a disaster.</p>

<p>Mark the desired shape of your tails/pins. You are in principle free to choose any angle, and any regular or irregular layout or proportions that you want, there are very few ""rules"" that are the kind you should follow. There are entire religions about which is the correct formula for the width of tails, but I've done them in many variations including irregular widths, and you can't really tell that one or the other is truly ""wrong"".<br>
As a rule of thumb, try to get a somewhat even distribution for the beginning and do the outermost pins half-width (looks pleasing), and go for somewhat steeper (1:6 or even 1:4) angles if you use soft wood or very thin boards, and rather not-so-steep angles on hardwood. You can use a selfmade jig or a commercial one to get the correct angle, or simply measure. All that is just a rule of thumb, you can in principle do whatever you want.<br>
Although at this point, you do not yet need to be super precise on marking, try to be precise anyway, use a sharp pencil or a kogatana. It never hurts to work with diligence, and you should get the habit of doing precise marks, so do it anyway.</p>

<p>All accessible lines (that is, any lines that have contact with an outer surface) are cut with the saw, then the rest is worked with the chisel. First mark the line with one exact hit, cutting fibers. Then remove the cut-off chip. Begin exactly orthogonal to the board by using a small piece of wood as a guide. After the first millimeter, you are allowed -- and encouraged -- to ""cut behind"" a little (I am not sure about the correct term to use in English, the German word is ""hinterstechen""). Doing so will make it a great deal easier fitting pieces together later while preserving a perfect visible edge on the outside.</p>

<p><strong>TODO: add a sketch (coming on weekend)</strong></p>

<p>Once you have finished one side, hold it against the other side, and carefully, diligently, mark its contour onto the other piece with your sharp pencil. Here, it really counts, so take your time, be precise.</p>

<p>Now do the second piece, but note that the pencil marks you made by drawing around the first piece are of course outside the form of the first piece. Which means that whatever cuts you make, the pencil mark <strong>must still be visible</strong> afterwards. If the marks are no longer visible afterwards, you will have a visible gap.<br>
When in doubt, stay rather on the safe side. It's better to have the mark visible and the tiniest amount of overshoot than to be too small. With a broad and well-sharpened chisel in your hand, you can carve off very, very minute sheets (less a tenth of a millimeter) if need be. You can always take away, but it's hard to add material that you've cut off. It's possible, only just not nearly as easy.</p>

<p>When trying to fit the pieces together and they don't really like fitting, you will need to remove something somewhere. But where?</p>

<p>Apply a little more force, and then pull the pieces apart. Now look at the little surfaces. They will all be rather uniform in look and texture, except one or two of them which will have a mirror-smooth surface. This is where you tried to force the non-fitting pieces together and they rubbed against each other. Take off a minute slice of wood with a broad, sharp chisel from these locations. Try again, repeat. You won't need to try more often than a couple of times.</p>

<h2>The tricks</h2>

<h3>The just-over-half trick</h3>

<p>When chiselling out, do not start at the beginning of the to-be-removed piece. Instead, start somewhere in the middle, and go down in an angle. Once you are certain that you are done just over half, stop working. Do the remaining pieces on the same side, and always stop once you are just over half done.<br>
Now turn the board around and start from the other side. This guarantees that both sides have a clean, perfect edge, and no visible tearout is possible, no matter what. If you are a bit in a hurry, you can give it a hard hit with the chisel once you're 1/3 done from the second side, that will do away with the to-be-removed piece.</p>

<p><strong>TODO: also add a sketch here</strong></p>

<h3>The clamp trick</h3>

<p>Clamps can be used not only to press the joint together in the direction of the two boards. A third clamp can be used to slightly compress the dovetails. It will only be maybe half a millimeter over the whole board, but that is enough to hide the visible gaps of a normal manufacturing precision and turn a ""meh"" joint into a ""woah"" joint. The glue will hold everything in shape once it is cured.</p>

<h3>The water trick</h3>

<p>This is a trick that a master carpenter told me (I haven't tried it myself, but once you think about it, it's so darn obvious that it simply <em>must work</em>). Wood expands when exposed to moisture. So, if you have visible gaps, give it a mild stroke or two with the sponge, and wait a few minutes.<br>
Obviously, having a glue that isn't too sensitive to water (or one that even prefers the presence of water, like PU glue) is necessary here.</p>

<h3>The dirty trick</h3>

<p>If, after all, you still have ""meh"" quality joint with visible gaps, fill the gaps with a mixture of sawdust and glue. The sawdust will give the glue a convincing color, which will make the gap look a lot less prominent.<br>
For that reason, it's always a good idea to preserve some of the sawdust or wood shavings.</p>

"Front and Leg vise","1794","","<p>It will probably have to wait until next summer but I am going to build my first woodworking bench soon.</p>

<p>I want to have at least one vise on it. I was thinking the front or leg vise. They both clamp in the same location. </p>

<p>Leg vise can be built from solely wood components and has a deep throat. It also is the largest of all bench vises from what I can tell. A ""con"" could be that a traditional leg vise relies on a parallel bar at the foot.

<p>Front vise has a smaller throat and typically has metal for the track. The overall design itself is smaller as well. </p>

<p>I am hoping to use this to help with sawing dovetails. I understand that it is not the only way but I feel more comfortable with the boards in a vertical position. I would like this fact not to distract from the actual question of vise choice. Merely an attempt at providing context to the question.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What criteria might make me choose one over the other? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'll try to expand upon some more considerations below.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Front (Face) Vise</strong></p>

<p>Face vises are generally like the wooden one shown above.  They have a center screw for tightening/loosening the vise with a set of parallel guide bars to help keep the vise from racking.</p>

<p>As you stated, they generally have a shallow throat (the distance between the top of the screw and the top of the vise).  This means they may not be able to hold some items as securely as other vises since there is less clamping surface.</p>

<p>When clamping with a face vise, if you clamp the piece in one end of the vise, you will want to clamp a <a href=""http://www.leevalley.com/us/wood/page.aspx?p=69605&amp;cat=1,41659"" rel=""noreferrer"">rack stop</a> or another similarly-sized piece of wood in the opposite end to keep the vise face from racking.</p>

<p>Since a face vise has a small footprint, it may be possible to slip a drawer carcase over the vise to fix it in the jaws.  I can't find a picture of this online, but I've done it before.  This is not possible with a leg vise because of the leg vise's length.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Leg Vise</strong></p>

<p>Leg vises act like a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever#Classes_of_levers"" rel=""noreferrer"">Class 3 lever</a> (mechanical advantage always less that 1.0).  Consider the image below (from <a href=""https://lakeerietoolworks.wordpress.com/tag/wooden-leg-vise/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lake Erie Toolworks</a>).  This has a similar criss-cross bracing to the Benchcrafted example you provided.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WXcs0.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WXcs0.jpg"" alt=""Lake Eire leg vise""></a></p>

<p>Just so you're aware, the criss-cross (aka St. Peter's Cross) <a href=""http://www.popularwoodworking.com/woodworking-blogs/chris-schwarz-blog/st-peter%E2%80%99s-cross-and-the-ultimate-leg-vise"" rel=""noreferrer"">is nothing new for leg vises</a>.  It's just another way that craftsmen have historically found to cope with the balance of forces at play with this vise.</p>

<p>Compared to the face vise, the leg vise has a deeper throat but it has a narrower face.  Thus, it can clamp things more deeply in the vise and is able to apply a higher force to a smaller area.  Also, because the face is much narrower, leg vises usually don't have issues with racking like face vises do.</p>

<p>However, since leg vises have a narrow clamping width, they usually need the help of a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QydDquSlwyI"" rel=""noreferrer"">deadman</a> to hold longer stock.  You'll find these on just about every Roubo-style workbench.</p>

<p>I know your question specifically asked about leg and front vises, but you mention doing dovetails as one impetus for choosing a vise.

"Are there alternative tools to a straight ironing rasp (or why are they so hard to find)?","1792","","<p>I'm looking for a tool to smooth/flatten down a surface in a rectangular channel in the center of a piece of wood (I constructed the piece by gluing two halves together, but stupidly didn't clean the channel halves well prior to gluing).  The channel measures ~1"" wide x 2"" long x 8"" deep (you can think of it as an 8"" deep mortise).  It's roughly square, but needs a lot of help.  Only one surface actually needs to be flat/smooth.</p>

<p>The best tool that comes to mind for the job is a file or rasp, but I need the handle offset so that it can actually get in the channel (the piece's construction is such that without an offset handle I wouldn't be able to put the face of the tool against the surface of the wood).

<h1>Paring Chisel</h1>

<p>My first thought for this was a paring chisel. Especially if one of the surfaces needs to be flat and smooth. Paring chisels are designed for clean <em>long</em> cuts and are not meant to be struck. Instead you could stand over the channel an push the chisel down with your body weight. The tools length would help keep the channel square. </p>

<p>If your recess is actually 1 inch wide then using a 1 inch paring chisel would be the best choice. Those chisels are designed with length in mind so finding one that is at least 8 inches long shouldn't be too hard. </p>

<p>If you have never used one before test on another piece. These are not inherently hard to use but the ease of work can depend on your wood species.</p>

<p><sup>Image from <a href=""http://www.wkfinetools.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WkFineTools</a></sup></p>

<p>The rasp blade you have picture would not make for a smooth surface. If it was like a cabinet rasp that would be better. Much like Graphus I have not seen handles rasps with necks like that. </p>

<hr>

<p>Given that my presumption was partial wrong about the work piece I can offer another suggestion. Perhaps a swan neck mortise chisel? Really depends on the angle you need. One primary purpose is to clean the bottom of mortises but the curved head might still be useful. I think it would be harder for this one to get a clean surface but if you are careful it could still work. I have an even better suggestion after that though.....</p>

<h1>Cranked neck paring chisel</h1>

<p>Even better though is I found that they make cranked neck paring chisels as well. They can also be called cranked shaft paring chisels. </p>

"Build a grid out of vertical, thin wood bars","1789","","<p>I want to create a grid out of thin wood bars (slats?), where the slats cross each other on the smaller side, like in this sketch:

<p>I would install LEDs in this grid, so it doesn't need to carry any external weight and the wood slats can be pretty thin. The grid would have a height of about 3-5 cm (1-2 inch) and a length of 50cm (20 inch).</p>

<p>What is the best way to do this? I was thinking about using a saw blade that is wider than the slats are thick – so each time I would just have to saw in once and that would be it. Obviously I would need pretty thin wood slats in that case (a few millimeters of MDF maybe?).
Is this possible? Feasible?
I have access to a chop saw and a buzz saw (both currently have blades not wider than 2mm) but I'm new to woodworking.</p>

<p>Is this even the best way to create such a grid? </p>
","<p>Yes, this is a great way to make such a grid, although you want the joints to be as tight as possible vs. cutting the slots slightly wider than the slats. With a looser fit, the grid will be more prone to racking.</p>

<p>If you want to make a cut to exactly the right width in one pass (up to a limit), you can use a dado set (available in either a ""wobble"" blade or the more common stacked dado set) to cut to the exact width of your slats, and the blade set to exactly half the height of your slats.  Keep in mind that on a 10"" table saw, the common dado set sizes are 8"" and 6"", which will limit your depth of cut.</p>

<p>Ideally, you would use a crosscut sled on a table saw with several slats aligned and clamped together.</p>

<p>You can also use a radial arm saw with a dado set--it works in a similar fashion but you cut from the top instead of the bottom, and the blade moves instead of the workpiece.  You have to be especially careful since a radial arm saw is configured to make a climb cut.</p>

<p>If you have a sliding miter saw, you can work similarly to a radial arm saw, but the blade cuts as you push it back instead of as you pull it toward yourself.  As far as I know, no sliding miter saw is designed to be used with a dado blade of any kind, so cutting the slats on a sliding miter saw will require multiple passes to cut the width of a slat, unless working with very thin material.</p>

"What should I do to maintain a saw blade?","1780","","<p>In an <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/3865/93"">answer</a>, <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/users/49/rob"">rob ♦</a> stated that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many other factors also influence the longevity of a blade between sharpenings, such as the hardness (e.g., steel vs. carbide, or one grade of steel or carbide vs. another) and initial sharpness of the teeth, <strong>whether the blade is properly maintained</strong>, the operating temperature, and the materials cut with the blade.<br><sup>Emphasis mine</sup></p>

<p>What is necessary to properly maintain a saw blade?</p>

<p>Are different techniques necessary for different types of blades?</p>

<ul>

<li>band</li>
<li>hand</li>
<li>reciprocating</li>
<li>jig/scroll</li>
<li>other</li>
</ul>
","<p>I think this is too broad to fully answer if asking about all saw types. Power saws I think can be grouped together for convenience and because the issues are fairly similar for all, but once you get to hand saws it's a whole different ballgame.</p>

<p><strong>Power saws</strong><br>
For power saws, I think the idea of 'proper maintenance' may vary somewhat depending on the person. For all power tools and the bulk of their users, this would mean only two things, <strong>cleaning</strong> and <strong>keeping rust at bay</strong>. Although it is possible few people have the inclination or skill to sharpen their own power-saw blades at home. </p>

<p>Assuming the blade doesn't have a rust-prevention coating applied in the factory keeping rust at bay is basic and simple. Oiling or waxing are the obvious routes, just as they are with most iron and steel in all other tools. </p>

<p>Cleaning is much more important with power-saw blades because the friction due to the high speed of the cutting in certain woods leads to gumming up in a way which is nearly absent when cutting by hand. Softwoods are the notorious culprit here, and a few resinous hardwoods are known for problems in this regard. Some sheet goods can be a problem too due to the type of adhesive used. The buildup can lead to the blade cutting poorly and appearing to have become blunt, while in fact it's just that the teeth need cleaning to free the edges and re-establish the proper clearance angle. </p>

<p>There are various products made for cleaning resinous buildup on saw blades. But the basic approach is either a solvent action (dissolves the resin) or a caustic action (breaks down the resin), which is why you can also do this effectively with an appropriate solvent such as kerosene, denatured alcohol, acetone or lacquer thinner* or with a suitable oven cleaner, one using caustic soda as the primary cleaning agent**. Some woodworkers report good results with other general cleaners including Simple Green, Goo Gone, Greased Lightning and even good old WD-40. </p>

<p>Not only is cleaning important for the blade to cut well in the first place, a clean blade has a much better quality of cut but more importantly keeping blades clean means they stay cooler during use, which gives a longer service life. As with all high-speed cutting edges, heat will begin to weaken them so anything that makes them run hot should be kept on top of.</p>

<p>* I would recommend you use the mildest solvent that will do the job rather than going straight to lacquer thinner, it most assuredly works but it's relatively toxic and very fast to evaporate. Plus it will dissolve a lot of paints so may remove important branding or other information printed on the blade. Try kerosene or denatured alcohol first.</p>

<p>** Caustic agents may attack some brazing so use with caution on carbide-tipped saw blades. Completely safe on any all-steel blade however. Do note that this will also very effectively remove most paints and coatings and of course there's a risk of chemical burns.</p>

<p><strong>Hand saws</strong><br>
Obviously with almost all hand saws rust-prevention is important, cleaning less so since it's rare you'd need to do anything other than brush away a few bits of clinging sawdust.</p>

<p>But with hand saws the concept of maintenance will go beyond the above two things and must include <strong>sharpening</strong>, which for many dedicated users is a standard part of keeping up their saws. This subject is beyond the scope of an Answer to properly cover and even fairly lengthy guides elsewhere online should be considered just primers on the subject, given there are entire chapters in sharpening books devoted to the subject.</p>

<p>Instead of even attempting to describe it here briefly I'll just tack on a few links. First, a very basic overview to introduce the idea:<br>

"What is the technique of turning a nail back on itself called?","1775","","<p>I was watching a video demonstrating a technique of putting a nail through two pieces of wood, bending the nail back on itself against a metal plate and hammering it in, so that the end result was sort of like a staple. What is that technique called?</p>
","<p>It is called <a href=""http://www.bobvila.com/articles/1202-nailing-techniques/#.VUfwRPlVhBc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">clinching</a>. The technique is pretty simple, yet hold fairly well to prevent separation from the two boards.</p>

<p>Here is a good example of how to do it:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/K1phX.gif"" alt=""clinch nailing""></p>

<p><a href=""http://collections.infocollections.org/ukedu/en/d/Jgtz061be/4.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a></p>

<p>The example calls for a small bar to be used to bend a short length of the nail. This can also be accomplished by just using a hammer to angle the nail. Any deformation of the wood will be hidden by the nail itself when it is driven back into the surface.</p>

<p><em>Detailed Steps</em></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hammer a nail most of the way through both boards. You want enough of the pointed end of the nail so that you can fold it over. Using a small piece of metal to help shape the nail, hit the pointed end of the nail causing it to bend in the direction you want. You don't need to be absolute on the angle, approximately 90 degrees will do. </p></li>
<li><p>Remove the piece of metal from the workpiece. Drive the nail completely through the two pieces of wood. You may have to set the workpiece on something to give you clearance for the remainder of the nail. Strike the nail between the folded over section and the workpiece, closer to the folded over section. This will cause the nail to bend as in step 2. <strong>You should drive the nail either in the direction of the grain or across it.</strong> Different people have different attitudes about why you should drive in either direction. For me, it boils down to do I want the nail raised above the surface of the wood or not. If I do, then I drive the nail across the grain.</p></li>
<li><p>Drive the bent end of the nail into the workpiece.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Alternative methods</em></p>

<p>Instead of using a hammer to bend the nail, you can use pliers or a vice. With thicker diameter nails, using an alternative method becomes problematic. One video I have seen recommended using a metal plate to turn the nails as you drive them.</p>

"Planing thin stock without the aid of bench dogs","1774","","<p>At this point I do not have a bench that will support dogs. However even if I did I would have an issue planing the faces of my thin 3/8"" wood. The bench dogs I have seen have a clearance of exactly 3/8"".</p>

<p>I am very eager to use my hand-planes but I don't have the setup for it. I have a <a href=""http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/tools-hardware/shop-equipment/work-tables-vises/work-tables-benches/jobmate-folding-work-table-0570029p.html?utm_campaign=bazaarvoice&amp;utm_medium=SearchVoice&amp;utm_source=RatingsAndReviews&amp;utm_content=Default"">cheap work table</a>, with plastic ""bench dogs"", that would be perfect to use but the dogs are too tall so I cannot use the plane with them getting in the way or damaged. </p>

<p><strong>What I have tried...</strong></p>

<p>Using the aforementioned work table, I had placed other wood below the work piece, to prop it up, but could not get a tight fit so everything just moved around. </p>

<p><strong>What I have considered...</strong></p>

<p>I have seen jigs where you would screw pieces of wood at opposite ends of the work piece and use wedges to tighten. Given the wood I am using I would have to have stops with shorter wood. Planing the stops is fine, since it is scrap anyway, but I don't how to secure them without damaging the plane (screws would be recessed but with the wood that thin I would expect the plane to break the wood). </p>

<p><strong>What I have been doing</strong></p>

<p>For now I have been placing the board on the floor and using a belt sander with my foot as the stop. I am able to do about 80% of a face this way since I don't want sand my feet. What I then do is turn the board ( not flip over ) and finish the other 20% which would not longer be obstructed by my foot. This has lead to inconsistent sanding on occasion. </p>

<hr>

<p>That being said ... Is there a jig /suggestion of what I can do so that I can hand plane the face of a pallet board that is only about 3/8"" high? I am currently looking for a solution without the aid of bench dogs (since I am not capable of supporting them) but will answers supplemented by them would be fine.)</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Using the aforementioned work table, I had placed other wood below the work piece, to prop it up, but could not get a tight fit so everything just moved around. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think a simple mod here could get this method to work (I've used something similar myself when planing thinner stock many times) although it wouldn't be the primary way I'd suggest you go about it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have seen jigs where you would screw pieces of wood at opposite ends of the work piece and use wedges to tighten. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is OK in general principle but I wouldn't recommend any holding system that relies on pinching the boards between stops (as happens if you had a wagon vice for example). With thin stock the potential for the material to bow upwards under the clamping pressure is too great, and even the slightest bow in the centre will result in the piece ending up noticeably thinner in the centre after surfacing both sides.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What you want ideally is a <em>low-profile stop</em> and there are a great many ways you can implement this. Since I presume you don't want the hassle of mortising into the top of your bench to allow the installation of a rising stop I'll mention three much simpler options.</p>

<p>The first one is so very simple but many people today are precious about their workbenches so are resistant to the idea. You drive one or two <strong>brass wood screws</strong> directly into the benchtop:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KR6R5.jpg"" alt=""Brass screw as planing stop""></p>

<p>Not only does the edge of a screw head provide a surprisingly good grip on the end of a board this type of stop can be varied in height to suit the stock you're working on by simply being driven in or backed off (as well as driven home completely to leave the benchtop clear once more).</p>

<p>This method is not new and may go back as far as the 19th century, here it is as a reader-submitted tip in the June 1959 issue of <em>Popular Mechanics</em>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GKKuh.jpg"" alt=""Popular Mechanics tip""></p>

<p>As in the above two images the screws can be used directly as the stop, but an alternative is to use them to hold a wooden stop across the benchtop against which the end of your board rests, as in the next image:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vRFq8.jpg"" alt=""Brass screws hold planing stop""></p>

<p>Second tip will work if you have a face vice, or dog holes in a front apron that would allow holdfasts to grip in a similar way. You make a type of planing stop that is a little like a T-square in form; these go by a few names, including a face-planing stop but sometimes are simply called a <strong>bench planing stop</strong>. </p>

<p>Here's one example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gbiOC.jpg"" alt=""T-shaped planing stop""></p>

<p>The short leg or keel is gripped in the jaws of the vice, or held by a holdfast, and the arm extends across your workbench as the stop. </p>

<p>Note: one design detail that isn't always incorporated into these is that the top of the keel block should be planed at a very slight angle (leaving the outside edge high, inside edge low). What this does is very firmly press the arm down once the keel is clamped securely.</p>

<p>As you can see shop scraps can provide the necessary material, a narrow length of ply and a piece of 1x2, so it's no problem to make two or three in multiple thicknesses to accommodate the planing of a wide variety of stock.</p>

<p>Last but not least, <strong>a bench hook</strong> with a low-profile back stop. Although bench hooks are commonly fairly small and primarily used as sawing aids the same basic design can be adapted for them to function as planing jigs (both for face planing as well as simple shooting boards). </p>

<p>And while they are typically fairly small, intended to be used across the bench, they can be made of significant size (in excess of 2' long if needed) to be used along the length of the bench:</p>

"Where should the trademark be placed on a baseball bat?","1743","","<p>As a kid during the days of Little League (my last close contact with baseball), we always admonished one another not to hit the ball on the trademark of the bat.  You'll break it!  </p>

<p>Well, occasionally one of us would manage to break a bat, but we never knew whether the trademark was involved.</p>

<p>Where should the trademark be placed to lessen chances of breaking or does burning a trademark into the barrel weaken the bat? </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Is there any truth to breaking a bat by hitting on the trademark</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes there is. Traditionally the logo or label is located in a specific orientation to the grain in the wood, leading to the guideline that the logo should face the sky or the ground (""logo up or logo down"") meaning you would be hitting the ball at 90° to the position of the logo.</p>

<p>As one manufacturer puts it: </p>

<p><em>There is a proper side to hit on, so be sure to also see the answer to the next question.</em></p>

<p><em>...[by orienting the label up or down] you'll be making contact with the area on the ""side"" of the bat where the grains are layered---the strongest ""side"" of the bat.</em> </p>

<p>Unfortunately, and as usual, it's not quite as simple as that because more than one species is used to make baseball bats and they have quite different structures. Also there is more than one type of breakage/failure (in the handle area or the barrel). More info here on <a href=""http://www.woodbat.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">WoodBats.Org</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>does burning a trademark into the barrel weaken the bat? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it's placed in the traditional location, I doubt it. It's at a right angle to the primary forces the bat is (should be) subjected to, so it should normally have no effect. </p>

<p>A burned-in logo would normally only involve the surface anyway. It is possible that if you burn very deeply it might compromise the wood if the logo is placed atypically, but I think that you'd have to have both conditions met for it to affect a bat's strength — so both burned far too deep and in the wrong orientation to the grain.</p>

Like discussed in comments I think you might be better off starting over and paying attention to points below. </p>

<p><strong>Knots and Pith</strong></p>

<p>Depending on where you sourced these it is likely that you could have large amount of knots and pith. When you got to purchase lumber you need to check for these things as they will largely affect the drying process. </p>

<p><strong>Normalizing Wood</strong></p>

<p>The wood you purchased should sit in the environment you plan on keeping it in for several weeks or months depending. While it might not looked warped in the store you sometimes don't know how long its been there and more importantly I doubt your build location has the exact same humidity. While gluing can help discourage some movement the wood is still going to lose / gain moisture. </p>

<p><strong>Wood Selection</strong></p>

<p>While I would still try this, and look forward to this summer, many would caution against using softwoods like pine, spruce and fir as they can be prone to warping. Also, depending on the use for the table softwood would damage more easily. This point might not be for you but you are likely using pine. </p>

<p><strong>The Glue up Process</strong></p>

<h1>Starting Over</h1>

","<p>Yes, that is a method still in use. You can use it to fill gaps. But, the unfortunate thing about this method is... You create a place on wood that is different in absorbing the oil/stain that you apply.
But it depends on your stain colour and wood's colour also. If they are both darkish, it will not be a problem. But if your wood is lightish and the stain is darkish... voila, you will get a whitish spot on wood, in places filled with the wood/glue. Because of its altered absorbance of the stain due to glue.

<p>I think you'll find that a lot of larger threaded screws made of wood (in the USA, at least) were/are made of hard maple.  This is what <a href=""http://lakeerietoolworks.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lake Erie Toolworks</a> uses for their vise screws.</p>

<p>Hard maple is a good choice since it has tight, closed grain and is not generally subject to chipping.  The side-grain forces on a screw require that it be resistant to chipping.  Oak would probably be a poor choice for that reason.</p>

I imagine that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignum_vitae"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lignum vitae</a> would make a good screw as well since it machines so well.</p>

<p>The most important part to remember for any wooden screw is that it must be very straight grained and free of defects.  Grain runout will weaken the shaft of the screw.  Any little knots in the piece will cause extra wear in your screw mechanism and be that much harder to cut out when making the threads.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Diameter</strong> Surely it needs to be of a fair size. Would 1 inch be sufficient? If it is too large, would there be a concern?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You will likely find that large vise screws are much larger than 1"".  The Lake Erie leg vise, for example, uses 2-1/4"" diameter dowels for their screws.</p>

<p>However, for a smaller vise like your Moxon vise, this is overkill.  A 1"" diameter screw is most likely fine.  If the screw is larger, there is no real concern - to a point.  If you have too large a thread pitch, the piece you thread into needs to be sufficiently thick that the threads have something to bite into.  Example: if you have a 1"" thread pitch screwing into a 1/2""-thick board, you don't have anywhere near enough thread wall in your nut to resist the screwing forces.</p>

<p>If you want to take a crack at making the dowel yourself (without a fancy threading jig), have a look at <em>L'art du menuisier</em>, by André Jacob Roubo.

"How to join short boards to make a longer panel","1702","","<p>I'm pretty familiar with edge joining boards of the same width to make a panel (for a table top, cabinet door, or whatever) but I've never done a project where I also need to end join short boards, and I'm a little unsure of what order I should do the gluing in. Basically, I found several fairly short pieces of african rosewood at a great deal, and I'd like to make a desk top out of them. I'd like the desk to be 5 feet long, but most of the pieces of wood are 2.5-3 feet long.</p>

<p>Do I first need to end join each board to get the overall 5' that I want, then glue those as I would any other panel? Or should I glue different length boards to the width I want, with uneven ends, and then keep gluing those until I get the length I'm looking for?</p>

<p>For reference, this is what I'm talking about:</p>

<p>As to the order the joints are made, you will need to join the shorter boards into longer ones, then join the long boards to make the correct width. If you try to do it the other way - making the width first, you'll end up with very, <em>very</em> tight slots to try to slip a new, short board into, and, if your other joints were done properly, you probably won't be able to.</p>

<p>Also, not specifically asked, but to make the butt joints, I'd suggested using finger joints like this:</p>

"Comparison of Western saws and Japanese Saws","1675","","<p>I was considering acquiring a Japanese style saw from Lee Valley. </p>

<p>I have a small collection of tenon saws and regular saws that would, it seem, already serve the same purposes as most of the Japanese equivalents. </p>

<p>Are there practical reasons to purchase Japanese saws to add them to my collection or are these just something I want to purchase as a gimmick?</p>
","<p>There are a few common differences between Japanese and Western saws:</p>

<ol>
<li>A decent Japanese saw is often cheaper than a decent Western saw.</li>
<li>The body mechanics of sawing are different--with a Japanese saw, you cut on the pull stroke and stand more in-line with the cut, whereas with a Western saw you cut on the push stroke and stand at an angle to the cut (so your arm moves like a piston).</li>
<li>A Japanese saw has a thinner kerf than a Western saw (which may be an advantage in some situations)</li>
<li>Because the saw plate is so thin, the teeth on a Japanese saw dull and break off more easily than those on a Western saw. For this reason, if you are limited to buying only one or the other, Andy Chidwick recommends the Western backsaw over a Dozuki because it will last longer (more sharpenings, and longer between sharpenings).</li>
</ol>

<p>Because the required body mechanics are different for the two styles of saws (in particular, the two styles of backsaws), it can be difficult to switch back and forth. This is why many people have strong preferences for one or the other--those people probably got very good at using one style of saw, and when they tried to apply the same body mechanics to the other type of saw, it didn't work very well.</p>

<p>If you're perfectly comfortable using a Western backsaw, a dozuki may not give you much practical benefit, but if you're having a difficult time learning to use a Western backsaw, a dozuki is easy to learn.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some types of Japanese saws complement Western methods nicely. For example, a ryoba or flush cut saw works great for flush-cutting dowels.</p>

"Why does direction matter when using an electric router?","1661","","<p>I was watching an episode of the Wood Whisperer on YouTube, and he was making a frame for a mirror. At one point in the video he was going to put a round-over on the frame and was using an electric router for it.

<p>A climbing cut will have less tear out, but requires more control of the router to keep it from pulling away and injuring the operator or damaging the work piece.  </p>

<p>A normal cut is safer in all instances.  The tear out that can happen can be eliminated by using a backer board to support the wood at the end of the cut.</p>

"Applying shellac in high humidity","1640","","<p>I applied a coat of dewaxed shellac (Bulls Eye) as a first coat on some poplar.</p>

<p>I then noticed that the can said do not apply if humidity exceeds 85%. I live in a generally humid area. Today is a rainy day and the humidity is 95% (89-100% forecast, temp ~60F/16C, indoors no heat), it's one of those days where the books on my shelf are damp. I sanded the poplar heavily first because it had surface moisture and the grain had risen.</p>

<p>My question is: Why can't I apply the shellac at humidity greater than 85%, what happens if I do, and if it was a big mistake how can I fix it?</p>

<p>It definitely is taking a long time to dry. I intend to coat with stain (Varathane, oil base) then a polyurethane (Garco, oil modified) eventually.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Why can't I apply the shellac at humidity greater than 85%</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few reasons. </p>

<p>One is that a very high water content in the air can slow drying, as you've experienced (a thin coat of shellac would normally take no longer than 10-15 minutes to dry) or prevent proper drying. </p>

<p>The main reason though is that as alcohol evaporates from a surface it cools it — just as you can feel if you get some on your fingers — and as the alcohol evaporates out of the shellac coat it can chill enough that it actually condenses moisture out of the air onto the surface. Shellac is moisture-sensitive as you probably know and this condensed moisture can be enough for the shellac to go cloudy. This clouding can sometimes be fixed, but obviously it's better to avoid it if possible.</p>

<p>But, as with most instructions on finish labels the 85% humidity thing should be taken as a general guideline rather than an absolute. I regularly apply shellac at humidities above 80% because I have no choice: it's <em>always</em> that humid here. The reason this can work is that relative humidity doesn't directly correlate to an absolute amount of water in the air, it's tied to the temperature. So it's much much more moist in the tropics at 100% humidity than it is somewhere more temperate. Also, how heavily the shellac is applied is a factor since the thicker a coat is the more alcohol is evaporating and the cooler the surface can get. So thin wiped-on coats can work without a hitch even when it's very humid.</p>

<p>Now that said, it is probably a good idea not to use shellac on the wettest of days. It's a pain, but a product's limitations are what they are and we have to work within them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and if it was a big mistake how can I fix it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's only a mistake if it caused an issue. If your shellac eventually dried right — hard, not sticky and with no clouding — then you're fine. </p>

<p>It's not so much a question of ""microwave-safe"" finishes as ""microwave-safe"" materials.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_oven"">Microwaves work</a> by exciting water molecules, thereby increasing their energy (i.e., heating them up).  The reason your wooden bowl gets hot is because of the water trapped in the wood fibers.</p>

"What degree should I sharpen my chisel","1615","","<p>So I got some cheap chisels and there all ground to different angles and I want to correct this on the bench grinder. I am going to do this free hand, I might build a jig. But I want to know what is a good angle to shoot for. Which I know is 25*. But I want to know a little better why it is not a good idea to go steeper. I say it is not a good idea because no website seems to explain why it is just 'bad' or something. I also want to know what each angle is used for. Like how might 20* benefit over 30*. All in all I want to know what angle will give a super cut. Like a hot knife through butter. Thank you.</p>
","<p>The sharper the angle, the sharper the chisel and the better it will slice through the wood fibers. However, this comes at the cost of durability. The shallower the angle, the more durable is the edge (since you have more metal behind the edge). As you can imagine, the angle is a matter of compromise - sharper or more durable. 25 degrees is a good middle point, so that's why it's typically used from the factory.</p>

<p>You should choose the compromise point based on your needs and the task at hand. End grain paring will require a sharper edge and it's typically done with hand pressure only, so a sharper angle (20 degrees or even sharper) will work well. For mortise cutting in side grain, where the cut doesn't have to be super clean, and you pound at the chisel with a mallet you might prefer 30 degrees or even shallower. For general work chisels the 25 degrees should work well.</p>

<p>If you can afford to have multiple chisels, each set sharpened to a different angle (20 degrees for paring, 30 for heavy work, 25 for in-between), you can use the right tool for the job. If you have only a single set the default 25 degrees bevel should typically be used.</p>

"Using scrapers on ""fuzzy"" woods","1597","","<p>Just started using scrapers and I love them. I was looking for questions and thought I would look around the concept of pitfalls and <a href=""http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/common-woodworking-pitfalls-and-how-to-avoid-them.html"" rel=""nofollow"">I read this paragraph in regards to sanding</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>Sanding that makes the wood fuzzy</h1>
  
  <p>Some woods, such as birch, get fuzzy when you sand them too much. The fibers of the wood tear and create hairlike fuzz on the surface of the wood. You don't want to stain or topcoat wood in that condition.</p>
  
  <p>If your wood does get fuzzy, go down a grit or two with the sandpaper (120-grit is a good place to start) and sand out the little furs. The way to avoid fuzzy wood is to make sure you don't sand with a paper finer than 150 grit. <strong>And don't use a scraper either</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That final emphasis is mine. I get that sanding can create fuzz due to tearing. That makes sense. Scrapers are supposed to avoid that by slicing the wood instead of gouging it. Why say don't use scrapers then? Are you not suppose to use scrapers on ""fuzzy"" wood? </p>

<p>I never use dummies.com as a solid information resource so if the information there is wrong I won't be surprised. I feel that sentence is misguided or needs to be embellished.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>That final emphasis is mine. I get that sanding can create fuzz due to tearing. That makes sense. Scrapers are supposed to avoid that by slicing the wood instead of gouging it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes in theory, but this is a case where the wood is unusually prone to tearing so scraping can't always give the results it would otherwise.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are you not suppose to use scrapers on ""fuzzy"" wood? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on the exact circumstances as much as on the scraper — both the size and the amount of hook on the scraper can have a large effect on the success of scraping (more on this below).</p>

<p>You may have read elsewhere that softwoods shouldn't be, or <em>can't be</em>, scraped. The reason for this is the fuzz, where the very soft earlywood on some species is  extremely prone to tearing or lifting. But as I mention in passing <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1134/what-are-the-differences-between-sanding-and-scraping/1159#1159"">here</a> I've scraped softwoods. In fact I'd like to think I've had quite a bit of success doing it and that is partly because I won't just scrape in one way and if that doesn't work I give up.</p>

<p><strong>Possible solutions</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Sand differently</strong><br>
Sometimes it's not enough to sand ""in the direction of the grain"", or parallel to the grain to put it more accurately, there are times when you want to sand <em>only in one direction</em>. Where you're getting tearing of fibres you can sometimes get much better results sanding forwards or backwards only, and not back and forth.</p>

<p><strong>Variations in scraping</strong><br>
Very broadly there are three edges that are used to scrape with: </p>

<ul>
<li>card scraper with a large, heavily turned burr (e.g. 10°)</li>
<li>card scraper with a small, lightly turned burr (3-5°)</li>
<li>a knife edge (using an actual knife, single-edged razor, or the edge of a chisel held upright)</li>
</ul>

<p>On the same piece of wood you can notice quite a difference between scraping with each of these. As a result it's worth having all three on hand to try out when situations crop up and you're not getting the uniformly good results you expect.</p>

<p><strong>Harden the wood surface</strong><br>
I was going to mention a similar workaround/solution to the problem as aaron has already provided, in applying a light coat of finish to harden the surface wood. But in my case I would suggest either dilute shellac or lacquer (in essence, using the equivalent of many commercial 'sanding sealers' one of whose jobs is exactly this). While varnish works as well or better for this purpose shellac and lacquer dry much much faster so you can continue work on the board with far less waiting.</p>

<p>This will improve results with both sanding or scraping, but if you remove too much wood you'll expose untreated wood fibres and the problem will recur. </p>

<p>I think the bottom line here is that problem areas in a given piece of wood are problem areas, and it can be difficult to deal with them 100% successfully. I'm sure nearly everyone has experienced that one patch on a board, that overall smooth-planes or scrapes well, which tears out and spoils the otherwise pristine surface. Occasionally in seems that no matter what direction you go at it the problem won't go away entirely and you eventually have to just do the best you can with it as time and the material allows, accepting it's not ending up perfect.</p>

<hr>

<p>Incidentally, you'll hear people express their surprise that others are having this problem much/at all in a given species that they're very familiar with, as in, ""I use [x species] all the time and I never experience this etc."". There's one major reason for the different experiences: wood varies.  As blindingly obvious as this is it's surprising how often it goes unacknowledged. It's not just that wood itself varies so much, local humidity (and therefore wood moisture content) obviously can be anywhere from dry as a bone to like a sauna. Last but not least whether the wood was air-dried or kiln-dried can have a marked effect on workability. Just ask fans of air-dried black walnut what they think of the kiln-dried version!</p>

<p>But there's another major reason that often gets overlooked which can play a major role here and that is whether one guy is processing their stock by hand planing and the other using machine planing. There's almost an assumption that planed wood = planed wood, which is very much <em>not</em> the case. </p>

"Is sanding along the grain important?","1595","","<p>I've heard from various sources that you must always sand in the direction of the grain.  Is this always true?  Does it depends on the sanding paper's grit, tool used or the wood being sanded?  What are the advantages of sanding along the grain?</p>
","<p>In general yes, you will have a much nicer finish much faster by sanding with the grain.  </p>

<p>The larger the grit (60 vs. 100) will leave larger 'gouges' in the wood when sanding.  The grit is an 'average' size of the grains and the larger ones can leave deeper marks.  Sanding with the grain the marks are much less likely to cut across the wood grain, leaving an obvious trail.</p>

<p>So by sanding along the grain you will need less time with finer and finer sandpaper to get the same finish.  While you can do the same thing by sanding across the grain it will take much longer.  </p>

<p>An easy example is to take a board that is pretty smooth and in one area sand across the grain, then take a much finer sand paper and sanding with the grain sand the whole board.  It becomes pretty obvious quickly the 'damage' done.</p>

<p>Random orbit sanders do a decent job of minimizing the worst of the cross-grain cutting. I've also found that the orbit sanding disks have a smaller variance in their grit.</p>

<p>I wouldn't myself do these kinds of cuts using a jigsaw, but it is possible though. People successfully use jigsaws to cut deep overlapping cross-lap joints for knockdown plywood furniture and that requires quite a high degree of accuracy. </p>

<p><strong>Jigsaw</strong><br>
Some of the tips given for doing clean, straight cuts with a jigsaw are:</p>

<ul>
<li>run the baseplate along a straight edge clamped in place (just a good straight piece of 1x2 is all that's needed)</li>
<li>work slowly, if you force the cut it can tend to induce flex in the blade</li>
<li>use a good quality blade (some are also capable of giving good surfaces on <em>both</em> sides of the material, although many are designed to give good top or bottom surfaces)</li>
<li>if you can't find or afford a suitable blade it's worth deeply knifing your layout lines <em>on both sides</em> to prevent chipout</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hand tools</strong><br>
I would do these sorts of cuts by hand and a sharp chisel would play a big part in the process, especially for cleaning up the corners but often for a bit of fine-tuning of the straight cuts, paring back to my gauged lines.</p>

<p>If one of the difficulties you experienced when paring with a chisel was holding it consistently vertical it's worth using a guide block clamped in place that the flat of the chisel can ride against:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NNPUJ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NNPUJ.jpg"" alt=""Chisel guide blocks""></a></p>

<p>Guide blocks can also be used to help ensure square shoulders when sawing as shown in this pair of illustrations which I think originally came from a Jackson/Day book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have just purchased a good table saw and router, and am a complete novice with them. I have thought about standing the board on edge and cutting in to get a clean cut, using a dado or many passes for the edge notch, but that seems awkward and quite dangerous. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes that could be quite dangerous with a table saw!</p>

<p><strong>Router</strong><br>
A router can be used quite easily to do these sorts of cut-outs. A jig or template would make the cuts very accurate and repeatable, if you don't mind having to construct them ahead of time. The jigs would be much like those in the following pic, made for doing the recess to take a hinge:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/htI9c.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/htI9c.jpg"" alt=""Router hinge templates""></a></p>

<p>The cut-out in the template is made a little oversize (by a fixed amount so easy to make the necessary adjustments to your measurements) and a collar/guide bush projecting from the base of the router will follow along its inside edge. </p>

<p>If you're cutting through the full thickness of the material in one pass turn the speed on the router up to full and progress the cut at a measured pace, <em>do not</em> attempt to force it to cut.</p>

<p><strong>Rounded corners</strong>: a router will naturally produce rounded internal corners, which are usually squared up. This is commonly done with a chisel, but you can also use a corner chisel or the 'shell' of a mortising bit. </p>

<p>If you don't fancy doing that you can actually leave the corners round. For the toe-kick especially I don't see an advantage to making the corner square and having it rounded is less usual so you could consider it a feature. </p>

<p>With the front notch that will accept the horizontal board you would have to round over a short portion of the two inside edges of the board to get it to fit in the notch properly. This isn't particularly difficult, although you may want to practice once or twice on scraps before doing it for real. Again after carefully marking out to start with you can do this by paring (using a chisel, carving knife, sharp penknife), paring then sanding, just by sanding or with a file, whatever you prefer.</p>

"Type of wood glue-up used in some Ikea furniture?","1588","","<p>Some Ikea furniture, such as the <a href=""http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/10290221/"" rel=""nofollow"">Norden table</a> series, uses a distinctive type of striped wood for the large flat surfaces.  These surfaces appear to be many pieces of approximately 1&ndash;&frac38; &times; &frac12; inch slats of wood combined together into a larger piece.  What is this type of wood and how is it made?</p>

<p>To be clear, I'm not looking for the species of tree the wood came from, but rather the name and manufacturing technique used to make this sort of composite structure.</p>
","<p>This is called a <strong>butcher block</strong>. It comes in two types - edge grain (like in the Norden tables), where the surface shows the edge (long) grain of the pieces of wood:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/a4OAS.jpg""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/a4OAS.jpg"" alt=""Edge grain butcher block""></a></p>

<p>And end grain, where the surface shows the end grain of the pieces of wood:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bohSJ.jpg""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bohSJ.jpg"" alt=""End grain butcher block""></a></p>

<p>Butcher block is made from small pieces, which are glued together. Since wood glue is stronger than the wood it binds, there is no need for any more fastening of the wood pieces. A butcher block in general is a more economical way of creating large wooden surfaces. </p>

<p>An end-grain butcher block is tougher than an edge grain, since the end-grain is tougher.</p>

<p>Butcher block construction is commonly used for cutting boards and for kitchen counter tops.</p>

"Using softwoods for bench tops","1588","","<p>As most of the regulars know I work with a lot of whitewoods. Pines mostly that come from pallets and what not.</p>

<p>I recently made a workbench from an old door but it was hollow inside so I plan on moving it to a lower level and replacing the top with something more solid. Given my availability of 2x4's it would be really easy for me to laminate those and plane the top to make a nice bench top. </p>

<p>There are enough people on the ""pine /softwoods are terrible for this"" bandwagon but I found a <a href=""https://paulsellers.com/2013/04/softwood-benchtops-work-great/"" rel=""nofollow"">blog post from Paul Sellers</a> that comes to their defence for me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have made benches in the US from every species of softwood with not issues of serviceability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So a good question for here would be are softwoods suitable or practicable for use as bench tops? </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>So a good question for here would be are softwoods suitable or practicable for use as bench tops? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Obviously softwoods are generally fairly soft and a bench made from softwood is going to be more prone to denting than one made of e.g. hard maple (a very popular choice in the US) but this could actually be considered a <em>desirable</em> trait rather than a failing. When woodworking on any very hard table care must be exercised not to accidentally mar the workpiece, especially when doing any work in softwoods or MDF. While with a softwood bench it is the bench that is likely to take the brunt of the damage if the workpiece is dropped on it or bumped against an edge, you could argue this is actually what you want. </p>

<p>That issue aside, the view is expressed that a softwood benchtop lacks the necessary toughness or resilience to take heavy use, particularly over a long service life. While it's not an exact parallel some indication that this view is too limited is given by farmhouse tables from Britain, Ireland and the Continent. These were very commonly built from pine and the fact that they often endured immensely long service lives (a century or greater) shows that softwoods can withstand sustained use over many years.</p>

<p>And just to show that this isn't merely an intellectual exercise, some vintage and antique softwood benches to prove the point conclusively:</p>

"Techniques for Working with Driftwood","1575","","<p>I've been collecting a bunch of wood from the beach near our house lately with the hopes of making some neat artwork or possibly furniture.  Are there any special precautions, techniques, or considerations I need to keep in mind when working with driftwood?</p>
","<p>This is quite a broad question. I've use wood I've picked up beachcombing many times, all of which could be classed generically as ""driftwood"" but it's far from uniform. Some was originally branches and other random bits of trees, some milled wood that got into the ocean somehow. On top of that the amount of time the wood spent in the water made a huge difference in its condition. </p>

<p>As a result, I've picked up pieces that don't appear to be much different to what I might expect if they'd never been in the ocean but only exposed to some rain and sunlight. Other stuff has broken down, from a little to a lot and the worst of it is soft enough you can break it apart with your fingers as most people have experienced once or twice when handling washed up wood on a beach. </p>

<p>So bottom line I don't think there are any specific techniques for dealing with driftwood, but rather for dealing with the wood in whatever condition it happens to be in. </p>

<p>The very soft stuff I don't bother with myself, although I see the potential for decorative pieces. This can be used without any modification other than maybe a wash down once you get it home so that it's a bit cleaner. It can also be stabilized or strengthened if desired using various commercial products (various <em>wood hardeners</em>) designed to introduce resins into the weakened wood structure which then harden and reinforce the soft, or 'punky', wood. For smaller pieces in particular they can have resin forcefully introduced (search term: <em>resin impregnation</em>), using vacuum or pressure. This can result in even very soft wood becoming hard and strong, but it changes its appearance quite significantly, to the point that some people think it looks like plastic or resin.</p>

<p>Same deal with glueing the wood or using mechanical fasteners. With wood in reasonably firm shape it won't react too differently to fresh wood, with very soft wood you often can't use conventional glue or screws because neither has anything strong to grab onto.</p>

<p>In terms of adding a protective coating to a project made from driftwood, some people are OK with using oils, shellac or regular varnish to finish the wood, accepting the colour change that occurs. Others prefer to keep the wood looking as much like it did on the beach, in which case a ""water white"" finish is called for; a common choice here is a matt waterbased poly. With luck the piece can look virtually unchanged while having a coating that protects it from getting grubby from dust and light handling. </p>

"Turning a railroad tie into a bench, how to make a cut?","1556","","<p>I have a couple leftover railroad ties from a retaining wall I built and I would like to turn them into benches.  Rather than sit on the old tar covered exterior though I would like to cut a bit of it off as in this fantastically drawn image:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jzJuY.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>That is a profile view so you are looking at it from the side.  Basically I would like to leave about 6 inches the full height on each side then cut a curve about two inches tall so that the seat portion is 6"" thick.  </p>

<p><strong>How do I make this cut and what tools will I need?</strong></p>

<p>Keep in mind that the lumber is 8"" x 8"" x 10' so getting it up on a workbench is out of the question.</p>
","<p>I don't know how ""pretty"" it needs to be when its done but rough cuts can easily be done with a chainsaw or a reciprocating saw with a long enough blade. A quick search shows blades that are 10"" long which might be enough for the reciprocating saw. A 12"" pruning blade like this <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000FAPPAA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bad boy from Amazon</a> for example.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oiIRHm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Might not be the best example but as long as the gullets are deep enough ( they would need to be for this. ) it <em>should</em> work.</p>

<p>Making wedges from the sides until there is enough room to work the tool though the 6"" region. </p>

<p>Need to be <strong>really careful</strong> using the chainsaw. Very dangerous tool. Especially for the stance you might need to make this cut.</p>

<p>If you had an old style enormous hand saw for ripping the tie I imagine that would work as well as seen in <a href=""http://www.timberframe-tools.com/natural-timbers/rip-sawing-an-old-log/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this blog</a></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eAqXi.jpg"" alt=""Big hand saw""></p>

<p>Coming at it from the side with a broad axe would work as well. In the same vein as how logs are rough shaped into timber. You could also cut vertically down was a saw (hand or powered) several times across the length of the seat and pop out the waste with a large timber chisel or slick. </p>

<p>Much like I said in my comment those ties are commonly treated with creosote which is a known skin irritant amongst other health concerns like causing chemical burns. While you might be avoiding exposure by sealing it I will still mention this because the risk is there while <em>processing the tie</em> as well

"Best way to flatten boards by hand","1515","","<p>I'm trying to process 4/4 soft maple rough stock into 1/2"" thin boards, ready for use in furniture and I'm having a real hard time getting them flat.  Here's my process so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>Crosscut a 18"" piece from the rough stock, about 12"" wide</li>
<li>Rip this piece in half for roughly the final width I'll need</li>
<li>Resaw each of these pieces so they're roughly 1/2"" thick</li>
<li>Try to flatten the board with my #4 plane, end up chasing my tail and never getting it flat</li>
</ol>

<p>I should mention that I'm only using hand tools for the entire process, and all sawing is done with a Japanese ryoba (<a href=""https://www.fine-tools.com/ryoba.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">example</a>).  </p>

<p>I know one issue I'll have to sort out is holding the work while planing, but what planing techniques could I be missing?  I generally start out going diagonal to the grain which gets me fairly close to flat.  Then I'll start going along the grain, but I never get completely flat.</p>

<p>EDIT: Here are some pictures of the sole of my plane:

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dkCWP.jpg"" alt=""Close up of mouth""></p>

<p>Also, it's a #4, not a #5 as I said earlier.  The sole is completely flat according to my measurements.  I don't see any nicks in the iron.  I do see a fair number of scratches on the sole and I'm not sure what's causing those.</p>
","<p>You are a brave individual--attempting to hand plane. I've successfully hand-planed my workbench and here was my method:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use two totally flat sticks (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winding_stick"">winding sticks</a>) on each end of the board to identify twist. If there is twist, begin by skimming from the high surfaces.</p></li>
<li><p>Starting at one end of the board, stretch one stick across the grain and look for light beneath. Mark the high spots with a pencil and skim that part (I went diagonal with the grain) until you see little or no light beneath the stick. </p></li>
<li><p>Move the stick several inches and repeat. </p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the same process, but lay the sticks in the direction of the grain. </p></li>
<li><p>Finish with one final pass across the entire board, with the grain. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>A couple of reasons why it might not be working:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The sole of your plane isn't flat. Have you checked that the #5 if completely flat? If not, rubbing it on a piece of sandpaper on a flat surface should do the trick.</p></li>
<li><p>The plane may not be large enough. I wouldn't think this would be an issue with only 18 in boards, but #5s are smoothing planes (if I remember correctly). You may want to try a jack plane (although, a 22 in jack plane on an 18 in board may be interesting....do take a picture so we can laugh at you :))</p></li>
<li><p>The blade itself has nicks? You mention in your comment that there's uneven bumps on the surface. Do you have plane tracks? If so, it might be that you don't have a <a href=""http://www.toolsforworkingwood.com/store/blog/269/title/How%20To%20Camber%20A%20Plane%20Iron%20%28And%20Why%20It%20Works%29"">camber</a>, too much of a camber, or nicks in the blade. </p></li>

"How can I minimize warp due to wood movement when gluing up a panel?","1503","","<p>I recently built a small 2' x 3' dresser top out of pine. It was within 1/8"" flat and level when I glued it up in the garage, but within a few weeks inside it had warped and buckled significantly. <strong>What techniques can I use to minimize the chance of this happening in
   my next project?</strong></p>

<p>Details on the project:</p>

<ul>
<li>I planed several 2x4's down to 6/4 (1.25"") thickness, and jointed
them with my router and a straight edge.</li>
<li>I checked the moisture content at the beginning of the project, and all the boards seemed to be a consistent 12% throughout. I even measured the middle with my pin contact moisture meter when I crosscut the boards to the 3' lengths.</li>
<li>I had a business trip partway through the project, and had to leave the unfinished table top sitting in the garage for two weeks. It was completely assembled/glued, but hadn't had stain or poly applied yet. When I got back, the warp had already occurred.</li>
<li>I alternated grain orientation on most boards, but I mistakenly put two next to each other with the convex side of the rings facing upwards. The warp is worst here, but there's still a bit of a wave on other parts of the dresser top.</li>
</ul>

<p>My thoughts for warp mitigation, and why I haven't tried them yet:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use narrower boards? (Not much of an option, since I was working with 2x4's to start with.)</li>
<li>Use hardwood? (I'm still a bit of an amateur, and I'd like to perfect my techniques with $10 worth of lumber, rather than wasting money on more expensive stock.)</li>
<li>Use quarter sawn boards? (See above reason.)</li>
</ul>

<p>So what am I missing? Which, if any, of the above options would be most effective to try first? Are there other techniques I can use to mitigate warp in my future panel glue ups?</p>
","<p>Is the humidity in your garage the same as the humidity in the room where the dresser is kept? You can start with a board with 0% moisture content, but regardless of the finish you put on it, it will take in moisture until it matches its environment. I know you can't always do this, but the best way to finish out the seasoning on your lumber is to put it in the room where it will used.<br/><br/>
If you're going to use flatsawn framing grade lumber, go through the pile and look for boards that came from the same slab as the pith. (Do not use a board containing the pith itself!) Looking at the board from the end grain, these will have almost straight, vertical grain. These boards are effectively quartersawn.<br/><br/>

"Embedded nut for using machine screws?","1499","","<p>Is there a kind of a nut or threaded insert that can be embedded in wood so that it will accept a machine screw?</p>
","<p><strong>Face mounting</strong><br>
A standard hex nut (or a square one if available) can be inlet into the surface of a board to accept a machine screw or bolt coming in from the other side.</p>

<p>Normally when face-mounted a hex-shaped hole is made, either by drilling the bulk of the waste out first with a suitable bit<sup>1</sup> and then finishing off with a chisel, or entirely by chiselling:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4XsR3.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4XsR3.jpg"" alt=""Hex nut inlet""></a></p>

<p>Square nuts obviously show their advantage here as the recess if much easier to cut out with a chisel. However, when using hex nuts some guides suggest it is better practice not to cut a hexagonal recess for them but instead to drill a hole the spanner size (i.e. the measurement across the flats) and then to force the nut into the hole<sup>2</sup>. </p>

<p>Note that these are intended to be mounted on the <em>opposite face of a board</em>, otherwise they would simply be pulled free as the screw force is applied. </p>

<p>Where you need to face mount on the front side of a board the solution is often T-nuts, which are hammered or forced into the wood. They won't win any awards for discretion or attractiveness so best used where they can't be seen or on utilitarian pieces:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Zc0E.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Zc0E.jpg"" alt=""T-nuts""></a></p>

<p>Note that T-nuts normally sit slightly proud of the surface as at A above, but can be mounted flush where needed by seating into a shallow drilled recess as at B.</p>

<p>Last but not least, threaded inserts:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/v6Pi9.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/v6Pi9.jpg"" alt=""Threaded inserts""></a></p>

<p>These are designed to thread into the wood usually but some only have flanges on the outside, not a thread. This type are either forced into a suitably sized hole or epoxied in place. If using epoxy be sure to thoroughly degrease the insert beforehand as they may retain some grease from manufacture.</p>

<p>Threaded inserts can be a bear to install straight, there are various tips to help and one of the standard ones uses a drill press as shown <a href=""http://www.popularwoodworking.com/techniques/q-installing-threaded-inserts"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> on Popular Woodworking.</p>

<p><strong>Cross mounting</strong><br>
Another way a standard nut can be used is to inset it from the side of a member, basically you cut a shallow (usually stopped) mortise that intersects the pre-drilled hole the screw/bolt will go through. This is used on bed frames and for the leg-to-stretcher joint on some workbenches and large tables or benches with knockdown construction.</p>

<p>Another option here is to use a wing nut:</p>

<p>For this same kind of mounting a barrel nut can be used instead and being cylindrical they simply slip into a drilled hole:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2zHqg.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2zHqg.jpg"" alt=""Barrel nut installation""></a></p>

<p>Barrel nuts tend to be much more expensive than you'd guess so expect some sticker shock.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> A Forstner is a good choice but a sharp spade/flat bit will do the job. If the spade bit has spurs on the outside edges the bottom of the hole won't be totally flat but it's not a problem.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Nuts can be forced in using clamp pressure, a vice or by using the screwing force of the nut and screw themselves. Another method, giving very good accuracy, is to use the drill press much as explained above in the Popular Woodworking link relating to threaded inserts.</p>

<p>Note that forcing nuts in can take considerable pressure, especially on hardwoods obviously, and this can over-stress a standard woodworking vice so caution is advised if you want to do it that way.</p>

"Will black walnut dull my carving tools","1475","","<p>I've recently been offered some black walnut lumber for free. As a wood carver who does all of his work by hand, I'm intrigued by getting the chance to work with black walnut, as it looks like a very beautiful wood (normally I just work with basswood).</p>

<p>The thing that does concern me though is the wood's hardness. I've never worked with it before, and was wondering if it would be a wood that could be worked by hand? And is it the type of wood that is going to dull my tools so that I'll need to resharpen them every few minutes if I do?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I've never worked with it before, and was wondering if it would be a wood that could be worked by hand?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, absolutely.  Black walnut isn't really all that hard of a wood, comparatively.  Looking at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janka_hardness_test"">Janka hardness testing</a>, black walnut is about 1010 pound-force.  By comparison, basswood is about 410 and purpleheart is 1860.</p>

<p>I would consider purpleheart very hard to carve.  Also, purpleheart is siliceous, meaning that it has silicon particles naturally present in the wood.  These dull tools fast.  Walnut, as far as I know, does not have these compounds.</p>

<p>Some tips from <a href=""http://www.woodmagazine.com/materials-guide/lumber/wood-species-1/black-walnut/?page=6"">WOOD Magazine</a> on carving walnut:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Walnut works best for sculptures and large figures with simple lines, or signs and relief carvings. If you do select walnut for a carving project, remember these tips:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Deep cuts along the grain may cause the wood to pop out.</li>
  <li>Walnut's grain varies from very open to almost closed, depending on where it grew. Each performs differently. Open-grain walnut carves easier. Closed-grain walnut may be more difficult to carve, but it takes a finer finish.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I find that black walnut machines very well with hand tools and will take a good finish.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And is it the type of wood that is going to dull my tools so that I'll need to resharpen them ever few minutes if I do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every few minutes?  Probably not, unless you're hogging out a ton of material very rapidly or your tools are made of crap steel.  With any carving, you'll have to touch up the tool edges with a strop once you notice they're cutting slower, but that's all part of the fun.  You'll have to hone more frequently than with basswood, but not to such an extent that it's annoying.</p>

<p>Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.  Take the wood!  Black walnut is one of my favorites, and even if you don't carve it, I'm sure you can find other uses for it.</p>

"Do I need to clean my miter and table saw after each use?","1474","","<p>A contractor told me that I need to clean wood dust from my table saw and miter saw after each use.

","<p>Although there are many instances in which you need to remove a standard or modular table saw blade guard, most cuts can be made with a riving knife installed. However, there are a few operations for which you must (or should) remove the riving knife:</p>

<ol>
<li>Raising the blade through a workpiece (e.g., when cutting the slot for a crosscut sled or zero-clearance insert)</li>
<li>Using a dado stack (the riving knife does not perform its duty and, in fact, will probably block your workpiece; for example, if installing an 8"" or 6"" dado stack along with a riving knife intended for a 10"" blade)</li>
<li>Cutting coves</li>
</ol>

<p>Also keep in mind that your riving knife must be approximately the same thickness as your blade. If you use a standard-kerf riving knife with a thin-kerf blade, your workpiece may be blocked by the riving knife or may pinch it, or may be pinched between the riving knife and fence. Conversely, if you use a thin-kerf riving knife with a standard-kerf blade, your riving knife will not be as effective at preventing kickback.</p>

"Do rip saws still have a place in the wood shop?","1467","","<p>40 years ago when I was first learning to work with wood, there were crosscut and rip saws, each used for their own purpose.  As I recall you could use a crosscut saw for either job. A rip saw could only be used for ripping wood.  I have just recently got back into working with wood, and I don't think I have seen a saw proclaiming it is one type or the other. </p>

","<p>Hand saws may never get used in a shop that turns out cabinets exclusively, but in most shops they have a wide variety of uses. Yes, there are specific rip and crosscut saws, but the woodworkers I know have mostly adopted Japanese style hand saws. A <strong>ryoba saw</strong> is a great tool to have around. It has crosscut teeth on one side and ripping teeth on the other. And the small oval shaped haft or handle allows very precise control. Most Japanese saws have an incredibly thin kerf which makes them easier to use as well.</p>

"What do I need to do to prepare wood for gluing?","1457","","<p>I would like to glue two pieces of pine together (at a right angle to eachother, flat sides together) using wood glue and nails. What do I need to do to prepare the wood?</p>
","<p>All you need to do to prepare wood for glueing is to 'clean' the surface. This can actually just be cleaning in the literal sense of the word since a wipe down with soapy water (followed by rinsing with clean water), or using one of a number of solvents, is sufficient in some instances.</p>

<p>But generally it's better practice to expose new wood. For wood already at its final dimensions a very light scraping or sanding is normal. </p>

<p>If you're going to use sanding just a few passes with med-fine paper (240-320 grit) would normally be sufficient, just enough skim off the surface. </p>

<p>This is why wood should be worked freshly prior to glueing:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C55Tu.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C55Tu.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><sup>Source: <strong>Wood as an Engineering Material</strong>, 10-4, a Forest Products Laboratory publication.</sup></p>

<p>In case it needs to be specified, <em>clamp firmly</em>. Good clamp pressure is what ensures a good bond, everything else being equal. Expect to have excess glue squeeze out of the joint, this is normal and indicates sufficient glue was applied initially.</p>

<p>From the comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wasn't sure if I should use nails or screws. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On wood as thin as this a glue-only joint will almost always be good enough. The glue bond should be strong enough that an attempt to pull the pieces apart will result in one or both splintering along the grain.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have to deal with end grain and side, but end is the smaller surface area and glue doesn't do well with ends according to brief research from earlier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>End grain doesn't bond as well as we'd like, but what is particularly weak is end grain/end grain joints. End grain to face grain can be much stronger than supposed and many sources have it wrong about how strong this can actually be in practice (as real-world tests demonstrate). If the end grain is sized prior to the final glue application it can glue much better, see <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/840/gluing-end-grain/851#851"">Gluing end-grain </a>.</p>

"Why S4S boards sold at Home Depot aren't straight?","1453","","<p>I am planing to build a picture frame with walnut. Since I am still very new to woodworking, I need boards which are as close as possible to the final dimension. I found a 1 in. x 2 in. x 8 ft. walnut board at Home Depot. This is a S4S board.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/Builder-s-Choice-1-in-x-2-in-x-8-ft-S4S-Walnut-Board-W16010208X/206201591"">http://www.homedepot.com/p/Builder-s-Choice-1-in-x-2-in-x-8-ft-S4S-Walnut-Board-W16010208X/206201591</a></p>

<p>I went to Home Depot and their boards are not straight. They have 4 ""smooth"" surfaces but are almost twisted... I would have expected a S4S board to have 4 smooth surfaces and to be straight. Am I correct? Is there something that can be done to straighten those boards?</p>
","<p>The boards <em>did</em> have 4 smooth surfaces, all perpendicular to each other, and were straight. That was when they came off the mill, though. Since then, they've been exposed to the elements, shipped to the store, handled, etc and nature has taken its course. Each board is different, which is why they all ""acclimate"" differently.</p>

<p>There are three main solutions </p>

<ol>
<li>Run the boards you get through a jointer and planer to straighten them as you would rough-sawn stock. This can be with hand or power tools. Generally not a solution for a beginner woodworker though, at least on the power tool side. </li>
<li>Spend some time at the store picking out the straightest, flattest, best-looking boards they have - going back multiple times or to different stores if necessary. I spent an hour at the big-box store looking for 1x boards for a project, and only wound up buying 10 or so. I looked at every single 1x3 and 1x4 they had, though.</li>
<li>Buy bigger boards than you need, but be less picky, and cut off the parts that are twisted, kinked, not flat, etc. Sometimes the majority of a board is great, but there's a big kink 18 inches from one end - just cut off that 18 inches and you're good to go.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, there is a 4th option, which may or may not be applicable, and that is to buy from a hardwood dealer. Many (most?) will mill for you (for an extra charge, of course; one near me charges an extra 50 cents per bf), so you can buy exactly what you need and get it S4S, ripped in half, whatever. Don't let it sit too long, though, or it will likely wind up just as warped as the stuff at the big-box store.</p>

<p>ETA: A 1x2x8 is about 1.4bf. Walnut at my local hardwood dealer is $5.00 per bf at the most (I don't remember exact prices), so you're looking at a total price of about $8, even with the milling. Compare that to the $25 that HD wants for the same board!</p>

"What are the main different types of ""hand drills""?","1449","","<p>I've seen hand drills that look like egg-beaters and I've seen hand drills that look like whirly-gig-a-thingys. Are there others?</p>

<p>What are the main different types of ""hand drills""?</p>
","<p>The drills you refer to as looking like egg beaters are in fact called eggbeaters by some people (precisely because of the resemblance). They are sometimes plainly called <strong>hand drills</strong>, as well as <strong>wheel braces</strong>.</p>

<p>Here's a Millers Falls hand drill (restored), revered as one of the best of its kind and still much sought after by woodworkers as well as by collectors:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tiRc1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tiRc1.jpg"" alt=""Miller&#39;s Falls eggbeater""></a></p>

<p>These are only suitable for drilling holes up to a fairly limited diameter, e.g 1/4"" or 6mm, and sometimes not in particularly hard or tough woods.</p>

<p>The other type you refer to is probably the <strong>brace</strong> or more fully the <strong>swing brace</strong>. These started out as all-wood affairs, then wood with brass or iron/steel banding and eventually evolved into the all-steel versions with a ratchet mechanism we're more familiar with today. Here's a fairly typical-looking modern one:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NWwYj.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NWwYj.jpg"" alt=""Larson swing brace""></a></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> unlike all other drills mentioned in this Answer that accept multiple bits, the swing brace can be the only one that can't be used with modern round-shaft bits. More modern braces can effectively grip a round shank, but traditionally the jaws in the chuck were made to grip a characteristic tapered-square enlargement at the base of the shaft, <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3330/what-drove-the-design-for-the-traditional-tang"">see illustration in previous Question</a>.</p>

<p>There is also the <strong>breast drill</strong>, some of which are like larger versions of the eggbeater with exposed wheels, but with two handles and breastplate. Others have enclosed mechanisms such as here:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CUsNM.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CUsNM.jpg"" alt=""Breast drill""></a></p>

<p>The enclosed mechanism on breast drills is sometimes merely the same wheel and pinions as on a hand drill, just protected from dust, but can on other models be something more complex and sophisticated, allowing more torque and multiple speeds.</p>

<p>Additional hand-powered drills that are still sometimes seen include the <strong>Archimedean drill</strong>, which developed into the <strong>push drill</strong> (sometimes generically referred to as the Yankee drill) which often has a reversing mechanism:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KpdRm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KpdRm.jpg"" alt=""Archimedean drill and push drill""></a></p>

<p>There are other small drills as well which have no mechanism at all and are just a bit of some sort set into a wooden handle, or held in a chuck of some type. Most drills like this are intended for small, shallow holes and are not commonly used in woodworking (in the West) but do have a place, e.g. in box making where the hinges can be fixed with very small screws.</p>

"How to cut an opening and door out of 3/4"" Plywood","1435","","<p>I want to cut a mostly rectangular hole out of a piece of 3/4"" plywood about 21"" wide by 32"" tall.  I would like the corners to be somewhat rounded (about a 1"" - 2"" radius), and I want to rehang the cut out section back in the main sheet as a door.  I know that I could simplify my life by cutting the door and the opening from separate pieces of plywood, but I'd like the grain to match which is why I want to reuse the cutout piece as the door.</p>

<p>What is a good way to go about making this cut keeping the straight parts parallel and the rounded parts clean and uniform to reduce the amount of reworking and cleanup needed to finish the job?</p>
","<p>There are generally speaking two ways people go about this kind of work these days, using a router or jigsaw. </p>

<p><strong>Router</strong></p>

<p>With the router you'd use a suitable straight-cutting bit with a bearing guide in conjunction with a template made from thinner material, running the bearing carefully around the inside perimeter of the template while being careful to avoid the router wandering into what will be the door. </p>

<p>A good material for the template would be 1/4"" (6mm) tempered hardboard, but thinner plywood or even solid wood could be used. The rounded corners of the opening would normally be drilled using a suitable bit, either a Forstner or a flat (spade) bit. A hole-saw could also be used if one of the right size is available.</p>

<p><strong>Jigsaw</strong></p>

<p>Internal jigsaw cuts are normally started in a drilled hole but some guides show a technique where you carefully plunge a suitable saw blade (with the saw running) into the material. With the latter technique in particular I would do some test cutting on scraps of your plywood to refine technique before committing to the final cut. Practice doing the curved cuts would also be advisable.</p>

<p>The radiused corners would generally be cut freehand with a jigsaw (working to a marked line obviously) and while you can cut the straight sides freehand as well you're more likely to ensure good results if you create a basic fence setup. </p>

<p>At the simplest this would just be four lengths of wood clamped at a suitable distance from the marked lines, this distance being the measurement from the side of the blade to the edge of the jigsaw's baseplate or 'shoe'.</p>

<p>In use the baseplate would then be carefully run along the edges of each of the boards to make the straight cuts, again being careful not to drift away from the edges into the door.</p>

<p>Note: if both faces of the plywood need to have the best surface possible then it's worth investing in a good blade made specially for clean cutting of plywood. Some blades give a good top surface, others a good bottom, but the best will give good results on both sides of the board (generally these will be <em>reverse-tooth blades</em>, where the teeth face downwards).</p>

"How can you safely operate a router table without a fence?","1433","","<p>I am now the proud owner of a used router and table. I am just getting ready to use it for the first time and was reading some emails and saw the following ad.</p>

<p><sup>Image from WoodPeck</sup></p>

<p>So almost all pictures I see of router tables have a fence or guard in play. In that picture they are not using a fence. I would think that the super fast moving blade would be a reason to have <em>something</em> for safety. </p>

<p>So can you operate the router, on a table, without a fence or guard safely? Assuming I can what, besides a fence, <em>can</em> I be using on the router table.</p>
","<p>The bit they are using in that picture has a bearing on the top part that is sticking out of the table (which is actually the bottom of the bit, because routers are inverted in a router table). Bits with bearings like that are safe to operate without a fence, because the bearing spins, acting as a guide as the stock is pushed along the bit. It doesn't matter which angle the stock approaches the bit from, because the bit is symmetrical, and as soon as the stock hits the bearing, the bit will not be able to cut any deeper.</p>

<p>The bit in the picture is known as a flush trim bit. In a router table, the bit can be used to trace a pattern. In the picture, the pattern is provided by the Woodpecker's jig. The curve of the jig will be cut into the work piece. As the work piece is pushed into the router, the bearing is pushed against the jig template. Because the cutting blade is flush with the bearing, the pattern the bearing rides against will be cut into the work piece.</p>

<p>If that is difficult to picture, it may be helpful to view a video of it being done. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTIWwOoMda4"">Here is one</a> I found on YouTube.</p>

<p>Bits without bearings generally require a fence to use. With no bearing, there is nothing controlling the depth of the cut. The fence does that for you.</p>

<p>I applied oil until the wood wouldn't soak it up any more.
After that I let it sit for a few days with puddles of oil on the surface.</p>

<li>Can I get the surface permanently smooth by sanding and applying oil

","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don't know if this was the application method recommended on the tin but this is the wrong way to oil wood. The correct application method is to apply a generous coating, let it sit for between 20 minutes to a couple of hours at most and then to wipe off every trace of excess from the surface with clean cloths or paper towels. When you're done the wood should no longer feel oily.</p>

<p>This needs to be repeated multiple times. A traditional oiled finish on wood is not a quick process because of the number of coats called for and the necessary 'drying' time. 15 or more coats would not have been unusual in the past and this took a very long time.</p>

<p>One traditional application regimen is:</p>

<p><em>""One coat per day for a week, one coat a week for a month, one coat per month for a year, then one coat per year for life.""</em></p>

<p>Most people don't have the time or patience for this today, but you want to build up at least 4-7 coats and let them cure for good durability. So in addition to not building up coats there hasn't been sufficient time for the oil to 'dry' (oils of this type don't actually dry, they <em>cure</em> by a process called oxidative polymerisation). </p>

<p>But beyond that there is the fact that oiled finishes are actually not especially waterproof. Proper water-resistance is only provided by a film-building finish, for example a varnish.</p>

<p><strong>Safety note</strong><br>
Using a drying oil such as linseed oil you must take care to dispose of any oil-soaked rags or paper properly. They are a significant fire hazard as they don't need an ignition source, if left wadded up they can spontaneously combust.</p>

<p>So either dry flat on the floor (once dry they are no longer a combustion risk), or put into a suitable metal or glass container with plenty of water.</p>

"What to do with a mineral-oil finished desktop","1417","","<p>I recently finished an oak butcherblock desk with mineral oil.

","<blockquote>
  <p>Could I refinish it by simply applying a drying oil (tung or linseed) over the mineral oil? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The standard answer to this on woodworking forums would be no, but in reality it might work acceptably. However, it's likely to compromise the ability of the drying oil to 'dry' properly, and this effect will be permanent, so it's safer to work to remove as much of the mineral oil as possible before applying any other finish. </p>

<p>Since mineral oil, like all oils, is easily soluble in mineral spirits (UK: white spirit) it can be used to rinse a lot of the oil from the surface wood fibres.</p>

<p>You'll want to use generous quantities of spirits and plenty of fresh cotton rags or paper towels to soak up liquid, perhaps doing three rinses and wipe-downs and then leaving the table to dry. </p>

<p>The next day check that the surface looks fairly uniformly de-greased and locally treat any areas that still look wetted with oil. </p>

<p><strong>Safety note:</strong> normally the fumes from spirits are not a big deal but we're not usually using them in quite this quantity so if possible do this job outside. If that's not feasible work in the most well-ventilated place possible; a garage with the door wide open would be good if available. Even after the rags/paper are bagged up and thrown away the table itself will give off a lot of vapour as it's drying out so you wouldn't want to leave it in any room you're using for another purposes.</p>

<p>Once the cleaning is complete you can apply the drying oil of your choice. It won't hurt to thin an amount of the oil with spirits for the first couple of coats; a 1:1 dilution works well. My recommendation for the oil would be BLO over tung oil as it makes the wood look better faster, is easier to get and costs less.</p>

<p>Incidentally you can also use varnish, or an oil/varnish blend, to provide better durability and water-resistance.</p>

<hr>

<p>Incidental point on wood removal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or would I need to completely sand off the layer of wood that soaked up the mineral oil before refinishing it? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the average home woodworker sanding should really be the method of last resort to remove a layer of wood from a large flat area, it's generally only a good method where there is access to a wide-belt sander. When working at home if you're thinking of taking off a layer of wood your first thoughts should be <em>plane</em> or <em>scraper</em>, both of which are faster and more efficient than sanding and produce much less fine airborne dust.</p>

The letters will be in storage for most of the year only coming out when we have recruitment activities at the beginning of each quarter. I was wondering what is the best kind of wood and thickness to use for this project. </p>

<p>I have a bit of experience in wood working but this is my first time undertaking a project of my own. Right now this project is just in the planning stages. I need to propose a budget before I can move forward and make more solid designs but I am looking to create letters that look similar to this photo: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eswk3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eswk3.jpg"" alt=""wooden letters""></a></p>

<p>Our letters are Lambda Sigma Gamma.  I will also need to make stands for the letters, especially the Gamma. </p>
","<p>If you're looking for weather-resistant and lightweight, you can't do much better than cedar for the wood choice.  Cedar also has a good strength-to-weight ratio, making it very sturdy.  For thickness, using 2x material (i.e., 2x4, 2x6, 2x8, etc.) is probably ok given your letter sizes.  Bear in mind that cedar usually has somewhat of a premium in price over other woods you'd get at a big box store.</p>

<p>A bit less expensive of an option would be pressure-treated dimensional pine boards, which also come in 2x thickness.  These will be heavier than the cedar but should have similar weather-resistance and sturdiness at a lower cost.</p>

<p>Based on the link you provided, you might be looking at using plywood for the letters.  Pressure-treated (exterior-grade) plywood is available, which will fit the weather-resistance bill.  However, I would advise backing the plywood with a frame of 2x material to keep it from bending when wet.</p>

<p>You state that these are going to be used for your recruitment booth.  Are they going to be kept outside for long term (i.e., months or years)?  If so, you'll want to consider using a waterproof glue such as <a href=""http://www.titebond.com/product.aspx?id=e8d40b45-0ab3-49f7-8a9c-b53970f736af"">Titebond III</a> and/or <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=cedar%20strength-to-weight&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8#safe=off&amp;q=coated%20deck%20screws"">coated deck screws</a> for assembly.  This will ensure that it stays together for the long haul as compared to less robust glue and fasteners.</p>

"How do I look for a table saw blade with non-angled teeth?","1401","","<p>I'm thinking about building <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgyQJ8ZaXpY"" rel=""nofollow"">this box joint jig</a> so I can make my joints with a single blade (rather than having to pull out my dado set). The problem is that I've got one of them fancy Freud blades that has angled teeth (adjacent teeth are pointed in a different direction). It makes great, clean, quiet cuts, but for non-through cuts, it leaves a little ridge.</p>

<p>I know they make tablesaw blades that don't have the angle on their teeth, but I can't find identify where it's listed online whether it's angled or not. Is there a generic name or description for this type of blade?</p>
","<p>You want to pay attention to the type of tooth grind, which describes how the individual teeth are shaped. <a href=""http://vermontamerican.com/article/circular-saw-blade-anatomy-grind-types/"">Vermont American</a> has a good resource for types of grinds. Any grind combination with at least one flat tooth should give you a flat-bottomed cut.</p>

<p>So good candidates would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flat Top Grind (often used for ripping)</li>
<li>Triple Chip Grind (for hard, abrasive materials)</li>
<li>Multipurpose Carbide Tip (ripping, crosscutting)</li>
<li>Tri-Grind (general combination grind)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your best bet is likely a Flat Top Grind, since there are no angled teeth that may protrude above the height of the flat teeth. Many ripping blades are FTG, so just check the description prior to buying.</p>

"Are there specific types of screws I should use for woodworking?","1394","","<p>I'm wondering what types of screws I should use for woodworking and what types I shouldn't be using as well. </p>

<p>For example, Are deck screws OK? What about a square head vs. Phillips? Does the type of metal/construction of the screw matter?</p>
","<p>Just to get it out of the way, this is the conventional/traditional wood screw:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YFoVY.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YFoVY.jpg"" alt=""Trad wood screw""></a></p>

<p>In the past it would always have been flat-head (now also called slot-head), and as a result when making a piece in a traditional style many woodworkers will insist on using flat-head screws so they look the part.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there specific types of screws I should use for woodworking?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, yes. But which type to pick is often on a project-by-project basis. While there are screws that were not originally intended for use in wood that are OK to use for specific purposes (when used appropriately, e.g. machine screws in jigs or tools), there are most definitely a few screws you <em>shouldn't</em> use in woodworking, and drywall screws top that list. Some people value them because they're sharp and drive well in the wood they're using, or for their black colour. But they are too brittle for woodworking in general and should never be used ideally.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are deck screws OK? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For decks, sure. </p>

<p>But you need more detail than that :-) How they are intended to be used in that application is a big factor in how they <em>should</em> be used. Decking is, like most exterior woodworking, sort of an extension of rough carpentry. In any project in a similar vein they can be a good choice. Although they can of course be used indoors they're not the fastener of choice for interior use and particularly for furniture pieces other screws should be preferred (many of which would be cheaper anyway).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What about a square head vs. Phillips? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and yes. Point to remember, these are not screw types, these are just head styles. A great many different types of screws can have either kind of head.</p>

<p>Square-drive screws — which I feel we should call <a href=""http://www.robertsonscrew.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Robertson screws</a> to give due credit to its inventor, even if we're not Canadian — are a particularly good screw because the square shoulders are very strong and resistant to stripping. Also on a practical level the tight fit of the driver to the screw can be good enough that the screw can hold securely on an unmagnetised bit, aiding single-handed driving. This is a particularly good head style I think and it's a shame it's not more common; possibly the only reason they're not more widely used worldwide is that when invented manufacturing wasn't capable of producing the screw strongly enough in a cost-effective manner.</p>

<p>Phillips screws (sometimes referred to generically as <em>cross-head</em>) have a long track record and can work fine but are now a bit outmoded, with the PoziDriv (Pozi for short) screw being an improved version. One general principle with screws that any good guide will emphasise, that the driver should be carefully size-matched to the screw, is particularly important with Phillips screws. While you can use both a slightly undersize or oversize screwdriver with a Phillips-head screw (they'll both seem to fit well enough) there is a great potential for the shoulders to round over when the driver 'cams out' and if you do this just a few times the screw can strip completely. In a somewhat similar vein PoziDriv screwdrivers should <em>never</em> be used on Phillips-head screws.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does the type of metal/construction of the screw matter?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, very much so but this is too broad a question to go into much detail so I'll just randomly pick a few salient points. </p>

<p><strong>Brass screws</strong><br>
Brass crews are considered a must for use with brass hinges and other brass fittings. Where steel screw are used, they stick out like a sore thumb visually and just give a cheaper appearance. </p>

<p>Brass screws must <em>always</em> go into pre-drilled holes, even in softwoods, or there is a great risk they'll snap when being driven in. In hardwoods in particular it is also good practice to drive in an exactly matching steel screw before driving the brass screw, so that the stronger steel screw can thread the hole and reduce the strain on the brass. Manufacturers of good brass hardware like Brusso will supply a steel screw in every pack of brass screws for exactly this purpose. </p>

<p>Even with this, some people use an extra security measure and lubricate the brass screw, using wax (just a candle will do), soap (any hard bar) or an oil or fat (e.g. lard or tallow, both used historically). Despite the steel screw being stronger it can be a good idea to lubricate it as well, particularly since it has to be driven in and removed multiple times.</p>

<p>Note: these days with the increasing cost of brass ""brass screws"" may not be solid brass but brass-plated steel. So while there's the potential for the brass plating on the head to be scratched off, they are stronger.</p>

<p><strong>Exterior applications</strong><br>
For exterior use, all screws and bolts should have a rust-resistant coating of one kind or another, or be made from stainless steel.</p>

<p><strong>Conventional screw use</strong><br>
The traditional use of a screw was to fasten a board to another board, often to its edge, so one board is considered the thin board and the second the thick board (even when they are in fact the same thickness of material). And in this application there are some rules of thumb. The length of the screw should be approximately three times the thickness of the thin board being fixed. Older guides (early-20th century and before) often state that the pilot hole should be deeper than needed so that the screw doesn't 'bottom out', but modern guides do not agree on this point and it's rarely done today, however, in particularly hard woods this can still be a good idea.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/H95qV.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/H95qV.jpg"" alt=""Wood screw, cross-section of hold""></a></p>

<p>In cross-section like this notice that the screw actually needs to go into two sizes of hole, the <em>pilot hole</em> we're all familiar with but a wider <em>clearance hole</em> in the first board. This drawing makes this clearer:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rUrFR.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rUrFR.jpg"" alt=""Wood screw clearance and pilot holes + countersink""></a><br>
Even where some of the threading on the screw remains in the thin board the idea is that it is not held there, which can lead to a problem called <em>bridging</em> where no matter how hard you drive the screw the gap between the boards won't fully close.</p>

<p><strong>Screws and end grain</strong><br>
Screws do not generally hold well in end grain. Where they must be driven into end grain you can 'toenail' or 'dovetail screw' them, that is, drive them in at a slight angle so that they partially bite into long grain. Another option is to glue in a dowel (preferably hardwood) in the path of the screw:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IJtvB.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IJtvB.jpg"" alt=""Dowel to secure screw in end grain""></a></p>

<p>Some very coarsely-threaded screws, e.g. lag screws, are considered to have so much hold that this isn't an issue but they tend to be used where a very firm and reliable hold is needed and it's worth going the extra mile and adding the dowel. Or alternatively switching to a bolt and barrel nut, as show in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1451/what-type-of-joint-should-i-use-for-building-a-piece-of-furniture-that-will-be-a/1459#1459"">this previous Answer</a> or a conventional nut and bolt as shown in the first illustration <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2524/design-considerations-for-a-machinists-work-bench/2526#2526"">here</a>.</p>

"Crosscutting 18"" diameter logs by hand","1362","","<p>I tried my hand at crosscutting a beefy 18"" log with a relatively low tooth-per-inch bowsaw today. I eventually made it all the way through, but not without cutting V-slices into the wood to give the blade breathing room and prevent it from constantly jamming, especially as I got into the heartwood. I should also mention that it took me <strong>forever</strong>.</p>

<p>Am I missing something here? I wonder if I used the right tool or if I should have been hammering in wedges or something. Should I have just used an axe?</p>

<p>(Hand-tool related answers only please – not interested in using chainsaws for various reasons.)</p>

<p><strong>More details:</strong>
The log I was cutting was green. The bow saw has no set and was brand new.</p>
","<p>I suspect the issue here is with the bowsaw blade not having enough <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/927/what-is-the-purpose-of-a-saw-set"">'set'</a> to the teeth. </p>

<p>The 'set' of the teeth on a saw blade is how far to either side the teeth are bent out from the main body of the blade, which makes the width of the cut wider and gives the body of the blade some clearance in the saw groove (kerf).</p>

<p>Some bowsaw blades have no set (referred to as zero set); from what I understand bowsaw blades of this type are intended to cut <em>green</em> wood, that is wood that is still very fresh and still quite wet. So if you were cutting a seasoned or even part-dried log the blade would naturally struggle.</p>

<p>If the teeth have set it may just not be enough for the type of cut you were doing, the depth of cut specifically. </p>

<p>One good general aid to a saw binding in the kerf is to wax the blade. The simplest way to do this is quickly swipe a block or wax or the butt of a candle along the saw. This can make a remarkable amount of difference.</p>

<p>Keeping the cut open with wedges as you ask about might also be beneficial. It certainly can't hurt to try.</p>

<p>This isn't what you asked about but you might want to stop right there. You will likely run into problems if you glued solid wood firmly to a dimensionally stable material like plywood. Some allowance for <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/908/what-general-considerations-do-i-need-to-take-into-account-for-wood-movement"">seasonal movement</a> must be made or the wood will strain against the glue and can crack itself free or will bow or otherwise warp the board.</p>

<p>I'll edit this out later if the situation is not how I'm visualising it but I wanted to give you the headsup in case it is, as this takes precedence over filling gaps.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do I use a mix of wood glue and cherry wood dust? Should I just fill with wood filler? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes :-) People do both very widely. Neither is perfect but both work acceptably well.</p>

<p><strong>Wood dust and glue</strong><br>
When you mix conventional wood glue (PVA type, yellow or white doesn't matter) with the wood dust of the same species you will nearly always end up with a fill that is darker than the surrounding wood. The result is similar to the colour of finished end grain, so quite significantly darker.</p>

<p>I don't know why it is so commonly stated that this is ""a good colour match"" because it's not. You <em>can</em> get a good colour match if you are using hide glue, but obviously that's not the glue most modern woodworkers are using and many guides saying they're getting a good colour match aren't either.</p>

<p>Epoxy is worth trying, you can get a slightly better result using epoxy instead of PVA (slightly). It does allow you to progress much faster since most epoxies set hard enough to be worked well under the time a normal glue + wood dust mixture dries out, and the texture is usually smoother and more uniform. This is something I think is worth experimenting with, especially for larger voids, but with those I think they should be made a decorative feature and no attempt should be made to match the wood colour (I often go with a very dark brown or black).</p>

<p>Superglue or CA can also be used for some fills, but again, expect them to be darker. I use this myself sometimes for hairline cracks but I don't think it's really suitable for larger voids, in part because of the very fast 'drying' time. Such fills would also be very brittle which may be an issue the larger they get.</p>

<p><strong>Wood filler</strong><br>
Commercial paste wood filler can work well, especially when you are not staining the wood (they don't tend to stain well). But be aware fillers vary widely in type and qualities, and it may be difficult to find one of just the right colour. But most can have their colour tweaked using dry pigments or with a little of a suitable paint (acrylic for waterbased filler, oil or enamel paint for oil-based) if you're up for some experimentation. </p>

<p>Note that wood fillers can, similar to end grain, go a little darker once the finish goes on. If the change is not too pronounced it's not a big deal, it is commonly advised to make fills slightly darker. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What's the best way? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As usual, there is no one best. There are a multitude of opinions on what makes the best type of wood filler and professional woodworkers and finishers each have their preferences, sometimes based on the species and final finish more than having a single way they will always use. </p>

<p>In addition to the options above people use a wide range of shop-made filler concoctions, at the more modern end of the spectrum spackle or drywall compound with wood dust and some commercial filler, and at the old-school traditional end linseed oil, wax and various resins coloured with dry pigments, softened using heat or with the addition of some turpentine.</p>

<p>Also at the traditional end but commercially made are <strong>shellac or wax fillers</strong>. Neither of these may be easily available to you but some people swear by them. Both can be melted into defects e.g. using a soldering iron, and then levelled off with careful scraping. Again these would traditionally be applied to the finished wood, allowing for a more accurate match of the colour of the surrounding wood. </p>

"Are there any tips when working a large surface with an handheld electric planer?","1332","","<p>A friend got me an electric hand held planer that he thought I could use to help clean pallet boards faster then what I was doing. For the most part it has sat in the box. Until recently though when I started using it to clean boards edges. </p>

<p>I have several 2x12 pine boards that I wanted to get the paint of off and preferred hand tool / muscle methods but I found myself losing patience when I realized the amount of work involved when looking at the pile (I should not care so much for pine). So I thought about giving my hand held planer a try.</p>

<p>It worked very well for getting the paint off and I checked the blades frequently to be sure they were not getting clogged or gummed (they were not in any case). I was having a huge issue keeping the work relatively flat. No matter how hard I tried the planer would be at some sort of angle and cut into wood on one side more that the other (usually the side opposite of me).</p>

<p>So I have a clean board now but it looks like ass. At least now I know that I can put it through a thickness planer with less worry. </p>

<p>Any thoughts as to what I was doing wrong or ignoring that what I should be doing right? It might not be the right tool for the job but it is what was available. I had it set <em>very</em> low so as to not burn it out and took many passes and moved onto the next section (that in itself might have been the issue).</p>
","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It sounds to me like this may be due to a combination of factors, the first is just one of technique, something that will improve with practice and experience. Hand-held planers are powerful, like belt sanders, and just like them they can run away from you if not held right. That might be better expressed as they <em>will</em> run away from you if not held right!</p>

<p>You may have been trying to take off too much on each pass which would be a critical factor if that's the case. Even at a low speed the bite into the wood will make control difficult. Unlike a belt sander, with a planer you can control the projection of the blades and because they're so effective having them set to remove the smallest amount possible (equivalent to 0.1mm?) will make it most controllable. </p>

<p>In terms of technique I think you should be trying to have the planer 'take off' at the end of each pass, like a plane lifting off from the end of a runway. This is even good practice with a hand plane, and I seem to recall when watching experienced users wielding planers that they do this at each stroke. It contributes to the fatigue of using them as you're lifting with arms extended, but that can't be helped.... probably a good reason they shouldn't be used heavily by the amateur woodworker.</p>

<p>One other thing, it's not clear if you were planing along the boards or across (not just at 90°, even at an angle) and this may also be a factor. If you were planing across that will account for some of the difficulty I'm sure. Cross-grain planing is <em>much</em> easier that planing along the grain, something noticeable even with a hand plane.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It might not be the right tool for the job but it is what was available. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The right tool <em>is</em> often the one that's available :-) </p>

<p>But this may be a good illustration of why planers aren't the ideal tool for smoothing larger surfaces. They're great at removing wood quickly, especially from edges narrower than the cutter head, but they shouldn't be expected to produce a good flat, smooth-ish surface as if you'd dressed the board with a jack plane.</p>

<hr>

<p>Mentioning the jack just above brings to mind another thing, if you were cross-grain planing it should be expected that the surface isn't great after that step. When flattening a board by hand all cross-grain work, whether by scrub plane or jack plane, is further flattened out by planing along the grain afterwards. </p>

<p>It's only that last step that produces a decently flat surface, which is then taken closer to finished with a try or jointer plane before final smoothing. </p>

<p>In your situation this planing along the grain to flatten off should be done by handing off to your thicknesser as you did, so within reason you should expect the board to look rough before it goes into the thicknesser, which will combine jointing and smoothing operations in one.</p>

<li>Maybe the wood is actually riding up over the blade? That doesn't make a lot of sense to me, as that is more like what happens in a climbing cut. I tried several things to get a more consistent joint, including making sure the pressure was as even as I could get it on each pass, and it helped a little but still had a lot of variation between passes.</li>
<li>Maybe the board itself has inconsistencies in height, causing it to engage the cut at different angles? That doesn't make a lot of sense either, because the cuts seem fairly consistent through a single cut. They only seem to vary between cuts. But I did try planing the board before cutting the joint to see if that helped with consistency. It didn't seem to make any difference.</li>
<li>Maybe my expectations are off and this is just what I should expect to get out of a stacked dado set?</li>

<li>This seems to be a lot more variation than I can use as-is in a lap joint. If I were to glue it up like this, my gut tells me I'd be compromising the strength of the joint. Is this true?</li>

<li>How do I fix it?</li>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>LeeG suggested that accumulating sawdust might be the problem. I made several changes to my setup, and it seems to have done the trick. I replaced the fence I'd been using with a much straighter board, and I cut a rabbet at its base for dust relief. I made sure to keep the surface of the table saw as free from sawdust as I could between each pass. The changes seem to have worked. The cuts are much more consistent between passes now.</p>
","<p>The chippers in the stack may vary in height.  You can test for that by making a single pass and see if it is smooth.  If the chippers are ok, then it is likely technique.</p>

<p>Make sure you are holding the work piece down tightly against the table on each pass and make sure there is no sawdust accumulating under it.</p>

<p>If you have some uneven joints, you can clean them up by sliding the work piece side to side over the blade.  This will help remove the high spots.  You can also clean it up with a hand plane.  You can eliminate the entire problem by using a tenoning jig and making the cuts vertical.  </p>

"Wood with good thermal insulation","1329","","<p>Are all types of wood similar with respect to their ability to conduct heat or are some types better than other?</p>

<p>1/2"" plywood doesn't really do a good job of keeping heat in and cold out, at least not compared to double-paned glass.</p>

<p>The A/Cs themselves are a good insulator and all gaps are well-sealed.</p>
","<p>The answer depends on which wood species are available to you.  With that being said, you can easily calculate it yourself with a formula and the wood database.</p>

<h1>Theory</h1>

<p>You can calculate the R value of any specific wood; you need to know the moisture content (MC) and the specific gravity (S).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>R = 1 / (S * (1.39 + 0.028 * MC) + 0.165)</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Example</h1>

<p><a href=""http://www.wood-database.com/lumber-identification/softwoods/eastern-white-pine/"">Eastern White Pine</a> has an S = 0.4 @ 12% MC, so you get:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>R = 1 / (0.4 * (1.39 + 0.028 * 12) + 0.165) = 1.17</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.wood-database.com/lumber-identification/hardwoods/hard-maple/"">Hard Maple</a> has an S = 0.71 @ 12% MC, so you get:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>R = 1 / (0.71 * (1.39 + 0.028 * 12) + 0.165) = 0.72</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In comparison, air has an R of 6.25 and concrete of 0.13.  (Bigger is the better insulator)</p>

<h1>In Short</h1>

<p>You just have to find which one has the lowest specific gravity and make sure it stays as dry as possible once installed.</p>

"How to deal with wood expansion when combining with a steel frame?","1325","","<p>Are there good general techniques to deal with wood expansion when combining it with a steel frame?  For the sake of argument, say we're building a metal and wood box where the metal comprises the frame of the box, but the wood comprises the panels (and assume that we're not using plywood or some sort of expansion resistant composite.)  How do we attach the wood to the steel in such a way where expansion isn't a problem?  With pure wood, we could cut a slot and float the panel, but I'm not sure what the extension of this to steel is.  Adding a slot to welded square tubing seems difficult.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>With pure wood, we could cut a slot and float the panel, but I'm not sure what the extension of this to steel is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You're on track with the slot, but not quite in the way you're describing here.</p>

<p>First, you would drill a regular circular hole in the steel corners.  Then, you make a slotted <em>hole</em> in the wooden panel.  This slot would be perpendicular to the grain orientation of the wood, similar to the image below, but not that long.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OeGvG.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OeGvG.jpg"" alt=""Slot""></a><br></p>

<p>In your case, you would only slot the hole enough to account for the expected expansion and contraction of the panel.  This will vary by species and the total width of the panel.  For ""regular"" box sizes, I would think that expanding the slot 1/8"" to either side would be acceptable.  For example, if you had a 1/4"" diameter hole in the steel corner for the fastener, you would make a 1/4"" dia. by 1/2"" long slot in the panel.</p>

<p>Then you would use a bolt to fasten the panel to the corner and make it snug tight.  I would suggest <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyloc_nut"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">nylock nuts</a>, using a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_nut"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jam nut</a>, or <a href=""http://www.loctiteproducts.com/p/t_lkr_blue/overview/Loctite-Threadlocker-Blue-242.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">thread locker</a> on a regular bolt to keep the bolts from loosening over time.</p>

<blockquote>

"Making safe cuts: Sliding miter saw vs Radial-arm saw","1322","","<p>In multiple questions (<a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2548/is-there-a-certain-way-to-cut-a-2-thickness-piece-of-wood-on-the-miter-saw/2549#2549"">this is one</a>) having to do with sliding miter saws, we have been admonished how to correctly make cuts - to wit: with the motor off, pull the saw outward, push the saw down, turn on the motor, push the saw forward, turn off the motor.  This is described as the safe way and even shows up in instructions provided by manufacturers.</p>

<p>Now, when I use my radial arm saw, I pretty much do the opposite, to wit: setup the cut, turn on the motor, pull the saw outward, push the saw back, turn off the motor. I think this is the safe way to do it - have made thousands of cuts without mishap and I'm sure it's the accepted procedure.</p>

<p>So my question is: why is the safe way to make the miter saw cut to push, and for the radial arm saw to pull?  </p>

<p>In both cases the blade is turning the same direction and on both saws the cut board is against a fence.</p>
","<p>You are, indeed, using your radial arm saw correctly, but it's important to note the critical differences between the two tools.</p>

<p>In both cases, you would be making a <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/2015/49"">climb cut</a> when pulling the blade toward you.  A climb cut is generally less safe because the blade literally tries to ""climb"" over the wood as it pulls itself into and over the wood.  If you are not used to using a radial arm saw, it can be difficult to control and can pull itself toward you faster than you may expect, especially if the blade's teeth have a positive hook.</p>

<p>Using a blade with a <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/2017/49"">negative hook angle</a> makes a climb cut easier to control.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So my question is: why is the safe way to make the miter saw cut to
  push, and for the radial arm saw to pull?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's start with the second part of that question--simply put, it is impractical to use the radial arm saw any other way. First, you cannot easily raise the blade over the workpiece.  Second, it pushes the workpiece down into the table. The blade's ability to climb over the workpiece is limited by the fact that the blade's height cannot be raised accidentally in the middle of a cut on a properly set up saw. To make a cut with a radial arm saw by pushing the blade instead of pulling it toward you, you would need to pull the blade toward you, position your workpiece behind it, and clamp the workpiece down (to prevent the saw from potentially lifting it off the table).</p>

<p>In contrast, a sliding miter saw does have the ability to raise the blade over your workpiece. However, it does not have any feature to lock its blade down at a fixed height, allowing it even more climbing ability if used to make a climb cut rather than following the recommended procedure.</p>

","<p>There are 4 ways I am currently aware of to turn the bottom of a bowl.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Turn it first, in this case you need to leave a Rabbet or a tenon for chucks to clamp on/in so that you can turn the bowl around and hollow out the inside.  This leaves the tenon or rabbet, and there could be tool marks left from the chuck.(alternately you can glue a piece of 'waste' wood on the bottom and use screws to attach it to a faceplate still might need clean up after removing the waste wood)</p>

<p>After hollowing out the bowl, there will likely be a tenon or rabbet and quite possibly some ugly tool marks, or the tenon might be damaged. (or you just want to remove the tenon/rabbet for aesthetics. That's where the next 3 come in.</p></li>
<li><p>Flat jaws - you can buy Flat jaws for many/most chucks out there and these are very useful.  They can clamp down or expand out to hold the rim of a bowl.  The uprights that hold the bowl are rubber coated screws so they won't mar or damage the edge of the bowl.  The screws can be placed at different distances to accommodate different size works.  Some of the jaws have some variable slots to help hold oblong bowls (likely from some warping). The larger chucks tend to have angled nubs to help grip the bowls.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hxDsr.jpg"" alt=""PSI flat jaws"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/x3Y6w.jpg"" alt=""One Way Large flat jaws""></p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Vacuum chucks - these use an air compressor to create a vacuum holding a piece onto the chuck.  It needs a good seal so holes in the work will preclude this as an option, even porous wood might not work, though finishing the inside of bowl can overcome porous material.  This is especially good for working on bowl and things with an uneven edge or a 'natural' edge bowl which won't work with flat jaws.  In my experience this should mostly be used for finishing work, and not to try and turn the whole outside.  Too heavy of cuts and the bowl will pop off, possibly getting damaged in the process.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pkGmT.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li><p>Jam chucks - </p>

<p>a. This is where a chuck such as the vacuum head of the Vacuum chuck (or other hand made ones) are used to 'push' the bowl against, using the tailstock to hold the piece against it.  This lets you turn most of the bottom other than a small piece around the tailstock with can be cleaned up easily with a chisel and some sand paper.</p>

<p>b. The other is to create an insert that fits the piece perfectly and is actually 'jammed' on the chuck like a hat on your head.  The friction will keep it there.  Once again this is generally for finishing work.  Jam chucks are always usable and certainly cover where the other two types fail.</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where possible, I'd like to avoid buying lots of different stains and mixing them by trial and error.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm afraid with this sort of thing generally it's <em>not</em> possible without some experimentation. Even if you were matching a fairly commonplace wood there's no guarantee a product of the right name will give the colour you want. Real-world example here: trying to match some vintage English oak it's clear a commercial English Oak stain is completely the wrong sort of colour (too red), but with a little experimentation it is discovered that an initial coat of Pine followed by two coats of Old Oak, the first wiped off after application, worked perfectly.</p>

<p>So, this kind of thing will usually require buying a few different stains and then trying various combos, <em>along with your final finish</em>; these are called ""test boards"" or ""test strips"". As you can see from the image below you must test with the final finish as there can be a significant deepening of tone after the clear finish goes on, and with oil-based varnishes also a slight yellowing, both of which obviously need to be factored in to the final colour. </p>

<p>Or to put it another way, if you got a dead-on colour match with stains alone it would no longer match after applying most finishes (exceptions would be some waterbased polys and a light application of lacquer).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cP3AX.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cP3AX.jpg"" alt=""Stain and varnish test strips""></a></p>

<p>There are additional challenges here, trying to match a softwood with hardwoods.</p>

<p><strong>Softwood v. hardwood</strong><br>
Pine is a softwood, so has very characteristic light and dark banding which hardwoods don't have. The lighter parts (the earlywood or springwood) is soft and absorbent, while the darker wood (the latewood or winterwood) is much harder and non-absorbent. </p>

<p>What this means in practical terms is that the light wood gets much darker than the dark wood when a stain goes on, at worst giving an effect called <em>grain reversal</em>, where what was the darker grain ends up lighter.</p>

<p><strong>Blotching</strong><br>
Pine is a blotch-prone wood, and as such you need to treat the wood prior to stain going on to help achieve a smoother colouring, a process called sizing in the old days. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CGKOp.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CGKOp.jpg"" alt=""Blotching and grain reversal on pine""></a></p>

<p>The usual recommended solution for blotching these days is to use a commercial ""pre-stain conditioner"", but diluted shellac or thinned varnish do the job as well or better for far less money. An additional advantages of using thinned varnish is that you can use the same product that you've already bought to use as your final finish, so no need to buy yet one more thing. </p>

The glue has been dried for about a week now and I'm noticing that the sides of the table are bowing downward about 1/4"" on each side. Is there a good way that I can stabilize the table top from underneath to fix/prevent the bowing? </p>

<p>For your reference, this is the design I created and am using for this project.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vQWq5.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vQWq5.png"" alt=""Table Design""></a></p>
","<p>The ideal 'fix' for this is probably to saw the table apart (yes I know, *gulp*) and flip a few of the boards over, </p>

<p>But going with what you have, two very traditional methods that were used to help keep tabletops flat were screwing the top to battens on the underside and breadboard ends. As a solution to your current obviously the first is more easily adopted of course so that's what I'll describe.</p>

<p>Your design may already incorporate boards that run across the shorter dimension of the table that the legs attach to, in which case those can probably be used for this. Although you may wish to attach additional battens given that bowing has already occurred.</p>

<p>It's not as simple as just driving screws through boards that run across the width of a tabletop. You need to account for what's generally described by the catch-all phrase <em>seasonal wood movement</em> (sometimes shortened just to the even-less-useful <em>wood movement</em>). This specifically refers to expansion and contraction of wood across the grain which on a wide tabletop can amount to a fairly significant dimensional change, e.g. 10-12mm or just under 1/2"". Note that expansion along the grain is so small it can safely be ignored. For a little more detail on movement please see more in this previous Question, <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/908/what-general-considerations-do-i-need-to-take-into-account-for-wood-movement"">What general considerations do I need to take into account for wood movement?</a>. </p>

<p>So in this case you would enlarge the screw holes on each end of the battens, or in your existing front-to-back boards if there are any, so that the screws in those positions can move back and forth as needed during dimensional changes during the year. </p>

"How to properly sharpen a Forstner bit?","1283","","<p>I need to sharpen some Forster bits, which are made of steel. What is best to be used and is there a proper way of doing it? Some people use sandpaper and others say diamond. Could I use the sandpaper on this or am I better off with using my diamond files?</p>
","<p>I don't think you can sharpen a Forstner bit accurately enough with abrasive paper. Even if you glue it to a small slips of wood to make rudimentary files from it these won't be particularly stiff so may not give you the accuracy you'd want to properly sharpen a bit, where as much as possible you want to maintain the existing geometry of the factory grind. It is possible in theory however.</p>

<p>The traditional tool for sharpening bits is a type of file, although with Forstners a round slipstone was often a necessary addition to tackle the bevel on the curved rim. </p>

<p>These days in place of a round slipstone many use a conical burr chucked in a pillar drill or a Dremel-type tool, or any similar handpiece. And for the flats a small slipstone can also be used, but it's commonly done today with a fine diamond paddle. </p>

<p>Although bits are usually made of tool steel they're not generally hardened to the same level as other cutting tools so can usually be comfortably cut with a steel file, just as with augur bits used with a brace. </p>

<p>Consequently the whole job can in theory be done just with files, a set of needle files being sufficient as long as they're of decent quality.... no guarantee of this today unfortunately! Price is not a reliable guide to quality with needle files, some cheap ones are well shaped and the toothing is cut well, while you'll read customer feedback on many files that cost more which indicates they can be neither. So I would recommend inspecting before you buy if at all possible. For a Forstner bit you'll need at least the round (rat-tail) and a flat or tapered file (the flat side of a half-round), and a triangular file may prove useful too. </p>

<p>If your bit is better made it may be hardened or made from a harder/tougher alloy such as HSS in which case they will probably not cut well enough with needle files so any of the alternatives will have to be used instead. It might seem obvious to use diamond needle files here, but IME many common diamond files are much too coarse for this job (150-300 grit, where you want something like 600 grit or finer).</p>

<p><strong>Method</strong><br>
Just as with augur bits you must be careful to sharpen only certain surfaces on a Forstner bit. The rule with large round bits like this is never to file the outside or circumference or you'll change the bit's size. While this is itself a problem there's more to it than that, it can also make the bit cut much less well and can lead to burning of the stock or worse, jamming, due to the cutting edges being a smaller diameter than the body of the bit.</p>

<p>For a Forstner the process is essentially this:</p>

<ul>
<li>hone the bevel on the edge</li>
<li>hone the straight flutes or chip-lifters</li>
<li>hone the central spur.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just to show the basics:</p>

"What do I need to know when looking at pallets for wood?","1282","","<p>I keep seeing projects being build from pallets and pallet wood. Can I just take any pallet or are there safety concerns? </p>

<p>What do I need to know about pallets in order to use them?</p>
","<p>These can usually be easy to come by. Plenty of businesses view them as scrap and are glad for you taking them away. Pallets are a favorite among up-cyclers as a (<em>usually</em>) free source of material and its unique look and feel. That being said there are several points to consider when collecting pallet wood. </p>

<h1>Simple Inspection</h1>

<p>There are some basic things when looking at a pallet that will let you know if it is even worth considering bringing it home. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Overall condition</strong>: In most cases you would only want a pallet where most of the boards are in good general condition. Visual inspection will reveal most of the common issues like splits, cracks, deep gouges. </li>
<li><strong>Assembly</strong>: This mostly depends on your project and tenacity. Looking for how the pallet is assembled as far as number of nails and/or staples as well as their placement should play a factor. If you are trying to conserve as much of the board as possible then too many nails risks the yield you might get from that pallets disassembly</li>
<li><strong>Stains/Smells</strong>: Assuming you are not lucky enough to know where you pallet came from, smelling the pallet and looking for stains might give you insight as to what it was carrying. You want to avoid oils and stains as they might be chemical residues</li>
</ul>

<h1>Health/Safety</h1>

<p>Something you might locate, while eyeing a pallet for take home, is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISPM_15"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the stamp</a>. Sample below from Wikipedia.</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/IPPC_from_box.jpg/220px-IPPC_from_box.jpg"" alt=""Pallet Stamp""></p>

<p>If a stamp is not present it does not mean you should not use it. Having one makes the decision much easier as to whether or not you should take it.</p>

<p>Stamps, similar to the one above, would exist on international pallets and are subject to certain standards. These standards are adhered to by many but <em>not all</em> countries. For the stamp do be official it must bear the <a href=""https://www.ippc.int/en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IPPC</a> logo. The stamp contains other components but the main focus is the letter code that identifies the wood treatment. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>HT</strong>: Heat Treated</li>
<li><strong>KD</strong>: Kiln Dried</li>
<li><strong>DB</strong>: Debarked</li>
<li><strong>MB</strong>: Methyl Bromide Fumigation</li>
</ul>

<p>HT and KD both involve a heating process to control pest and fungi. MB is the stamp you want to avoid as it means it was chemically treated. In many cases it is considered a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromomethane#Health_effects"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">health risk</a> and should <strong>never</strong> be used. </p>

<p><strong>Stamp-less pallets</strong></p>

<p>It is common place for pallets that have not left the country. These can still be used but more caution is required. Great for most projects but you should still consider possible risks if the project would be in contact with children or food. The points mentioned under <em>Simple Inspection</em> would be pertinent here once again. </p>

<p><strong>Colored/Painted Pallets</strong></p>

<p>You, no doubt, will run into orange and blue pallets. These are used as rental pallets and were designed for long life. As such it is likely that they have come into contact with chemicals. Another point is that these pallets usually have a deposit or reimbursement fee associated to them. Companies have a vested interest in these pallets in order to get that deposit back. </p>

<p><strong>The lonely pallet</strong></p>

<p>No doubt you will find a pallet all by it's lonesome beside a dumpster and it passes all tests and you want to take it home. You could probably just take the thing but don't assume that because of where it is that it is garbage. If you can ask someone its would be a courtesy. For all you know that is where someone else agreed to pick it up.  </p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Don’t be discouraged but informed and aware when looking for pallets. There are lots of pallets out there so it should't be hard to find useful materials. Plenty of uses for pallets from building birdhouses to wine racks to a clubhouse to a <a href=""http://www.viralnova.com/build-a-pallet-house/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">real house</a>.

"How to cut round corners on a 4x4?","1277","","<p>I have some ~36"" 4x4 pieces that need to have round corners with a radius equal to the width of the board. (Each end of the 4x4 will have a 1/4 circle connecting the top and bottom of the board.) The curve would lie in the plane of one of the long sides - that is, if you if you looked end-on at the ""ends"" (3.5"" x 3.5"" profile), it remains square, but looking at the front or back (36"" x 3.5""), you'd see half of a capsule shape (with curves cut in each end). </p>

<p>Todo: insert picture here. :/</p>

<p>My problem is that the board is too deep to cut with my router unless I cut from both sides - it's tricky to get both sides to line up, even using the template I've cut from 1/8"" MDF. I have the same issue with my jig saw as it appears to cut about 2-2.5"", and the (planed) board is still about 3-1/4"" thick.</p>

<p>I can approximate the curve with my miter saw, making a series of cuts in ~10 degree increments that are tangent to the curve, then hit it with the orbital sander to smooth it out. That works <em>okay</em>, and provides the the most repeatable results, but I feel like there should be a better way.</p>

<p>I do not have access to a band saw.</p>

<p>Suggestions? </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I tried the router approach but wasn't able to get the result I was looking for. I finally went back to the miter saw, going in 2-5 degree increments. It worked pretty well, just have to find my belt sander now. :)</p>

<p>This has hand processes written all over it to me but actually I think you've arrived at what might be the best method using the tools you have available. Some things just are a lot of work and there's no getting around it, but you <em>will</em> get better at doing it the more of them you do. It won't get any less boring though!</p>

<p>Many people with access to a stationary belt or disk sander would do this sort of thing using that. Obviously it would be better to first saw away each corner at 45° to reduce the amount of sanding required, but it could be done purely using the sander fitted with a coarse belt and many people who rely on sanding a lot wouldn't hesitate to do it that way.</p>

"Table saw technique, cross-cut dados on multiple boards","1271","","<p>I bought a table saw recently and it's the most terrifying tool I own.</p>

<p>I want to cut a 5/8"" dado across four 5"" wide boards in identical positions, about 14"" from the reference edge. I have a 1/2"" stack so I'll have to make two passes. What is the safest technique for this?</p>

<p>It doesn't feel good to use the fence, one at a time, because it's difficult to keep the board flush to it given only 5"" contacts the fence with 14"" distance to the blade.</p>

<p>I could use the mitre slide but I'm not sure how to get consistent position for multiple cuts. Is there some magic jig I can cut or a good marking / measuring technique for the mitre slide? (I am thinking, maybe I can make an ""L"", laying on its side, with the long edge mounted to the slide and the short edge 14"" from the blade, but I foresee problems keeping the angles true and the short edge sturdy; I could make it out of scrap steel maybe but now it seems like a whole project of its own.)</p>

<p>Can I somehow load all the boards at once? I was thinking maybe I could temporarily mount them all to a piece of plywood or something then run the whole thing along the fence, maybe once to make all the edges flush then flip it around to cut the dados. But I don't want to put screw or brad holes in the boards and I'm not sure how to mount them otherwise.</p>

<p>How can I safely and accurately make these cuts?</p>

<p>As a beginner, that is the right attitude. I note that the most dangerous time will be when you are no longer a beginner but not yet an expert; that's when people make careless mistakes. I try to remind myself frequently that my table saw is trying to kill me.</p>

<p>Correct. This is a recipe for the work rotating and kicking back.</p>

<p>And you never want to use the miter slide and fence in combination because again, the work can bind against the fence and rotate away from the miter. However there is a way to safely use the fence as a reference; more on that in a minute.</p>

<p>If you're going to go to that kind of trouble then it is better as others have noted to simply make a sled. I use my sled for all but the most trivial cross cuts.</p>

<p>Not worth it. It'll be hard to keep everything together and awkward to try to cut so much at once. And this is not the last time you will have to solve this problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can I safely and accurately make these cuts?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cheap solution is to use the fence as a reference but <em>not</em> keep the work against the fence while it is being cut. You reference the fence <em>before</em> the work engages the blade like this: (Though I personally would be inclined to use the other miter slot.)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0z1BG.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0z1BG.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Clamp a scrap <em>known-to-be-flat</em> board to the start of the fence, set the fence-with-board as your reference, and push the work against the board before you start moving the miter. When the work engages the blade it is past the board, and so there is no chance that the fence will bind against the work.</p>

<p>But again, building a sled pays big dividends. Repeatable, accurate cuts are easier, and you can build as many safety devices into a sled as you desire. My sled is covered with points where clamps can be added to hold work in place. Hands are terrible clamps.</p>

"What general considerations do I need to take into account for wood movement?","1266","","<p>I know that wood movement is an issue, but it's a bit vague for me where I should be concerned with it.</p>

<p><a href=""http://workshopcompanion.com/KnowHow/Design/Nature_of_Wood/2_Wood_Movement/2_Wood_Movement.htm"">This page</a> Suggests that there is almost no movement in the longitudinal direction, but that there is significant movement in radial and tangential directions respective to the grain.</p>

<p>Are there particular orientations which I should avoid, e.g. radial in one piece in a plane with tangential of another?</p>

<p>With what orientations is it safe to use screws without hardware that would allow movement?</p>
","<p>That page you link to is correct, wood movement is almost completely across the grain. Longitudinal or long-grain movement is so slight it can nearly always be ignored. </p>

<p>Just to note, we must remember movement is both expansion and contraction, which typically happens seasonally:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/c9U3q.jpg"" alt=""Seasonal wood movement""></p>

<p>Obviously there are specific instances where movement cannot be accurately predicted. Where the grain shifts direction, as much as 90° within the same board (e.g. wood taken from various crotches within the tree) and particularly where there is wildly changing grain (e.g. in a burr or burl).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there particular orientations which I should avoid, e.g. radial in one piece in a plane with tangential of another?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the standard cross-grain situation you want to try to avoid where possible. So the answer is basically yes but it's complex because you can't avoid it in many cases. </p>

<p>Where you have no choice but to make a cross-grain join, you must build in some means to allow for movement, for example by fixing loosely as with various tabletop fasteners, fixing at one end of the joint only or allowing something to float within a groove or rebate (US: rabbet), as in the floating panel in frame-and-panel construction. </p>

<p>Unless you take these sort of steps to avoid an issue you can take it that something <em>will</em> happen, not that it <em>might</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With what orientations is it safe to use screws without hardware that would allow movement?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That depends for a start on how you define hardware. The standard 'buttons' used to attach tabletops and allow movement are wood, and are made by the woodworker, but are technically hardware.</p>

<p>Rather than think about the orientations it is safe to use screws visualise the expansion and contraction of the wood and how you allow this to happen after fixing. So essentially screws could be safe in any joint they can be used in, as long as they're utilised appropriately.</p>

<p>A good example is the top to any table, which typically will be cross-grain to some portion of the underframe or apron assembly. One standard way is to fix firmly in the centre and allow the front and back edges to move. Where you want an edge to remain fixed relative to the piece (e.g. a table intended to go flush against the wall) you fix firmly there and allow movement to occur out from that edge:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/T9jnZ.jpg"" alt=""Allowance for tabletop wood movement""></p>

<p>Screws are used here both for the points where firm fixing is desired as well as where movement is being allowed for, by screwing directly into the tabletop through the apron and through some form of movable fixing/fastener respectively.</p>

","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Cherry will naturally darken with exposure to UV light, regardless of whether you've finished it or not.  My parents have a cherry bedroom set that exhibits this characteristic, even though it's kept in a bedroom with the windows closed most of the time.</p>

<p>However, if you want to ""artificially"" age it, leaving the piece in the sun for a while (a few hours, even) will help darken it.  Depending on your local climate, you may need to leave it in the sun longer.  Just be aware that if you leave it on your driveway for a few days, you'll likely have to clean off the dirt and grime that accumulates, which could lead to odd flecking in the wood from the spots that were covered up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, does the answer apply to all types of wood?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not necessarily.  Cherry is one of the faster-reacting woods that is available in terms of darkening with sunlight.  Others take much longer to darken/change color.</p>

<p>Personally, cherry is the only wood I would consider artificially aging with this process, and any others I'd just let time take its course and age it naturally.</p>

"Are drain holes in a wooden bird house necessary, and if so, what's the best way to make them?","1239","","<p>I'm asking a few wood working question in relation to an owl box I'm making to put on my property. My question is about drain holes in this and any bird box.</p>

<p>I've always put drain holes in bird houses I've made, because they've called for them. However, they don't make much sense to me. It seems like any bedding or nesting material would absorb any pee, and there wouldn't be enough to need draining. I'd also think that general debris would clog any drain holes.</p>

<p>Firstly, do you guys think that drain holes are necessary? The only real use I can think of is that they might be for any rain that gets in. However, if nesting material and bird crap get in them and clog them up, they wouldn't even drain that. It seems to me that it'd be more important for air circulation to get rid of any toxic fumes like ammonia from the pee and to evaporate any liquids.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you think they are necessary, how do you recommend doing them. Would you just use holes, slots, or like some I've seen, would you chamfer the corners of the bottom so you have a vent on each corner? Will any liquid even run to these vents or would you need to work the wood to have some kind of slope to direct it to the corner holes? Thanks for the help.</p>
","<p><strong>Drain holes are necessary</strong></p>

<p>Obviously the inhabitants of the house still have to get in somehow. Seal it up all you want but they will need an entrance. That entrance would be a means to allow rain to enter (I suppose maybe ambient moisture as well). Yes, you will have an overhang but wind will still push water in. Some styles of house don't have effective overhangs especially larger ones, like bird hotels, where they cannot cover all spaces efficiently. Yours will not be the case.</p>

<p>Urine is not really an issue. Like you said it would most likely be absorbed in the nest.</p>

<p>Depending on your choice of wood sitting water could encourage the wood to rot which you don't want. As mentioned in a <a href=""http://www.drsfostersmith.com/pic/article.cfm?articleid=2194"" rel=""nofollow"">Birdhouse Selection Guide</a> mold would also be a concern.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make sure your birdhouse has drain holes in the bottom to let out water. This is important to keep mold and bacteria from multiplying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Make your holes</strong></p>

<p>One in each corner would be best so that no matter which orientation of the birdhouse the water can exit somewhere. Small 1/4"" holes would be more than sufficient and then let gravity do the work.</p>

<p>Need to be careful though as too many could allow more wind to get in reducing the overall temperature. So don't get all hole happy. Birds might not like that and would either not nest there or could move. </p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Overall it does seem like a good idea to at least have the one drain hole. This allows for a little air circulation as well. Sure debris would get in there but doubt it makes and air/water tight seal. </p>

<p><strong>Sidenote</strong>: Also as a birdhouse owners we are supposed to check for debris and such things after the inhabitants have moved out as part of proper maintenance. This is to extend the houses life. </p>

"How should I orient a spline along a long edge join?","1235","","<p>I glued up a 4' long dresser top last night, and ended up using a 1/4"" spline to line up the two 12"" wide sub-panels into one 24"" wide one.</p>

<p>I was using pine quarter-sawn boards, and for the spline I just ripped a 1/4"" wide strip from the end of one of the panels, since I had made them a bit oversized. So the spline had the same grain direction as the panels, except the growth rings are rotated 90°. Unfortunately I didn't really think about spline grain direction while I was gluing it up.</p>

<p>In the future, is it critical that I manufacture a long spline for an edge join with grain perpendicular, like in the image below? It seems like a huge hassle, since I'd have to have a super wide board or use dozens of little spline chunks.</p>

","<p>The spline will expand at the same rate as the board it is in, if the grain is running parallel to the grain in the board, so there shouldn't be a problem.  The reason splines are better when the grain is perpendicular to the join is for strength - wood will split along the grain much easier than it will break across it.</p>

<p>Normally, in a panel glue up like you describe, the spline is only used for alignment, not strength.  The edge grain to edge grain glue bond will be plenty strong alone.   I will use splines, biscuits, dominos, or dowels on this type of glue up just for alignment purposes.</p>

It looks like replacement parts for your model are readily available online.</p>

<p>If you find that you are regularly burning up the hooks on your sander's pad, try turning down the speed if your sander has a speed control.  I burned through 2 or 3 sanding pad attachments for my oscillating tool before realizing this.  Also try connecting a vacuum or dust extractor to the sander to help get more airflow for cooling, as well as helping to prevent the paper from becoming clogged and overheating.  Or, as Jacob Edmund suggested in a comment on your original question, you may be able to replace the backing pad with a smooth one designed for use with adhesive-backed sandpaper.</p>

","<p>You never would normally chisel something like that. It would be cut using a mortising saw.</p>

<p>If you did need to chisel it, like you were doing a Joseph the Carpenter, father of Jesus, re-enactment or something, you would use a soft-wood paring chisel and first make a vertical cut straight down across the grain, then you would set your chisel in that nick and chip towards the end. When you get to the bottom it becomes tricky. You use a diagonal shave, so the chisel goes diagonally across the bottom flat using only hand pressure. The chisel needs to be super sharp for this last step to come out clean.</p>

<p>The key thing of course is that you always chisel <em>away from the grain</em>, never into it. In your photo can be seen the result of chiseling into the grain: splitting.</p>

Not a spring clamp but something like a c-clamp where you could control the clamping power. Cloth or rubber sections could help prevent marring of the work.

"How to make a long shallow cut on a narrow piece of wood with a circular saw","1205","","<p>I am using 5.5 inch wide cedar fence board as lapboard style siding on a chicken coop. The roof is a ~22 degrees shed style roof. I'm having trouble making the long cuts which touch the roof. The one cut I made in the picture below was much more difficult than I wanted it to be. I do not own a table saw or a sliding miter saw. I do have available a circular saw (which I used for this one cut) and a miter saw with a 10 inch blade. </p>

<p>What is the best strategy for making such a long cut?</p>

","<p>You need a guide board. Figure out the distance from the edge of the circular saw blade to the edge of the plate, preferably not the side that the motor hangs over, or your board will have to be very thin to fit underneath it. Clamp the board (make sure it's a straight one!) to the work piece parallel to the cut line, at the distance you measured on your circular saw. Run the plate of the saw along the guide board as you cut, and your cut will follow your cut line exactly. I did this for a long time back before I got a table saw, and still do it when cutting large stock like plywood sheets that can't easily be cut on the table saw. </p>

"Leveling a finish/finishing the finish","1200","","<p>I'm using Emmet's Good Stuff (poly gel varnish that you wipe on) as a finish on a walnut slab.  I've read a lot about finishing online, but am a little confused about ""leveling the finish.""  As I understand it poly varnish requires some minor abrasion between coats for good adhesion.  The guy at my local woodworking store told me to use 320 to accomplish this as well as to knock out any streaks left by my application rag, dust nibs, etc in between coats.  I take it that this is not the ""leveling step"" described in sources like Flexner's ""Understanding Wood Finishing"" and is really more of a very light hit with 320 so as not to ""bust through"" the finish?  How many coats of finish should you put on before ""leveling""?  As I understand it ""leveling"" means sanding (possibly wet sanding with ~320 grit) until the entire surface is at an even sheen, which presumably requires some amount of build up or else you're going through to the wood.</p>

<p>Flexner's book (page 156 -- ""Brushing Varnish"") says: ""brush on the first coat....sand the surface lightly with 280-grit or finer...apply the next coat...sand the surface lightly with 320-grit or finer sterated sandpaper...If you're trying to achieve a perfect or near-perfect flat surface, sand out the brush marks after the next-to-last coat...use 320-or 400-grit wet/dry sandpaper lubricated with soap and water or mineral spirits.  The last coat will then level better.""</p>

<p>Does that mean that if you apply, for example, 5 coats of finish that you sand the first one with 280, the next one with 320, don't sand the next one at all, wet sand the 4th coat, and polish the final 5th coat?  If you apply 7 coats would that imply two more coats with no sanding/abrasion at all?</p>

<p>On a related note his book also warns about ghosting or going through one layer to another.  If you're leveling a surface, which has brush marks in it are you not -- by definition -- taking off more material in some places than others, which means that you must be intentionally ghosting in certain spots?  </p>

<p>After leveling I take it the next step is polishing/rubbing, which can be done with things like abralon discs and the like.  Is that typically done on the leveled surface or on yet another coat over the leveled surface?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>As I understand it poly varnish requires some minor abrasion between coats for good adhesion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. You'll read this online <em>a lot</em> (and in some books, and what's worse even in the instructions for some products) but it is completely untrue. The only reason to sand between coats is if you need to 'de-nib', or remove minor surface blemishes. </p>

<p>The important word above is IF. Where poly is spray-applied to a high standard for example in a dedicated spraying booth with filtered air — such as in many commercial operations — there would never be any sanding between the coats of poly and they don't have problems with poor adhesion.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>320 may be a tad high but it is a suitable grit for de-nibbing. </p>

<p>There is some individual opinion and personal preference for the grit(s) to use for sanding between coats. Many woodworkers progress from 240 through to perhaps 400 as they sand the first and then progressive coats. There is likely some 'voodoo' or personal mythology here, given the nature of varnish and the fine scratches that even the coarsest of these grist will leave; for certain applications there is probably no discernible difference to de-nibbing with 240 or 400. Except that the 400 will clog faster and work more slowly.</p>

<p>Dead on.</p>

<p>Not all guides to wood finishing will say this but flattening should always or nearly always take place just once, and as the final step after all the finish is down. </p>

<p>We can take a lesson from the way that finish is rubbed down on high-end cars here. There they <em>only</em> sand at the end, without exception unless something goes wrong. In woodworking one of the most common similar-looking finishes is on pianos, and there too they wet-sand only at the end (followed by buffing). The standards for flat and smooth in both cases here are generally far higher than required by most woodworkers, so these perfectly illustrate that sanding between coats is unnecessary to achieving a great result.</p>

<p>This is more of a problem with certain finishes and not with others where the multiple coats are more cohesive. And yes you're right, it is practically inevitable that it will occur to some degree or another. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Correct. And yes this is usually on the levelled surface. </p>

<p>There is rarely any point to buffing or polishing an as-applied varnish layer because it is inherently glossy enough. The polishing is to regain the gloss lost by the sanding done during flattening.</p>

<p>The converse — rubbing down a final coat of varnish to <em>reduce</em> sheen — is frequently done however.</p>

"Why would a plane have a grooved sole?","1196","","<p>One of the planes I rescued from a yard sale has grooves in its sole, running front to back across the surface that contacts the wood.

<p>So what have I got here, what's it designed for, and are there any special yips I should know when setting it up?</p>
","<p>One supposed advantage of a grooved, or corrugated, sole on a plane is to prevent the plane from ""sticking"" to the surface of the wood, similar to the way two panes of glass (or any two smooth surfaces) will stick together if there's no air between them.</p>

<p>It was originally intended to reduce friction by reducing the contact surface without compromising the plane's ability to produce a flat surface, though as aaron pointed out, in reality that isn't the case. You just need to wax the sole to reduce friction.</p>

<p>You cat set it up the same as you would a non-corrugated plane. As LeeG noted, a practical benefit is that there's less material to remove if you need to flatten the sole.</p>

","<p>From the picture, it appears to be the open grain of the wood.  This is typical in an initial coat because if you have done it right, it will be relatively thin.  A good way to tell, is if you can lightly feel a difference in the finish where the spots are in comparison to the rest of the top.  If it looks like this is the case, you should notice it disappear in the next coat.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If not, try to determine whether it's in the finish    or on the surface.  Poly can be a fragile process because it takes so    long to cure and needs a virtually dust-free environment.  If it    appears to be on the surface, you should be able to sand it out of    the finish.  If your scotch pad isn't enough, a piece of 220 or    higher should be fine so long as you're careful not to go too deep.     Also, if using sandpaper, be mindful of uneven scratching in the    finish.  It will add an extra coat or two to your process.</p></li>

"Chlorine bleach on poplar","1193","","<p>While experimenting with stains and struggling with a moderately green piece of poplar, I found that I really like the results of:</p>

<ol>

<li>Sand lightly with 220 then wipe lightly with mineral spirits to clean, let dry completely.</li>
<li>Generous coat of minwax pre stain conditioner. Leave for 30 minutes without wiping excess (it all soaks in).</li>
<li>Generous coat of Varathane golden pecan stain. Leave for 5 minutes then lightly wipe excess.</li>

What is the long term downside to bleaching poplar with chlorine bleach before staining it? (I brushed it on the surface, as opposed to outright soaking it, if that's significant. It seemed to have penetrated only about 1-2 mm.)</p>

<p>That may be salt residue. Briskly brushing the surface may remove this and return the wood to feeling like it did prior to bleaching.</p>

<p>With two-part wood bleaches (A/B type) one bottle contains sodium hydroxide, lye, which is very basic and likely in a more concentrated solution than common bleach. In the traditional fuming technique to darken oak the wood is exposed to the vapours from concentrated ammonia, another strong base/alkali.</p>

<p>In reality wood is pretty tough stuff, and for many woods even heavy treatment with caustic chemicals — as is done in some furniture-stripping operations — does little more than slight damage <em>to the surface wood fibres only</em> (somewhat similar to some exposure to sunlight and rain).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the long term downside to bleaching poplar with chlorine bleach before staining it? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>None that I'm aware of. </p>

<p>Some people like to neutralise the bleach by wiping down with vinegar (safety note: after the wood has dried, <em>do not</em> do this while the bleach is still liquid) but that is likely a pointless step given a number of other treatments with alkaline chemicals are not followed by any use of acids.</p>

<p>From the opposite direction, some users when they are treating wood with vinegar or other acids like to neutralise these with a dilute solution of baking soda or washing soda (both mild bases). But this too is unnecessary, and in addition can have unintended effects on some species, changing the colour of the wood slightly.</p>

<p>In reality most wood species are naturally acidic, so the surface wood fibres being left acidic won't matter to them. And where an alkaline chemical was used and there's any excess (un-reacted) chemical in the surface wood fibres it will be neutralised naturally over time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have some oxalic acid coming too that I'm going to play with. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oxalic acid is the wood bleach of choice for dealing with water staining and stains formed from iron reacting with the tannins in wood. It can also be used to treat some of the discolouration from a burn or scorch.</p>

<p>Note that oxalic acid is quite toxic, so do follow safety instructions. Wearing goggles, a dust mask and gloves is advisable when handling the dry powder as well as the prepared liquid solution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generous coat of minwax pre stain conditioner. Leave for 30 minutes without wiping excess (it all soaks in).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, it appears that ""pre-stain conditioners"" consistently have incorrect instructions. According to Bob Flexner you tend to get far better, more consistent results if you wait for the product to dry rather than applying stain a short while later as it appears you did here. To say that a lot of user experience supports this would be an understatement, as ""pre-stain conditioner"" is nothing more than a dilute finish in most cases; and very dilute shellac or varnish*, thinned protein-based glues also, have been used for centuries to do the very same job — what used to and still should be called <em>sizing</em>. </p>

<p>Secondly, conditioners should generally be used only where needed: for controlling blotching in blotch-prone woods. It's a needless expense and time penalty otherwise, and in addition it can negatively affect the very results you're hoping to achieve. What sizing does is partially seal off the wood, lessening stain penetration, which is usually the exact opposite of what we want when staining**. </p>

<p>*And I would recommend using dilute shellac or varnish for this instead of the commercial product because A, you can use the final finish you're going to be applying to the wood anyway, B, you know exactly what you're using and can control its strength to perfectly suit the wood you're using, and C, because it'll almost always be far cheaper.</p>

<p>**Where a lighter staining effect is desired for any given stain colour, simply diluting the stain is often a more direct way of achieving the same result.</p>

<p>I typically like to put paste wax on my work when I'm done -- I like the feel and I think it helps protect the wood under certain circumstances (e.g. water appears to bead up better on oil-finished wood with a paste wax compared to just oil finished wood).</p>

<p>I noticed that the Maloof oil/poly can suggests using <a href=""http://www.rockler.com/sam-maloof-s-finishes-sam-maloof-oil-wax-finish"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maloof Oil/Wax</a> as a top coat.  I assumed that the oil/wax was just like the Liberon paste wax I've used, but I took a look at the <a href=""http://go.rockler.com/msds/sam-maloof-oil-wax-finish-msds.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MSDS</a> and was pretty surprised.  It looks like it's basically just BLO+tung oil and a really small amount of wax.  Is this a common finish?  There seems to be so little wax that I'm curious if it has any effect at all.  Qualitatively what is the difference in a finish with using something like this (e.g. oil and a really small amount of wax) compared to paste wax?  Do they serve different purposes in the finishing world? </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>On a related note this seems really easy to make. Am I wrong in thinking that I could just add 1 part BLO, 1 part tung, and some beeswax flakes into a glass jar and melt/mix it using a double boiler?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Is this a common finish? </p>

<p>No. Oil/wax blends are not common and I think for good reason. Looked at a certain way it's because it combines the worst of both materials, something I don't say lightly.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Excellent question. The answer might be a very uncomfortable one for fans of Maloof's work or of the finish on their own pieces: it's likely to be softer and more easily marred. </p>

<p>Two important facts: oil dries soft, wax dries soft. </p>

<p>There's no getting away from these. It's because they're soft that neither should be applied as a surface coating of any significant thickness. </p>

<p>As the Comment above from keshlam rightly says, Maloof experimented until he got <em>the effect</em> he liked the most. He was going for appearance, and possibly feel, over wear characteristics I promise you, because an oil finish normally would never go over a film-building finish — oil finishes are supposed to go <strong>in</strong> the wood, not <strong>on</strong> the wood for a very good reason. If you don't wipe off the excess after using BLO on a piece and let it fully 'dry' (might take a month or more) you'll easily see why.</p>

<p>I think the nature of Maloof's work should be strongly borne in mind in considering his choice of finish; even before he had a big name and became one of the brightest stars of American woodworking his work was what you might class as art furniture, or fine furniture if you prefer. Stuff like this is, to be blunt, intended to be babied. They're not daily users in a busy household with young kids! Well not unless the pieces are safely locked in a room the kids don't have access to :-)</p>

<p>Unrelated to the main question, a quick bit about Maloof's oil/poly blend.</p>

<p>I think anyone who currently uses it or is tempted to (either bought or made at home) should think carefully about the role of the tung oil in a mixture that already contains linseed oil. What purpose does it actually serve?</p>

<p>No you're not wrong and I always encourage people to make this kind of thing themselves, rather than buy a commercial version (which are sometimes disproportionately expensive). The cost is only part of it though, by making something yourself you get a better appreciation for the materials, you can tailor the mixture to suit your own tastes, the local conditions and other factors.</p>

<p>The above points are often emphasised in guides on making homemade versions of blended finishes, others being ""Danish oil"", ""tung oil finish"" and ""teak oil"". But a key aspect that's often not expressly stated is that <em>it means you have all of the primary ingredients separately</em>. They are far more useful and versatile as individual components than in a single readymade mixture.</p>

<p>Commercial paste waxes are typically a blend of one or more waxes, e.g. paraffin wax or beeswax with a little carnauba (for added hardness), plus the spirits (in the old days it would have been turpentine, so they smelled a lot nicer) that make it a paste at room temperature rather than a solid. And that's it usually.</p>

<p>As the simplicity of the ingredients suggest, this is also something where an equivalent is easily made at home.</p>

"Supporting a level box on an uneven surface","1171","","<p>I am building some 6' x 2' x 1.5' (depth) cedar planter boxes for specific locations on concrete outdoors. The boxes need to sit as close to the ground as possible, a few inches max.</p>

<p>I am building three of them.</p>

<p>The concrete is neither level nor flat (eyeballing it I would say it's up to a 2-3"" height difference in some places), and throwing down a level concrete pad is not an option.</p>

<p>The challenge is that the boxes will probably each be holding about 1500-1800 lbs of soil. Additionally, they will have little kids climbing all over them, so it's important that they do not wobble and that any supports underneath do not collapse.</p>

<p>The other challenge is they sit against a wall. So I will only have direct access to one side once they are fully built.</p>

<p>Currently the basis for the design is pretty simple. I plan to build a pretty standard floor frame with 2x3 or 2x4 joists every 18""-ish, with the box built on top of it.</p>

<p>But I'm not sure how to build supports to level it. The shape of the ground is very complex and doesn't lend itself well to simple measurements and cuts. Also I don't want to paint myself into a corner and make it impossible to build, I need to construct it in such a way that I don't have to tear the whole thing apart if I don't get it level on the first try.</p>

<p>The boxes don't have to move once they are placed. They will be there until they rot.</p>

<p>How can I do this? How can I build a stable, level support for 1500+ lbs on an uneven concrete surface?</p>

<p>I am thinking about using those adjustable height feet with threaded rod, perhaps 8 of them around the perimeter of the base frame. Then I can level them before placing the box on top when I still have access to all the corners. But I don't have experience with these, and I'm concerned that they may wobble and collapse with sideways force.</p>

<p>I had also thought about cutting 2x4s to the contour of the ground and sitting everything on those. But I don't know how to transfer the ground contours to a cut pattern (Intel has those cool cheap 3D cameras out and I honestly considered grabbing one, but I don't have enough time to wait for one to arrive then develop software to generate contours), and when I run through this idea in my head, I see all sorts of opportunity for frustration.</p>
","<p>I would build the support frame for under the boxes, just the frame (out of treated 2x4's).  Then find your where you want the boxes to rest.</p>

<p>Then you scribe your 2x4's with a compass.  You get your frame some what level, then set the compass (generally to the max gap, but only if you want the whole frame resting on the ground) and go around with the compass point on the ground and where the ground pushes up, the pencil will mark the board where it needs to be cut to 'relieve' the ground underneath.  </p>

<p>I had to do this a bit with my dad's log home.  All trim had to be scribed to get a nice fit with the logs.</p>

<p>Once you have your frame ready (and mark where the corners are on the concrete!) you can attach it to the bottom of your boxes. </p>

<p>So, my question is: How could I have constructed this frame with no gaps? How can I create a tight mitered frame around a <em>fixed size, pre-existing</em> object?</p>

I also read <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-Cure-for-Miter-Joint-quotGaposisquot/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this trick</a>. But I can't understand how I can apply any of this, because it all seems to detail how to get the angles right <em>without caring about the final size of the frame</em>. I also am having trouble understanding how the sleds described could be used here - I think I accomplished about the same thing in step 9 above.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the biggest challenge here is that my reference edge is actually in the center of my frame.</p>

<p>I do not know what good marking / measuring / cutting techniques are required to make this happen. I am frustrated because I keep trying to research this and hitting dead ends where people care about the precise angle but don't mind shrinking their frames by 1/16"" or so in the process.</p>

  <p>How can I create a tight mitered frame around a fixed size, pre-existing object?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK I'll tackle this one first as it's actually most important: in this context you don't want to. </p>

<p>To pass on some sage advice I read only recently: <em>new woodworkers should resist the urge to picture-frame a panel made from solid wood [of any significant size]</em>. Just to add a little bit of my own, <em>unless you've made provision for movement across the grain</em>, such as is commonly done on frame-and-panel cabinet doors.</p>

<p>The reason is that solid wood will always expand and contract across the grain, and even where the movement is modest (smaller panels, certain species) it will still exert enormous forces on the frame if it's constrained, and try to push the mitres apart. It is very likely to succeed. If the mitred frame is somehow built stoutly enough that the joints can resist the expansion the panel itself would suffer, as the pressure needs to be relieved somehow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How could I have constructed this frame with no gaps? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it's really very simple at heart, it's just that we get confused by conflicting or competing tips that don't always go together. The basic thing is not to work by measurement but rather use the piece you're framing to directly mark your frame members — same basic way drawers should be fitted to the openings they are being built for, allowing for vagaries in the way the piece <em>is</em>, not the way it <em>should</em> be.</p>

<p>So let's say you start with a single long piece of moulding. Cut two long and two short frame members clearly over-long, then piece one corner together, fit it to the thing you're framing and work out from there. With the mitre held <em>firmly</em> closed and tightly against the first corner mark your short member and your long member directly from the short and long sides of the piece.</p>

<p>Once you get to cutting, your step 5 is the thing to avoid obviously! Even 0.5mm too short is a big deal (about 1/50""). So saw carefully <em>outside of the mark</em>. You're not trying to get this perfect in one go, it's OK to have one or both pieces a tad too long after cutting; you can always trim off more wood, much more difficult to put it back once it's been removed :-)</p>

<p>The traditional way of incrementally trimming mitres is still one of the best methods, and that's with a very sharp hand plane and a mitre shooting board:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/us6vR.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/us6vR.jpg"" alt=""Mitre shooting board""></a></p>

<p>[Source: Wood Magazine]</p>

<p>Planing removes hundredths of a millimetre (thousands of an inch) per cut so the trimming is in tiny increments. Very difficult to overshoot your mark removing this little material at a time.</p>

<p>So let's assume your pieces were overlong at first test fit, now you pare on the shooting board, test, pare, test, pare. Rinse and repeat until the fit is perfect.</p>

<p>You follow the same basic procedure for the next long frame member, working out from the second perfect mitre joint that you just created. The final short frame member can be tricky, but remember you just need to sneak up on the fit. Start from one corner and trim only the other end until as you check the fit the mitre is now dead-on.</p>

"What are the jointer-specific steps for removing warp in lumber?","1136","","<p>The typical method for removing warp in wood is to joint one face and one edge, followed by planing the other face and using a tablesaw for the final edge. The planer and tablesaw are fairly easy, but using a jointer to get the first edge and face straight can be tricky. What are the steps on a jointer to remove(if possible) various types of warp(i.e. twist, cup, bow, crook, kink) on the first edge and face?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>
To clarify, I am not asking how to mill wood using only a jointer, but rather how to use the jointer for the first edge and face before moving to different equipment. In particular, I want to know how how the procedure varies depending on the type of warping and any specifics regarding grain orientation.</p>
","<p>The purpose of a jointer is <em>specifically</em> to flatten warped lumber. If your lumber isn't warped, you don't have to joint it. In a fantasy world, none of us would need jointers. Unfortunately, in our world wood moves, so even if the lumber was jointed perfectly flat before you bought it, it probably won't be perfectly flat by the time you go to use it. Certain species and certain cuts will be more susceptible to warping.</p>

<p>Let's assume your jointer is properly-tuned. In other words, the top surface of the outfeed table is perfectly even with highest point of knives as they rotate, and the top surface of the infeed table is perfectly parallel to the top surface of the outfeed table--i.e., the infeed and outfeed tables are perfectly coplanar when raised to the same height, even with the top of the cutterhead's arc.</p>

<p>Now we're ready to start squaring up a board.</p>

<p>First, you joint the face, taking one or more shallow passes at a time until the face is flat. For this pass, you hold your workpiece against the horizontal infeed and outfeed tables.  Depending on the size of your jointer, most consumer-grade machines can safely remove up to 1/32"" or 1/16"" per pass. Once you think the piece is flat, you can prove it's flat by scribling with a pencil across the entire face and taking one more shallow pass. If all the pencil marks are gone, your workpiece is flat.</p>

<p>Now that you have a flat face, you joint one edge. Set your fence exactly 90 degrees to the tables, then hold the newly-flattened face up against the fence. Pass the workpiece through the jointer one or more times until the edge is perfectly flat, again taking shallow bites.</p>

<p>That's it; assuming you have any wood left, you're done and you can move onto steps 3 and 4, ripping the other edge parallel to the first (usually with a table saw), and planing the other face parallel to the first (usually with a thickness planer).</p>

<p>But what if you don't have any wood left? In that case, you're probably sitting in the emergency room waiting to have your injuries treated, which means you should have done something differently. Let's hop in our time machine and do it right.</p>

<p><strong>Deal with <em>severely warped</em> and/or long boards before they even touch your jointer</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned in a comment, sometimes you simply <em>cannot</em> remove all the warp with only a jointer, or if you did you'd have little or nothing left to work with after jointing. For this, you'll need to do some crosscutting and/or ripping (or karate-chopping), which you can't do with a jointer.</p>

<p>The longer, wider, and thicker your lumber is, the more likely it is that there is some noticeable warp, whether it's a cup, twist, bow, crook, etc. But the warp may be more pronounced in one particular area. In the most severe case, if you take a severely warped board and choose any points, one on each end of the board, there may be no straight path from point A to point B which passes only through wood without passing through air. But if you crosscut the board in half, you will usually find that it's much easier to find a path from point A to point B without passing through air.</p>

<p>So before you ever start dimensioning, you should cut the piece down to rough oversize length. Crosscut each piece a couple inches longer than your final dimensions (or maybe even longer, if you have to account for joinery or some extra fudge factor), but keep each piece at least 18-24"" long if you plan on jointing. Now that you don't have to remove most of the wood in order to get a flat board, you can start jointing to remove each type of warp.</p>

<p><strong>Bow/crook/kink</strong></p>

<p>For a crook or kink, you should flatten a face first so you can register it against the jointer's fence. After that, the steps are basically the same for a bow, crook, or kink.</p>

<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Place the concave face (for a bow) or edge (crook/kink) down so both ends are making contact with the infeed table. If your infeed table is not long enough to support both ends of the board, you can add an extension or auxiliary infeed table.</p>

<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If the crook/kink is severe, you can start by making a few shallow passes with one end on the outfeed table and one on the infeed table, then finish with method 1.</p>

<p><strong>Twist</strong></p>

<p>Twist is the most difficult type of warp to deal with, and is easiest to tackle with a planer sled. But you can do it with a jointer with a little bit of finesse.</p>

<p>To preserve the most thickness, you want to start out by removing equal parts from each end of the twisted board.</p>

<p>For shorter pieces, you can hold down one edge of the piece on the infeed table, but for longer pieces you have to balance the twisted board freehand for the first several passes.  Matthias Wandel has a nice <a href=""https://woodgears.ca/jointer/squaring.html"">article</a> illustrating this technique.</p>

<p><strong>Cup</strong></p>

<p>You can't fix a cup with any amount of crosscutting. If you have a severe cup, jointing and planing away the convex belly on one side and the concave cup on the other side may leave you with little or no thickness left. What started out as an 8/4 board may now only be 1/2"" thick.  A better solution may be to rip the board narrower. The narrower the board, the less severe the cup. So you could rip the board into strips and, depending on your needs, either joint each one individually before gluing them back together, or you could preserve a little more of the board's width (probably at the expense of matching grain patterns) by flipping every other one over and gluing them back together.</p>

<p>But let's suppose the cup is shallow enough to joint. If your jointer is wider than the board, joint with the concave side down. If your board is wider than your jointer, joint with the convex (belly) side down.</p>

<p>On basic appearance it looks similar to a block plane. </p>
","<p>The body of a typical hand plane is a single metal casting. An infill plane, by contrast, is formed from metal plates (sole and sides) joined along the edges, or sometimes by a single piece of metal U-channel. Dense wood is used to fill the space between the plates to support the sides, establish a bed for the iron, and to make holding the plane possible.</p>

<p>Infill planes are often made with steep blade angles, which makes them work well on highly figured woods. They can be and often are made one at a time by woodworkers for their own use in a wood shop with only basic metalworking tools. The metal components can be cut by hand or ordered as a kit, and are usually joined with soldered dovetail or box joints.</p>

<p>Most types of hand planes can be made as infill planes: block planes, smooth planes, jack planes, shoulder planes, etc. can all be made as infill planes.</p>

<p>Honestly all those things can be accomplished with any bench plane within reason, so from a 3 to a 6 in Stanley's numbering system (and including both a 4 1/2 and 5 1/2). </p>

<p>But in reality you wouldn't normally choose to do all of that with just one plane. Planes no. 3 through to 4 1/2 are intended to be smoothing planes, and they are geared towards doing just that, smoothing. They're not intended for flattening tasks, although they can be pressed into service for that it's not without a penalty in time and effort. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am probably going to order one Lie-Nielson to get started with. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>While you're unlikely to be unhappy with an L-N purchase I'm basically going to recommend straight out that you reconsider and go with something else. For someone in your position I think a cheaper brand or vintage from the secondhand market are a much better proposition.</p>

<p><strong>A premium for what?</strong><br>
My general point is about paying a premium for a plane (and L-N's are among the most expensive of modern planes produced in large numbers, particularly so outside of North America). One of the things that you pay a premium for is higher standards of machining on all parts, with tighter tolerances, which supposedly gives you a plane that works better, adjusts more easily, keeps setting better and lasts longer. <em>But in reality most of that is smoke and mirrors</em>, because planes produced not to be ""heirloom tools"" but merely as working men's tools — vintage planes from any number of makers, including Millers Falls, Record and Stanley of course — have a proven track record in both performance and longevity, with many planes well in excess of 75 years old still in daily use in a professional setting. </p>

<p>This shows quite clearly that we don't actually need those far higher tolerances for real-world performance. </p>

<p>And of course it calls into question just what the premium pricetag is actually for. Since it's not about performance or about durability feel free to speculate what it is you're actually paying for.</p>

<p>Lower-cost planes can require more work (called <em>fettling</em>, see more on that in the link at bottom) to 'commission' or get ready for use, and the lower price point reflects this. Notice I said <strong>can</strong> require more work. Not all cheaper planes require anything like the effort to commission that you read about too frequently online (two hours+ needed to lap the sole flat and so on). I've had three planes new planes pass through my hands that each cost less than $30 and an experienced plane user could have gotten any one of them ready to do fine work in under half an hour. </p>

<p>Lastly, one of the other things that buying cheaper allows is buying more tools for the same money (less money in fact), which leads on to my recommendations for you.</p>

<p><strong>What I'd get instead</strong><br>
The important take-home message here is <em>you can get equal performance from planes that cost far less</em>. On top of that for the new user you're less likely to want to baby a tool that didn't cost so much, and if you won't be hesitant to use it hard when needed it can be a great boon. </p>

<p>So in reality what you'd really be better off with here is a selection of planes from a cheaper brand, or, the same selection in vintage tools.</p>

<p><strong>2-3 planes instead of one</strong> I would want to have at least a no. 3, 4 or 4 1/2 (pick based on your hand size and strength) and a 5, the latter set up traditionally with a curved cutting edge on the iron for faster stock removal. And given the choice I'd also like a low-angle block plane too, although this isn't at all a must-have and you could quite happily live without one*.</p>

<p><strong>One plane only</strong> If you go with just a single plane I would get a 4 or 4 1/2 and a spare iron which you can sharpen differently. This in effect turns the one plane into two different planes depending on which iron is fitted — cambered iron for flattening and faster stock removal, iron sharpened straight (with corners rounded off) or with a <em>very</em> slight radius for smoothing tasks, jointing edges and end-grain work.</p>

<p>*These days it's often said or implied that you need a low-angle plane for working on end grain, but that's not at all the case. Actually low-angle planes are a relatively modern thing and just as in the past any standard bench plane is perfectly capable of planing end grain if sharpened to a sufficiently high standard. This is why the most common plane used for tackling mitres in a mitre shooting board might be a no. 5 (some users even prefer a 6 or 7 for this, for their extra heft).</p>

Now, it would probably suffice to clamps on sides (shown in the picture as the right and left sides) and get a pretty good seal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the size piece you're working with, clamping from opposing sides will probably be sufficient since the pieces are pretty stiff with comparison to the span.  You could put a ""bumper"" clamp next to the splits to control the tendency to bow outward too (similar to a caul for keeping table tops flat during glue-ups).</p>

"Does circular saw diameter bear on anything but maximum cut depth?","1093","","<p>Assuming we're talking about <em>sliding</em> miter saws, or table saws, does one select a blade diameter purely to maximize the potential depth of cut?  Or are there other benefits to larger blade diameters for even shallower cuts?</p>

<p>I'm actually thinking larger blades might be slightly detrimental to shallower cuts because a larger radius puts more blade surface area in contact with the piece being cut, but maybe that's only a problem if the piece isn't perfectly supported/fed (and so can flex in against the blade).</p>
","<p>Depth of cut is usually the primary factor associated with choosing a saw diameter, but certain types of saws are affected in other ways.</p>

<p>Besides depth of cut, one factor that impacts all types of saws is that larger blades require more materials in general to manufacture, but they also require more teeth for the same type or quality of cut. As a result, they also cost more (especially with carbide-tipped blades) because of more sharpened cutting edges. For example, 7-1/4"" fine crosscut blade might have 60T and cost $20 while a comparable 10"" crosscut blade may have 80T and cost more than $70.</p>

<p>For some types of saws, like a miter saw, the diameter of the blade also has other implications for the saw's capacity. For example, a 12"" (non-sliding) miter saw can crosscut and miter a wider board than a similar 10"" miter saw if the board is laid flat across the bed. (You can use the miter saw's vertical travel to squeak out a little more crosscut capacity by laying the board on its edge across the bed, with the face of the board against the miter saw's back fence.) Typically the same relationship exists for sliding miter saws, but one could certainly design a 7-1/4"" sliding miter saw that has greater crosscut capacity than any given 12"" sliding miter saw.</p>

<p>For table saws, the only implication is generally depth of cut, though if you want a table saw with a blade braking system (SawStop or Bosch's upcoming <a href=""http://www.boschtools.com/AboutBoschTools/PressRoom/Pages/031815_reaxxsaw.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">ReaXX</a>, you're basically stuck looking at 10"" saws.</p>

<p>Another issue you may face depending on the size you choose is that some blade sizes may not be as readily available at local stores--for instance, 9"" blades for older table saws.</p>

<p>There are also indirect implications for other types of saws. For example, a 7-1/4"" circular saw will have a smaller, lighter motor and will thus cause less fatigue on the operator than an 8-1/4"" circular saw when lifting or pushing the saw over many cuts.</p>

<p>As long as you're using a sharp blade of the right type and with an appropriate depth of cut, the blade diameter is often largely inconsequential and it becomes more important to have the right type or size of motor in your machine. If your saw's motor does seem to get bogged down, you should confirm the blade is actually sharp and/or switch to a thin-kerf blade.</p>

"Determining flexibility of wood types from charts and tables","1090","","<p>If I'm looking for a type of wood that has very little flexibility (or one that has a lot), what wood metrics should I look for in tables / charts / lists to judge relative flexibility?</p>

<p>Is the Janka hardness scale a good indicator of flexibility as well or is dent resistance an independent thing?</p>

<p>By flexibility I mean e.g. how much will a shelf of a given thickness and grain orientation bend when a load is placed on it. I don't really care about max load or breaking point, just a way to compare wood types of the same thickness under the same load. </p>

<p>I'm just not sure what to look for. Most searches for flexibility yield hardness scale tables but I don't understand enough material science to know if this is what I'm looking for.</p>
","<p>Let us not perpetuate a misconception of what is stiffness. Indeed, the modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus), as mentioned in your <a href=""http://workshopcompanion.com/KnowHow/Design/Nature_of_Wood/3_Wood_Strength/3_Wood_Strength.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">citation</a>, is important to stiffness.  But stiffness of beams (structural elements that bend) it is also dependent on the moment of inertia (second moment of area) which for a rectangular cross-section varies as the third power of thickness.  (If the thickness doubles, the stiffness is multiplied by eight.)  See this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_engineering_theory#Stiffness"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, a thick board is stiffer than a thin board.  Using ""stiffness"" is an error by the citation.</p>

<p>The answer to your question </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By flexibility I mean e.g. how much will a shelf of a given thickness and grain orientation bend</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is actually: modulus of elasticity.  </p>

<p>For more information on the bending characteristics of wood, you could look at this <a href=""http://www.recreationalflying.com/tutorials/scratchbuilder/wood_strength_values.html#stress_strain"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a>.  It shows how wood beams typically act under loads and eventually break.</p>

<p>Further research on the net reveals that the MOE grows larger as the moisture content lessens (moist beams sag more than dry beams).  MOE can actually increase by 50% between green wood and wood dried to 12% moisture content.</p>

<p>The MOE also varies greatly from species to species and greatly affects the amount of deflection in a beam or shelf. <a href=""http://www.wood-database.com/wood-articles/modulus-of-elasticity/"" rel=""nofollow"">See this</a> to see that MOE for western red cedar is about 2/3 of that for red oak  and only 1/2 of that for shag bark hickory. A book shelf made of the cedar will sag 50% more than one of the same dimensions made from oak.</p>

<p>And then there's the issue of wood continuing to sag with no increase in load over a long period of time.  We have all seen book shelves that continue to sag  even when all of the books are removed and there is no load on the shelves.  This can happen even if the shelf was not loaded beyond its elastic limit.  Wood behaves differently from metals, which, incidentally, behave differently from one another.</p>

<p>As the question and answers are evolving I am becoming clearer on what I am confused about: My assumption is <em>not</em> that the wood's MC changes quickly, it's that in the presence of a highly varying environment I question if it changes too slowly to ever really reach EMC, at least in the conventional ""weeks"" or ""months"" suggested resting times. Also I question conventional accepted wisdom regarding season and location (I am gathering more data on these lines as I type this, however). It is given, to me, that live wood has a high MC and needs to be dried; what is really not clear to me after looking at answers and data is if it actually matters that wood rests near its final location, and how much a couple of weeks or months really makes a difference. By all traditional experience, it does, but by the very limited observations I have made so far, it does not seem to.</p>

<p>The major variable that affects the above is Winter/December 2015 had record-breaking high temperatures (72F/22C was not a white Christmas). From this I learn two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>The tighter range of seasonal EMC averages (12.4-13.1%) and medians (10.5-11.9%) suggest a reasonable target EMC. This is good news.</li>
<li>There is no statistically significant difference in my area's relative humidity and EMC per season (or even monthly, really). This leads to other questions outside the scope of the original version of this post.</li>
</ul>

<p>This raises some additional questions for reflection: Most notably 1) is a ""few weeks"" or a ""few months"" really enough time to let wood sit, and 2) that season doesn't matter contradicts some accepted experience, although this may be unique to my location.</p>
","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It does matter, and the moisture content bit is a bit easier than you're making it out to be.  Let me explain.</p>

<p>Humidity fluctuates throughout the day, as we all know.  However, on <em>average</em>, an area's humidity levels can be given to a fair amount of precision.  For example, we'd all expect a rainforest to have a higher average humidity level than a desert, even though both can fluctuate quite a bit.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The important thing to remember is that wood starts out containing more water by proportion than the air it's in.  Nature always seeks to achieve equilibrium.  So, if you have a piece of wood with more moisture than the air, the air is going to try to remove moisture from the wood to balance the system.</p>

<p>At some points, there will be days where the air is more moist than the wood and no loss of water will occur in the wood.  <strong>However, if given enough time, the wood will lose enough moisture that, on average, it is as moist as the air.</strong></p>

<p>After this point, daily fluctuations will move the moisture content in the wood up and down, but this is usually localized to the outside fibers of the wood.  Think of it as ""moisture inertia.""  The thicker the piece, the more moisture inertia it has, and the longer it takes to equilibrate with the air.  Conversely, the more moisture inertia it has, the more resistant it is to moisture fluctuations once it reaches EMC.</p>

<p>Well-built furniture takes these movements into effect.  Poorly-built furniture will have cracks and opened joints (among other problems) where they have not been properly accounted for.</p>

"How to prevent table saw blade vibration gouges?","1088","","<p>I'm very new to table saws, and am having trouble getting a clean cut. The blade cuts fine most of the time, but every once in a while something goes wrong and I'll get a big gouge in the wood.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of what I mean, done on the thinner edge of a 2x4:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r0JJw.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r0JJw.jpg"" alt=""gouge""></a></p>

<p>I've measured the depth of the gouge, and it's 15 thou. That seems really extreme, especially considering how smooth and perfect the rest of the cut is. This kind of gouge makes fine furniture impossible.</p>

<p>I know the table saw is correctly aligned; that's the first thing I did when I got it. The fence is parallel to the blade, and the arbor has practically no run-out. A splitter was set-up behind the blade, and the blade I used was brand spanking new.</p>

<p>Here's a video of me making the cut shown earlier, so you can see my set-up and feed rate:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr-1Yj9Ra44"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr-1Yj9Ra44</a></p>

<p>Anyways, from what I can tell, the blade vibrated/wobbled a bit and that's what caused the gouge. I could probably reduce the chance of this happening by cutting in several passes, but when I tried that before I still got the occasional gouge. Any ideas on how I can fix this?</p>
","<p>I took a long look at my table saw today and was able to find two things wrong:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The splitter was too close to the fence.</strong> This was causing friction between the board and the fence, making it hard for me to push the board through. This was part of the reason why I was feeding the wood so slowly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The blade was angled very slightly towards the fence.</strong> I thought I had it set to exactly 90 degrees, but I was wrong! I've heard that having the blade on a negative angle like this makes kickback more likely, so chances are it makes gouges more likely too.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I fixed all of these things, then re-cut the 32 feet I needed. This time, I had the blade raised slightly higher, and I fed at a faster rate.</p>

<p>The result? <strong>No more 15 thou gouges!</strong> The wood is now very smooth and usable.</p>

","<p>First, I would avoid any pressure treated wood around anything having to do with food preparation - the chemicals that go into that wood are often poisonous.  </p>

<p>Redwood or cedar would be good choices for anything outdoors, as would cypress, white oak, and teak, but they are more expensive and harder to source.  </p>

<p>2 by lumber is always 1/2"" less than the stated size, so 2x4 is 1 1/2 x 3 1/2 and 2x2 is 1 1/2 square.</p>

<p>As for the joinery, mortise and tenon is a good, strong joint, but only if it is made correctly.  You would need to use a waterproof glue such as Tightbond III or epoxy.</p>

<p>Another option for the joinery would be to use pocket screws.  They sell outdoor rated pocket screws, and most of the joinery could be hidden with your design (cut the slots in the bottoms of the cross members).  Pocket screws would be much faster and not require quite as much precision to get a solid fit.  </p>

<p>I had no idea this was a thing. Can I reliably use my table saw as a disc sander? The RPMs seem higher than a typical disc sander, and also would I run a risk of burning out the motor if I ran it too long? I mean, I know the table saw motor is pretty heavy duty, but it doesn't seem like it was designed to run in the same manner that a disc sander motor runs (long periods of time, low or no load).</p>

<p>I've always wanted a disc sander - I have no stationary power sanding tools right now - but don't have the space for one. What am I risking by using the table saw with a sanding disc?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>would I run a risk of burning out the motor if I ran it too long?</p>

<p>As to running the saw for a while, that shouldn't be a problem if it has adequate ventilation.  Electric motors run best when run continuously (minimize start/stop).  Using it for sanding will probably be a much lower load than ripping wood stock.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What am I risking by using the table saw with a sanding disc?</p>

<p>The only issue I can see is that you have to press the work against the sanding disk, which would cause bending in the table saw arbor.  Though table saw motors are pretty hefty, I don't really know if this would be an issue or not.  If you made a sanding disc out of a more flexible material (say, 3/4"" plywood), it probably won't be an issue.</p>

<p>Edit: YouTube to the rescue again.  Here's a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmfThrbX1NI"">video showing this technique</a>.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I'd rather ruin a (relatively) cheap dedicated disc sander than an expensive table saw.</p>

<p>Weaker yes, but it shouldn't be a problem as there is still ample surface area. Some additional care would be advisable to ensure a successful bond forms. </p>

<p>Firstly, in case you're unaware wood surfaces to be glued should be freshly worked — that is, they should have been planed, cut, scraped or sanded recently — for a proper glue joint to form. And with sheet goods some sanding is considered a good idea anyway to remove any minor surface contamination it may have accrued during storage and from handling with bare hands.</p>

<p>So lightly sand both surfaces to be glued, spread a thin even layer of glue over both boards (a hard rubber or plastic roller can work well here if you have one) and then bring the boards together and 'clamp' using heavy objects. Use plenty of weight spread around the boards, you can use paint tins (full), stacks of books and even bottles of water to supply the clamping force.</p>

<p>Wood glue is very lubricative, so watch out for some slippage as weight is applied. </p>

"Two-part router table dust collection, both four inch?","1078","","<p>I'm in the process of building a router table dust collection system, similar to the one shown in the image below. </p>

<p><img src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/lumberjocks.com/lxhkyus.jpg"" alt=""Multi-port dust collection for router table""></p>

<p>On many of the designs I've seen (including the one above), the top port accepts a 2.5 inch hose while the bottom one accepts a 4"" hose. I'm wondering if there's anything wrong with using two 4"" ports instead of a 2.5/4. </p>

<p>I've got the <a href=""http://www.harborfreight.com/2-hp-industrial-5-micron-dust-collector-97869.html"">HF 2HP DC</a> unit (lots of acronyms there). </p>
","<p>bowlturner already mentioned that reducing from 4"" to 2.5"" does not work very well with a dust collector and suggested some possible reasons why a 2.5"" fence hookup is so common for router table dust collection.</p>

<p>I'll try to specifically answer your question about two 4"" ports:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm wondering if there's anything wrong with using two 4"" ports
  instead of a 2.5/4.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The typical rule of thumb suggests that you want to maintain about 4000 FPM air velocity through your dust collection system. If you drop too far below the recommended air velocity, dust can pile up in the lines.</p>

<p>If you split a 4"" hose into two 4"" hoses, you've effectively cut the air velocity in half for each branch. (In this particular example, the 90 degree tee and the question mark-shaped flex hose will add some extra resistance. The air will follow the path of least resistance, so the straight branch into the cabinet will still pull more air than the branch that goes to the fence--but for the sake of simplicity, we'll ignore that for now.)</p>

<p>In order to maintain 4000 FPM after splitting into two 4"" hoses, you either want to start out with the dust collector pulling the air twice as fast through a single line of the same diameter, or you want to start out with the dust collector pulling air at the same velocity through a line whose cross-sectional area is twice as large before splitting into the two 4"" lines.</p>

<p>Now let's plug your specific dust collector into the equation. WOOD Magazine <a href=""http://www.portercable.com/uploads/PCD/Documents/News/182DustCollectors.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">tested</a> the Central Machinery 2hp dust collector from Harbor Freight and found that it only pulls 536 CFM @ 4.25"" WC static pressure (a far cry from its advertised 1550 CFM). Coincidentally, 536 CFM is almost exactly the amount of airflow you need in order to draw the air through a 5"" line at 4000 FPM. But if you're just using 4"" hose all the way, 536 CFM equates to 6142 FPM through a 4"" hose according to <a href=""http://www.billpentz.com/woodworking/cyclone/staticcalc.xls"" rel=""nofollow"">Bill Pentz's static pressure spreadsheet</a>. So at first glance, it appears this dust collector falls short by quite a bit. But that's not the whole story.</p>

<p>The good news is that 4000 FPM is only necessary to lift dust vertically. If we're talking horizontal and downhill runs, 3000 FPM is adequate. So if you can smooth out the bends in the line (specifically, replace the tee with a wye and straighten out the question mark-shaped loop), you should have no trouble pulling air through each branch at about 3000 FPM. Mathematically speaking, your dust collector should be able to handle a slightly improved configuration just fine, and realistically speaking, the pictured configuration is suboptimal but possibly ""good enough.""</p>

"Does the speed of sanding a piece of wood affect the end result?","1070","","<p>Does the speed of sanding a piece of wood affect the end result?  In particular, what is the point of having a dual speed random orbital sander?</p>
","<p>A lower speed can be desirable if you're sanding between thin coats of finish or thin veneers, and you don't want to sand through the current coat or the veneer. But many of the lower-end or homeowner-grade random orbit sanders aren't aggressive enough for it to matter.</p>

<p>As with many tools, lower speeds on a sander offer more control, so you may avoid rounding off corners or having the sander skip or jump and gouge the material (particularly if you're using a more aggressive sander).</p>

<p>Some tools have sanding attachments which only work well at lower speeds. For example, if you use an oscillating multi-tool for sanding at the tool's higher speeds, the hooks for the hook-and-loop backing pad will melt, rendering the attachment useless.</p>

"How do I know when my lathe speed is wrong or could be better?","1065","","<p>I'm about a year into learning to turn on an inexpensive mini-<a href=""http://www.harborfreight.com/5-speed-bench-top-wood-lathe-65345.html"">lathe</a>. I mostly turn small lidded boxes or bowls. With both boxes and bowls, I like them big, so I'm often within an inch or two of the width capacity of the lathe.</p>

<p>I turn mostly walnut or spalted maple, though I'm not sure if that makes a difference.</p>

<p>The machine is a great starter lathe, but because it is a pain to change speeds, I end up using the slowest speed almost all the time.</p>

<p>My question is, <strong>am I missing something when I go from roughing all the way to final sanding/polish using only the slowest speed?</strong></p>

<p>The main problems I notice in my finished pieces are tear-out that leaves a rough feel on two sides of the piece, no matter how long or attentively I work my way up the grits (I start at 80 and go all the way up to 800 most of the time).</p>

<p>I guess my pieces take longer than the folks I admire on Youtube, but I can't tell if that is due to the slow speed, my hesitation, my tools, or the videos' editing...or a combination of all three.</p>

<p>It would be really helpful to hear <strong>the ways you recognize while you're working that you can or should increase the speed</strong>.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
","<p>Yes, speed can make a huge difference.  My first lathe was a PSI midi-lathe (not mini) and it required stopping the lathe, opening a panel, and switching the belt to another set of pulley's.  A pain.  However, you need to do it.  </p>

<p>While it is recommended to have it slower for unbalanced pieces (roughing it to a cylinder), speeding it up will make a lot of things better.</p>

<p>Slower speeds don't always cut as cleanly and need a sharper blade to do a good job.</p>

<p>To improve your finish, you can do several things.  speed up the lathe will allow for cleaner cuts. When you get near the end, sharpen the chisel and the will also help make cleaner sharper cuts and not tear the wood, which causes the rough spots, especially on the end grain.  Last by going faster it dramatically improves the ability to sand the piece quickly and well.  I tend after all the cutting is done, to speed up the lathe anyway just for the sanding.  It really does help a lot.  The time it takes to change the speed is made up in how much faster you can get your piece finished and it looks so much better.</p>

"What tool can cut thin wood or acrylic/plexiglass without melting it that is suitable for NYC apartment?","1058","","<p>I live in NYC. I have a small roof deck but mostly must work inside and I have very little space to keep tools. I need to build cases for my electronics projects. Acrylic/plexiglass seems like a nice option but I'm at a loss when it comes to cutting square holes in it. Some say a Dremel will work others say it will melt the acrylic.</p>

<p>Right now I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Large manual drill</li>
<li>Small manual jeweler's drill</li>
<li>serious glue gun</li>

<ul>
<li>manual scroll saw</li>
<li>scroll saw</li>
<li>jig saw </li>
<li>Dremel</li>
</ul>

<p>But I can't decide what would help me build cases for my small electronics projects most out of thin (think under 1/4"" wood) and plastic. Noise can be and issue. That's why I love my manual drills.  They also are much more precise and don't melt plastic. I'm leaning towards the manual scroll saw ... but I don't have any way to try before I buy...</p>

<p>Maybe I need more than one saw? Any advice?</p>
","<p>If you are just trying to cut out small squares I would favour hand tools as well. I would think primarily out of respect for you neighbors but also to keep clean up a little more manageable. Also hand tools can be cheaper in some cases. That of course depends if you are trying to get a production going in which case it might be considered inefficient. </p>

<p>So I would suggest you get a small saw like a keyhole / compass saw if you do not already have one. The blades are designed for cutting small holes which sounds like what you are doing. If the holes are not on the edge of your work then you would just need to drill a hole, on the inside of the square, large enough to get the saw in. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ory9C.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ory9C.jpg"" alt=""Keyhole""></a></p>

<p>Cut on the inside of your lines and then you could sand smooth. </p>

<p>You can essentially do the same thing with a jig saw and you can get them fairly cheap. As long as you are cutting sheet goods it will serve you well. Still need to make a starting hole if you are cutting in the middle of the board obviously. </p>

<p>Coping saw came to mind as well but they are better at cutting curves and might not fit depending where these squares are in relation to the edge of the stock.</p>

"What are the steps for the general hobbyist to rescue green wood for future projects?","1035","","<p>I live in suburbia USA, where hardwood trees grow all over the place.  I regularly see large diameter (8 inch, 20 cm) branches and even whole trees removed and end up getting chipped or allowed to rot on the ground.  I would like to rescue some of this green wood, let it age and use it for projects in a couple of years.  But I am not sure where to start, should I leave it whole, cut the green wood with my table saw, or what?</p>

<p>I have a table saw with a 10 inch blade which is the closest thing I own that <em>could</em> work as a lumber mill. I have this vision where I cut the green wood into rough lumber, stack it outside and a couple years later start using my rescued wood to make stuff. </p>
","<p>First thing, most branches are very poor for turning into lumber.  They will be stress wood and very likely to bend and twist as they dry or after, sometimes even while you are cutting them.  </p>

<p>They of course can be used for turning.</p>

<p>As Peter Grace said, always ask before you collect it, but if it's just laying around, most of the time you will be allowed, some might be very grateful to get rid of it.</p>

<p>Now for processing and storing for later.  You have many options, but if all you have is a table saw you are asking to loose parts of your fingers.</p>

<p>If you are saving the larger pieces for turning, splitting it in half and drying it like firewood is a good idea.</p>

<p>Peter also recommended the chainsaw mill.  They can work and they are a LOT of work, but likely the cheapest option.  Not only do you need to buy the guide, you need (should) to have a special chain for the saw.  Most chains are designed for cross cutting wood (across the grain) and to make lumber you should have a ripping chain (along the grain), cutting slabs like that is not only hard on the person it is hard on the chain saw, and not having the correct chain is MUCH harder on both.</p>

<p>Also be aware that unless you are an expert sawyer you are not going to cut nice flat cuts. so you need to cut them larger to be able to plane down to your desired thickness.  You also need a guide to make your first cut 'flat' and not twist around the log.</p>

<p>Now, you can make lumber this way and MANY people do, the equipment is relatively cheap and after a dozen logs your will likely be doing a reasonable job.</p>

<p>Some people also use bandsaws to make lumber, getting a large throat like 12"" would be my minimum recommendation and then you would also need to build some guides to help run the logs through.</p>

<p>Band saws will waste a lot less wood because of a much smaller kerf, chain saws are going to be at least a 1/4"" for each cut and the more uneven the cut you more you have to waste planing it.  Bandsaw kerf is about 1/16"" or less.</p>

<p>You can also find in many communities people who have portable mills and can be paid to cut up the lumber.</p>

<p>Last you can get your own, My dad and I bought a Woodmizer LT15 (used) 8 years or so ago and make our own.  It's been worth every penny.  </p>

<p>However, with all of these options you still have one thing to worry about, often trees that are 'harvested' in town have many things inside that are dangerous to blades of any stripe.

<p>I don't know if it's eastern red cedar or not, because it was purchased, but I do have access to a lot of raw eastern red cedar. I want to know how long that smell will last under normal use of indoor items and if there is anything you can do to preserve it or bring it out if it fades.</p>

<p>I think the outside of the armoire is polyurethaned to prevent wear. I think they left the inside untreated so you'd have that smell. While it's 30 years old, it doesn't see normal use. It's bedroom storage for things you don't use very often, but need to keep semi-protected. I'm sure that is the reason it still smells so strongly of cedar. If I were to build a piece from it, leaving some of it raw, how long would you reasonably think the smell would last? I'm sure it fades at some point, but would a light sanding expose more of the ""smelling"" surface? By normal use, I mean something you'd use regularly in your house, such as a dresser, a mens valet, a liquor cabinet, etc... Thanks for the help.</p>
","<p>The smell comes from the oils in the wood.  If you want it to last longer it should remain closed as with your chest.</p>

<p>Direct sunlight, moisture and large temperature changes will dry the wood out faster and avoiding those things will keep it smelling like cedar longer.  </p>

<p>Sealing the external surfaces of whatever you make will help the wood keep its smell longer as well. (The piece you mention is about the best case scenario for keeping the smell really)</p>

<p>Light sanding can certainly bring the smell out but its not a total reset and it won't last as long as the smell did when the piece was originally created.</p>

<p>How long is hard to say, depends on the wood, the climate, usage and all that but again your chest tells us it can last a really long time.</p>

<p>And if all else fails and the smell is gone you can always buy cedar chips and put them in an inconspicuous place in the piece to keep it nice and cedar-y for a long long time.  </p>

<p>Glue the dowel/plug into the hole, redrill the hole for your threaded insert, and reinstall the insert.  The plugs have the advantage that when you reinstall your insert, the threads of the insert are biting across the grain of the plug vs. splitting the long grain of the dowel.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I suggest this for closing up the crack:  Drill a couple holes that cross the crack and epoxy in some dowel pegs.  The pegs will act to bridge the gap and keep the crack from opening wider.  You can also fill the crack with epoxy to help keep it together, but the dowel reinforcement will greatly strengthen the crack.  See the image below.</p>

","<p>To repost and add to my response to your previous question:</p>

<p>You will likely not be able to prevent checking and cracking of this piece as it dries. You have different rates of shrinkage depending on the direction of the grain, and with the cut being kept essentially in it's original configuration (i.e., a section cut from the whole tree), it will want to crack and check like every piece of non-split firewood you've ever seen.  Additionally, due to the thickness of the material, you will likely have an exterior layer that dries much sooner than the interior, further exacerbating the checking/cracking issue.</p>

<p>As @keshlam mentions in his comment, the rule of thumb is one year per inch of thickness for drying wood.  This is a rough approximation and depends on a lot of factors (species, local climate, how the piece is stored to be dried, thickness, grain orientation, among others).  There are <a href=""http://blog.lostartpress.com/2014/03/20/but-is-it-dry-enough/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>quite</em></a> <a href=""http://blog.lostartpress.com/2013/12/21/water-vs-wood/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a few</a> Lost Art Press <a href=""http://blog.lostartpress.com/2014/01/11/water-vs-wood-the-sequel/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blog entries</a> on the subject of drying of monolithic workbench pieces you might find of interest (see also this <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=lost%20art%20press%20drying&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">google search</a> for more on the subject from LAP).</p>

<p>In your original post you mentioned cutting out the rot in the center of the log, which I would like to address here as well as it pertains to drying.  Removing the rot will not only help keep the rest of the log rotting along with it in time, but it will also help with cracking in that you won't have the center pith.  By removing this, you will allow the outer portions of the log to shrink in with less inhibition, thereby (hopefully) alleviating some cracking.  Also, assuming you remove the center, I would refrain from jamming another piece of wood in the open space for fear of increasing the log's likelihood of cracking.</p>

<p>However, once the piece has had time to dry and season, you can stabilize the cracks with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_joint"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">butterfly keys</a> or epoxy, to name a couple options.  Given the thickness of your piece, you may be waiting a while before being able to do this.</p>

"Tips for Simple Inlay of Brass into Walnut","982","","<p>I'm wanting to try building a simple clock like <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mjKAF.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mjKAF.jpg"" alt=""Image credit - www.aliexpress.com""></a></p>

<p>(Image credit - www.aliexpress.com)</p>

<p>My question is about the brass inlays. From what I've found on the web, the process is drill perfectly circular holes for the inlays, glue in the small pieces of brass rod (tapping in so they are just proud of the wood) and sanding smooth.</p>

<p>First question about this is does brass sand away with regular sandpaper (say 120 grit) or does it require something special? </p>

<p>Also, what is the best tool for cutting brass? Will a hacksaw cut it? </p>

<p>Is there a particular place to find brass suitable for inlay? I found some options by searching for brass rod on the big ecommerce site, but I wasn't sure if that was a good option or not. </p>

<p>Any tips would be greatly appreciated. </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>First question about this is does brass sand away with regular sandpaper (say 120 grit) or does it require something special? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes it does but you'll run into a big issue with metallic particles being spread over the wood and possibly becoming lodged. The tiniest of recesses can harbour metal dust and you'll catch glints even from individual specs from various viewing angles forever, but worse is that American black walnut is an open-grained species so the entire surface is covered in potential sites for the metal dust to accumulate.</p>

<p>So the ""just proud of the wood"" bit in your description of the method I'd suggest is not the best way to go. Once you get some brass do a test and see, I'm sure you'll find it would be preferable not to sand it along with the wood.</p>

<p><strong>Three options on the drilled holes</strong><br>
Most obvious and the one I was initially plugging is drilling the holes dead on the correct depth, which is easily done using the depth stop on a drill press or bench drill. It's more challenging to do consistently if freehand drilling but also possible if you're careful and use a depth stop of some kind (commercial or homemade). </p>

<p>Second options is making the holes ever so slightly too deep which would be preferable to doing them shallow since the wood will sand much more easily than the brass if then sanding everything flush.</p>

<p>Third option is to drill straight through and I think this is the best idea.</p>

<p>First and third options mean you don't have to sand the brass in place at all, and on top of that will allow you to polish the brass if you like, then protect the surface with a thin coating of lacquer before glueing in place, keeping it bright for many years to come. A mirror finish is easily created on brass, but I don't think would be feasible after in situ because you'd inevitably stain the wood with the polishing residue.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons I now think option no. 3 is <em>the</em> way to go. First is that you don't have to saw thin disks of brass but instead can use short lengths, which are way easier to handle. And you don't need both faces to be dead square since the rear face doesn't register with the bottom of the hole, saving a lot of effort.... even the lengths can vary without it affecting the top surface being dead flush :-)</p>

<p><strong>Bit types</strong><br>
Forstner bits are the bit of choice for the larger holes (sawtooth bits that look similar to Forstners will also do a great job), and brad-point bits are a great pick for the smaller holes at 1, 2, 4, 5 etc. </p>

<p>Notice that in the sample clock pictured the larger holes aren't as uniform as they could be! The one at 3 o'clock is a lot off, which just shows how careful you have to be if you want a neat result.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, what is the best tool for cutting brass? Will a hacksaw cut it? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, with ease, but in case it's not obvious the cut surface will require significant filing and/or sanding to smooth it off. </p>

<p>Note that there are various kinds of brass, some are 'free cutting' and will saw much more easily than others. But as a decent hacksaw blade can even cut annealed tool steel you should have little difficulty as long as you can hold the brass rod firmly in place so it doesn't move around while being sawn (this wastes energy and makes cutting go much more slowly, but also increases the chance of the blade binding in the kerf and potentially snapping as a result). </p>

<p>Lubricating the blade with a light oil (mineral spirits will work OK, you could also use baby oil or mineral oil) is a good idea and will help the cut go more smoothly.</p>

<p>Also note that for the thinner rod you may not be able to use the same coarser hacksaw blade that would work to saw the thicker rod because the teeth could be too large for the smaller diameter. If memory serves the rule of thumb is that you want at least three teeth in the cut (ideally more), so work out how fine a saw blade you'll want to use based on the diameter of the thin rod you end up getting. That same finer blade can then be used on the thicker rod, although it will saw more slowly it will give a better surface that requires less effort to clean up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a particular place to find brass suitable for inlay? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are probably dozens of places you could get brass, including some craft or hobby stores. Online there's sure to be a seller or two on eBay and I've heard great things about OnlineMetals.com but haven't been able to order from them myself because shipping to Europe is a killer.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit for a follow-on query posted in the Comments.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Its interesting, after I posted the question, some time later I was thinking exactly about your option 3. I was trying to determine if such a solution would work. The back won't show, so no problems there. But, if you drill the hole all the way through, how do you hold the brass in place? I assume you would still glue it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes it would be best to glue the brass in position. In theory you could go for a friction fit and because it's a clock that just sits there on the wall and isn't moved around much that would probably be fine, but best to at least tack the brass in place with a dot of superglue. </p>

<p>Sticking disks into shallow holes I'd have also recommended epoxy, but for just a holding something like this in position superglue would work fine, although if you have both epoxy is still slightly preferable IMO. </p>

<p>So insert the rods from the front, flush up their front faces with the wood (check with your fingers, not by eye as your fingers can detect even the slightest discrepancy that you can't see) and place just a dot of glue at the edge of a hole at the back, that's enough hold for something like this. </p>

<p><strong>Bonus tips:</strong> if you ever wanted to reclaim the brass, for example because the wood got damaged from a fall and you want to make a replacement clock using the existing brass, the hold of epoxy can be weakened by heating. The heat from a domestic hairdryer should be enough to soften the epoxy, loosening its grip sufficiently to allow the brass to be popped free. </p>

<p>If you go with superglue there are of course debonders, but you can go low-tech and just freeze the whole clock. Superglue gets very brittle at freezing temperatures allowing even strong bonds to be snapped with ease, so either tap the brass lightly with a hammer or by gripping with pliers and twisting (at the back of course).</p>

","<p>If the defect were in a location that was not subject to wear and abuse, you could fill the defect with wood putty.  After it cured, you could sand it down, and finish to taste.  Unfortunately, this location will get beat up further, and the wood putty would just chip off.</p>

"Best method to stain the ""side"" of a project","970","","<p>I wasn't sure how to stain the 1"" side of my desktop (an 80x30x1"" red oak panel), so I thought painter's tape would be a good idea to only stain half at a time. (Half while doing the ""bottom"" of the table, then tape other side and do the ""top"")</p>

<p>This has left me with a line along the side of the table where the stain is darker on the bottom and lighter on the top, mostly noticeable on the end-grain.</p>

<p>To avoid this result in the future, what is the typical way to deal with having to stain the ""side"" of a project? Should I have stained the entire side when doing the bottom? Should I stain the side as a separate process from the top and bottom? Clearly painter's tape was not the right method.</p>

<p>Also, what are my options other than sanding the sides down and starting over, to fix the mismatch in color?</p>
","<p>Stains tend to penetrate into wood and can wick along the grain, especially with an open grained wood like red oak. For that reason, applying tape to the surface isn't going to give you a clean border as it would with paint -- the stain just seeps underneath the tape.</p>

<p>The easiest way to avoid these kinds of problems is to stain the entire project all at once. Certainly, you should at least try to stain each surface all at the same time. Don't try to do one half of a single surface and then the other. If you need to do only some surfaces, stop at the edges and be quick to wipe any drips or beads that might happen at the edges.</p>

<p>To fix the problem you have now, I'd try using an appropriate solvent to re-dissolve the stain pigment or dye and help redistribute it. You'll probably want to do the entire surface so you don't end up with more blotchiness. The right solvent will depend on the kind of stain that you used. Before attempting to fix your panel, recreate the problem on some pieces of scrap and practice solving the problem there; this will give you confidence that the solution will work and also provide an opportunity to practice.</p>

What are the properties of the wood which makes end-grain boards desirable? What are the disadvantages or difficulties of building them as opposed to regular cutting boards.</p>
","<p>The physical qualities of end-grain that make them desirable over side grain in a cutting board relate to the structure of wood itself. Viewed under a microscope, end-grain looks like a series of straws.</p>

<p>An end-grain cutting board is kind of 'self-healing' in this regard, as compared to side grain. </p>

<p>The disadvantages? Wood isn't as strong along the axis parallel to the end grain, therefore you tend to make things thicker when using end grain.

The only time you should need to use a bench grinder on a chisel is to re-establish a chisel edge that has been badly mangled or chipped from misuse.

<p>As there are routers in all shapes, sizes, power and price ranges available i'm at a loss what to buy.</p>

<p>The consens among all the different opinions i read so far is that ""SIZE DOES MATTER""! On one side the actual size of the thing where a smaller/lighter motor is preferable, on the other side the brute force the router can produce should by rather high (ideally 1 kW upwards).</p>

<p>The routers that would fit my needs/budget best i think are the following:</p>

<p><strong>Makita RT0700C:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>(+) round enclosure and easy to mount (steadily) to a brick of wood</li>
<li>(+) static I/O switch</li>
<li>(+) variable speed control</li>
<li>(+/-) heavy(ish) (3.3 kg or 7,3 lbs)</li>
<li>(-) 710 Watt</li>
<li>(-) bulky head</li>
<li>(-) ~140 € (in Austria)</li>

<p><strong>Kress 06082206 1050 FME-1:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>(+) POWER (1050 Watt)</li>
<li>(+) static I/O switch</li>
<li>(+) variable speed control</li>
<li>(+) lightweight (1.7 kg or 3.7 lbs)</li>
<li>(+) quite small, round enclosure which makes it easy to mount in a lift</li>
<li>(-) ~200 € (in Austria)</li>
</ul>

<p>While i can bring myself around to using one of these (and probably will), on my search for THE perfect router, i stumbled across <strong>CNC motors</strong>. They are perfectly round metal cylinders with a very low profile (they average at around 5 cm in diameter), weigh next to nothing and are relatively cheap (compared to routers). My favorite at the moment is something i found on eBay for ~100€ with 1.5 kW.
As there are plenty of videos, tutorials, plans, opinions and whatnot out there on the subject i feel like i'm missing some major point here. Why isn't anyone using CNC motors for their homemade router tables? Especially since all those start with some kind of ""As i'm on a budget, i'm using..."" in the end it's some 200€ router.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance, so long...</p>
","<p>I think you may be misunderstanding what a CNC motor is. The CNC motors are stepper motors, and they can be precisely directed to move the X, Y, and Z axes of a CNC machine They need the appropriate signal to tell them to spin, and by what amount. A CNC router still has a regular router attached to it.</p>

<p>This picture may be helpful (image from <a href=""http://www.probotix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">probotix.com</a>):</p>

<p>The green motors in the picture are the CNC stepper motors. They drive the positioning of each axis. The router actually doing the work is the yellow thing in the middle; it appears to be a standard Dewalt 618.</p>

<p>Note that if you did try to use a motor that isn't already built to be a router, you'd still be missing a lot of important parts, perhaps the biggest of which is the chuck. How would you attach the bits to the motor? Whatever solution you come up with is likely to be an additional expense, and given the speed routers run at, do you trust it not to come apart on you while your bit is in the work piece? </p>

<p>Another consideration is, how are you going to move it up and down in the router table? The Dewalt in the picture has a spiral channel running the length of the motor casing that allows you to twist it to position it higher or lower (I'm simplifying a bit here, but that's the gist of it). Other routers have similar mechanisms. You could probably use a router lift, but once you're buying or building that, you've lost a lot of the cost savings you're going for and might as well have just bought a normal router.</p>

"When did people start using plywood rather than real hardwood?","941","","<p>It seems like old furniture is usually built using nice solid wood but recently (from my perspective) there has been a huge surge of plywood use even in handmade furniture. When did this start happening? When did technology become available to make plywood?</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>When did technology become available to make plywood?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Plywood in the sense of cross-grained veneers glued together is actually very old, for example various sources claim the Egyptians and ancient Chinese used materials that are basically plywood although it wasn't made in quite the same way as the modern stuff is with whole logs steamed and then peeled apart by a giant knife!  </p>

Rotary-cut method, also referred to as peeling.</p>

<p>Plywood in the modern sense is a 19th century thing, but I believe the actual commercial production of it didn't get going until the early 20th. Sources vary somewhat on this, but it is the case that early in the 20th century plywood as we would understand it today starts to be seen used for things like cupboard backs, drawer bottoms and, quite quickly, found its way to major parts of furniture like the main field of a cupboard door (where it would have a good-quality veneer on at least the outside face, sometimes on both faces). </p>

<p>Much modern mass-produced furniture no longer uses plywood by the way, for the major boards it is now most common to see various grades of chipboard/particleboard, or MDF, with various laminates on the surface. These laminates are mostly melamine-coated paper but occasionally real wood veneers are used, obviously this is on higher-end stuff.</p>

"Building a large dining table and wondering if my design is strong/structurally sound enough","934","","<p>The table is 9' 6"" L × 36"" W × 29"" tall.</p>

<p>The frame and the legs will be 1 ½"" T. Apron on the side is 2"" T, 1"" tapering to 1"" at the end. The legs are 4"" W at the top, tapering to 2"" at the bottom. Wood is white oak.</p>

<p>I'm planning on building sort of torsion box on the frame (+ some cauls or whatever they're called to keep the top from warping).</p>

<p>Given a weight of 48lbs/ft3 for white oak, it seems the top will weigh in at about 170 lbs (!).</p>

<p><strong>So, the question is:</strong> Do you think the frame is strong/solid enough to carry this weight? And do you think in general this will be a sturdy and wobble-free table?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>wondering if my design is strong/structurally sound enough</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A torsion box is obviously very stiff and stable, and this would make for a very very strong table just as it does with workbenches constructed this way. </p>

<p>But it's complete overkill for the kinds of loads a normal table would require, think about the much sparer structure of a standard 7' (2.13m) dining table which are often capable of taking the full weight of an adult. And anyway torsion-box construction is best suited to tops made from plywood or another manmade board where they can be rigidly joined throughout.</p>

<p>Even on a table of this kind all you should need is three or four 'stringers', one between each pair of legs and one or two in the middle somewhere. And it is directly from these that you can attach the tabletop, no need for extra battens. </p>

<p>The best options for attaching the tabletop to the apron IMO are with hardwood buttons or expansion plates, as shown in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2720/will-these-table-legs-support-this-table/2731#2731"">this previous Answer</a>. Even on a table of this size you shouldn't need more than eight (two per side). But you could add a third along the long sides if you feel the need, it won't harm the structure in any way if you use more than are strictly necessary.</p>

<p>I would suggest you alter the design in another key way as well, to make the structure underneath distinctly narrower than the top, so that it has the common overhang that tabletops have. If you make any sort of apron or under-frame flush with the sides of the tabletop itself at certain times of the year when conditions are exactly right it will be dead flush as when it was made. But it could be slightly narrower during the wet season when the top expands, and most importantly slightly wider during the dry season when the top shrinks, which will look very strange!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>do you think in general this will be a ...wobble-free table</p>

<p>That's entirely down to how flat the floor is and how accurately the legs are cut to length :-) </p>

<p>Any four-legged table will be stable and free from wobble if those conditions are met.</p>

<p>Assuming the grit is embedded at least 1/3 of this diameter, you would ""cut"" into the wood about that far per row of ""grit"".  So it depends on the length of your sandpaper (a 1 inch piece of 80 grit sandpaper is going to cut less than a 10 inch piece per stroke, probably about 10:1 if I had to guess).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>exactly as the blog author stated she did it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you find your suitable equivalent product I would suggest a few minor deviations from the process described. </p>

<p>The first is to do with stability. </p>

<p>Normally you want to let wood get used to the conditions in which it will be installed prior to use, a process called acclimation, and professional floor crews will try to have the flooring material delivered to the installation site a couple of weeks or longer prior to laying the floor. I would suggest that after you bring the product into the house you open up the ends of the packaging (to allow air easier access to the wood) and then wait at minimum five or six days before you use it, but a fortnight or longer won't hurt.</p>

<p>The second is to do with the staining. </p>

<p>The material is pine or another similar softwood and they are notorious for not staining evenly, giving a blotchy/uneven appearance if the stain is applied directly to them without preparation. This blotching is clearly visible in all the post-stain photos at the link.</p>

<p>The way to solve this problem is to partially seal the wood, a process that used to be called sizing. Commonly these days this is accomplished with a commercial product called ""pre-stain conditioner"", but I don't recommend you buy one of these. Instead, use diluted varnish or shellac, which does the job as well or better than the commercial product and for a fraction of the cost. In addition to reducing or eliminating blotching, sizing the wood will also even out how the pine takes the stain so that there isn't such a characteristic 'stripy' end result:<br>

<p><strong>Suppliers</strong></p>

<p>The start of forward momentum comes that this chair is apparently available through many manufacturers. Likely they are from the same template or root supplier but either way they are out there. These are the ones I found that appear unique enough. There were more but some appeared to be cookie cuttered from others.

<p>I'm planning of installing 4"" tubing around my basement shop that leads to a new dust collector with more HP.</p>

<p>How can I calculate how much HP is required. I don't want to waste money buying a new dust collector that can't handle my tube layout.</p>
","<p>Note that 90 degree bends greatly restrict airflow and should be avoided as much as possible.  Long sweeps, less severe bends, and diagonal runs of dust collection pipe will cause a smaller drop in static pressure.</p>

<p>Edited and condensed from my answer on using a <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/773/49"">shop-vac vs. dust collector</a>...</p>

<h2>CFM vs. Static Pressure, defined</h2>

<p>Air volume is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM) or liter per second (l/s)--the volume of air that the device can move from its intake to its exhaust in a given amount of time.</p>

<p>Static pressure is measured in inches of water (often referred to as inches water column, or inches WC), as in, how many inches the suction device can lift water up a pipe, or in millibar (mbar).</p>

<p>In simple terms, static pressure determines how much resistance (“static pressure loss”) your dust collector can overcome in order to move a given volume of air through the hoses and pipes. When it comes to designing a dust collection system, the raw CFM figure is initially more important than the raw static pressure figure, though static pressure does come into play once you start designing your ductwork (more on this later).</p>

<h2>Is that enough CFM and static pressure?</h2>

<p>WOOD Magazine has a great <a href=""http://www.woodmagazine.com/woodworking-tips/techniques/dust-collection/figure-dust-collection-needs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> on calculating CFM and static pressure requirements for dust collection. Although the worksheets in the article may look intimidating at first glance, they aren't too difficult to fill out. The article includes some typical CFM requirements for various tools, some of which I've included or summarized below.</p>

<ul>
<li>Table saw, radial arm saw, miter saw, bandsaw: 350 CFM, 165 l/s</li>
<li>Belt, disc, or drum sander: 350-550 CFM, 165-260 l/s (depending on size)</li>
<li>Table-mounted router: 195 CFM, 92 l/s</li>
<li>Thickness planer, up to 13"": 400 CFM, 190 l/s</li>
<li>Thickness planer, 14""-20"": 785 CFM, 370 l/s</li>
</ul>

<p>Now let's look at some contenders for an entry-level dust collection system. A 1hp <a href=""https://www.grizzly.com/products/1-HP-Dust-Collector/G8027"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grizzly dust collector</a> rated at 8A@110V produces 500 CFM/235 l/s and 2.76""/7 mbar of static pressure. As you can see from the CFM figures above, under ideal conditions this dust collector should be able to capture most of the dust from most tools except larger sanders and 14"" or larger planers.</p>

<p>Remember, I said that was under ideal conditions. This is where static pressure comes into play. Every inch of pipe or hose, every turn, and every change in diameter produces resistance which your dust collector (or vacuum) must overcome. You can use one of the various static pressure calculators such as <a href=""http://www.billpentz.com/woodworking/cyclone/staticcalc.xls"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bill Pentz's static pressure Excel spreadsheet</a> to calculate the static pressure drop produced by your ductwork and hoses. For the Grizzly 1hp dust collector we looked at earlier, the total static pressure drop can be no more than 2.76""/7 mbar. If you plug only 500 CFM/235 l/s and 7 feet (2 m) of 4"" (10 cm) flex hose into the calculator, you'll see the static pressure drop is almost 3""/7.5 mbar, so we already need to look at a more powerful dust collector.</p>

<p>Although this is the simplest way to size a dust collector, you don't suddenly go from 500 CFM to 0 CFM. The excessive static pressure loss simply reduces the airflow through the system. Some manufacturers or magazines provide the CFM curves at various static pressures, which is helpful in determining whether you can sacrifice a few CFM for a longer run of pipe or hose while maintaining the recommended 4000 FPM air velocity.</p>

<h2>Other considerations</h2>

<p>Of course, even the best dust collector will not capture all the dust, and even if you pony up the cash for a HEPA filter your dust collector will disperse some amount of fine dust back into the air. That is why you should try to exhaust your dust collector outside if it is practical (while also venting outside air back into the shop), and you should still wear a well-fitted respirator with replaceable P100 (HEPA-equivalent) filter, regardless of any other precautions.</p>

<p>There is one way that I know of to mitigate this effect:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fill the edges of the plywood with a wood filler to take care of any little dings, scratches, gaps, or craters that might not be readily visible.</li>
<li>Sand the filler back to flat after it's dried/cured</li>
<li>Paint the edge with a flat primer to make an even base coat (like what you might do for a house's wall)</li>
<li>Sand the primer back to flat, reapply primer (repeat as often as necessary to achieve a uniform, flat base)</li>
<li>Paint the edge with the color of your choice</li>

<p>This will likely remove enough of the plywood edge that it will stand up to casual scrutiny.  If you're very detailed in your woodfilling and sanding, they results will be even better.</p>

","<p>The reason the lock miter bit is restricted to the router table is mostly for safety - it is a large diameter bit, and it exerts a lot of force on whoever is holding the router, be it you or the table.

<p>I would suggest building a temporary router table - just take a piece of plywood, cut a hole (easiest with a hole-saw) for the router bit to poke out, and connect the router base plate using mounting screws (check your router's base plate to see which ones you need. You might even got some with the router). The fence can be any flat piece of wood that you can clamp while adjusting the lock miter (and you can even screw the fence in after the setup is good). The fence doesn't need to be aligned in any particular way, and it should just be flat enough around the router bit. Clamp the plywood to another table, lower the bit all the way, turn on the router and slowly raise it, so that the router bit will make a hole in the fence for itself.</p>

<p>Something similar to this (picture from Google Images search).

"What material is suitable for a children's desk/furniture?","893","","<p>I want to build a children's desk for my wife's two nieces. I have some very nice oak but I don't feel like using something like that would be smart because it will be beaten up, painted over, and let's face it, not appreciated.</p>

<p>What would be a suitable material, in terms of durability and cost, for a children's desk? The desk would most likely be painted over with a ""children's"" color. I was thinking about using MDF but I don't know how it will hold up or how it compares in cost to, say, maple or oak. </p>

<p>Also, what tips/advice do you have for using the chosen material that would be different from using normal hardwood?</p>

<p>EDIT: I live in the Midwest so I will be limited to materials within the region.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>What would be a suitable material, in terms of durability and cost, for a children's desk?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a piece of furniture that's destined for the lifetime of abuses that children can inflict upon it, I view it from two different schools of thought.</p>

<hr>

<p>The first school says that since you expect the piece to be beaten up, painted, and generally neglected, you will want to make it out of a material that maximizes durability while minimizing cost.</p>

<p>For my money, this wood is usually southern pine or douglas fir.  I built my workbench out of southern pine for this reason.  Spruce is also a very strong material for it's cost and weight, though it dents very easily.</p>

<hr>

<p>The second school says that because of the abuse you expect, you should go ahead and spend your money on a hardwood that will take the abuse in stride.  Something that will not chip easily, something that holds a nice edge without denting, and something that doesn't show scratches just by looking at it.</p>

<p>For example, the bed frames my father built for my brother and I as kids were made of red oak, and they experienced their fair share of abuse from two energetic boys.  Both are now relegated to our hunting cabin and have been transformed into bunk beds that my brother and I use to this day, over a quarter of a century later.  They remain sturdy because they were built well out of a stout material.</p>

<p>In this case, a good hard maple or red oak would be perfect.  Both are fairly inexpensive (in my area, at least - your mileage may vary), and using them for something that the Queen won't use is perfectly acceptable.</p>

<p>For painting, poplar is a good choice since it takes paint well.  If I recall correctly, alkyd-based paint is best for poplar.  It's a fairly soft wood, so expect some denting.</p>

<hr>

<p>There is a tendency to want to cheapen the things we give to children because of the though that the kids won't appreciate them and that they'll abuse them.  I find that this depends on how the kid(s) is (are) raised.  Giving them something nice and instilling in them the idea that <strong>they</strong> are responsible for keeping it nice, I think, is one of the best things you can do as an adult.</p>

<p>Too often these days we/make buy crappy furniture out of cheap materials under the expectation that it will get used until it falls apart.  I say, ""no!""  The truly environmentally-friendly way to make furniture is to make so well that it will outlast you and your children.</p>

<p>I was planning on using blue painter's tape on the panel, and some on the foot of the jigsaw, to help prevent any scratching.</p>

<p>Should I cut this hole before doing my 150 and 180 sanding? The hole is about 100mm (3.9"") in diameter.</p>

<p>I worry that I'll get better sanding results without the hole in the way, but that I could have to re-do some sanding if the foot of the jigsaw scratches the surface.</p>

","<p>As Daniel B. mentioned, a jigsaw isn't the ideal tool if you want a smooth cut.</p>

<p>If you have a drill press, you can use a circle cutter for a smooth cut.</p>

<p>You can also use a small router and circle cutting jig to get a nice, smooth cut.</p>

<p>In either case, use a sacrificial piece of wood on the exit side of your workpiece to prevent blowout.</p>

<p>So making your own is going to work out a better solution for a lot of woodworkers, especially those building a collection of vintage chisels. And taking the DIY approach allows you to make matching protectors for gouges of any sweep and potentially any other edge tools you want to protect as well.</p>

<p>The 'high-tech' solution is to use a dip product or a mouldable rubber or plastic. Dips include the Dip Seal mentioned by LeeG as well as the classic Plasti Dip beloved of toolheads*. Mouldable products include Sugru or the homemade equivalent and for something harder a thermo-forming plastic like Utile Plast, Mold-It or ThermoMorph. </p>

<p>A low-tech solution is one of the oldest, and that is a leather cap. These are still fairly common today on some very large chisels like slicks and used by some woodworkers for their smaller chisels too. You can buy them from a few sources but some are homemade.</p>

"Not-so-obvious disadvantages of butt joints","884","","<p>Having just completed my first woodworking project (a twin-size bed made of 1x poplar and plywood), there are of course many things I would change if I were to do it again. Perhaps one of the more surprising to me (as a beginner) is my desire to not use butt joints (with only glue, or with pocket-hole screws). </p>

<p>Butt joints look easy, especially for beginner woodworkers who may not have a big selection of tools - just cut the pieces to length and glue, screw, nail, whatever. Their main disadvantages - strength and appearance, IMO - may not be a concern if it is strong <em>enough</em>, and the final piece will be painted or edges covered up with trim. Especially compared to cutting dadoes or M&amp;T, butt joints are simple to execute - in theory. </p>

<p>In practice, though, I found they are very difficult to align precisely and even a very shallow dado / groove or biscuits (though that's another tool) would have helped with alignment immensely. This was compounded by not having a good and flat surface to assemble everything on (an assembly table just moved high up on my project list). Having the glued-up pieces slide around while trying to tighten down clamps or nail in a brad with the pneumatic nailer was frustrating, and would have been a moot point with a different kind of joint.</p>

<p>Are there any other not-so-obvious drawbacks to butt joints, that may not be apparent to (beginner) woodworkers?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>In practice, though, I found they are very difficult to align precisely and even a very shallow dado / groove or biscuits (though that's another tool) would have helped with alignment immensely. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where a butt joint is an appropriate joint to choose the difficulty in alignment is their main downside. There are simple construction tips that can help overcome these problems, including creative use of clamps and registration surfaces (e.g. a stop block, or just the top of the workbench sometimes) to butt matching surfaces against<sup>1</sup> but there's no denying it can be a tricky thing to do in practice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having the glued-up pieces slide around while trying to tighten down clamps or nail in a brad with the pneumatic nailer was frustrating, and would have been a moot point with a different kind of joint.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, all wood glues are very lubricative and they can make a joint surprisingly slippery! </p>

<p>Anything in the same vein as a biscuit (including dowels, Dominos and splines) is one of the primary ways to fix alignment and stop things slipping around during glue-up because they lock in the positions of the two pieces of wood, sometimes relevant to the face sides only (biscuits) other times both up and down as well as side to side (dowels and Dominos).</p>

<p>But when making up large panels from a number of boards there's really no reason to resort to any of these because you can use a <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/229/what-is-a-good-way-to-prevent-jointed-tabletops-from-bowing-when-tightening-fast/241#241"">caul</a> to force alignment as you are clamping up. </p>

<p>Note that splines, dowels, biscuits and Dominos don't add any needed strength in a joint like this and in fact may slightly weaken the joint as paradoxical as that seems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there any other not-so-obvious drawbacks to butt joints, that may not be apparent to (beginner) woodworkers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other than being careful where one or both faces is end grain I don't think so. Anywhere that face grain is glued to face grain (whether longitudinal or radial) the joint created will be at least as strong as the wood around it.</p>

<p>This assumes the joint faces are properly prepared of course. They should be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flat (or occasionally with a deliberate curve, as in a sprung joint).</li>
<li>Smooth (the smoother the better, roughening the surface is almost never desirable).</li>
<li>This last one doesn't get mentioned often enough — freshly worked (older wood surfaces don't glue as well as those which have just been worked, ideally within an hour).</li>
</ul>

<p>And on top of the above it's important that enough glue is used so that it can fully wet the joint face <em>on both sides</em> and that sufficient clamp pressure is applied<sup>2</sup>. You want to clamp <em>hard</em>, firmly enough to squeeze out all excess adhesive because a thin film is nearly always the strongest<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>A little more on some aspects of this in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/4233/what-are-the-different-grain-directions-and-how-do-they-affect-joint-strength/4240?s=3|0.1136#4240"">What are the different grain directions, and how do they affect joint strength?</a></p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> These surfaces should be waxed or otherwise protected (e.g. with tape, packing tape is excellent for this but just about anything will do) so that any glue that squeezes onto them won't bond them to the workpiece.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Many woodworkers, including some pros, under-clamp and the fact that there aren't more joint failures is a testament to the bonding strength of glues. But where joint strength is critical, and in butt joints the glue is the only thing holding the wood together so it's a critical example, you want to tick all the boxes and that includes very strong clamp pressures being applied to ensure a thin glue line. In butt joints we should be aiming for glue lines that are nearly invisible, certainly not easily seen at arm's length.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> An exception would be when using epoxy, which doesn't require clamp pressure to ensure a good bond and which can make a very strong bond even in a thick film.</p>

"Why are bed slats not attached?","883","","<p>Planning a wooden bed frame. I am considering why bed slats I've seen seem to always just rest loosely on top of the frame rather than join to both sides. I know wood expands and contracts with heat/humidity but since the ends of the bed are also expanding and contracting in the same direction, why would these need to be separate? Perhaps it's for easy replacement as they more likely break. Maybe it's due to the weight of the mattress and occupants? If I made then of similar strength to the header and footer rails, I would think these problems would go away.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I know wood expands and contracts with heat/humidity but since the ends of the bed are also expanding and contracting in the same direction, why would these need to be separate? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The slats aren't moving in the same direction as the ends of the bed just because they're both going side to side, they're at 90° to each other in the other axis (the ends being upright, the slats being flat). So this means the ends will tend to expand up and down, the slats along the long dimension of the bed.</p>

<p>Just in general, when boards are not joined together movement tends to be very easy to deal with because it's only each individual board's movement that you need to account for, which can be small enough in many cases you can ignore it<sup>1</sup>. It's when boards are joined together and these small movements become one larger movement that we have to pay attention. </p>

<p>As to why bed slats are frequently not attached I think it's simply because they can be, they don't have to be fixed in order to work. And by not fixing them you save time and effort in drilling holes, driving screws or whatever. But where it is important for one reason or another<sup>2</sup> bed slats are fixed to bed frames. </p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> As in the apron of a table for example.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Bed slats are stronger when fixed at the sides and quite a bit stronger when fixed very firmly, e.g. when glued down or mounted into a housing groove or dado. </p>

<li>glue back of drawer back on</li>
<li>glue front of log onto front of drawer</li>
<li>glue back of log back onto log</li>
</ol>

<p>It appears there's also a secret compartment in the bottom of the large 3-compartment drawer. That secret compartment was probably cut out after step 2, then the secret drawer itself was created using a similar process:</p>

<ol>
<li>cut off front and back of secret drawer</li>
<li>cut out compartment</li>
<li>glue front and back onto secret drawer</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that in step 1, you typically don't cut off the front of the log or blank if you are going to have one or more drawers that are visible from the front; instead you cut off the front after you cut out the drawer(s).</p>

<p>You may have noticed from the sequences of steps above that there are basically 4 cuts that you can mix and match in different orders to come up with pretty much any bandsaw box design: cut off the back, cut off the front, cut out the drawer(s), cut out the compartment(s) in each drawer. Once you know this, you can also look at any bandsaw box and work backwards to figure out how it was made.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I couldn't find seams or joints or anything.</p>

<p>Because the bandsaw blade's kerf is so small, it's possible to close up any entry cuts or other seams so that they are practically invisible. You can also strategically make cuts with the grain to make them even less visible.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>when I am levelling out wood with my plane, I get little pits (likely I suspect from the blade chipping against denser areas. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is called <em>tearout</em>, it is not caused by denser areas of the wood (in fact it can be common in softer sections of a piece of wood). </p>

<p>It occurs when bundles of wood fibres literally tear free from the surface of the board instead of being cut neatly by the plane's iron (plane blades are now commonly referred to as irons). </p>

<p>The usual recommendation of a solution to this is to plane 'uphill', where the grain rises upwards and away from the direction you are cutting, versus 'downhill', where it is rising towards the edge of the iron. However not every board is uniform in grain and it is very common to find areas of rising grain in just one portion of a board that is otherwise easily planed (this is the case both on the faces as well as the edges of boards). </p>

<p>Some species are well known for having grain that can frequently change direction, and hard maple and certain types of oak are commonly noted for this characteristic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any suggestions or recommendations to help improve the quality of the surface while manually levelling out my working surface? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It may be impossible to avoid, but there are a few things that can minimise the problem. Most are adjustments to the plane itself, some of which are obvious and some are not.</p>

<p><strong>Reading grain</strong><br>
Before we get to plane adjustments one thing you can do in all cases is strive to plane in the correct direction, <em>even if this means changing the direction you plane multiple times over the surface of the wood</em>. This is not as easy to do as it is to write, but it can be used as part of the fix for this problem and many experienced woodworkers do this when required.</p>

<p>Rather than attempt to exhaustively cover <em>how</em> to read grain here (would make for an excessively long answer) I'll just link to <a href=""http://www.popularwoodworking.com/projects/reading-grain-direction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this detailed piece on Popular Woodworking</a>.</p>

<p>Now to the plane itself. </p>

<p><strong>Plane tweaks</strong><br>
There are three things to look at:</p>

<ul>
<li>the sharpness of the iron</li>
<li>cap iron setting </li>
<li>blade projection</li>
</ul>

<p>It should evident that you should strive to have your plane iron as sharp as you can possibly make it. This is always preferable anyway, but here the sharper an iron is the more likely it can cut through tricky grain rather than have it rise up and break free from the wood surface.</p>

<p>The second adjustment is not at all obvious and that is the setting of the cap iron (commonly called a chipbreaker today). For easy planing on wood with simple grain this can be set back from the cutting edge, possibly 1.5mm (1/16""). But it can be set much closer than this, and should be where a finer surface is desired as well as when experiencing tearout. For this it can be set ""as close as you dare"" as one woodworking guru puts it. Which in practice can be a fraction of a millimetre, e.g. 0.2mm (0.008"") <em>or less</em>.</p>

<p>Lastly, projection. If you adjust your plane to take the thinnest shaving possible tearout is minimised anyway, combined with the above two tweaks you can eliminate it entirely. </p>

<p>Measuring the thickness of plane shavings accurately is fraught with difficulties and not everyone has a digital calliper anyway, so visually the shavings should be whispy, sometimes described as ""lacy"", and at thinnest should barely hold together if handled. More like the ones at top than the ones at bottom in this image:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZwA3p.jpg"" alt=""Plane shavings compared""></p>

<p>If you find that you cannot bring everything together so that you get no tearout at all, it should at least be minimised. To tackle the last of it I would recommend that you switch from sanding to scraping as much as possible for final smoothing. </p>

<p><strong>Scraping</strong><br>
Card scrapers are inexpensive and produce a surface that is actually superior to sanding with less effort, and often faster (even when compared to power sanding). </p>

<p>I'll be purchasing a home sometime soon and will finally have a garage space all to myself for woodworking (cue celebratory dancing).</p>

<p>Previous shops (owned by my father) used some combination of incandescent or fluorescent bulbs for lighting, along with natural light coming from the windows.  As far as I could tell, the color rendition was fine, or at least acceptable with these options, and they gave enough light to work.</p>

<p>Some of the LED options I've seen include more lightbulb-size lights, light tubes along the lines of fluorescents,  and wall strips.  Color warmths vary.  I've only used LEDs for smaller lighting fixtures in the home (60 watt equivalent fixtures).</p>

<p>How do LED lights compare to incandescent and fluorescent lights in the home workshop?  Assume the workshop isn't heated, if that makes a difference.  Also, there will only be a couple windows (assume I'll keep the garage door closed).</p>
","<p>Specs are on line: you can do your own comparisons. Factors to consider:</p>

<p>Brightness. A fair comparison would be between lamps delivering about the same number of lumens.</p>

<p>Color temperature. Lower is, paradoxically, what we call ""warmer color"" -- more red, less blue, similar to incandescent, and higher color temp is ""cooler"" coloring with a shift toward blue. Which is ""better"" depends on where your work will be viewed, plus personal preference; the same issue exists between warm and cool white fluorescents.</p>

<p>Color accuracy score. Fluorescents tend to have strong light at specific color ranges, and can mislead you about how colors will balance when you leave the shop and get more varied/natural lighting. I believe both LEDs and incandescent generally score better here.</p>

<p>Efficiency. LEDs win hands down for lumens per watt, commonly about twice as efficient as modern  fluorescents and six times as efficient as incandescent.</p>

<p>Maintainability. LEDs last longest without attention, and unlike fluorescents the don't lose some of their life every time you turn them off and on. LEDs can last so long, in fact, that some fixtures are designed to be discarded and replaced after many years of service rather than being re-lamped.  That offends my sense of waste, but it can be cheaper to buy one of these than to buy the corresponding number of LED retrofit tubes and plug them into a traditional shop light. I'm currently struggling with exactly that decision.</p>

  <p>My understanding is that connection points would mostly have sliding forces when the shelf is bent under load, but I'm not sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'll answer this from a structural engineer's standpoint (being that I am one).</p>

<p>What you're doing here is making a <em>composite shape</em> out of your wood shelf with steel reinforcement.  As this shape bends, in order to behave compositely, you need to restrain the relative slipping of the OSB layer over the steel layer and develop what's called <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_flow#Shear_flow_in_semi-monocoque_structures"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">shear flow</a></em> between the two layers.</p>

<p>The math behind the answer is beyond the scope of this SE, but I'll try to give you a belt-and-suspenders answer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Screws are obvious answer, what size should I get and how many? Or would glue or rivets suit me better?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have 18mm (~ 11/16"") thick OSB and 4mm (~ 3/16"") thick steel straps for a total depth of 22mm (~ 7/8"").  I would go with 19mm (3/4"") long round head or pan head screws, say a #8 or #10 screw size, spaced at 100-150mm (4""-6"") on center.  You'll have to drill through the steel strap, obviously.</p>

<p>Personally, I'm a fan of SPAX screws for OSB since they have an aggressive, self-drilling thread pattern.  They make a <a href=""http://www.spax.us/en/multi-material-construction-screws/unidrive-pan-head.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pan-head screw</a> that would be just about perfect.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Pcq4.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Pcq4.jpg"" alt=""screw""></a></p>

<p>Most glues will not form a long-term or reliable bond between steel and wood, so I would not recommend that.  Rivets might work, but I'm not too optimistic about their long-term holding power in wood compared to screws (and they're harder to install).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@Ashlar Yes, to stiffen the shelf. Max load is 100kg more or less evenly distributed. Shelf's depth is 1m.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would space the straps at the approximate third points of the depth of the shelf (i.e., 33cm from either the front or back).</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:  I just did a quick back of the envelope calculation on your shelf.  The shear flow between the two layers will be on the order of 200 lb/in (or 100 lb/in per strap).  So, the #10 by 3/4"" screws at 4"" centers should work.

"What kind of woods can be riven with a froe?","865","","<p>I've never used a froe before but I'm enamored with the idea of making my own boards.</p>

<p>Right now, I use splitting wedges to make quarters small enough to feed through my bandsaw. This results in a lot of waste as the wood never splits cleanly. 5"" is usually the best board width I can manage once I'm done cutting.</p>

<p>I've looked at videos of wood being riven with a froe (not making individual planks, just squaring off the sides) but the wood being split is never identified. It always looks clean and smooth and I think that would fit through a bandsaw much better.</p>

","<p>I may be off a little on this, but from my experience of looking up antique tools, a froe was primarily use to spit roof shakes (shingles). Back in the day when to homes were made with the local trees, whether cut by pit saw, adz or other means, shakes where cut with a froe after the logs where cut to a specific length, somewhere in the 20""-24"" range. The wood was a straight grained wood as mentioned before, depending on what was available in the area. Some areas had cedar, others had douglas fir and oak. There may be other species out there, but I man not familiar with them. If I remember right, there is still a company that sells hand split shakes, well there was a few years ago. </p>

"Are there any best practices when using dado blades or stack?","861","","<p>I recently got an <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0012YF25Q"" rel=""nofollow"">8"" dado set</a> for my table saw, and was a little nervous about using it without the normal safety equipment I usually have in place (primarily a riving knife), especially since they've been deemed ""dangerous"" enough to be banned in Europe. I want to approach my use of the set with a thorough understanding of the dangers involved. <strong>Are there general guidelines of what to do/not do with a dado set installed?</strong></p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can I cut dadoes with the work piece against the fence, or should I strictly use a miter gauge or crosscut sled?</li>
<li>Obviously using both the fence and miter gauge at the same time would still be a kickback risk.</li>
<li>Are through cuts a definite no-no with dado stacks? If I need to make one quick one, should I just go through the hassle of switching out the dado stack, reinstalling my regular blade and safety equipment?</li>
</ul>

<p>So far, I've made a zero-clearance insert to replace my standard insert so there isn't a gaping hole in my saw table around the blade.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Can I cut dadoes with the work piece against the fence, or should I strictly use a miter gauge or crosscut sled?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on the nature of the cut. A <code>dado</code> is technically a slot cut across the grain (a crosscut), so in that sense, yes, you would typically use a miter gauge or sled.  A <code>groove</code> is a slot cut with the grain (like a rip cut). Regardless of whether you are cutting a dado or groove, if the edge parallel to the fence and blade is significantly longer than the edge perpendicular to the blade, it often makes more sense to use the fence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""2"">
  <li>Obviously using both the fence and miter gauge at the same time would still be a kickback risk.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are not making a through cut, there is no offcut to be pinched between the blade and fence and kicked back. Many woodworkers and woodworking publications do not consider cutting a dado or rabbet to provide a significantly increased kickback risk with the workpiece against the fence, although you should not make a cut you are not comfortable making.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""3"">
  <li>Are through cuts a definite no-no with dado stacks? If I need to make one quick one, should I just go through the hassle of switching

  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>You can make through cuts with a dado stack, but you must keep in mind that you will waste more wood and will have a more limited depth of cut. You also cannot use a stock riving knife, so you could potentially have an increased chance of kickback over using a normal blade along with a riving knife. If you do make a through cut, definitely ensure that your workpiece is not in contact with both the miter gauge (or sled) and fence as you make the cut.</p>

"How do I prevent stain from being removed during sanding?","845","","<p>I am refinishing an old Remington 870 stock birch stock. I stained it with a dark cherry colored stain, and then began to apply <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000I1QA6E"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hope's 100% tung oil</a>. I had read to wait at least a day before sanding and applying the next coat, though <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/573/how-long-does-it-take-tung-oil-to-cure"">that</a> seems to be a short period of time. However, when I sanded the stock, much of the stain I had applied was removed along with the tung oil (if I recall correctly, I was using 340 grit paper, and I had cut the first application of oil about 50% with mineral spirits). </p>

<p>I decided to restain the whole stock, and ended up staining it several times, letting it dry and wiping down with mineral spirits to remove the tackiness between each coat (I know that multiple coats are generally advised against, but the birch wasn't accepting the stain evenly and this helped me get a fairly even, nice stain). The stock is now fully dry (wiped the access stain off a day or two later with the help of mineral spirits, and then let dry for a week). </p>

<p><strong>My question is</strong>: is there a way to properly apply tung oil to the stained wood without removing the stain during the sanding process? Do I simply need to wait longer for it to dry, not sand between the first couple of coats, use a finer grit sandpaper, or what?</p>

<p><em>Bonus question</em>: This being my first woodworking project, my sanding left something to be desired. There are very minor sanding marks in the wood that I didn't notice before staining. They are mostly in the same direction of the grain of the wood, but a few of the swirls I didn't match perfectly. Is there anything I can do to fix this without removing the stain and starting over? It doesn't bother me very much, but I would feel unacceptably lazy if I didn't even make an effort to fix it. </p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>My question is: is there a way to properly apply tung oil to the stained wood without removing the stain during the sanding process? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup: <em>don't sand</em>. </p>

<p>Drying oils are not a surface coating, they're a penetrating finish, so basically there's nearly no difference between sanding oiled wood and directly sanding the surface of the stained wood, which many guides specifically warn not to do. </p>

<p>Even when sanding a film-building finish (shellac, varnish, lacquer) great care must be exercised not to sand too much as if you break through the finish you can almost immediately reveal bare wood because stain penetration is extremely shallow. </p>

<p>Drying oils don't need to have the previous application sanded if they're applied appropriately. While it's become common advice to sand or scuff the surface when applying subsequent coats of tung oil in particular, but BLO as well, this is by no means the only way to do it. </p>

<p>The traditional method for applying drying oils specified that the surface should be wiped extremely thoroughly after application and in fact buffed hard with the wiping cloth, which ensures removal of all excess oil from the surface, and simultaneously burnishes the surface of the wood. Both of which were considered vital to the development of a good oiled finish. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are very minor sanding marks in the wood that I didn't notice before staining. ... Is there anything I can do to fix this without removing the stain and starting over? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically your options are scraping or sanding to remove the marks, unless you switch to a film finish which can hide minor surface defects.</p>

<p>An oiled finish magnifies flaws, doesn't hide them, which is why surface prep for an oiled finish must be done more conscientiously than if using varnish, e.g. sanding to a higher grit. FYI when varnishing there's no benefit to sanding beyond about 220 grit and in fact you can often get away with stopping at 150, while if you're doing an oil finish it can be advisable to sand beyond 400.</p>

<p>Bonus answer to a point in one of your comments above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've read that with tung oil the first couple coats will get fully sanded away and the pulp mixture will fill in all of the imperfections in the surface</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's true to a degree but actually not the ideal way to go about doing this. </p>

<p>If you want to fill pores in the wood it's <em>far</em> preferable to use a grain filler, either homemade or commercial. Preferable because the results can be superior, and you get there faster and more reliably.</p>

<p>Since you might ask, homemade grain filler can be made from fine sanding dust (220 grit or higher) mixed with varnish; some people use oil as the binder but varnish sets harder and faster so it's preferable. You could also experiment with using wood glue.</p>

<p>It looks nice, but of course from a stability point of view that is probably one of the worst table designs to come up with ;). A lot of force is on those box joints, of course this is just a couch table for some glasses and a bowl of chips, but still.</p>

<p>I'm pretty new to woodworking, and only have an electric jigsaw at the moment, a manual saw and will get some chisels. 
If I work carefully will it be possible to make the joints fit well enough to make the table as stable as it needs to be? Or would I really need precision machines like a table saw with box joint jig?
I'm aware this will be quite a bit of work... Any tricks to make this easier?</p>

<p>Also, does the wood used matter much? The example table is made from    acacia, but I would prefer birch. Is there a difference in hardness, for example?</p>
","<p>Before I get to the whole box joint part I will tell you there is a difference with hardness is woods. <a href=""http://www.wood-database.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wood-database</a> is a great website to get information on a given wood. I think acacia is harder then birch. Not to familiar with it. But you could really use any wood you would so like. Also I would get some bar clamps for the gluing part. And for glue I recommend Titebond. I use type 2 (water resistant).</p>

<p>Now I going to make some pictures but they are not going to look the best, since I will have made them :). So here is the process I go by.  </p>

<p>So in the image above is the first step. Going from one end of the board tote other end measure at 1/2 increments (or to your liking). And you need to put the lines back the same distance as the thickness of the wood. So you know were to stop. The best would be to draw a line across the back of them lines so you do not go to far. Going to far will cause a gap OR the finger will hang out (if done for all of them. But not like in the image, do each one separate. but make sure that you do it from the same side on each or it will not line up, if that makes sence. Then once done and them lines line up put a X on every other. Those you will be cutting out. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0cIt1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0cIt1.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So above I have the 'wood' up close with the X's. The little squares represent the jigsaw (or any other ) blade. You should have the blade a little ways from the line. If it is centered on the line you WILL have gaps. And as you may guess by having it a it away there still will be some wood to remove. That is were sandpaper or a chisel can come to play. I recommend sandpaper. Take a block that is smaller (width) so you can get in there and file away the wood to the line. This will give you the most control*. I would use 60 grit sandpaper.  a chisel would work, but I think that the chisel can go off and chip out what you do not need. But can still be used to get close and finish the box. Just take your time and it will pay off. </p>

<p>Gluing is easy (I think). Just glue like you would any other board. It does make a difference were the clamp is. Have the one clamping end on the tooth, were the one board touches the other. Hopefully you get what I mean.</p>

<p>There are many different jigs for a table saw and router table. But I have always done it with a band saw since I do not have the greatest luck with a router table or a table saw. There are many jigs online and on YouTube. You could also do a dovetail but I think for you being a beginner learn to do a box joint before a dovetail. </p>

<p>If you have any other question or I did not cover something or have any other questions let me know in the comments below! </p>

<p>*You have to keep square to the wood. And when sanding watch how you do it. I see people sand and go in a U or C like 'stroke'. I think you get what i mean just keep square. </p>

The 24-inch rails are rated at 50 pounds (20 kg) total, but I have to expect the bottom needs additional support for such a width and depth.</p>

<p>I was originally thinking some straight steel rods perhaps 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) in diameter placed under the bottom oriented front to back to prevent sag and relieve much of the load from the edges.  There appears to be little supply of such materials at hardware stores except coarse threaded rods, which seem tacky.  I imagined something stainless and smooth.</p>

<p>Usually, the quickest means of reducing drawer sag is to use a thicker bottom, as you've indicated was suggested in another forum.  For example, if you double the bottom thickness, you increase its stiffness by a factor of eight (stiffness is based on the cube of the thickness).  This is usually my first and only solution for large drawers.</p>

<p>You can also keep a smaller groove in your drawer sides (1/4"" is probably ok) and bevel or rabbet the edges of the drawer bottom to fit the groove.  The drawer needs to be thickest at midspan to resist the loading, so narrowing the edges really doesn't affect its strength.</p>

I tend to use <a href=""http://dhh.howyousign.com/?p=365"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> type of construction where the drawer bottom sits (and slides) on runners (see image below). When I first started building these sorts of drawers, I cut the drawers about 1/8 in less than the distance from bottom runner to top runner to ensure that the drawer fit. The problem was that the drawers would tip whenever I opened them. So I began modifying my design to allow a smaller gap. Now I'm at the point where I cut the drawers sides to the exact same size as the drawer opening, then run a handplane past it a couple times to get a tight fit that slides easily. The end result is that my drawers, even when fully extended, open parallel to the floor without tipping (like they used to when I used a 1/8 in gap).</p>

How do I combat these seasonal changes in drawer sizes?</p>
","<p>Yes, the 1/8"" gap that you mentioned is recommended precisely to account for wood movement, and you may find that the drawers fit too tightly once they pickup moisture during the more humid summer months.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you had constructed the drawers during the humid summer months instead of the winter, you would want a tighter fit to begin with, because the drawers would shrink and fit more loosely during the winter months.</p>

<p>You can also limit wood movement by using more dimensionally-stable materials such as MDF or plywood rather than solid wood.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that many factors contribute to wood movement, including material, species, climate, and grain direction. You can use the <a href=""http://www.woodbin.com/calcs/shrinkulator.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Shrinkulator</a> to estimate movement based on a specific material or wood species.</p>

"Why is my dust collector way too loud?","838","","<p>I have a 3/4 HP dust collector which uses an induction motor. I bought it on the assumption that the fact that it uses an induction motor means that it shouldn't be too loud, but it sounds like a jet engine. I suspect that the sound is not generated by the motor but rather by the fan. Is there something that can be done to lower the sound coming from the fan?</p>

<p>The dust extractor I have is similar to the one in the photo below, but the dust filter is fabric. The layout of the parts is identical, the motor is on top with nothing covering it, the filter and dust bag's location is the same.</p>

","<p>These are moderately noisy beasts. The best that can be said for them is that they're less noisy than a shop vacuum, and much less noisy than any of the large tools you're likely to connect to them. More expensive units, with thicker metal components, may be a bit quieter.</p>

<p>You can try to reduce resonance in the frame, but anything you try to do to the blower's internals will impede function. Some folks build what amounts to a sound-deadening closet to isolate dust collectors; that's your only hope for anything resembling whisper-quiet operation.</p>

<p>The other approach is to turn them on only when needed -- ie, when you'll be wearing hearing protection anyway. Remote controls exist to make that easier, either pushbutton or sensing the current of the cutting tool when it's turned on. The fanciest version, for those who are setting up larger workshops, automatically opens the blast gate(s) for just those tool(s) as well, so the whole dust collection system automagically configures itself as and when needed.

  <p>Is Danish Oil redundant to Polyurethane?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mostly yes, you'd normally use one or the other not both.</p>

<p>If you're already planning to use an oil-based varnish (any type) as the final finish on a project there's usually no reason to use ""Danish oil"" (or any similar oil/varnish blend) beforehand. Although this won't do any harm it adds an unnecessary step and yields no benefit. </p>

<p>There are two exceptions to this, the first is where the ""Danish oil"" is coloured so you're effectively using it as a stain. </p>

<p>The second would be for optical reasons, where you've done a comparative test and found it enhances the figure* or chatoyance of the wood more than the varnish applied directly to the bare wood. However, this enhancement is usually best done using straight oil, mainly because it's much cheaper (it can also give a more pronounced effect). </p>

<p>A hidden benefit of having oil on hand for doing this sort of thing is that you no longer need to buy a product like ""Danish oil"" because you can make your own version, very quickly and at a significant saving — all commercial versions of this type of finish greatly overcharge for one of the major components, the cheapest, the mineral spirits. This can sometimes be 75% or more of the contents of the tin!</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a folding walker? Here's a picture:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DVUO1.jpg"" alt=""folding walker""></p>

<p>The whole point of a walker is to support someone, so it needs to be stable in all directions. Lateral stability is provided by the parallel tubes in which the two frames pivot.</p>

<p>You could use a similar design for a tray table: a front panel connecting two frames which each swing out, or a two-legged front frame with two swing-out gate legs. Such a design would provide more foot/leg room and more stability, and would fold into a flat unit. I'm sure I've seen folding tray tables that use this concept.</p>

<p>Another option would be to build a set of nested tables that don't collapse at all, but which fit together in roughly the same space that a set of folded tray tables would occupy. These tables can be much more stable because they don't need to fold, but of course the tables need to be different sizes so each one fits inside the next larger one. You can make nesting tables to match any furniture style.

  <p>How can I flatten this thin wood back out?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's a chance that you won't be able to do this to your satisfaction. When sheet goods become warped due to poor storage conditions or bad stacking, or a combination of the two, they tend to take 'a set' which apparently can be impossible to completely remove. </p>

<p>Some improvement is certainly achievable, I've done this successfully myself on warped material, but I don't think you can get thin plywood like this back to absolutely flat which you may require for this application.</p>

<p>It may be possible to flatten plywood by dampening the material, in a high-humidity environment rather than by wetting directly, and then press it flat until it is dry. This works with some other board materials. But the pressure or weight needed would probably be outside the range of what you could rig up as it is in the range of hundreds of kilos per square metre at minimum and possibly a few tons (as you can achieve in an old cast iron book press). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there any tricks to storing such wood so that it stays flat?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Storing it horizontally on a dead-flat surface is really most of it as you'd probably guess, but the thicker you stack the more likely minor thickness imperfections in each sheet can accumulate which will mean the upper sheets will no longer be laying absolutely flat. </p>

<p>So shortish stacks on a known flat surface, with some weight distributed on top is probably your best bet. It may also be beneficial to use a sacrificial top board (e.g. melamine-laminated particleboard/chipboard) so that the uppermost sheet of ply is not exposed to the air on one side and not on the other. </p>

<p><strong>Material quality</strong><br>
I don't know if it applies to 1/8"" but with thicker material the usual recommendation in woodworking forums to get more reliably flat stock is to buy better material from a better supplier, although sadly this is still not an absolute guarantee you'll get flat sheets of ply every time.</p>

<p>Also, in case you are unaware ""Baltic birch plywood"" is by no means one uniform quality to begin with so it's possible you're not getting particularly good stuff anyway, and there is most certainly better-quality plywood than this. If you want to look at getting something high end be prepared for some sticker shock!</p>

<p><sup>Image from inside The Woodwright's Shop</sup></p>

<p>My issue was that he didn't really show us how he used the template while he was using the lathe. </p>

<p>In its simplest form I suppose you hold the template beneath the work piece while it is mounted on the lathe and eyeball where the changes need to be made. Then turn on the lathe and work while periodically checking the template. </p>

<p>I feel that could be an error prone approach. </p>

<p>So, that being said, how do you effectively use a 2 dimensional template, like the one Roy shows above, when turning?</p>
","<p>I can think of at least two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>use the template on a duplicator </li>
<li>use the template to set
calipers</li>
</ol>

<p>.... basically what keshlam said.  The first if you have a duplicator you can use the template to make the shape.  Most of us don't have a duplicator in our arsenal.

<p>The other is to use calipers to take measurements at key places. </p>

<p>First you take and lay the pattern by your work piece and mark the ends, and the high and low places.  if you have a round piece you can spin it and make lines all the way around the piece, this makes them show up better.</p>

<p>I think MDF or a good-quality plywood would be perfect for this application.</p>

<p>To get the curve, you would cut a series of parallel kerfs in one side of the board, similar to the image below.</p>

<p>The spacing of the kerfs isn't an exact science, more of a trial and error thing.</p>

<p>As you can see, you only cut part way through the board.  Ideally, if you use plywood, the ply you have left uncut has grain running perpendicular to your kerfs so that you're not bending across the grain.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm honestly not sure about thickness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would say your fascia board can be 3/4"" thick and be fine.  You would want to put another supporting board behind the fascia and under the stage pretty closely anyway to help carry the stage load.</p>

<hr>

<p>Otherwise, if you want to get really complicated, you could use a solid hardwood and steam bend it the old fashioned way.  Hickory, ash, and oak take bending well.  See this <a href=""http://lumberjocks.com/topics/21389"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">related forum post</a> for other woods.  Air-dried lumber tends to bend better than kiln-dried, FYI.</p>

<p>For as light of a bend as it seems you're looking for, you might just be able to use several thinner boards (say 1/4"" thick) and laminate them into the curve by gluing them into shape.  It's fairly easy to make a jig to do this:</p>

","<p>As wood ages it will dry out and become more rigid. Most portable thicknessers can get the wood down to approx. 1/4"".  Any thinner and the wood is at risk of tear out which will destroy the plank as it feeds in. Different species will perform better than others. How thin you want to go also depends on how you will be using the wood and how the grain runs through the piece. The thinner the piece the more likely it is to warp or cup.  You can search this sight for more insight into the relationship of the grain and the tendency to warp.  The risk of cupping will increase as you get wider and thinner, depending upon how much the grain lines curve in the cross section of the depth.  I would recommend testing on a sample or two and leaving it sit for a week or two to see how this wood performs. I also suggest planing in small depth increments to limit the risk of  tear out especially as you get closer to 1/4"". </p>

<p>What if I have no choice but to run it faster, what precautions should I take and what technique should I use?</p>

<p>For example, I am looking at a 1/16"" slot cutter with a stated maximum RPM of 16000, but the variable speed range of my router is 20000 RPM to 30000 RPM. Can I still use the bit to make the cut?</p>
","<p>In short: <strong>No.</strong></p>

<p>Compared to 16,000 RPM, 20,000 RPM is 25% over the specified maximum. Manufacturers -- even cheapish ones -- always calculate in a bit of tolerance, but 25% over limit is <strong>a lot</strong>. I wouldn't mind running a 19,000 RPM bit (if that existed) at 20,000 if it was the only one I had available, but surely not a 16,000 one.</p>

<h2>What may happen?</h2>

<p>1/16'' (1.5mm) is pretty slim, these bits are not unlikely to break even when treated properly. Most reputable manufacturers here do not even sell such small bits except with very slim shafts (3mm), which are usually only available for ""toy"" routers (like a 175W Dremel or Proxxon) that are a lot weaker and usually allow speeds as low as 7,000, too. A ""typical"" router for a <em>Real Scotsman</em> normally cannot fit such slim shafts at all, and for good reason -- you can already predict with high likelihood what would happen if you clamped that tiny fragile bit into the router.</p>

<p>Indeed, when you do find such ultra-small bits here, you usually get them in packaging units of 10, which is <em>tell-tale</em> for their destiny. Or, to cite Robert Louis Stevenson:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>""Prophetic,""</em> said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger. <em>""And now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your name, we'll have a look at the colour of your blood.""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What <em>will</em> happen?</h2>

<p>Nobody knows! The two most likely things to happen will be either nothing at all (""works fine""), or the bit ripping off right away near the shaft as you plunge in.</p>

<p>It is <em>usually</em> much more serious to have a wide-diameter bit go off (that's more like standing next to an exploding hand grenade). But of course, even a slim bit may just as well go flying somewhere, including the direction of your stomach or your face. You have no way of telling whether it will just work fine or whether you will die from injury.</p>

<p>Of course, desastrous failure can <strong>always</strong> happen with any kind of bit, all the time, and for a wide variety of reasons. Among them pushing forward too hastily, tilting, buying low quality bits, not maintaining bits properly, or just... <em>bad luck</em>. And, of course, running 25% over the specified maximum. Life is dangerous and often lethal, and power tools -- routers in particular -- are dangerous beasts.</p>

<p>But there is <em>reasonable</em> risk and <em>unreasonable</em> risk. Reasonable risk is wearing a knife-resisting vest (I'm actually doing that) which will catch 99.9% of all sharp objects that aim for your heart and your liver, and a polycarbonate face mask while working with well-maintained tools at the indicated speed. Or, more traditional, protective glasses and a thick cow leather apron.<br>
Unreasonable risk is... everything else.</p>

<h2>What may <em>also</em> happen?</h2>

<p>The bad thing about taking unreasonable risk (read as: being grossly negligent) is that not only is desaster a lot more likely to happen, but also that you are out alone in the dark with the consequences.</p>

<p>If the bit sends out shrapnels and you lose an eye or are otherwise injured in a non-trivial way, you may find that your casualty insurance tells you: <em>""Why! You ran 25% over the specified maximum, this had to happen""</em>, and refuses to pay the bills. The same can (almost certainly will) happen with your indemnity insurance in case you injure a bystander.<br>
If nothing else, that alone is a good reason not to go too much over the limits. The risks simply are not acceptable.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In terms of clear finishes I think the standard, or I should say <em>your</em> standard, for finishing maple will work for this too, broadly speaking. Some people aren't a fan of any finishes that add more yellowness to maple, preferring to keep it as light as possible by using a 'water-white' finish (most waterbased finishes, or lacquer), while others don't mind the yellow/orange tone imparted by shellac or varnish. Pick your poison. </p>

<p>The one caveat I'd add is in relation to highlighting any figure. Because this beetle attack and staining can occur on any random acer, ambrosia maple planks can also exhibit the whole range of features seen on unmarked maple (both soft and hard). Where this coincides with rippling or 'curly' figure in particular I think the finishing regimen should seek to highlight the rippling as you would otherwise, as IMO it's a crying shame to see this finished in such a way that it looks a bit flat, like on the left here:</p>

<p>One additional concern would be if you have areas that are punky, I don't believe it's anything like as common as on conventionally spalted woods but sometime the fungal attack has gone a bit too far and made the wood soft and spongy, and it's a PITA to try to work it and finish it. Often consolidating the area with a penetrating wood hardener, or superglue, is the only way to get a good surface and even at that there can be some slight textural difference between it and the unaffected wood which are only hidden if you build a full film finish.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There's also the question of whether to fill the holes with colored epoxy or leave them.</p>

<p>I'm of two minds about this, while I'm a fan of filling holes/voids usually (I like the look and that you don't leave a hole which can trap dust and other crud, making them very ugly) the holes here are a specific feature of this wood so it might actually be desirable to leave them, to showcase them.</p>

It's clearly always possible to start on a very coarse grit and work my way up to fine grits and stropping, but in some cases some of that work at the coarser end is unnecessary.   How do I figure out when it's OK (and a time saver) to start at, say, 400 grit or 1000 grit?</p>
","<p>In order to do this without gaining the experience to be able to assess what grit would be a good start, you would have to (I think this is why people are saying you really have to judge it.):</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a microscope to see the amount of metal that needs to be removed</li>
<li>Know the ""depth of cut"" of different grade abrasives</li>
<li>Choose the grade of abrasive that would cut as deep as you need material removed.</li>
</ol>

<p>To gain experience you really just need to do more sharpening. If you are concerned about removing too much material too quickly then start with a fine grit and see if that polishes some parts and leaves scratches or chips untouched. Keep using more coarse grit until the abrasive produces the same size scratches as you're trying to remove. Then start working your way through finer grits to remove the scratches from the previous grit.</p>

<p>As you improve, you'll naturally be able to look at the scratches or chips and know that it looks like you've just finished with 240 or 400 or 80 (gah!) and that's where you should start.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Are there any other hardware options besides two rods bolted to the wood top and wood base? </p>

<p>There are many types of bolts that might suit a project like this, depending on the exact design you arrive at. Have a look on <a href=""https://www.boltdepot.com/fastener-information/Type-Chart.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BoltDepot</a> for a pretty comprehensive overview of what's available. </p>

<p>In theory the entire table could be made from wood, using a hardwood dowel to act as the hinge pin. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any hardware to get it to lock at all different positions? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could do this in wood, again depending on the design you go for. Something like the adjustment bars that some reclining sun chairs use, where a hinged horizontal goes into slots spaced evenly underneath:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mMp5m.jpg"" alt=""Simple reclining mechanism""></p>

<p>There are also a variety of metal mechanisms that provide heigh adjustment for tables and ""lift hinges"" as used in many kitchen cabinets:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a way to make the wood sit closer to the desk, in the lowered position ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I were making this I would make the legs closer to the original laptop stand that provided the inspiration, so that they sit beyond the edges of the table portion and the entire assembly basically folds flat when fully lowered.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What type of wood does one use for something like this?</p>

<p>You could make this out of pine if the material is thick enough. Pine can work even for something that needs to take a person's entire weight, like a step stool, as long as it is thick enough and the joints are suitable, to provide the necessary strength.</p>

<p>For more compactness you want a stronger, stiffer wood. Oak would be a good choice. If you're in the US, white oak in particular. Hard maple would also be a good choice.</p>

"Routing boards without burn","796","","<p>It seems when I utilize routers, they always seem to burn the edge of the board at some point in the cut. I believe I am cutting at a relatively even speed (though this is obviously subjective). My router bits are fairly new (use wise), so should not be dull. I'm wondering what is the proper technique involved for using a router properly?</p>

<p>Some things I'm wondering are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should you see better results using a routing table instead of locking the board and using the router freehand?</li>
<li>Old vs. new router bits</li>
<li>Speed of the router (or power output), does it make a difference?</li>
</ul>

<p>Anything else which might be pertinent?</p>
","<p>Depth of cut tends to be one of the most important aspects to using a router that is often overlooked.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, you're better off taking very thin cuts when using a router.  This allows for consistent feed speeds without bogging down the router bit speed.  </p>

<p>If you're working with woods of varying density (ie. knots in the wood) then you'll want to size your cut depth based upon the worst case of what you expect to see.</p>

<p>The balancing act is taking lots of thin cuts takes more time and we often want to move on to the next portion of the project.  So sometimes you cut a little deeper and take the risk of scorching, knowing that you'll have to sand that out later.</p>

<hr>

<p>To address some of your questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should you see better results using a routing table instead of locking the board and using the router freehand?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A router table can provide better support for the material so you'll have more consistent results.  But some pieces won't fit on a router table and you need to go freehand instead.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Old vs. new router bits</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Age of the bit isn't as much of a question as <em>sharpness</em> of the bit.  Given that older bits tend to be more used and therefore less sharp, newer, sharper bits are the better way to go.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Speed of the router (or power output), does it make a difference?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to adjust the speed of the router based upon the size of the cut you're making.  Big bits need to be run at lower speeds.  Smaller bits can be run at higher speeds.  The primary concern is the friction generated between the bit surface and the wood.<br>
Big bits run at high speeds generate more heat from friction which leads to a greater chance of scorching the wood.</p>

"What is a shooting board?","795","","<p><a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/1298/180"">This</a> answer regarding preventing tearout when planing end-grain suggests using a shooting board. What is it, and how does it prevent tearout?</p>
","<p>""Shooting board"" refers to a family of jigs that are used for squaring the butts or end-grain of boards with hand planes. They are also used for joinery by planing multiple boards at once in an effort to match joint angles.</p>

<p>The basic premise is the same on most of the jigs: two flat boards, one on top of another. The wider of the two boards is placed on the bottom creating a fence for the hand plane to follow. On top of the boards is where you would create stops to prevent the piece you are planing from moving. </p>

<p>The hand plane typically will move at a right angle along the fence. Simple shooting boards cut at 90 degree angles but the stops or other fences can be positioned to allow other angles.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ypXLf.jpg"" alt=""Basic Shooting Board""></p>

<p><sup>Image comes from <a href=""https://www.inthewoodshop.com/ShopMadeTools/Setting%20Up%20and%20Using%20a%20Shooting%20Board4.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">InTheWoodShop</a></sup></p>

<p>The picture above shows the fence that the hand plane would follow. The top piece of wood is the stop where the wood piece is located. </p>

<p>Variations of that design will allow for different results. As mentioned earlier, it could be used in joinery. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/79biz.jpg"" alt=""Double Mitre Shooting Board"">
<sup>Image comes from <a href=""https://www.inthewoodshop.com/ShopMadeTools/Setting%20Up%20and%20Using%20a%20Shooting%20Board4.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">InTheWoodShop</a></sup></p>

<p>In the above Double Mitre Shooting Board you see that the basic design is still there: a fence for the plane, and stops. Planing two pieces at once, when properly mounted, will give both ends perfect angles. This particular jig could be used for framing and cabinetry. </p>

<h1>Preventing Tear-out</h1>

<p>I have not personally used a shooting board but at first glance it does not seem designed to prevent tear-out. That first impression was in error of course. When used <em>properly</em> the shooting board will shave a small controlled portion with each pass. Also, the fence is designed so that the plane will follow along at a 90 degree angle. Normally freehand planing could allow for <em>slight</em> changes in angles based on pressure and your work piece - the theory being that the controlled movement stops tear-out.</p>

<p>More importantly: As long as your plane is sharp and not protruding too far, the pass on the shooting board will slice and not push the wood. This should prevent tear-out as well. </p>

<p><strong>Aside</strong></p>

<p>If you are having issues visualizing how this works, without constantly damaging the fences, this picture gives some context and detail that cannot be seen from general pictures of shooting boards.</p>

"Best surface for a workbench / desk?","792","","<p>Tl;dr  -  durable, affordable desk surface. <br/>
I want to build a large (9ft x 2.5ft) workbench/desk.  I'm planning on doing a lot of soldering and building on it, but I also want to be able to do homework and writing as well. If the surface has dings in it, it'll be a pain to write on.</p>

<p>I would prefer some kind of laminate but I'm afraid it will be melted if I have a soldering accident.  What is a good, durable surface for a desktop that won't melt or ding easily?</p>

<p>I'd prefer something that I could get for under 50 USD or so for the area specified.</p>

<p>Is there some kind of wood that would be OK for this application?</p>

<p>I have some basic woodworking tools (miter, table saw) and determination so I don't think available tools will be an issue.   Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Edit: Eventually I've decided on an easily removable and tile-able system of tempered hardboard held in place by gravity and a small edge of the desk.  This way I can easily swap out sections by lifting it off and replacing.</p>
","<p>You mentioned a few requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>suitable for soldering</li>
<li>suitable for writing</li>
<li>less than $50</li>
</ul>

<p>You have several options for a soldering table. The anti-static laminate ones I used in college looked just as good when I worked in the computer repair shop on campus as they must have when they were brand new. As long as you don't touch the tip of your soldering iron directly to the surface, you're not going to burn the table. In my experience, dripping solder cools and solidifies immediately upon contact with laminate, and brushes off easily.</p>

<p>I've also seen soldering tables with MDF tops that took a lot of abuse from hundreds of students over the decades, but they were still in reasonably good shape despite some ""character."" I'm pretty sure the tops were intended to be replaceable.</p>

<p>If you plan to do a lot of soldering, you may want to consider a surface that can be refinished, or design your table with a sturdy flat subsurface and an easily-replaceable top surface.</p>

<p>Of course, if soldering isn't going to be your main activity on this table, you can also lay a board or mat on top of the table anytime you pull out your soldering iron.</p>

<p>Pretty much any surface can be made into a writing surface if you're writing in a notepad, but if you're talking about laying a piece of paper directly on the surface, that can sometimes be an iffy proposition. Personally, I wouldn't give this requirement much weight unless you're talking about building a drafting table. Pencils work great on smooth surfaces, but a surface with a little texture works better for ballpoint pens than a perfectly smooth surface. If you've ever tried signing your name on a piece of paper on a very smooth surface, you know it can be an exercise in futility. Of course, if your material or surface is too soft, you can end up etching the surface when you write on top of it.</p>

<p>Your budget gives you a lot of options on both the new and secondhand markets: MDF, hardwood-veneer plywood, laminate, or even solid, reasonably hard hardwood if you can find a local lumber mill. In terms of selecting an appropriate species of solid wood, see <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/807/what-minimum-level-of-hardness-on-the-janka-scale-is-appropriate-for-a-desk-to"">What minimum level of hardness (on the Janka scale) is appropriate for a desk top?</a>. You may even be able to find some appropriate material at garage sales, on craigslist, etc. If you have a university nearby, you may be able to find a lab table from a chemistry lab. If you have a Habitat for Humanity ReStore nearby, you may be able to find granite or laminate countertop material pretty cheap.</p>

<p>A previous version of your question also mentioned sheet metal, but regular steel rusts if not sealed, and stainless steel and aluminum are very expensive. Also, thin metal will dent easily. Thicker, more dent-resistant metal is even more expensive.</p>

<p>You didn't mention what plans you have, if any, for finishing, but a durable varnish such as polyurethane will also help protect your table from abuse from soldering and writing, as well as any spills. It will also help protect against minor dents.</p>

"securing 3/8"" plywood to studs","792","","<p>I am getting ready to put 3/8"" plywood up in my shop for the walls.  I was going to borrow my dad's pneumatic stapler but I forgot it.  What I do have is a 16 gauge nailer that takes nails from 1"" to 2"".  (While this might fit better in DIY, I'm here and its for my woodshop!) </p>

<p>What I want to know is will 16 gauge nails do an adequate job holding the plywood on my walls?  If so what length would be best and what kind of coverage would be needed?  I was thinking 1.5"" about every 8"" on the studs. As a bonus, there is a cement block around the base and the plywood will actually be able to rest on the blocks.  </p>
","<p>I don't know that I would trust 16 ga nails from a pneumatic nailer, regardless of length, unless there were quite a few of them. The issue is the difference between the body diameter and the head diameter (or lack thereof). </p>

<p>If you're going to be hanging tools and/or shop cabinets full of heavy tools from the plywood, I'd recommend finding another fastener like wood screws or in a pinch, drywall screws. Either of those at 1-1/2"" long would be bulletproof, spaced every foot to 16"" or so vertically. They'd also let you remove the plywood if you need to run more electrical circuits, etc.</p>

","<p>You could drill as deep as the hole saw allows, then use a chisel to remove the ""plug"" left behind.  Then drill again with the hole saw.  One thing I would highly recommend anytime drilling using a hole saw is to give the chips a place to go.  In this scenario I would drill a smaller hole using a spade/forstener bit inside the hole but overlapping with where the hole saw will be cutting.  Like the red hole in this diagram:</p>

How can I keep the tabletop together while the glue sets without using clamps?</p>
","<p>If you're using most modern glues you do need clamps*, or some substitute, here. Hide glue is the one exception since it can be used to create <em>rubbed joints</em>. Although some people use PVA-type glues in this way in limited circumstances hide glue is the only adhesive that you can really do this with and achieve a proper result at a large scale (that result being that the joint ends up stronger than the wood around it).</p>

<p>So you need 'clamp pressure' but you don't have clamps. There are two ways around this, first is to use a type of clamping board and second is to build your own wooden clamps which as you'll see below is not quite as daunting as it seems.</p>

<p><strong>Make your own clamps</strong><br>
There are a great many versions, from simple to more elaborate, cheap to more expensive. </p>

<p>If you need clamps that costs the least and take little time to make this is probably the best basic design:</p>

Whatever you build it must be quite robust as you need to exert significant pressure for a good glue joint to form — your glue lines should be invisible or nearly so. In addition to looking so much better thin glue lines are <em>much</em> stronger than thicker ones using most adhesives.</p>

<p>*There is a school of thought here that the correct answer is you should just go buy the necessary clamps. They don't have to be expensive to work well and they will have use in the future, you can be guaranteed of that. And in case you haven't heard it yet there is a common understanding in woodworking that you can't have too many clamps :-)</p>

<p>These days the best kind of longer clamp on a budget is arguably the extruded aluminium sash clamp. There are many makes and apparently most are virtually identical. They're usually very affordable and in some markets sets of four, six or eight are sold at a significant discount. </p>

<p>Where they're commonly available pipe clamps may also be worth considering since you can buy the clamp heads and then make clamps of almost any length by buying suitable pieces of iron pipe.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Kiln Drying</h2>

<ol>
<li>Kiln dried lumber is more readily available</li>
<li>Much faster than alternative drying methods</li>
</ol>

<h2>Disadvantages to Kiln-Drying</h2>

<ol>
<li>Loss of Character</li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juglans_nigra"" rel=""nofollow"">American Black Walnut</a> is a great example of a wood that suffers when kiln dried. The wood looses tremendous character when it is dried in kilns. The heart-wood and sap-wood boundary is not nearly as vivid in kiln died walnut. This can be considered a benefit if the wood is used in certain commercial situations such as flooring. However in fine woodworking the loss in character is generally not desirable.</p>

<p>Another wood that I have noticed a difference in character between kiln dried and air dried is American Cherry, where the general depth of the color is noticeably muted in kiln dried cherry boards.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Potential Drying Defects</li>
</ol>

<p>Improper kiln drying can lead to some drying defects that may be difficult to see to the unaided or untrained eye. Examples include <a href=""https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/1495/FPL_1369_ocr.pdf;jsessionid=CC9C96B15C5BA74B1A378C1A4AE8D4B4?sequence=1"" rel=""nofollow"">honeycombing</a> and <a href=""https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/1495/FPL_1369_ocr.pdf;jsessionid=CC9C96B15C5BA74B1A378C1A4AE8D4B4?sequence=1"" rel=""nofollow"">case-hardening</a>. These during defects usually render the lumber unsuitable for most fine woodworking and can also pose danger when working the wood in certain situations.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Air Drying</h2>

<ol>
<li>Less Chance For Drying Defects</li>
</ol>

<p>The biggest defect from air dried lumber is improper moisture content and perhaps warping due to poor stacking techniques. Problems such as case hardening and honeycombing are not found in air dried lumber.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Better Color Retention in Certain Species</li>
</ol>

<p>The difference in color and character between kiln dried wood and air dried wood of the same species is unmistakable for certain species as mentioned above. Walnut and cherry are the most easily distinguished, although I am sure there are others. </p>

<h2>Disadvantages of Air Drying</h2>

<ol>
<li>Time</li>
</ol>

<p>Air drying is just plain slow. The general rule of thumb is 1 year + 1 year per inch in thickness.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Storage</li>
</ol>

<p>Properly curing wood usually takes lots of good dry space. For most lumber operations this is a luxury that is tough to justify.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall kiln dring is hard to dismiss as a viable way to bring wood to market. Most of the wood I have used over the years was kiln dried and very little of it suffered from any of the drying defects listed above.</p>

<p>However it should be noted that due to the potential loss of character in certain species of wood, air drying should be considered if you are looking to work with these woods or want to highlight the natural character of woods with very dissimilar sap wood and heart wood.</p>

<p>Also, if I were to woodburn it, should I do that before application of polyurethane?</p>
","<p>You will want to do the woodburning before you apply finish.  It's usually a good idea to lightly sand the area around the woodburn after doing the burning and before applying finish.  Woodburning has a tendency to create little ridges at the periphery of the burn.</p>

<p>Make sure you remove all of the sanding dust from the stick before applying finish.  This can be done with a rag wet with water or mineral spirits, or you can use a <a href=""http://www.rockler.com/tack-cloth"">tack cloth</a>.</p>

<p>Applying polyurethane may be done with a <a href=""https://hostedmedia.reimanpub.com/TFH/Step-By-Step/display/FH01DJA_POLYFI_02.jpg"">bristle brush</a>, a <a href=""http://images.meredith.com/diy/images/2009/02/p_SCN_136_06.jpg"">foam brush</a>, or even a rag.  It all depends on the type you have bought, and the can will give you directions for applying the finish.</p>

<p>If it's a spray polyurethane, read and follow the directions to see the ideal shake time and distance from which to spray the finish.  Remember that it is best to apply several light coats instead of one very thick coat.  This is because the light coats will dry more evenly with less dripping.</p>

1) Media blasting with crushed glass media alone (no finish sanding).
2) Media blasted with crushed glass media, followed by finish sanding with Buffy Pads (Sashco version of 3M non-woven pads). You can make out a faint line in between the media blasting and the Buffy pad sanding.

They will often choose to sample the stain on some scrap piece of wood from around the house. When the real home staining starts, after all prep is done and they're now applying stain with a sprayer, they find that the color is much darker than their sample. It's why we wrote that blog post and preach ""PROPERLY sample"" everywhere. </p>

<p>That said, for sure - you can use these different types of wood prep to get the ""ombre"" stain look that is popular these days. Just don't do it on a full home unless you're really daring and on the cutting edge of log home style. :-)</p>

"Safety - Cutting multiple pieces at the same time","767","","<p>I'm barely a novice carpenter, in fact all the wood work that I do is for my college's technical theater program, but I'm handy with saws, and other power tools.</p>

<p>I've been told by many people I work with that I should never cut more than one piece of wood on the miter saw at a time. I think this is ridiculous. When I ask them to explain how its more dangerous, nobody has a good answer.</p>

<p>It seems to me that if I need two pieces of identical length, I should cut them at the same time. If they're small enough, maybe three in one cut.</p>

<p>So my question to you all: Is it dangerous to cut multiple pieces of wood on a miter saw in one cut? What about other powered saws?</p>
","<p>There are a couple main (safety) concerns with this: the pieces moving while cutting and the offcuts getting caught in the blade.</p>

<h3>Pieces moving while cutting</h3>

<p>This is not so much an issue with safety as it is with accuracy. If one (or all) of the pieces move, you'll need to redo the cut on at least one of the boards, potentially negating any time savings you would see by cutting multiple pieces at once. Risk is negligible if everything is clamped.</p>

<h3>Offcuts getting caught in the blade</h3>

<p>This is probably not as much an issue on a miter saw as it is on other powered saws. Offcuts always have a change to get caught in the blade, although this situation is riskier since you are continuing to cut after an offcut is made. Typically, your offcut would become free at the end of the cut, at which point you turn off the saw. In this case, though, you are continuing to cut, so you have to be aware of what those offcuts are doing (and where your board is pushing them). With a miter saw, the blade is probably moving away from the offcuts, so likely not a big risk. Clamping again can reduce this (clamp both the ""keep"" side and the offcut side), but does introduce a potential problem with binding.</p>

<p>Thanks to @JacobEdmond for pointing out that stacking the pieces vertically on a miter saw can lead to the offcuts falling into the blade. Positioning the pieces in front of each other leads to a much safer cut.</p>

<p>For the same reason you don't want to run a piece in a crosscut sled against the fence (use an offset fence instead), you want to be careful about confining the pieces too much after the cut. You don't want the offcuts to get caught in the blade, but a loose offcut in the blade is much better than an offcut which is confined - that leads to flying wood and other Bad Things.</p>

<h3>Your bigger issue is likely to be accuracy</h3>

<p>Getting 2 (or 3 or more) boards lined up exactly together, with a stop block, clamp, or other registration device, is likely to take a relatively long time in order to make an accurate cut. More time, likely, than just setting up a stop block and making 40 ""single"" cuts instead of 20 ""double"" cuts in the first place. In addition (thanks again to @JacobEdmond), any error in your miter saw setup (blade angle, bevel angle, etc) will be amplified across the bigger cut.</p>

<p>Consider the time to line up the pieces, put a clamp on, butt up against the stop block (or measure with a tape and mark), ensure the pieces are still lined up, and cut. Compare that to the time to butt the piece up against the stop block and cut.</p>

<p>So, while it can be done relatively safely, it may not gain you much in terms of speed - unless your tolerances are fairly loose.</p>

"Can you make shaker doors out of one piece of MDF?","760","","<p>I've seen people make raised panel doors out of one piece of MDF. I've also seen a professional machine make a shaker door out of one piece. But is it feasible for someone to make one with a handheld router? Would the inset middle area be smooth? If so, what type of bit would be best?</p>
","<p>It is perfectly feasible to fab a shaker door from a solid slab of MDF. Routing out the interior flat area is a simple matter of proper jigging and depth control. But you will need to chisel-cut the inside corners and invest a lot of time sanding out the panel area. A router will not leave a 'finish' grade surface when the bit is acting as an end-mill. The best bit to use would be an up-spiral 3-flute bit with 1/2"" shank. Bit diameter of 1/2"" probably best when balancing strokes necessary to rout down versus difficulty. You'd need to set up two jigs - one as a perimeter jig and another as a platform to ride on the frame while routing down to panel surface.</p>

<p>BUT... That approach is not the only approach to the ""MDF Shaker Door"" problem.</p>

<p>With MDF as the material, and a router as your only tool (unless you say otherwise), the simplest approach I would suggest would be using two thicknesses of MDF, one for the frames and one for panels. Rout the frame as a unit from the thicker stock, rout a rebate on the back side to accomodate that panel, chisel-clean the corners of these from rounded to square. Then rout the panels out of the thinner stock and glue the panels into the frames.</p>

<p>That will get you there, but is wasteful of the thicker MDF stock (the lost middle parts), and the unsightly joint on the back side.</p>

<p>To do this using the least amount of material, and again with only a router, approach it as a true panel door. Rout the Stiles and rails of the door as individual items from thicker stock, rout a groove into the inner-facing edge to receive the panel (groove size to match panel material). Rout the panels from the thinner MDF sheets. Rout out some splines from the thinner stock, to match depth of groove times 2 and as long as the stiles are wide. Assemble doors with glue, sliding splines in from ends until they contact the panel. Clamp flat.</p>

<p>So, no matter how you go about this you are in for a fair amount of labor. My personal preference would be for the wasteful but simple way, as it asks the least sanding time after assembly.</p>

<p>And in closing, I suggest that you reconsider using MDF at all if that is an option. While it is cheap and in common use it is really not the best stuff to use for a number of reasons. For an inexpensive shaker door, solid pine and pine ply panels would look as good and hold up better over time. And it's doable with just the router, using the last of the options I posted above.</p>

"How can I minimize snipe while thickness planing?","760","","<p>I usually notice a small amount of snipe on the ends of the boards I run through my thickness planer. It's not too deep, (&lt;1/32"" maybe?), and doesn't cover too much of the board length (&lt;4"" on either end), but it's noticeable if I inspect the boards closely enough.</p>

<p>I've heard lifting the far end of the board a little higher than the section in the planer helps reduce snipe, but so far I haven't been able to <strong>consistently</strong> get a board <strong>completely</strong> snipe free.</p>

<p>Just for background purposes, I'm using a DW735 with the infeed/outfeed tables installed.</p>

<li><p>feed several pieces in one after another. If I feed piece B before piece A exits, the rollers don't have a chance to drop (and hence, there's no chance for snipe). </p></li>
<li><p>Similar to #1, you can build a jig to prevent snipe. Take two strips of sacrificial wood that are the same height as your workpiece but longer. Screw these pieces to the workpiece and feed it through. The planer will then snipe the jig, but not the workpiece. Here's a picture:</p></li>

","<p>As always this sort of thing shouldn't be asked as ""What's the best..."", because it's usually the case that there is no best, many options may be equally viable. For this if you asked multiple professional woodworkers I'd bet each would have their own ideas about how this should be treated for the proposed location and there's no way to be sure if one is head and shoulders above the others without trying it. </p>

<p><strong>Film finishes</strong><br>
This is varnish or what we can loosely refer to here as lacquer, which would include the epoxy as proposed by Stoppal. </p>

<p>Epoxy or the right type of lacquer (e.g. an automotive finish) on paper seem like the perfect solution as they can <em>in theory</em> provide a reliable and durable 100% waterproof coating. </p>

<p>But, and this is a big but, this assumes even and thorough coating — no voids, thin spots or pinprick holes. Best of luck treating something this intricate and avoiding every one of those potential weak points in the recesses! Spraying such a finish on (which is practically the only possible application method) would actually make complete coverage harder, not easier.</p>

<p>There is exposed end grain everywhere on a carving like this and if water can get to it it will suck it up like a sponge. If this does occur it will leading to areas of localised swelling and within short order you could have cracks forming and possibly delamination. </p>

<p>As such I think this is the least good of all the options, despite at first glance appearing to be the best.</p>

<p><strong>Wood preservative</strong><br>
Just because this is a decorative piece it doesn't mean it has to be treated any differently to other pieces of exterior woodwork, so wood preservative as you might use on a fence is a perfectly viable option here. Clear/colourless and coloured versions are available. </p>

<p>In addition to commercial wood preservatives homemade options are possible, using for example a borax solution, something which is gaining renewed popularity in recent years as people look for non-toxic alternatives. You make up a concentrated solution and then brush it liberally on the wood, letting it soak in and dry. These retard microbial attack and deter wood-boring insects.</p>

<p><strong>Oil</strong><br>
No oil finish is waterproof, let's start by saying that. But what they can do is provide some protection, help preserve the original look of the wood (prevents greying/silvering) while allowing it to take on and lose moisture. Over time the wood tends to age 'gently' or 'sympathetically', unlike what can happen when water eventually gets underneath a varnish and causes patches of ugly discolouration.</p>

<p>In addition to the older, more tradtional pure oils (most commonly linseed oil in the West, tung oil in parts of Asia) modern ""oil finishes"" for exterior application are a possibility. These generally have waxes and resins added to provide better waterproofing and longevity.</p>

<p>Note that the above refers to raw linseed oil, not boiled linseed oil which is normally what would be recommended. This is one of the few applications where the raw oil is to be preferred. Raw linseed oil is also sold as flaxseed oil although it is commonly more expensive.</p>

<p><strong>Teak oil</strong><br>
Although I hate the name of this finish — it's not made from teak any more than Danish oil is made from Danes :-) — it has a long proven history of protecting wood, even with full exposure to sunlight and the elements. </p>

<p><strong>No finish</strong><br>
As odd as it might seem some will advise no finish for this, letting the piece weather naturally. Although this does include the likelihood of cracks forming with no finish on the wood it is free to dry out as fast as possible when it does get slightly damp. Often I would be in favour of this but I don't think it's advisable here without knowing the wood and its characteristics. It might be a species that does not like being wet and will begin to break down faster than you'd like. </p>

<hr>

<p>It's hard to tell from the one small photo but the piece looks pretty sizeable and might therefore not be carved from a single piece of wood. If it is glued up from smaller pieces there's a further unknown and that is whether the glue is soluble, water-resistant or waterproof.</p>

It has a sander tool icon on the cover yet it reads ""Do not use for hardwoods"". From the wikipedia it seems as hardwood refers to all kinds of trees except conifers.</p>

<p>Did I understand this right? Doesn't this mask gets quite useless if this can be used only on conifers? I am about to sand some older wood pieces that might be hardwood.</p>
","<p>The fact that there is any warning at all probably has to do with the fact that the mask's rating is only FFP2 and it can only filter <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respirator#Mechanical_filter_respirators"" rel=""nofollow"">94% of dust particles</a>, whereas other masks can filter 99% or more. FFP2 also only requires &lt;8% inward leakage, which seems like quite a significant amount of leakage.</p>

<p>The reason the warning specifically mentions hardwoods may have to do with the fact that hardwoods are generally more toxic, as Daniel B. commented. A collection of points from a University of Illinois at Chicago <a href=""http://www.uic.edu/sph/glakes/harts1/HARTS_library/woodhazards.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">paper</a> state:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Contact with the dust of many hardwoods can cause conjunctivitis (eye inflammation), hay fever, asthma, coughing, and other respiratory diseases.</li>
  <li>Some hardwoods can cause hypersensitivity pneumonia (alveolitis), and frequent attacks can cause permanent lung scarring (fibrosis).</li>
  <li>Some hardwoods contain chemicals that are toxic.</li>
  <li>Inhalation of hardwood dust is associated with a particular type of nasal and nasal sinus cancer (adenocarcinoma).  This type of cancer has a latency period of 40-45 years, and occurs to the extent of about 7 in 10,000 among woodworkers who are heavily exposed.  This rate is many times higher than the rate of nasal adenocarcinoma in the general population.  Over half of all known cases of this type of cancer are found in woodworkers.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet the paper considers softwoods much less hazardous:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Softwoods do not cause as high a frequency of skin and respiratory
  problems as do hardwoods.  A few individuals can develop allergic
  reactions to some softwoods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regardless of the higher rate of toxicity among hardwoods, any fine dust is hazardous and can cause respiratory ailments in sufficient quantities.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that most disposable masks cannot create as good a seal with your face as reusable respirators with replaceable P100 (or equivalent) filters, which filter 99.97% of particles 0.3 microns or larger.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Can I sharpen a carbide tool with sandpaper?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without knowing exactly what kind of paper you're referring to the answer would have to be maybe.</p>

<p>The term sandpaper is used very loosely, in addition to the many different grit types and bonding styles in various papers it can even be used by some to cover sanding materials that aren't paper-backed.</p>

<p>Some woodworking sandpaper will basically have no effect on carbide, it's much much too hard compared to the abrasive grit on the paper (quartz or flint). You can test this on the shaft of a solid-carbide burr, where you won't be able to get the paper to leave any scratches.</p>

<p>You can get some traction with aluminium oxide or silicone carbide papers, although the going will be slow. These two abrasives are used in most high-end abrasive papers, cloths and films (including wet-and-dry types) and they can be used to polish carbide. If they can polish it they are 'cutting' the material so can be used for sharpening too.</p>

<p>But in general this is something that calls for diamond plates of one sort or another:</p>

<p>You do have to be very careful about not altering the geometry of the bits and maintaining symmetry, so some more info:</p>

<p>A cheaper alternative to a commercial diamond plate would be to use a diamond paste applied to a flat steel plate of some kind. Diamond pastes are an inexpensive entrée to using diamonds in sharpening, particularly if you buy them directly from China. They are available in a wide range of grit sizes — commonly from 0.5 micron at the fine end to 30 or 40 micron at the coarse end (still relatively fine by abrasives standards) — and can be suspended in oil or a water. I would recommend going with the oil-based type for most users.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the dust from carbide is considered highly toxic so it's advisable to take appropriate precautions to protect yourself from inhaling any as you're sharpening the bits and wash the sharpening media down well afterwards if not using an oily medium.</p>

I am more than willing to add features to it since this is a problem I'd like to find a long term solution to (there is a fence too, not shown, that's just some extruded aluminum angles with a wood face, but I actually prefer just clamping wood to the table for fences because I don't have a good fence adjustment solution with a wide position range yet):</p>

<ul>
<li>Freehand, difficult to keep stable as mentioned above.</li>
<li>I tried putting the fence in but with the trim sticking out past both the plywood faces, I couldn't figure out how to make that work.</li>
<li>I also tried just carefully holding it vertically on the table. That was about the same as free hand, a little worse because it's easier to hold the router straight than it is to hold the plywood straight. Holding too high tended to pivot away from the bit, too low into the bit. Plus this was about as slow as doing it freehand.</li>
</ul>

<p>My goal is to have a way to do this quickly and cleanly, and as perfectly flush as the flush trim bit normally gets it. I want to put the piece on the table, zip it past, and be done. I also want to be able to do this in the future so I don't mind investing time into jig building / table upgrades.</p>
","<p>For edge routing, you need <a href=""http://www.toolboxbuzz.com/woodworking/shop-made-tools-router-table-fence/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a tall router-table fence</a>. Clamped to your router table, this provides a perpendicular surface to guide your boards past the bit. As the linked should point out, the bit gets buried into the fence's surface (ather than trapping the workpiece between the bit and fence which would almost certainly cause a high-speed kickback situation -- dangerous), so the fence can be used to control the depth of the cut. Fingerboards are usually mounted to the table go help press the workpiece against the fence and bit to ensure constant cutting depth.</p>

<p>(As @AloysiusDefenestrate pointed out in the comments, in this case making the fencs with a notch at the bottom edge -- or just setting it on top of a spacer -- would let the trim slide underneath and contact the bit while the panel rides safely on the fence and bearing.)</p>

<p>Oh, a few afterthoughts:</p>

<p>1) If you wanted to freehand this, clamping a 2x4 level with the top of the trim would give you a wider surface to ride on. Less effective if the trim overhangs both sides, unless you cut a notch in that support board's top inner corner.</p>

<p>2) If the right side of the fence is set back a hair from the bit while the left side is level with the bearing, you have essentially created a micro-jointer. (The fence I'm using now lets one side be shimmed out for just that sort of application.)</p>

<p>3) A horizontal router table, such as the ones used for ""production"" raised-panel work or mortising, would avoid the need to fight gravity.</p>

<p>4) The traditional, solution is to just grab a block plane and take off the excess that way... then, when you're close enough, switch to a sanding block for the last bit (which might be the case with the router too). Hand tools aren't always slower, especially when set-up time is considered!</p>

","<p>The easiest way to check if the sole is flat is to turn the plane upside down and lay a trusted straight edge across it in various places and orientations. If you can see light coming thru between sole and straight edge -- assuming it isn't a grooved sole -- then it isn't flat.</p>

<p>There are articles/videos on the web that will guide you in flattening the sole. Generally they do assume you have a reasonably flat reference surface  to support the sandpaper used to grind the sole flat. </p>

<p>The plane iron can probably also benefit from some flattening and honing, especially for inexpensive planes.</p>

"Why is plywood often undersized?","719","","<p>A lot of plywood products are slightly undersized by 1/32"", e.g. 23/32 instead of 3/4, 15/32 in 1/2, etc. The undersizing often requires very careful math and measurements when constructing things, or the purchase of specialty hardware such as the many plywood specific router bits.</p>

<p>Why is the plywood undersized?</p>
","<p>This seems to be a matter of manufacturing and in <em>some</em> cases quality (in the sense of <em>You get what you paid for</em>) which is more speaking of the choice of wood, type and thickness of core and type and thickness of the veneer. The one thing you didn't explicitly imply either is that the thickness of a sheet of plywood could also be inconsistently think throughout the sheet, which is also a pain. To quote the article that <a href=""http://www.popularwoodworking.com/techniques/basics/choose_the_right_plywood"" rel=""nofollow"">Maxime Morin found</a> which also concurs with bowlturners comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reasoning is that an undersized thinner panel will still fit in a groove cut at the nominal size, but an oversized panel would not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is hard to predict what each sheet class of plywood will end up like post manufacturing which is why there are grading systems<sup>1</sup>. It is also important to keep in mind that moisture will play a <em>small</em> part in this ( again.. more deals with quality.)</p>

<p>Looking at forums from people discussing this issue is just accepted as fact that this is a possibility that needs to be accounted for. One of the many reasons why I own digital caliper. Tool manufacturers are also aware of this because you see products like <a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/Freud-89-650-Undersized-Plywood-Hi-Density/dp/B000NJ7AZG#productDetails"" rel=""nofollow"">undersized plywood router bits</a> which are </p>

<p>This is one reason why MDF has such a cult following. It is easier to get a more consistent thickness and appearance (no knots!). MDF is recommended when you need to have consistent dimensions and don't mind the extra weight.</p>

<p>I'm trying to see if there is any worthy technical reference articles that discuss this variance but have not found any as of yet. </p>

<p>I can't find it again but there was a comment from another WW.SE user who mentioned something along the lines of ""This is why measuring in the field is important"". I believe the point being made was don't assume measurements. Measure twice, cut once. </p>

<p><strong>My Delusions Of Grandeur</strong></p>

<p>While mulling this idea around in my head I came up with the idea of joining the boards with box joints. Although they wouldn't need any strength to speak of, I think this would give the post a nice look. I'm even considering using two or four different types of wood to maximize the effect.</p>

<p>There are a ton of guides, tutorials, discussions out there on how to make box joints with the table saw or a router table and some kind of jig. By now it feels like I watched and read ALL of them :). While being excellent for cutting box joints for their intended size and application, none of them suit me and my idea. The room is somewhere under three meters (ten feet) high and so would the boards be.</p>

<p><strong>My Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Is the grain direction a problem for me? Box joints are usually cut into end-grain, I would cut them into long-grain.</li>
<li>If I use different wood(species), would the joints explode all over my living room while they probably expand at different rates/times?</li>
<li>What is the best tool to use?</li>
<li>What would be the best jig to use?</li>
<li>Is this completely loony or is there already an established way of doing this that I simply didn't find?</li>
</ul>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Is the grain direction a problem for me? Box joints are usually cut into end-grain, I would cut them into long-grain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In terms of cutting the joint initially, possibly depending on the method chosen. In terms of the finished joint, very much yes (see final point).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I use different wood(species), would the joints explode all over my living room while they probably expand at different rates/times?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Expansion and contraction is across the width of boards, not along their length, so I don't think you have to worry about it. </p>

<p>Even without using <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3441/what-is-the-maximum-width-for-a-full-cross-grain-glue-up/3533#3533"">quarter-sawn wood</a> the expansion across the width of single boards is usually small enough that it can safely be ignored.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the best tool to use?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I need to say it? There is no best. This sort of thing is so highly dependent on what's available and the experience of the user anyway that it's always better to ask this sort of thing differently, e.g. ""What tools would be good choices to cut this joint?""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What would be the best jig to use?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The jig you envisage in your Answer is probably the perfect solution here if cutting this joint by machine. And while I'm a big fan of jigs perhaps no jig at all is worth a moment's consideration, because one clear option that was overlooked above is doing this using hand tools.</p>

<p>I'm not going to actually recommend this because the amount of work would seem so overwhelming (and anyway it's trumped by my final point) but you asked for options so...... </p>

<p><strong>Hand tools</strong><br>
There's technically no limit to how long you could make a joint like this by hand. </p>

<p>This might seem contradictory given the known lower accuracy of hand processes compared to machine-cut joints, but just as in dovetailing <em>any irregularities are transferred to the mating piece</em>. So yes, you will get irregularity but the process factors it in.  </p>

<p>Also these joints would not require the level of tight fit that you'd want on the dovetails on fine furniture. Sloppy fit would be much more acceptable here, even desirable given the difficulty in interlocking over such lengths, and as you say it's not like this needs any strength to speak of.</p>

<p>You could use a router to hog out the centres, for speed and to reduce the effort needed, but an additional benefit of using hand tools for almost all the wood removal is that it gives almost total control over tearout if you do it right as all the cutting processes go <em>into</em> the wood, never exiting on long grain.</p>

<h2>Why this isn't a viable idea</h2>

<p>The elephant in the room: the little cubes of the cut joint are all short grain. This isn't just weak theoretically it's weak in practice. You will find if you do a quick test that even modest pressure against the fingers can be enough to snap them free. </p>

<p>I can't find any images but people have cut box joints/comb joints/finger joints as you're proposing here, 90° to the normal orientation, and almost invariably they get one or more breakages just when dry-fitting the joints. If you did manage to make it through that stage and complete glueing up without incident manoeuvring the piece into position you might get failures along the corners. </p>

<li>cross cutting to the target thickness</li>
<li>gluing the edges together. </li>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Is this process mandatory or cosmetic? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well for that style of board it's mandatory for the cosmetics :-) </p>

<p>Apart from allowing smaller offcuts to be used up, the standard board construction using small blocks of wood does have a structural reason: each glue joint make the board stronger.</p>

<p>But there's no technical reason you have to make an end-grain board <em>exclusively</em> out of little blocks, rather than longer pieces showing end grain. However, because end grain strips are inherently breakable across the grain you need to be concerned about their length and how they're aligned. And the final thickness of your cutting board is obviously a significant factor here too, a 25mm / 1"" offcut from the end of a board is weak enough that it can easily be snapped in half using the fingers, while a 2"" offcut from the same board would be much stronger. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Definitive yes, with caveats. </p>

<p>Using longer strips I think you have to stagger the joints (e.g. using 'running bond' pattern) for sufficient strength, as in these examples:</p>

<p>I think I'm just using cheap bits and much like the OP in the above question I am going through them like balsa wood.

<p>Should I always be using brad point bits on wood? It is what they are for is it not? How do I know how big my pilot hole should be? In general I try to use a bit the same size as the shaft of the screw I'm using (width without the threads to be precise). </p>

<p>How can I make better pilot holes. I've seen videos where you clip the end of a nail and use that but that seems more of a kludge than a solution. Worst case this could be a dupe of the other question.</p>
","<p>For most hard woods using a pilot hole the size of the shaft of the screw should be good enough to prevent splitting, since it is the shaft that would be 'pushing' out on the wood.</p>

<p>There are some that are hard enough that making the pilot hole larger than the shaft but still smaller than the threads is useful, but these are pretty hard woods and it is mostly to ease the driving of the screw.</p>

<p>The other two issues that could cause splitting would be putting the pilot hole to close to the edge of the board, and/or putting the screw in too tight.  when you have pilot holes and counter sinks in hardwoods, you don't need to over-tighten the screws, good and snug is perfect.  </p>

<p>It is easy to over-tighten with a power drill and the head of the screw with shaped funnel of the counter sink makes it easy to go to far and split the end of the board.</p>

<p><strong>Comments from BrownRedHawk</strong></p>

<p>Also, if your bits are burning, they could be overly dull and/or not enough feed pressure. Allowing the bits cutting face to slide can cause this. I've also had second hand bits sharpened inappropriately so the cutting face is narrower than the shank of the bit that caused excessive burning and poorly shaped holes.</p>

There's also a limit on the angle/shape of ""cuts"", since I can only hold it to the sander at so much of an angle.</p>

<p>They would all be a bit differently shaped, with varying handle sizes, groove locations, etc. So I'm guessing anything that uses some sort of shaped jig wouldn't work.</p>

<p>So, my main questions are: Would it be safe on a lathe to go down to about half diameter? If not, what would the best tool for the job be?</p>
","<p>I've made several wands on my lathe and it works just fine.  I've gotten them down to close to a 1/4"" thickness.</p>

","<p><strong>Lamination FTW</strong><br>
If the chair were a different type I'd have suggested solid wood (note: grain must go horizontally), but not for one like this. Laminating up a curved plywood back is <em>the</em> way to go here IMO as already suggested in @keshlam's Answer. Only one potential problem with this plan, and that is getting the thick veneers to do the lamination or cutting them yourself. </p>

<p>BTW you know these have to be glued up on a curved form, don't underestimate the amount of time making that will take. </p>

<p>And if you don't also make a reverse-curved one as well (female or male, depending on whether you decide to go curve-up or curve-down on the main form) you'll need a lot of clamps to make each back, and it would probably be worth using clamping cauls as well. Figure at least eight strong clamps tied up each time while the glue dries so factor that into your estimates of how long the whole process will take.</p>

<p><strong>If you did want to make it from solid wood</strong><br>
Even though I'm a handtool guy primarily because of the relatively specialised nature of the shaping of one side of each back* this has power tools written all over it. And the main one to get this type of thing done repeatably and accurately is the router, with an appropriate jig.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Making some sort of jig to then use a router - Would still require a lot of sanding </p>

<p>You're underestimating the surface you can get with a router. Just generally if your bit is sharp, you use good technique (appropriate feed rate, best routing direction relative to the grain) and you take a very shallow final pass you can get nearly finish-ready surfaces straight from the router. </p>

<p>Plus anyway, if the surface left by the shaping operation on this project were a little rough you should always be looking at planing or scraping before sanding. Scraping is like sanding on steroids. It's faster, produces a better surface and it doesn't use up a consumable product. <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1134/what-are-the-differences-between-sanding-and-scraping/1159#1159"">What are the differences between sanding and scraping?</a>  </p>

<p>You can yes but common woodworking glue (PVA-type, white or yellow) wouldn't necessarily be the best choice for the glue.</p>

<p>A much more solid fill can be made by using epoxy. Filled (or just coloured) epoxy is now a common material for filling voids and defects in wood. To a degree this kind of filler can stabilise a crack and add strength, but without some further means to hold the wood steady (e.g. a butterfly key, hidden bolt or dowelling) a crack may continue to open up, so it is worth taking at least one extra step as a safety measure. </p>

You may have to tap in several directions to get it loosened.</p>

<p>Once you've got the old one out, ensure that there isn't a lot of sawdust jammed into the collet. Looking closely at your picture, I can see some faint tan lines through the collet where it is probably clogged with sawdust. If the bit's been left in there for quite a while, humidity will have settled into the sawdust and hardened it quite nicely. Clean out the collet as thoroughly as you can, using dental floss and a small pick if necessary to get the dust out. That should help prevent the new bit from getting stuck. I'd also recommend not keeping a bit in the collet to prevent it from happening again in the future.</p>

<p>It's also possible, depending on how long the bit's been in there, and what conditions the router has been stored in, that there's a bit of rust binding the two together. If the tapping route doesn't fix it (though that should break the rust free, as well), a very light shot of penetrating oil (like WD-40) should help. If there's rust on the old bit when it comes out, that's likely your culprit. A few <em>very light</em> touches with some emery cloth wrapped around a dowel (of smaller diameter than then bit's shaft) should get rid of the rust. <strong>CAUTION:</strong> It's possible that you might make the collet too large by doing this, so you may want to leave that part for your friend to do when you return the router, so it's his problem to deal with if he sands too much.

"What is the purpose of a saw set?","689","","<p>I do understand what the set is but I suppose I have some questions about its purpose.</p>

The video was very informative in that regard and towards the end the topic turned to saw setting. </p>

<p>He showed, using a tool, how to set a saw. After which he showed how to reduce the set with a hammer.</p>

<p>I read that having a proper saw set reduces the chance of the saw blade buckling. At the end of the day: </p>

<ul>
<li>What is the purpose of a saw set?</li>
<li>Would there be a reason to remove it permanently?</li>
</ul>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I read that having a proper saw set reduces the chance of the saw blade buckling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One purpose of set is to reduce the chance of a saw binding in the kerf. This can lead to buckling, but with some saws it would be nearly impossible for them to buckle in use (a quality backsaw for example, due to the added stiffness provided by the sawback). </p>

<p>Saws with no set can also be described as having '0' set.</p>

<p>Set is not the only way to help prevent binding. Not used as much today, a saw can be made with a tapered blade: thicker near the cutting edge and slightly thinning towards its back.</p>

<p>Either method is particularly needed for rip saws, used for cutting along the grain. During ripping cuts pinching of the saw by the wood is common and starts to become more and more likely as the depth of cut increases (especially once the cut depth exceeds the blade height).</p>

<p>Note: even with set binding can occur so on long rip cuts or when re-sawing by hand it can be necessary to keep the kerf open with a small wedge near the start of the cut:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NBbjQ.jpg"" alt=""Wedge used to keep kerf open during ripping""></p>

<p>The other purpose of saw setting is to improve cutting performance (especially for crosscut saws). In addition to an improvement in the actual cutting done by the teeth, any saw with a flat blade and no set will naturally experience increased friction within the kerf so more effort will be required during sawing. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would there be a reason to remove it permanently?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it is not advisable for general-use saws but can work well for certain specialist applications.</p>

<p>Some specialist saws are manufactured with no set, for example flush-cutting saws. When sawing flat against a piece of wood any set on the teeth will tend to scratch the surface, so no set is very desirable on such a saw. Often the teeth have no set at all, but occasionally will have '0' set on one side only; for this type of saw care must be taken to have the side with set facing upwards.</p>

<p>You can also modify a saw for a particular purpose — very fine, <em>shallow</em>, finished cuts for example. As noted previously binding is increasingly likely as the depth of cut increases, which is why no set can work for shallow cuts that don't exceed the depth of the saw blade (also especially on crosscuts where there is less of a tendency to bind anyway). Regardless of the type of cutting being done, because of the increased friction regular lubrication of the blade with wax is advisable.</p>

<p>If you really want it glued, there's no problem with gluing it. But the whole point of using threads instead of glue or a wedged through tenon is that you can disassemble a threaded connection.</p>

<p>Two, that I can think of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Although threads cut in wood are plenty strong for many uses, they <em>are</em> cut across the grain and can break. If the threads are at all loose, the force of a mallet blow might be applied to just a part of the threads and cause them to break. Glue could help support the threads and spread the force of the blow more evenly.</p></li>
<li><p>If your mallet handle isn't round, then you'll want it to maintain a particular orientation relative to the head.

"Can I use a band saw to make a cutting board?","669","","<p>I don't really want a table saw because I think I could use the bandsaw/band saw for more things like resawing and curves.

","<p>I've done that: duplicate an old pig-shaped board with a fresh scrap of hardwood.  Trace the outline, cut out with a bandsaw, finish up the curves with files, and then use a router table to round over the top.</p>

<p>A bandsaw would <em>not</em> be good for making strips to glue up into a butcherblock style piece. It's not precise and straignt enough; though if you follow up on the jointer you can make it work, albeit with a lot more waste and possibly non-parallel sides to the strip.</p>

<p>If you make a <em>real</em> butcher-block, where the strips are turned sideways so the end-grain is the cutting surface, then the board's original top/bottom are the edges to glue up, and the cut sides are the new face. A jointer won't work on the endgrain, and the bandsaw is probably great for cutting slices from a large chunk of maple: it's what I would have used if I had one. The table saw blade was not tall enough to go through so I had to flip the piece and cut from both faces, and this produced a less-than-smooth cut that took more work (and more waste) to clean up.</p>

"Can I use sculptor chisels with a lathe?","667","","<p>I got a tiny (almost ""toy"") lathe, for turning wood.

The lathe, tiny as it is, is quite neat, but I really need a better tool.</p>

<p>I looked up turning chisels, and they are expensive (and I'm short on cash after the lathe purchase). I happen to have a neat set of small sculptor chisels though, and I wonder if I can use them instead. I'd <em>just</em> try but I'm afraid I'm going to ruin the nice chisels too.</p>

<p>The length/leverage should not be a problem - the lathe being so tiny, the rest for the chisel comes really close to the material. </p>
","<p>The following may read like I am trying to talk you out of the idea but I'm not, just hoping to help you go into it with realistic expectations. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can I use sculptor chisels with a lathe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, although I think you'd very quickly want to use some purpose-made turning tools if you start to do much turning, you can definitely use tools not designed for turning (see bottom point).</p>

<p>There are two main issues I think, number one being safety (primarily, securely holding on to the chisel during use) and edge wear. </p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong><br>
Even with a very small lathe the levering force from fast-spinning wood shouldn't be underestimated, particularly if a tip digs in which happens to nearly everyone at some point the potential for the tool to be snatched from the hand is greater than you're probably thinking.</p>

<p>See this Answer for a little on turning safety: <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1304/what-do-i-need-to-know-for-basic-lathe-safety/1305#1305"">What do I need to know for basic lathe safety?</a>  </p>

<p>There's also the issue of the toll on the tool itself, edge failure (not merely blunting which I cover next, but chipping), possible bending of the blade lower down near the handle and last but not least a crack forming in the handle (even with a tight-fitting ferrule in place).</p>

<p><strong>Edge wear</strong><br>
Almost every carving chisel will be a type of high-carbon steel, which will wear much more quickly than HSS, now regarded as the minimum standard for the metal for a turning tool. The harder and tougher the wood the more you'll need to sharpen, and without exaggeration this might mean you need to stop to re-sharpen every couple of minutes.</p>

<p>However, historically we had no HSS or carbide-tipped tools of course. Until very recently all turning was done using some kind of high-carbon steel, so there's no technical reason it can't be done, it's just that you will need to sharpen much more frequently.</p>

<p>Related to this, <strong>edge geometry</strong> — because of the stress on the edge, even when using much stronger steels it's common for turning tools to be sharpened to a much steeper bevel angle than you'd use on carving or bench chisels. Gouges for example can have a 70° outcannel bevel, not the 25-30° more common on a carving gouge, so once converted the tools will require a lot of work (i.e. a lot of metal will need to be ground off) to change them back to the kind of geometry that's better for carving. So you can't really expect the same tools to do double duty I'm afraid, broadly speaking it's one or the other and not both.</p>

<hr>

<p>As I say above, despite how it may come across I don't want to dissuade you from trying this. After all many people have made their own turning tools from screwdrivers (mainly scrapers and parting tools) and <em>usually without further hardening the tip</em> and that is saying something as screwdriver tips are deliberately not made as hard as the steel can get.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nfuV4.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nfuV4.jpg"" alt=""Shop-made turning tools""></a></p>

<p><sup><strong>Source:</strong> American Woodworker, Feb 1994.</sup></p>

<p>For extra penny-pinching points, assuming it's not too late, don't throw away the crappy tool you got with the lathe. Despite how bendy it was it may still be made of tool steel, just not hardened properly. If that is so you can harden it yourself fairly easily at some point in the future. </p>

<p>For very basic heat treatment the equipment needed is modest — a small gas torch and a metal container of oil for quenching, nothing more. You can then temper the steel using the torch, or for a little extra control by heating and cooling in a domestic oven.</p>

<li><p>Are we in over our heads?!</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>Let me answer your questions in reverse order:</p>

<p><strong>Are we in over our heads?!</strong></p>

<p>No, you're not in over your heads. You can do this.</p>

<p><strong>Do you see anything wrong with my initial draft?</strong></p>

<p>At a glance only a few things concern me.</p>

<ol>
<li>How will you move this to where it needs to be once it's built, and will it ever need to be moved again? You may want the table to break down if it will ever need to go through a doorway, up or down steps, or to a different location. For example, if you use the pictured design for the leg shelves, I would make the shelves removable.</li>
<li>I'm not familiar with game tables but where do people's legs go when they are sitting at the table? It seems like the shelves attached to the legs will be in the way all the way around the table, except for one person on each side whose legs will fit between the board game shelving and the other shelf. I presume the extendable shelf that slides out from the top of the table will give the people on that side some leg room, but it isn't clear that every side has an extendable tabletop.</li>
<li>Consider what will happen if someone leans on the extendable shelf/tabletop. Will it break its wooden or metal drawer slides, or the slot that houses it? Could the shelf itself flex or break?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>For the shelving units below the table surface, how do I connect the shelves to the legs? Screws that are longer than 4"" and some wood glue? Routing out a slot to shove that thing into?</strong></p>

<p>You can certainly route a dado to help register each shelf and create more glue surface. Wood glue will certainly strengthen the joints but you may want to either run the shelves' other legs all the way up to the table frame/apron, or make the shelf removable in case you need to move it at some point in the future. If you want the shelves to be removable, you probably don't want to glue them to the legs.</p>

<p>You can use long screws that go through the legs and into the end of the shelves but personally I would use a different type of fastening method, especially if the shelves are made from plywood or MDF. (Also keep in mind you'll need fairly deep countersink or you'll need longer than 4"" screws if your legs are actually 4""x4"" as shown in your diagram.)</p>

<p>Here are some of the alternatives I think you should consider for attaching the shelves to the legs:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dowels, simply clamping or strapping the parts together while the glue dries (if you plan on permanent attachment with glue)</li>
<li>Drill pocket screw holes into the bottoms of the shelves and use pocket screws to fasten the shelves to the legs.</li>

"What are the implications of using multiple polyurethane coats?","665","","<p>What are the pros and cons of applying more coats of polyurethane?  I know with more coats the flaws are amplified, but doesn't more coats protect the wood better?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>What are the pros and cons of applying more coats of polyurethane? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are really no cons to applying more coats of poly, within reason. Cost does go up with each layer of course but this is inherent to all finishing; and you do get something for the additional outlay, be it improved looks or surface protection.</p>

<p>With each additional layer there is the chance of additional surface defects — blebs, dust specs etc. — however, these can be almost entirely avoided with proper setup and application procedure (and can anyway be fixed relatively easily if they do occur).</p>

<p>Fact is today it is common to <em>under</em>-varnish, because very often the focus when finishing is on looks rather than protection. For example, if varnishing a piece with wipe-on poly it's not uncommon for woodworkers to use just enough coats to get the sheen they want, which may mean 3-5. But wipe-on poly is diluted polyurethane varnish, so each layer is inherently thinner than regular varnish and the wiping application also tends to deposit a thinner coat than brush-application would anyway. </p>

<p>So six coats of wipe-on may only be the equivalent of only <em>two</em> coats of regular poly. And three or four undiluted coats is often the ideal number to reach the full protective potential of polyurethane (primarily maximum water-resistance).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know with more coats the flaws are amplified</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's not really the case. It can be, but there are many variables. And often you seek to, and can, rectify flaws with each additional layer, building towards the final blemish-free finished project. </p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to salvage these pieces?</p>
","<p>You can get this flatter certainly, but you may not be able to get them totally flat or to get them to stay that way permanently — wood that has bowed can show a tendency to want to return to that shape. </p>

<p>One method is to wet the cupped side and put the wood out in the sun to dry. A variation of this is to wet both side but have the wet side sit on grass where it'll dry much more slowly. I've tried both (not on anything this extreme!) and I'm not sure there's a clear winner in terms of effectiveness.</p>

<p>Another method doesn't involve drying outdoors but is a little more involved. You'll need a few clamps and some means to raise the edges of the boards up a little so the centre can bend downwards slightly. You thoroughly saturate the wood, front and back, and then clamp it in stages until you get it slightly beyond flat, i.e. cupped very slightly in the opposite direction to how it is now. Then let the wood dry overnight or longer.</p>

<p>Note: you must use scrap blocks under the clamps to help prevent marring the wood, this is soft wood anyway but it'll be even more prone to bruising when wet.</p>

"How do you use a 300 & 600 grit diamond jointer / planer blade sharpener / knife hone holder?","664","","<p>I received mine earlier today from ebay but no instructions were enclosed and I can't find any on the net.</p>

<p>How do you go about using this correctly to get the most out of it?</p>
","<h1>Stop!</h1>

<p>Please don't use that stuff on your tools, it's far too coarse. </p>

<p>300 and 600 grit is most certainly <strong>not suitable</strong> for sharpening a planer blade or such.</p>

<p>300 grit is very aggressive, it takes away a lot of material and not in a very smooth (sharp) way. This is something you might use on an garden axe after you've chopped through roots and earth (and little rocks) for some time to get rid of the dents that will now be visible in the blade. Or you might use it to get a straight cutting edge again if, for some reason, someone had ""sharpened"" it totally wrong so it's all skewed and sloped.</p>

<p>600 is better but still too coarse to really sharpen a tool. It's most suitable if a blade doesn't have the desired angle.</p>

<p>For <em>sharpening</em> jointer/planer blades and (quality) knives, you might want to start with, say, 1000 grit (or 800 if you have that lying around and can't afford to buy 1000), then have another go with 3000, and finish by pulling it over a 6000 (better 8000) polishing stone.<br>
People who make a religion out of sharpening will probably pull the blade over leather, afterwards (I'm not doing that, 8000 stone works well enough for my practical purposes, but opinions and tastes differ).</p>

<p>The 1000/3000 stones are what make the micro-edge, and the 8000 stone (pulled along) gives that edge a polish, which is what makes the difference between a ""meh"" sharp blade and a ""woah"" sharp one. After pulling over the polishing stone, the edge looks like a mirror.</p>

<p>Stones are available up to 20.000 or 30.000 grit (possibly more?), and some people will use them, but these stones are quite unaffordable.</p>

<p>I use Suehiro Cerax 1000/3000/8000 with the Veritas sharpening guide model 2 (and a 5.99 plastic Japanese guide for kitchen knives), which gives a very nice result and is reasonably affordable (around 80 or so currency per stone). It's not ""diamond"" but corund, but that makes little difference.<br>
10.000 is only available as ""mixed grit"", which is something I don't quite trust -- else I might be inclined to give that a try. Upwards of 10.000, quality stones are clearly in the 3-digit price range (and no, the first digit isn't a one!).<br>
I've heard of people using the somewhat cheaper ""Sun King"" or ""Sun Tiger"" stones instead to full satisfaction. They're cheaper than Cerax but are said to wear out faster, too. For me, the price difference isn't significant enough.</p>

<p>""Diamond"" is really only needed to sharpen ceramic blades, and doesn't make a better sharpener otherwise (though it will obviously wear out slower). For tools made of steel, a ""normal"" stone will do just fine (I was told ""soft binding"" is better for high-carbon steels whereas ""hard binding"" is better for high-alloy steels, but I use hard binding all the way, which works fine, too).</p>

<h1>What does this look like in close-up?</h1>

<p>The following shots are from a cheap Thai kitchen knife that I bought (and sharpened) this week. Not a wood tool, but you can see the difference beween what a coarse grit and a fine grit does anyway.</p>

<h3>Factory sharpened</h3>

<p>As delivered, as sharpened (well, ""sharpened"") in the Thai <strike>sweat shop</strike> factory. I would guess this is maybe 600-grit.  </p>

<p>Believe it or not, you <strong>can</strong> actually cut with this, and it isn't all bad either, at least for vegetables and such.<br>
However, I wouldn't want to use a wood tool that has an edge like this.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ui3Li.jpg"" alt=""factory sharpened""></p>

<h3>1000 grit (incomplete)</h3>

<p>Here, I have partially sharpened the blade using a 1000-grit water stone. Since I am sharpening at a slightly more acute angle than the worker who made the blade, the edgemost part of the blade has not been touched yet, but you can already see that it will be a lot smoother. A dozen more pulls over the stone are necessary to get an even, uniform edge:</p>

<h3>1000, followed by 3000-grit</h3>

<h3>Finish with 8000-grit</h3>

"How do I choose a drill press?","661","","<p>A drill press seems such an essential tool -- even outside of fine woodworking I have found need for it a great many times -- but as I dive into woodworking I see even more of a need for it. The precision, straightness of cut, and depth limiter will obviously give better results and make some near-impossible hand drill tasks easy. But how do I choose one?</p>

<p>Spindle travel seems very important. 2"" sounds tiny and 5"" sounds big. How much do I actually need, or what depths should I expect to want to reach. If I only drill through 3/4"" wood, any size is fine. (Right?) But a 2x4 could makes more travel useful.</p>

<p>Table size and adjustability seems very important. Big, tiltable, easy clamp spots, etc. would make it most easy to use with any workpiece. Right?</p>

<p>Bench vs floor standing also seems important, however I'm not sure I see many scenarios where floor standing space would actually matter for the workpiece... though maybe I'm short-sighted?</p>

<p>What else am I missing?</p>
","<p>Table size matters, but it's common to add your own table -- many drill presses come set up with a table that's better for metalworking than woodworking.</p>

<p>Ease of adjusting the table matters. You want a table that can be reliably brought back to level... or you can leave it level and use a jig when drilling on an angle, which some find easier.  </p>

<p>You want a table whose height is easily adjusted, and that can be swung off to the side for end-drilling large pieces. Most drillpresses will have those features.</p>

<p>You want a head that lets you change speeds reasonably easily.  It should have a built-in depth stop, ideally with both quick and fine adjust. You <em>USUALLY</em> won't need more than 4 inches travel, if that; if you're going deeper, moving the table vertically can supplement quill travel.</p>

<p>Note that I'm saying ""want"". You can save a significant amount of money by getting what you need instead. The best deal is often a 50-year-old machine in reasonable condition  which may be s bit more nuisance to set up and will be heavy but will do the job just fine, especially if you spend some time tuning it up.</p>

"Sharpening grits -- naming and selection","659","","<p>Independent of all the different kinds of surface one can use to shape, clean, and sharpen tools -- and perhaps independent of whether said surface is motorized or not -- I have to admit to being a bit lost as to what grades of abrasive exist in what media which should be used for what part of the task, and so on. ""Fine"" and ""extra fine"" seem to be defined differently for every manufacturer or medium, and not all of them give numeric values on the abrasive scale which might make them comparable... and I'm not certain whether 600-grit diamond is really equivalent to 600-grit wet/dry sandpaper on a surface plate and how either compares to any of the natural stones which are referred to only by name..</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>I have to admit to being a bit lost as to what grades of abrasive exist in what media </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being a bit unsure of what equates to what is commonplace and even outright confusion is understandable because <em>you can't trust comparative grit guides</em>. Even doing a cursory investigation into abrasive stone comparison charts you should find some inconsistencies. </p>

<p>You might suspect this is an example of ""You can't trust stuff on the Internet"" but unfortunately it's more pervasive than that as this is also true of guides published in print, including those from the manufacturers themselves. So one has to be very careful about accepting any <em>comparative</em> information as definitive, although the defined grit size for any given product is more trustworthy (but not entirely reliable either).</p>

<p>Here are two charts giving comparative grit sizes:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gprwA.jpg"" alt=""Norton grit comparison chart"">  </p>

<p>[Source: Norton catalogue]</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RIHUt.jpg"" alt=""Bladeforums grit comparison chart""></p>

<p>[Source: truncated from a chart found on Bladeforums]</p>

<p>As you can see they agree and disagree about equally. Worth also comparing these to the chart linked to in rob's answer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and how either compares to any of the natural stones which are referred to only by name..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's worth noting that natural sharpening media, just like wood, are inherently variable. Any given grit rating for a type of stone like Soft Arkansas or Belgian Coticule should be taken as an approximation at best. </p>

<p>In addition to some difference in apparent grit size they can vary in how well they cut, due to differences such as the grit:matrix ratio as well as in the variation of grit sizes within the stone (there is nearly always a mixture, with some or many smaller particles amongst the coarsest ones). Books going back to the 19th century mention the variability, e.g. that you might find <em>""a quick-cutting [example]""</em> of a finer stone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Fine"" and ""extra fine"" seem to be defined differently for every manufacturer or medium, and not all of them give numeric values on the abrasive scale which might make them comparable... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very true. Even for the same type of sharpening medium two manufacturers might have a slightly different grit size in products of the same name. FWIW and just from casual observation this seems to be spread fairly evenly from the fine to the coarse end of the market.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it really just ""go by the numbers and stop when you're satisfied with the edge""?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To a degree, yes. But this is a little misleading as the fact is most people over-sharpen some or all of the time. </p>

<p>It's best to adopt a KISS approach to sharpening and not over-think it (very common in the West). First, what is the goal? To grind two faces to meet at a sharp edge, ideally with a zero radius. The more refined that edge, the less irregularity present, the sharper it is. </p>

<p>If that is firmly borne in mind it's much simpler to sharpen appropriately. It's also good to separate the concept of sharpening from honing. </p>

<p><strong>Sharpening is edge creation.</strong> Sharpening is for new tools that don't yet have a proper edge, and when an edge needs to be created from scratch (pardon the pun). </p>

<p><strong>Honing is edge refinement.</strong> Honing is the last step in sharpening but it should be the <em>only</em> step required when your knife, chisel or plane irons have lost their keen edge. So honing is what you do between sharpenings, meaning that in fact most of 'sharpening' is actually honing (or should be), since you can hone dozens of times between sharpenings so it is done far far more frequently. </p>

<p>If you hone well, and with sufficient frequency, you might need to sharpen yearly or less.</p>

<p>When honing you shouldn't even glance at your coarser sharpening media, and in fact a medium stone would often be much more aggressive than the edge needs. Using one fine stone or diamond plate, followed by a strop, or a fine and ultra-fine stone if using waterstones, should normally be more than sufficient.</p>

<p>And in fact at the very simplest you can hone by stropping <em>only</em>. An edge that's not quite sharp enough can be brought back to shaving-sharp in just 20-30 seconds by stropping, this is commonly done with carving knives and should become more common with chisels and plane irons.</p>

<p>Any advice?  Perhaps I should score the laminate somehow before-hand?  Or chop through the rubber with a knife instead of the router bit?</p>
","<p>Here's how I would go about it.</p>

<p>First, I would score the edges of the miter slot with a very sharp knife to establish your margins.  Ideally, this would go through the laminate, but at the very least should give you a crisp edge.  If I was able to slice through the laminate, I'd then peel it off the top of the table.</p>

<p>Next, if I was unable to cut entirely through the laminate, I would use a circular saw with a blade specifically made for laminates (similar to <a href=""http://www.boschtools.com/Products/Accessories/Pages/BoschAccessoryDetail.aspx?pid=9429"" rel=""nofollow"">this Bosch model</a>) to establish the shoulders of the miter slot and attempt to minimize tearing of the laminate.  I've heard of people mounting the blade backwards to also minimize tearing but haven't tried it myself.</p>

<p>After having the depth and sides of the miter slot established, it's a simple matter of finishing it off with a straight bit using the router, guided by a straight edge.</p>

<p>As far as the rubber edge is concerned, you <em>should</em> have no issues cutting through it as I have described. If you're still worried about it, I'd just trim out the area with a knife beforehand.</p>

  <p>Is there any harm in removing the old iron wedge from the old handle and re-using it?</p>

<p>None at all. In fact almost all hammer and axe re-handling guides will suggest you do your best to keep the previous wedge or wedges to use again. I've re-handled three old hammers so far, managed to reuse the wedges for all three even if badly rusted.</p>

<p>Assuming the old wedge(s) aren't damaged the only reason I can think of not to use them again is if you want to use a different style of wedge that you like the look of more (I'm thinking of ring wedges) or you believe is more secure.</p>

<p>If there are any worries about how well the old wedge will hold, simple and very effective wedges can be made quite easily from mild steel if suitable stock material can be found, or from annealed tool steel with a little more effort.

<li>If you haven't chosen your wood to use yet don't sweat it if you can't locate some hickory. Axe, hammer and maul handles were made in Europe for many centuries before hickory was ever heard of. Ash makes for very good handle stock.</li>
<li>Select your piece of wood with care; it's said that a good piece of lesser wood makes a better handle than one made from a poor piece of a better wood and I believe this to be true.</li>
<li>Part of choosing a good piece is the grain orientation within the eye of the axe head. Endeavour to have the grain oriented the ideal way, that is: back to front, not across.</li>
<li>Try to limit grain run-out when shaping the length of the handle.</li>
<li>Make sure the wood for both the haft and the wooden wedge are both quite dry, otherwise they will shrink at some point and the handle will come loose.</li>
<li>The wooden wedge goes back to front, the metal wedge goes across (splitting the wooden wedge). English oak makes a very good choice for wooden wedges if you have any.</li>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Many videos and tutorials from the much respected internet woodworkers show them always going from a coarse medium through to a fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think there are three key things here. </p>

<p>With respect to a few of them, the category ""Internet woodworker"" does not in general mean you're getting info from the best and most experienced craftsmen. Always worth bearing that in mind to begin with. </p>

<p>The second is that every workman's tool wear, <em>and acceptance of same</em>, is slightly different. Using equivalent tools, if one person is working much more on hardwoods, particularly harder or more abrasive species, and another is almost entirely using common softwoods their respective need to sharpen will be wildly different. </p>

<p>The third thing is, and this is the most important probably, there is a massive gulf in the sharpening routines from one end of the spectrum using one stone, sometimes with no strop (yes really) to the guys at the opposite end with five or more stones routinely used for normal sharpening (honing). Additionally some sharpen a bit and test their edges to see if they've done enough, others work through a sharpening routine by rote and therefore don't have to check because they know that it'll always have returned an edge to working sharpness (this is Paul Sellers for example, he's one who specifically advises always working through from coarse to fine surfaces and ending with a good stropping). </p>

<p>Now on to what you do specifically. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>20-30 strokes or so on a 3000 grit water stone (this is enough to get a burr the full width of the blade), 20-30 strokes on a leather strop with some chromium oxide compound, and carry on. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's working for you and that's the main thing, but, for some the fact that 20-30 strokes are needed indicates that the stone you're using is a little too fine<sup>1</sup>. There isn't a single standard here by any means but very broadly speaking you should be able to turn a burr in 10-20 strokes and doing it in under ten can be a realistic goal.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the benefit to working through the grits for a common touch up?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For most people, there isn't one. Doing so is simply wearing away more steel than is necessary to get back to sharp.</p>

<p>Now in the grand scheme of things this excess wear is NOT a big deal. The entire lifespan of an edged tool is more than one generation in almost all cases so even if you <em>significantly</em> shorten something's lifespan you're unlikely to notice it :-)</p>

<p>But I don't think anyone needs to go through a full grit progression<sup>2</sup> just to deal with common edge wear. You should only <em>need</em> to do this from normal use if a ridiculous amount of time has passed since the last sharpening and any such edge is long past functioning like it is supposed to.</p>

<p><strong>One person's bottom line</strong><br>
If routine sharpening (honing) is taking longer than a couple of minutes per edge you're not doing it efficiently. The fastest workers, honing little and often as almost all of us should, can get an edge back to workably sharp in 30-60 seconds and IMO that's the thing to aim for. </p>

<p>Note: if you can't do it that fast and you want to, then shorten the interval between honings, change your sharpening materials, or both.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup>You're honing on a stone finer than the majority of workmen had in the shop for most the last few centuries of European and American woodworking to put it into perspective. </p>

"What's a good way to cut a board parallel to its face?","649","","<p>I have some thick boards that I'd like to make thinner.  Generally I would thickness plane the board, but in this case I'd like to reduce the thickness of the board by about half (e.g. from 2"" thick to 1"" thick or 1"" thick to .5"" thick).  Thickness planning would be a real waste of material in this case.  Is there a good way to cut a board parallel to its face such that I end up with one board of a desired thickness and another board of the original thickness - saw blade width - desired thickness?  What kind of surface finish can I expect on the new face of the two resulting boards?  The boards in question are roughly 8"" wide.  I was thinking I could use a band saw with a fence, but this seems pretty sketchy since the blade isn't rigid.  Can you slowly raise the blade of a table saw and use a high fence to accomplish this (doesn't seem very safe)?</p>
","<p>The operation you want to do is called resawing, and is best done on a bandsaw.</p>

<p>Ideally, your bandsaw should be equipped with a 1/2"" or wider, 2-4 TPI blade and a resaw guide or high fence that can be easily adjusted for blade drift (just in case you haven't yet mastered Alex Snodgrass' drift-free <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbZqWac0jU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bandsaw setup technique</a>).</p>

<p>(<a href=""http://www.woodmagazine.com/woodworking-plans/bandsawing/bandsaw-resawing-guide/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a>)</p>

<p>The bandsaw will leave a pretty rough surface, so after you've sliced up the board into thinner boards, you'll need to run each one through the thickness planer or drum sander (or hand planes) to clean up the bandsaw marks. If you cut the original board into more than 2 boards, keep in mind that you'll need to flatten one face on each of the inner boards before thicknessing, so be sure to cut the inner boards a little thicker than the outer boards for this reason.</p>

<p>If your boards are sufficiently thick, you can also resaw on a table saw, but it's much easier to resaw <strong>unsafely</strong> on a table saw and you end up wasting a lot more wood because of the much thicker kerf (vs. a bandsaw). If you do this, you should use a rip blade rather than a combination blade or crosscut blade; otherwise you'll have to take much shallower passes to avoid burning. Generally you shouldn't resaw all the way through on a table saw--in fact, most 10"" table saws can only resaw about 6-7"" wide boards on their own anyway. One resawing technique is take several passes cutting progressively deeper kerf in each long edge with the table saw, then finish resawing the middle on the bandsaw or with a hand saw.</p>

<p>You can also skip power tools entirely and resaw with a hand saw.</p>

","<p>This could work, but you would want them setup to run in parallel, and not in series I would think. For example at the end of your ductwork, you have a Y that splits right into the two vacuums. My guess is the stronger vacuum will end up with the majority of your dust. </p>

<p>However if you set this up with a cyclone, you can still centralize all of the dust collection into a single bin, and still utilize the suction of two vacuums.</p>

<p>The biggest issue I can see happening is if you ever get a blockage, or accidentally close all of your gates, the vacuums will in essence be fighting each other in the closed system, and the weaker one will blow.</p>

  <p>Does the manufacturing process of MDF give the resulting boards a grain direction?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and no.</p>

<p>The wood fibres in MDF are said to be randomly oriented, and it is plainly visible if you study the surface that they are random. However, during manufacture MDF is laid down in a continuous horizontal sheet and then pressed down to thickness which does leave a sort of grain-like structure or stratification between the faces. This leads to the well-known tendency of MDF to split when screws are driven in at the edge, while if driven through the face there is far less tendency towards splitting.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Why would someone do this? What problem might that solve or advantage would it convey?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have two rails joining a leg at right angles to each other, you sometimes need to miter the tenons to prevent them from interfering with each other.</p>

<p>I haven't seen the bench you're talking about, but it sounds like a typical case where you have rails connected to legs with mortise and tenon joints. If the tenons on the rails reach to the center of the leg, they will of course bang into each other when they're inserted into the mortises. To prevent that, you miter the ends of the tenons.</p>

<p>An alternative would be to shorten one or both of the tenons so that they don't reach so far into the leg, but shorter tenons mean joints that have less resistance to racking forces. Mitering the tenon shortens just the inside cheeks while allowing the outside cheeks to stay long, providing a little more mechanical strength and glue surface.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> There are some drawings of table-rail joints with the tenon ends mitered <a href=""http://www.woodworking.com/ww/Article/Mortise-and-Tenon-Joints-7613.aspx"">in this article</a> at the heading <em>Three-dimensional Frames</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Boring Bar and Depth Stop</strong></p>

<p>The tool in the middle is the boring bar and depth stop. Depth stop appears to be an adjustable collar. Pretty simple to figure that one out but here is the content of the document all the same:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The boring tool is used to remove the centre of the hollow vessel or bowl to an accurate depth. The depth stop limits the depth of cut to prevent the risk of cutting through the bottom of the project. The tool should be presented to the
  work horizontally and cut on centre line. The boring bar is sharpened by rubbing a diamond file on the two cutting edges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Hollowing Tools</strong></p>

<p>The bottom tool picture is a fixed edge swan-necked hollowing tool which is designed for general cutting and hollowing. The tool above and on top is just the same except the cutting head is adjustable making it more versatile for more complex cuts and better geared for smaller sizes of work as well. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These tools cut on the centre line of the work. Throughout which the tools are held horizontal. For a more gentle cut rotate the tool until the tip trails around the 8 o'clock position. Make a series of light cuts starting from the top of the work and working towards the bottom. We recommend that these tools are honed with a diamond file on the bevel. If the tip is severely damaged it may be necessary to re-profile the tip on a bench grinder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following notes are also present</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Cutting occurs on centre.</li>
  <li>For a gentler cut rotate the tool until the tip trails up to 15° off horizontal.</li>
  <li>Tool must be horizontal at all times.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Wall Thickness Gauge</strong></p>

<p>More of your issue comes from the Wall Thickness Gauge which is supposed to make it so you don't cut through the wood completely. It is expected that the external shape of the work is completed before these tools are used. The following is the instruction for setting the gauge which I am sure you figured out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Lock on to ferrule with 'T' knob (A).</li>
  <li>Slacken screw (B) with allen key provided.</li>
  <li>Holding the finger loop in contact with the handle, set to the required gap and retighten the screw</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't know if this part is just obvious but based on what I read (it does not say itself) the bar will move while you work obviously. You will know you hit your desired depth once the bar comes to rest and is not under tension. Not the most fool proof system (assuming I understand right) but you are cutting blind so it is better than nothing. </p>

<p>Some notes also compliment the gauge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This can now be left in position whilst turning if required, and can be swung in and out to check the wall thickness as you tum. If the project is made from an open grained wood such as a burr, it is best to check the wall thickness when the work is stationary.</p>
  
  <p><strong>N.B.</strong> The wall gauge can be bent if required for any difficult
  areas. This is sometimes necessary on deep necked hollow
  vessels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last note has the following accompanying photo</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KPDe2.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KPDe2.png"" alt=""Setting correct gap""></a></p>

<p><strong>Scratching outer contours</strong></p>

<p>Does the bar scratch all of the work or just the tighter inside contours? Perhaps you need to bend the bar more for part of the cuts? Also I cannot tell from any photos what the end of the gauge looks like. Mostly wanted to know if it had a flat or rounded end. I would have assumed the latter but it is possible either way that you have a manufacture defect?</p>

<p>My suggestion would be make sure that the end is rounded as much as possible. Rotary tool and using a few different heads should help. Polish that baby and that should hopefully prevent scratches. </p>

<p>Only other suggestion which you are probably already doing is make the outer surface <em>slightly</em> uniformly wider than the intended finished product and clean once you are done hollowing on the inside. </p>

<p>For completeness there is a warning both in this document and almost every video I watched on the subject. </p>

I really want to use those for building a workbench top. So I am going to be cutting them up. Since they were previously at my work they have been painted with the times over the years and have ~4 layers of various paints. I have no reason to think they are lead paints but that is pretty easy to test anyway. </p>

<p>I have an <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/604/can-you-use-painted-wood-in-a-planer-without-damaging-the-tool"">older question</a> related to this but since I cannot see what's under the wood I worry about the blades, old or otherwise. Also I am curious what my other options are.</p>

<p>When it comes to removing multiple layers of paint off cheap wood what are my realistic options? Inevitably some will be related to chemically stripping wood and while those are answers, I am looking for something outside of that. I don't really have a place for that nor do I want to deal with the chemicals and their removal (played with them once in the past trying to restore a dresser).  </p>
","<p><strong>Scraping</strong><br>
Although I'm a big advocate of scrapers this isn't something I'd personally do by scraping alone unless I had a paint scraper (AKA hook scraper). A thick layer of paint made up of multiple layers built up over time is particularly resistant to a conventional scraping action with less-robust scrapers, as you can get a parting of the ways between subsequent coats. What this means in practice is that you might have to go over a given area multiple times before you're down to bare wood (DAMHIK). </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ngb9y.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ngb9y.jpg"" alt=""Hook-type paint scrapers""></a></p>

<p>If you use a dedicated paint scraper such as the ones above instead of wimpier options (e.g. card scraper, shaving hook) you should have better results because they have a very aggressive scraping action. But still it would likely require substantial muscle effort, although the type of paint and just how thick it is are obviously factors here.</p>

<p><strong>Heat/flame + scrapers</strong><br>
Although there are safer chemical strippers (note: almost invariably <em>much</em> slower than their nastier cousins) the other traditional option for removing a heavy coating of paint was to use a blowtorch, which you can still use, or alternatively a heat gun which is a little safer.</p>

<p>Oddly this seems to work best on thick paint. Some of that might be a user reaction to how amazingly it softens and releases that much paint, but thicker paint does tend to sort of 'sheet off' where a thin coat tends to cling to the surface more tenaciously.</p>

<p><strong>Hand planing</strong><br>
A scrub plane/roughing plane (or a jack with a good camber on the iron) can be a great way to get off a very thick coating of paint, just as it's a great way to remove a shaggy or heavily weathered surface from wood. Working diagonally over the wood this requires surprisingly little effort. </p>

<p>It's perhaps too aggressive for the handtool-only guy who would then have to flatten off entirely by hand, but with a planer to smooth the wood afterwards it's worth considering this approach for its speed and effectiveness.</p>

<p>I wouldn't do this level of paint removal by sanding pretty much ever, there are just too many downsides. Cost of the belts is an obvious one, as is the mess (even with dust extraction the amount of dust released can be pretty bad). The potential to 'dub over' the wood or is also very high. Worst though is the potential toxicity of the paint dust not captured by any dust extraction and it's not just lead paint that we have to wary of — <em>all</em> paints and other finishes should be considered harmful when converted to a fine dust.</p>

"How do I remove a liquid deglosser from my cabinet doors?","594","","<p>Long story short, I put a liquid deglosser on about half of our kitchen cabinet doors, and now I realized what a mistake that was, and want to remove it. So far, the only effective means of getting it off have been a heat gun and scraper, but it's taking forever. </p>

<p>Is there some trick that I can use to quickly and thoroughly get rid of the deglazer residue?</p>
","<p>You are now in the process of removing the old finish which is exactly what you were attempting to avoid by employing the liquid sander/deglosser..  </p>

<p>The manufacturers of the deglosser (note it is not deglazer, a product used for leather preparation) specify to use it for preparing a previously finished surface for refinishing with no need to remove any residue - apply deglosser, let it dry, apply new finish. The deglosser is intended to make the new finish better adhere to the old finish.  It's understandable how one would be confused, given that the brand that you selected also makes a liquid paint remover/stripper.</p>

<p>If I were in the same situation (i.e. half way through stripping with a heat gun) I would grit my teeth and finish stripping.  True, it's going take time, but you have a chance of completing the task with a uniform surface preparation and uniform application of finish for all of the cabinets.</p>

"Gluing plywood to plywood for doll's house floor","587","","<p>I am making a small doll's house for my daughter. This is my first project; I am a total beginner at woodworking, basically what I know is remembered from watching my dad 30 years ago :)</p>

<p>It's going pretty well, I have cut the panels, and even managed to get some perfect rectangles cut for windows; however when cutting them I noticed that of course, the plywood delaminates very easily - in fact much more easily that I expected.</p>

<p>A front view of what I was planning to do:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Q3EL.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Q3EL.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So I plan to make the base and main ceiling out of pine so I could screw into it for strength, however the floor was just going to be plywood glued, along with some mouldings as batons to increase the surface area along the side.</p>

<p>Will this design be strong enough for the interior floor just with the glue? I know that the glue is stronger than the wood; my concern is that the top layer of plywood and glue will peel off and the floor will collapse if she bangs around too much (she's two and a half).</p>

<p>(There will be a back as well of course.)</p>

<p>Matt mentioned dimensions may be important:</p>

<p>It will be ~22cm x 34cm x 22cm (w x h x d)</p>

<p>The plywood is 8mm thick; the pine is 15mm.</p>

<p>The plywood is basically offcuts from my father in law, so is in ""been knocking around the workshop"" condition. Clean but a bit flaky.</p>

<p>The plywood has a paper thin veneer on one side in a reddish looking wood. I should have mentioned this actually, although I can just use the other side. I assume this was done for appearance - it is literally paper thin and flakes as soon as you bring a tool into the same room. I presume I should avoid gluing to this side altogether?</p>
","<p>This would very much depend on the quality of your plywood which <em>sounds</em> questionable. You also don't mention the thickness which would play a role here as well. The overall dimensions of the project are not shown either. This is a dollhouse after all so I can't imagine its size would be a huge factor.</p>

<p>For screwing onto the base: That should be fine. If you wanted to make it stronger gluing it as well would help as well as make sure you screw into face grain and not end grain. </p>

<p>For the middle panel as long as you make a support for the plywood to rest on I imagine it would be fine. However you could consider making a dado (slot) for the floor to slide into. </p>

<p>Looking at designs online I see your ideas in play. The picture below has at least the back is for sure plywood and you can see glue on the joint for the roof in the upper right. Notice the partitions on the floors that add strength in the middle of the floors. Looking at the cut windows we can see that the whole design is just plywood and it is not a stretch to assume it is just glue holding the thing together. </p>

","<p>They're all called ""belt sanders"", but typically have some descriptive adjectives in front of them. ""Hand Held"" and ""Stationary"" are generally used to distinguish portable hand-held tools with tools that stay in one place on a workbench:</p>

<p><strong>Hand Held Belt Sanders</strong> - These are belt sanders you can hold in your hand:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PejS3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PejS3.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
(<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_sander#/media/File:Belt_sander_bosch.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Stationary Belt Sanders</strong> - These are belt sanders that remain stationary, like on a bench top (if you also said ""<a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=benchtop%20belt%20sander"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">benchtop belt sander</a>"" you'd be able to get the point across, too -- these typically seem to be combo belt + disc sanders these days, although that is not a rule):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jIJED.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jIJED.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
(<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_sander#/media/File:Bandslijpmachine_hobbykwaliteit_(Westfalia).jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>)</p>

<p>Then you can describe <em>stationary</em> belt sanders in various ways, e.g. <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=vertical%20stationary%20belt%20sander"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vertical stationary belt sanders</a>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AKaFf.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AKaFf.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
(<a href=""http://www.harborfreight.com/1-in-x-30-in-belt-sander-60543.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>)</p>

<p>The angled one you show isn't special, the angle is just... part of the specification of that tool, sort of like a 3"" vs 6"" belt sander. You can find ones with adjustable angles, too.</p>

<p>The one interesting iteration is stationary belt sanders with a vertical sanding plane but with the belt moving horizontally are often called <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=edge+sander"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">edge sanders</a>, e.g.:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z7jNg.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z7jNg.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
(<a href=""http://www.extremausa.com/products/sanders/edge-sanders.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>)</p>

<p>And there you might have <em>oscillating</em> edge sanders, as well, which are edge sanders that, as implied, oscillate back and forth. </p>

<p>But basically, edge sanders aside, they don't really have special names. They're all belt sanders. ""Hand Held"" vs ""Stationary"" is the most important categorization, but beyond that, you essentially just tack a reasonable descriptive adjective on the front.</p>

<p>Note that the ""hand held"" and ""stationary"" qualifiers are fairly common among many types of tools, not just belt sanders, e.g. <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=hand%20held%20planer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hand held planer</a> and <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=stationary%20planer&amp;oq=stationary%20planer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">stationary planer</a>, etc.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to guess the difference between hand held and stationary Bernie Sanders, though.</p>

"Coping with uneven table saw table and inconsistent cut depth","586","","<p>What is the best way to cope with a table saw that has an uneven table?</p>

<p>I noticed inconsistent cut depths with my table saw so did some test cuts on a piece of oak known to be straight and measured the depths. Cuts were like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tdImJ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tdImJ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I made the cuts in a random order to rule out the possibility of the blade height drifting. I also noticed no play in the blade position or angle with my hands.</p>

<p>Results were like this (leading and trailing edge depths measured about 0.25"" from respective edge, note x axis is mirrored wrt above picture, ""throat plate far edge"" is where the edge of the wood crosses the far edge of the throat plate):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIQoB.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIQoB.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The blade has angled teeth, and I measured to the center of the cut. I made the full set of measurements 3 times and found my results only varied by at most 0.0005"", so I believe the relative measurements to be accurate.</p>

<p>The first thing I discovered was that I did a poor initial job adjusting my throat plate height (as evidenced; it was too low), so I fixed that. However, I closely inspected the table with a square (a friend lent me a Starrett) and found that it is not completely flat. There are large, smooth, ever so slight bends and dips in it, and the bit to the right of the throat plate is a few hundredths of an inch higher than the left side. I am <em>presuming</em> this is the cause of my inconsistent cut depths. I also can feel with my fingers that the miter slide's rail is slightly higher than the table although I'm not sure how this affects things.</p>

<p>I noticed an identical trend with a piece of MDF and a piece of poplar as well (this is actually what prompted me to do this experiment) although I did not make a full measurement set on those.</p>

<p>What is the best way to cope with this (or are my expectations too high; the saw is a Ridgid R4513<sup>†</sup>)? I have not yet built any sleds. It seems like a sled with a nice flat base will solve the issue for cross cuts. I did read <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/1095/1250"">this great answer</a>, however, I am still unsure what to do for non-through rip cuts, where the material is longer and I want to use the fence. </p>

<hr>

<p><sup>† After reading grfrazee's answer, I contacted Ridgid and they claim a ±0.016"" manufacturing tolerance; further inspection of the table appears to verify it is within their tolerance. So it seems my expectations may be too high for this particular saw.</sup></p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>What is the best way to cope with this? Or are my expectations too high?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's hard to tell from your picture, but your issue could be one of a couple of things.</p>

<p>It seems like your throat plate is sticking proud of the table saw surface by some amount.  You can easily check this using a known straight edge.  Shim/de-shim the throat plate as necessary to make it flush with the saw bed.</p>

<p>If that's not the issue, then I hate to say it, but it seems like you got a lemon of a table saw.  Assuming you're setting everything up correctly (i.e., no user error producing poor results), a 0.040"" variation over 12"" in a table saw bed is pretty horrible.  I think most higher-end table saw manufacturers cast the beds and then grind to a flatness of +/- 0.005"" to +/- 0.010"".  I can't tell who made your saw, but if it's a lower-end model, this could be the culprit.</p>

<p>Having a look at this <a href=""http://lumberjocks.com/topics/25542"" rel=""nofollow"">related Lumberjocks forum thread</a>, you might be able to shim the table saw bed to get it closer to flat.  How you do this will depend on the model, so I really can't give you any good guidance on how to do so.</p>

<hr>

<p>On a different note, let's not forget that we're working wood here.  Wood will experience seasonal movements in excess of your 0.040"" discrepancy very easily.  This might just be a case of ""good enough.""</p>

"What determines carving tools/chisels quality?","586","","<p>I wish to get into wood carving I just don't know where to start and what I should be looking for when looking for a set of carving tools. </p>

<p>What determines the quality of one set over another? Yes, I understand some sets come with more tools and that can be the reason behind a price difference but then I see some sets with no more than 1-2 extra tools that have extremely varied prices. </p>

<p>In other areas of woodworking tools I can see why one brand would cost more than another because of quality, manufacturing, and material differences but when it comes to carving tools the only one I see applying is material differences but even then I don't believe that would account for the degree of the price differences.</p>

<h1>QUESTIONS</h1>

<p>What are the quality characteristics used to define quality: </p>

<ul>
<li>durability?</li>
<li>hardness of the metal?</li>
<li>resistance to corrosion?</li>
<li>ergonomics?</li>
</ul>

<p>Which are typically most important to new woodworkers?  Any info anyone can offer is gladly appreciated.</p>
","<p>This is actually a pretty broad topic, but other than marketing decided price (brand A being more expensive than brand B simply because of the brand name) there may be large difference in manufacturing of the chisels that can affect price.</p>

<p>I'll address general woodworking chisels, but I suspect that the same applies to the various carving chisels (as well as for turning gouges).</p>

<p>The basic requirements from a chisel (in my view) are good edge retention and easy to sharpen to a very sharp edge, so you get a sharp edge that lasts a long time during work. These two are almost opposite in their demands from the tool, but high end chisels achieve them both.</p>

<ol>
<li>Metallurgy - the exact formulation of the steel used in the tool is extremely important for its performance. It is not that the components of the steel are expensive, it is that getting the precise ratios of different elements in the alloy takes knowledge, experience and tight tolerances on production. All of these cost money. </li>
<li>Heat treatment - this is also an important step that requires all the knowledge and experience as the alloy formulation, and it needs to be exact for each individual chisel (not just the batch of metal used). For example, the kilns used for heat treatment must be uniform in temperature, or some chisels will be too hot during treatment and some too cold. This costs money.</li>
<li>A unique feature of chisels (and plane irons) is the back hollow - since a chisel will often be resharpened by the end user, a hollow back will facilitate this. This is typically done by choosing the hollow face of the chisel blank after heat treatment and using that side as the back. This is an additional manual step in production. Manual steps cost money.</li>
<li>Quality of initial sharpening and finish - grinding the chisel flat and true, creating the cutting bevel and honing the edge are all steps that take time. Cheap chisels may be completely dull right out of the box, while quality chisels are typically well finished (although these are often expected of the end-user to dress and sharpen before first use).</li>
<li>Quality of the handle - both the choice of the wood (or plastic) and the structure of the handle (with appropriately sized reinforcements). A cheap chisel might have a thin and weak retaining ring, with the handle made of softer wood or with less attention to the grain being clear and straight.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are probably more parts that can cost money (like the box/bag the chisels come in, different widths costing more, etc.), but I think the above are both the most crucial to the chisel's performance as well as being the most expensive in production.</p>

"What oil/stain/finish to use on a cedar spoon?","584","","<p>So, I just finished my first carving: a Welsh lovespoon, chiseled out of a cedar plank and sanded down smooth.</p>

<p>But now I want to give it that deep rich color and bring out the wonderful smell of cedar. There are a couple of spots with really nice grain spirals, and even the remnants of a knot, and I want to make all those variations pop. But I've never finished, varnished, oiled -- anything -- before.</p>

<p>What should I use?</p>

<p>Oh, and it needs to be food-safe!</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>But now I want to give it that deep rich color and bring out the wonderful smell of cedar. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any finish or treatment (e.g. mineral oil) you apply will actually have the tendency to lessen the smell, AFAIK nothing will enhance it. Traditionally the cedar linings of chest and cupboards was left unfinished for precisely this reason. And from what I've read you the characteristic odour will be completely gone after a few washes, sorry!</p>

<p>Sidenote: I'm guessing you used western red cedar which is not actually a true cedar, but it does still have good rot resistance. The reason it smells like cedar is that it has the same aromatic compounds in the wood that real cedar (cedar of Lebanon) does and these are a natural preservative.</p>

<p>So your spoon is made from a naturally resistant wood, making it a good candidate for having no finish put on it at all. Even used for stirring soups etc. it could still last for years and years. I have an unfinished beech spoon that's easily 20 years old now and other than the surface being a little rough it is in extremely good condition. My mother used to leave it standing in simmering soups or stews and it was left soaking in washing water many times..... wood can be surprisingly resilient :-)</p>

<p><strong>Fine sanding and raising the grain</strong><br>
If you want to try using no finish then you may want to spend a little extra time with your finish sanding, using as your finest grit at least 220-240 but you could go up to maybe 320 or 400 (there is likely little point in going any higher than this as there can be on denser woods).</p>

<p>Because the spoon will be exposed to water, even if only when you wash it, it would be best to pre-raise the grain so that your smoothly sanded wood doesn't go rough and you feel like all the sanding effort was wasted. So after final sanding you wet the wood down. It's best to do this with hot water. The surface will go rough as some of the compressed wood fibres will swell up and it will stay rough after drying.</p>

<p>Now let the wood full dry and then <em>lightly</em> sand again with your finest paper. You're just looking to removed the swelled or 'raised' grain that sits above the surface level, nothing more. Some people do this wetting and sanding cycle two or three times just to be on the safe side. </p>

<p>After that you should have no problems with the wood going rough once the spoon is in service.</p>

<p><strong>Oiling for looks</strong><br>
Just like with many cutting boards, you can treat the wood for cosmetic reasons (most boards do not need to be oiled and actually last perfectly well without it). </p>

<p>So if you want to enhance the look of the wood and give it that deeper tone you can do the same thing and rub in one or more coats of oil. The standard recommendation for the oil for this these days is mineral oil. In the recent past vegetable oils were used for the same purpose and if you'd prefer that then any light-coloured, flavourless oil should do fine but use a nut or seed oil for preference. Despite what you might read elsewhere, you don't have to worry about the oil going rancid and giving an 'off' taste to your food.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> mineral oil or vegetable oil is not a waterproofing treatment for wood, as contradictory as it seems. </p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p><strong>Varnish</strong><br>
It just occurred to me you might be using this for dry jobs in the kitchen, in which case you may want to varnish instead of oil the wood to enhance the look. This will do a lot to reduce the nice smell I'm afraid.</p>

<p>If you use varnish you'll want to thin it and wipe it on thinly. So decant a couple of spoons of varnish from the tin to a small jar and add about twice that amount of mineral spirits. A few wiped on/wiped off coats should give a good satin sheen to the wood.</p>

<p>You can apply more than six or seven if you'd like to build more of a glossy film.</p>

Does one really need to do this?  Someone once mentioned it had something to do with condensation in the tank, but I'd really like to know canonically what the safe/proper procedure should be.</p>
","<p>It is a good idea to drain the air compressor periodically.  Part depends on how much you use it.  My grandfathers tank hadn't been drained for years (I think after he quite using it but everyone else still did) and it had 20 gallons of water in it.  </p>

<p>The big problem is the water rusts the tank from the inside and on top of that if you have a lot of water (quarts/gallons) in the winter time it can freeze and possibly damage the tank.</p>

<p>How fast it accumulates depends on how humid it is where and when you use it and how much it is used.</p>

<p>On my little tank (10 gal.), it only takes a minute or two to open the pitcock on the bottom and let out the water.  I generally try to do this at least once a year in the fall, but if I'm using it frequently, I try to remember about every 10 hours of use (that might take me two months).</p>

"Do I need to laminate both sides of plywood or can I coat one side and laminate the other","572","","<p>I am relatively new to woodworking. I am in the process of laminating plywood (which will be used as a tabletop and also to hide the actual support for the table). I have googled alot and found different answers. Some are not even for plywood.My question is do I need to laminate both sides? </p>

<p>The cost and time will be high if I do laminate.. Some parts of the plywood will be sealed to the wall so that will be useless to laminate. Can I get away with laminating one side and just coating the other side with varnish or something else (please recommend me).</p>

<p>The humidity here is almost constant, </p>

","<p>Part of the answer depends upon the size of the piece, its thickness, and possibly the number of layers in the panel.  I do not know any hard and fast rules for making a determination but here are some considerations.</p>

<ul>
<li>The grain in each layer is set perpendicular so that strength in the panel resists the tendency of adjacent layers to curl as moisture and temperature generate distorting stresses.</li>
<li>Plywood panels have odd number of layers so that the opposing forces are balanced helping the panel keep a flat profile.</li>
<li>If the plywood panel is small (&lt;18"" width and depth) and the panel is thicker (3/4"") adding a thin veneer layer on one side only will probably work. As the dimensions increase or the thickness decreases the risk of distortion increases. Of course, if the surface applied on the face is thicker, it will generate more stress in the panel.</li>
<li>Painting one side will not prevent moisture penetration and curling.  Moisture is tenacious and will find a  way in generating stress in the panel. The edges of the panel will be especially vulnerable to admitting moisture.  However, the steady humidity in your chart is a good thing and will help.</li>
<li>There are other panel materials such as MDF or particle boards which can be used as a substrate that are not subject to the same stresses that could be used.  For instance, kitchen countertops are only laminated on one side (with a waterproof membrane no less) and maintain a flat profile for long periods. despite humid conditions. </li>
</ul>

<p>If there is a design  reason such as maintaining a specified thickness for only veneering one side, then it is worth a shot, otherwise I would recommend surfacing both sides.</p>

"Ripping vs Resawing - is there a reason for the difference?","572","","<p>While I understand the technical difference between ripping a board in two vs resawing a board into thinner boards, is there a technical reason for the distinction?</p>

<p>Granted, thinner pieces of wood will flex more substantially during cuts on a resaw and binding while cutting is a concern, but that's a difference of degree not type, and would remain true when ripping boards into smaller sections as well.</p>

<p>For instance, if I were to saw a 4x4 into two 2x4s, is that operation a rip or a resaw? </p>

<p>It would seem to be more reasonable to label the cut according to it's orientation relative to the grain like we do with the crosscut. Presumably ""quarter-sawing"" perpendicular to a consistent set of rings of alternating density is mechanically distinct from ""rift/plain-sawing"" mostly between the rings, resulting in different stresses on the blade and wood.</p>

<p>Bonus question: Is there research that discusses the differences in these two cutting processes?</p>
","<p>Resawing is a type of rip cut (always, without exception). The reason for the different terms is that ripping cuts are <em>all</em> cuts along the grain but not all rip cuts are resawing.</p>

<p>Resawing, as the term is used today, refers only to cutting a board <em>across its thickness</em>, i.e. sawing a thick board into two (or more) thinner boards. You are literally re-sawing the board from its original sawn thickness.</p>

<p>A standard rip cut performed on the same starting board would be <em>reducing its width</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For instance, if I were to saw a 4x4 into two 2x4s, is that operation a rip or a resaw? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's both, but wouldn't normally be referred to as a resawing operation. </p>

<p>I don't think this is because a 4x4 isn't generally referred to as a board (although that distinction is largely arbitrary), but if you sawed it instead into three or four or five boards, that would then be resawing certainly <em>even if it wouldn't commonly be thought of or described that way</em> — lots of idiosyncratic or irregular use of terminology in woodworking, as well as regional and dialectical differences.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would seem to be more reasonable to label the cut according to it's orientation relative to the grain like we do with the crosscut. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, because the orientation of the grain, as I think you're referring to, isn't relevant. Resawing is a type of rip cut as already stated, so in one way the cut is always along the grain but the angle of the cut as it relates to the grain in the wood the other way (more radial than tangential, more tangential than radial) is not relevant to the type of operation, thinning the board is the only criterion that defines resawing. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bonus question: Is there research that discusses the differences in these two cutting processes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm giggling inside at this, we do love to over-analyse things. Anyway not that I'm aware of. Why would there need to be? We can call resawing anything we want for all the difference in makes in what the operation is, or how it's done. </p>

<p>I bet in other languages resawing wouldn't be a simple translation of <em>re- saw</em>, it could be a specialist woodworking word stemming from the historical name for the cut with no exact parallel in English (there are a few examples of this in French, German and Swedish). </p>

<p>But regardless of the word(s) used in all cases it will simply refer to a type of rip cut performed to cut a thicker board into thinner boards.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>Congrats on an excellently done question! </p>

<p>In terms of how to cut the board apart I don't think it matters that much, but with an angled cut providing a wider glue surface area that will provide a stronger joint. In the right context I doubt this increased strength will actually matter though, since I assume the sheets will be supported underneath when installed as your worktops. </p>

<p>If the plan was to have the glued-up boards support themselves and then any weight put on top IMO you'll want to rethink. Even a very shallow cut giving <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/707/how-can-i-join-two-boards-at-the-ends/708#708"">a scarf joint</a> I doubt would provide the needed strength if unsupported.</p>

<p>I think your major difficulty is going to come when it comes time to glueing the pieces of ply back together, you would ideally want to have at least three long clamps with an opening somewhat wider than 6'. Obviously clamps this size don't come cheap. One option is to make rudimentary sash clamps from 2x4s, each would be nearly seven feet long but could be cut down to a more manageable length after the worktops are assembled so they would then be more practically usable in the shop. However transporting that length of 2x material might present you with the same problem as with the plywood in the first place!</p>

<p>An alternative method to allow clamping that is sometimes used is to attach temporary glue blocks to the wood, similar to how mitre joints are sometimes held together. These blocks can be directly glued on or attached with an intermediate material (often paper), see <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2752/how-do-i-temporarily-attach-two-pieces-of-wood-together-for-machining/2757#2757"">tip here</a> for a little more, however with plywood instead of solid wood it might not work as the surface ply can be weak. However, unlike when doing mitres here you have an advantage as one surface will be hidden so instead I would suggest screwing clamping blocks directly to the underside of the plywood, these can simply be unscrewed after the glue has cured. </p>

<p>The small holes left in the ply after the screws are removed won't harm its strength.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking yes, any darker wood can be matched by any lighter wood (in terms of colour, grain pattern is another story).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how does one mix and match stains to achieve the right color? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the hard part. Without specific products lined up and samples of the same woods you're using it's essentially impossible for someone to give you a sure-fire recommendation that'll give a match. It may get you close, but your standards for a match may need better than someone else's ""close enough"".</p>

<p>The usual recommendation with this sort of thing is to experiment for yourself using scraps of the wood you're using. Unfortunately this can mean buying one or more products you don't end up using, but that's unavoidable unless you get lucky with the very first thing you buy to test out. </p>

<p>One important aspect to bear in mind: say there is something that gives just the right colouring (doesn't matter if it's something you mixed or an off-the-shelf product). That perfect match is completely dependent on coat thickness: too thin and it'll end up too light, too thick and it'll be too dark.</p>

"Body positioning while using a jointer","565","","<p>I just got a old Beaver 4"" jointer that looks <em>very similar</em> to this one. </p>

<p>I used it for the first time this weekend and it was awesome. I am wondering though if I was doing something inherently wrong while operating. I was processing some pallet boards which were 4' to 8' long and since some were so long I found myself walking along the jointer with the board to keep it flush against the base and fence. </p>

<p>I thought that maybe I was supposed to feed from behind but that didn't make sense as I would not be able to maintain downward pressure as the board passed over the cutter. </p>

<p>How should my body be positioned while operating a jointer?</p>
","<p>Most woodworkers I know, including myself, walk along with the board when jointing, to some extent; but for long boards they stay in one place either at the infeed or outfeed side and use the push pads hand-over-hand to ""walk"" the board across. You should put downward pressure on the infeed table when starting the cut and on the outfeed table when ending the cut, but there are two schools of thought for what happens in the middle. Some keep pressure on the infeed table and others keep pressure on the outfeed table.  Personally, I think it makes more sense to put down pressure on the outfeed table, but I have woodworker friends who do the opposite and produce much nicer work than anything I've ever made.  As long as you stick to one or the other, you should get a good result (except perhaps at the very ends), even if your infeed and outfeed tables are ever-so-slightly out of parallel.</p>

<p>In terms of safety, you should try to keep your hands at least 6"" away from the cutterhead at all times, which also means you shouldn't joint anything shorter than about 18-24"".  As Doresoom mentioned, you should use push pads.  Because you're usually working with longer pieces, push sticks and push shoes might not work as well on a jointer as they might on a table saw, though I suspect Matthias Wandel might still use push sticks on a jointer.</p>

<p>Ideally you should never pass your hands over the cutterhead, even if you are using push pads, but this can be very awkward at first, and at least one of the more famous instructional Internet woodworkers walks along with his workpiece and passes his hands right over the cutterhead (with push pads, of course).  You can use featherboards for face jointing, but most jointer fences are not tall enough to use featherboards for downward pressure when edge jointing wide boards.</p>

<p>Other than the color imparted by the oil, is there any difference between the two finishes? Can I just apply BLO to the wood and cover it with polyurethane?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>What is the difference between wiping polyurethane and wiping varnish?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There can be no difference, they could be the same thing. Although note that sometimes ""wiping polyurethane"" refers to the application method, not the product used.</p>

<p>What we call polyurethane or poly is a type of varnish, a fuller name for it would be polyurethane varnish although some people don't like calling it that it's perfectly accurate. Strangely given the name the polyurethane is merely an additive, actually present at quite a low level. All polys of this type are actually modified versions of an alkyd varnish, so they're technically <em>uralkyd varnish</em>, but uralkyd is considered an ugly word or something so it's rarely seen on labels on consumer-level packaging.</p>

<p>Note for anyone new to finishing: this refers to oil-based polyurethane only, not waterbased ""polyurethane varnish"" (which is not really a varnish in the conventional meaning of the word). The <em>only</em> thing they have in common is the addition of some polyurethane, they're actually completely different otherwise.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to Bob Flexner, the only difference between this and polyurethane-based wiping varnish is that the varnish also contains linseed oil, tung oil, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You've slightly misread that page. Earlier on Flexner states:</p>

<p><em>""All types of varnish are made by cooking an oil with a resin.""</em></p>

<p>And lower down under <strong>Make Your Own</strong> where he says:</p>

<p><em>""After choosing a varnish, turn it into a wiping varnish by thinning it with mineral spirits.""</em></p>

<p>No additional oil is needed to turn a regular varnish into a wiping varnish.</p>

<p>You can add more oil to a thinned varnish if you want to, but this replicates something like ""Danish oil"", not merely a wiping varnish. Products of the ""Danish oil"" type are typically said to contain approximately a 1:1:1 mixture of varnish, an oil (BLO or tung oil usually) and spirits (or turpentine if the user prefers the smell, or believes it improves its characteristics).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can I just apply BLO to the wood and cover it with polyurethane?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes you can. This isn't that uncommon. The main reason you might chose to do this rather than applying the varnish directly to the bare wood is to improve the wetting of the grain, enhancing the figure in the wood (commonly referred to as ""popping the grain""). Oils, <em>on some woods</em>, give increased contrast as well as enhancing any chatoyance (cat's eye effect) compared to the same wood with the varnish applied directly to it. On other woods there's little difference, little enough that it's often not worth the extra effort. And on others there's no difference you'd notice, except for the slightly yellower colour imparted.</p>

<p>This is not just a species-by-species thing, the grain in individual pieces of wood can make all the difference, so obviously this is an area where you need to do some experimentation. </p>

<p>But an example of where you might want to oil first is on a darker wood with good figure, such as burr walnut or ribbon-stripe mahogany, to improve contrast and maximise the chatoyance. An example of where you'd probably want to skip it is any light-coloured wood with straight grain, such as plain maple or clear white pine.</p>

"What sort of dust collection system would be adequate for a two-car garage?","558","","<p>I have only recently moved into a new house with an attached two-car garage. I am also starting to make a fair bit of dust working on projects in the garage.</p>

<p>Tools I am using include handsaws, a circular saw, drills, a 13"" planer and a radial arm saw.</p>

<p>My current method is to work on a project then use a wet/dry utility vacuum to clean everything up afterwards.</p>

<p>What I would like to mitigate:</p>

<ul>
<li>A standing layer of dust on everything in the garage.</li>
<li>A clogged up utility vacuum</li>
<li>An unhealthy workspace</li>
</ul>

<p>I have seen a couple recommendations online, such as a cyclone dust collector which I believe goes after the tool, before the vacuum. Also I have seen DIY air cleaners using box fans and furnace filters.</p>

<p>I do not wish to spend a ton of money, but at the same time I do want a good system for a hobbyist/prosumer that will prevent the above concerns.</p>
","<p>There's two things to consider here: how much the machine throws dust all over the place, and how good dust collection is at the source. The circular saw and RAS are both going to throw dust with a fairly high velocity, and neither have good dust collection mechanisms. You could build one for the circ saw (as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRQaF2R4UcA"" rel=""nofollow"">Jay Bates</a> did for his circ saw) or a <a href=""http://lumberjocks.com/hjt/blog/38727"" rel=""nofollow"">dust shroud</a> for the RAS. For the planer, dust collection tends to be pretty good (at least in my experience when using a dust-collector). So as long as you're sucking chips at the source, you should be good to go. But even if it was so-so, the chips are big enough that they are easy to track down. </p>

<p>So, I'd recommend a couple things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get a chip separator for your shop vac. You can easily <a href=""http://www.woodcraft.com/Articles/Articles.aspx?articleid=408"" rel=""nofollow"">make one yourself</a> or purchase a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B002JP315K"" rel=""nofollow"">dust deputy</a>. This will keep your filter from getting clogged and improve performance. </p></li>
<li><p>Attach a furnace filter to a fan (see <a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/user/irnsrgn/media/wood/aircleaner02.jpg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> image from photobucket), which it sounds like you're doing. </p></li>
<li><p>Use a leaf blower to clear out the thick layer of dust. I actually do this daily to keep my garage clean. (At least it will work well during the summer).</p></li>
<li><p>You might want to invest in a dust collector. There are some fairly inexpensive options out there.

I do not care about the aesthetics (color/scrapes), but need it to not come off.  Im not going to be refinishing it.  It would not be exposed to sun often, but may be taken outside about once or twice a year.  Thus it would not experience much weather change because the house stays relatively the same temperature.  However, it would be exposed to humidity and wear from hands.  Can varnish wear off by rubbing?  I need the strongest finish for these specifications.  Any recommendations?  I would need a type (example: water polyurethane) not a brand.</p>
","<p>General point first, there is no best finish for any job because part of what constitutes 'best' is down to the taste of the individual, which is obviously highly variable. </p>

<p>In addition to that practical considerations come into play for the woodworker, a high-end finish that gives excellent performance might not be picked on the basis of its high cost or because of a short shelf-life (too great a potential for waste). Another reason could be simply down to an issue with application, either it's too challenging to apply well for the project at hand (e.g. superglue finish on intricate carving) or where a finish must be sprayed and there is no spray equipment available.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>but need it to not come off. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just remember that everything has a finite lifespan. No wood finish is 100% guaranteed not to fail, ever. (But see last point below.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can varnish wear off by rubbing? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but strong varnishes are highly wear resistant — as seen on the edges of dining tables where wear-through can take years of regular use. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I need the strongest finish for these specifications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps you don't. Instead consider whether a finish that is easily repairable would be better, so with regular upkeep — easily done by the user, not the original woodworker — you continually restore it rather than attempting to rely on a film finish that will fail eventually (even if after many years of service). </p>

<p>There are two good options in this area that are widely available, relatively inexpensive and easily applied without prior experience: boiled linseed oil (often shortened to BLO) and tung oil (must be pure tung oil, not ""tung oil finish"" which may contain no tung oil at all). </p>

<p>After the initial finish is built up over a week or longer of daily applications and buffing, a couple of additional coats in the first year and one coat per year after that will maintain the finish in good condition for decades, perhaps indefinitely if upkeep is maintained.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>and would like to know the key design considerations and recommended jointing options for such a project</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately there isn't any easy answer to this. </p>

<p>As with many woodworkers when I was designing my own workbench I immersed myself in the topic and spent months collecting images, step-by-step build articles, reading and analysing (over-analysing) books and online sources for any and all suggestions about what materials to use, what joints to favour etc. And the inescapable conclusion from doing this is that there simply isn't any one particularly good design <em>for any aspect</em> of a workbench. </p>

<p>People can't even agree on the minimum thickness for the worktop, there certainly isn't any agreement on what joints should be used (any reasonable joint is strong enough, and many can be further reinforced if needed/desired).</p>

<p>As long as the chief requirements are met — stability and strength — then everything else is up for grabs.</p>

<p>Machinists' benches don't have all the same requirements as a woodworking bench of course but you do see the same individuality in them too. The materials, worktop thickness, key design aspects (including shape and worktop height) all vary enormously from one to another. </p>

<p>So the take-home message is this: <strong>strong <em>enough</em></strong> and <strong>stable <em>enough</em></strong>.</p>

<p>And price of materials doesn't ensure this, by which you can read that it doesn't need to be made from hardwoods. Even if a bench at some point has to be able to support something like an engine or a rear-axle assembly it could be made from inexpensive 2x construction wood throughout, as many real-world examples show.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I envision using something like white oak 4x4s for the legs and having a 3"" or 4"" hard maple top. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless you're set on the materials from an aesthetic point of view I would suggest you re-think a thick maple worktop. It undeniably makes for a strong, attractive slab, and it will be extremely tough and durable, but as amazing as this might seem to a non-woodworker (some woodworkers too!) a solid-wood worktop is <em>less</em> stable than a much cheaper top made from one or more manmade boards, including if made from the cheapest and most maligned of the lot, OSB or oriented-strand board. Another very un-admired material is particleboard (UK: chipboard) which in sufficient thickness is immensely strong — this is the core material of most laminate kitchen countertops. </p>

<p>The difference in price between a hard maple worktop of 3-4"" thickness and one made from some combination of MDF, plywood or particleboard would be considerable, possibly approaching a factor of ten. And the top made from the manmade boards will be more stable as mentioned, and likely at least as strong so actually represents far better value.</p>

<p>If you have your heart set on seeing maple (or another hardwood) on the top you wouldn't have to give it up entirely while still taking advantage of manufactured boards for the bulk of the construction. Hardwood edging strips are usually used on the edges anyway for better durability, and in addition to those a 'skin' of thinner hardwood boards for the top will give the appearance of a benchtop made from hardwood but at a fraction of the price. A particularly good and inexpensive way of skinning the top has been used by a few people on their workbenches: laying a layer of laminate flooring on the surface. </p>

<p>A worktop laminated up from board materials will save money in another way, as in addition to the savings in materials costs the build time will be significantly shorter because it's far easier to construct. Instead of a lengthy and sometimes tricky flattening and smoothing operation at the end of the glue-up of a solid-wood top, a laminated top can be essentially ready to go as soon as the last glue joint has dried.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, notice top is made from 2x4s sistered together, which seems logical to me. Do you bolt them together?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes you can if desired. This is sometimes used as the sole joining method, here's an example for a heavy-duty workbench <em>200 pounds of ""ain't goin' nowhere""</em> as its maker says:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z5R9Q.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z5R9Q.jpg"" alt=""Through-bolted worktop""></a></p>

<p>Other times the threaded rod is used as a reinforcing/stabilising measure, with the boards glued together as normal. To be frank though, this is not needed if the boards are glued together properly (glue joints are <em>at least</em> as strong as the wood itself) but it is sometimes seen as a necessary precaution if the top will see regular exposure to moisture.</p>

<p><strong>Possible leg joints</strong><br>
At the crudest end of the spectrum you could literally nail the entire thing together! It would be plenty sturdy if done right. I'm sure you would prefer not to go this way and for various reasons I wouldn't recommend it anyway. </p>

<p>As touched on above there are innumerable options for true joinery (multiple joint types and multiple variations of each one) and as such it's difficult to recommend just one. What I'll suggest instead is a simple-to-do, very strong, but most importantly <em>reversible</em> construction method that I think is ideally suited to the home workbench: bolt it together. And with very heavy use there's no risk of glue joints creeping or fracturing if you don't have any! </p>

<p>Here's an illustration of how it can be done:<br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TwMZa.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TwMZa.jpg"" alt=""Bolted workbench construction""></a></p>

<p><strong>Joining worktop to leg assemblies</strong><br>
This as you'd probably guess by now can be done in many ways. I'm a fan of the simplest, strongest option for this sort of thing so I would suggest using some of these:</p>

<p>Yes they're crude, but very effective and quick to install. Plus of course it keeps with my theme of keeping the construction simple yet strong, and capable of being knocked down at any point in the future in case you need to move or alter the bench.</p>

"What is the difference between a chisel bit and regular chain saw blade?","551","","<p>I was at a saw shop the other day and someone asked for a chisel bit chain.  When I get a chain at the DIY store it comes in a box and the only choices are brand and size. The chain this customer got came off a roll, like a length of rope, the clerk took of a length went in the back and came back out with proper loop of chain for the saw.  What is a chisel bit chain? How does the roll of saw chain factor into it?</p>
","<p>The comparison of chisel bit chain and regular chain should be Chisel-Bit vs. Scratcher-Bit. Other synonyms might exist. </p>

The square tooth square grind being the most efficient and arguably the harder of the three to keep sharpened. Number of teeth and gaps in between also play a major roll in an individual chains upkeep and effectiveness.</p>

<h1>Scratcher-Bit</h1>

<p>The first chain saw chains had teeth similar to a common wood saw and are refereed to as <em>scratcher</em> teeth. Since they do not have a depth guide like chisel-teeth it made the chain cut slower and inefficient. See picture from Wikipedia</p>

<p>You could always use hinges that are designed to have the pins removed regularly.  These are called ""loose pins,"" and resemble that depicted below.</p>

<p>You would install them so that they fold in the direction you want for your box and arch configurations and just take the pins out for storage.</p>

<p>Edit: now that I look at it again, these types of hinges would be very useful for your box configuration since they can ""complete"" the square and keep it from coming apart while still being disassemble-able, which is something that the two-way hinges can't do.</p>

<p>Edit #2: As you've indicated, where you live you haven't been able to find these types of hinges.

A bent nail would work (the ones linked above recommend a 20 penny nail as a replacement pin, for example).</p>

"Finish raised the ""grain""?","548","","<p>I recently put together a stationary combination work bench and cabinets out of 5/8 particle board and 9/8 ""benchtop"" (which appears to just be thick particle board). I previously made a work table from the same ""benchtop"" and applied an oil-based polyurethane finish to it without issue. However I had some water-based polyurethane around that I wanted to use up, both in matte and satin finish, so I applied a coat of the water-based matte finish to my new tops.</p>

<p>To my surprise, the smooth face of the particle board became quite rough. Can I treat this like regular wood and just sand it back down before applying another coat of the water-based polyurethane, or do I need to try something else for my next coat?</p>

<p>The rough look of this combination work bench and cabinet is in this shot of the plans below, although I made a number of small changes on the fly and haven't updated the plans to match. The purple bits are intended to be slide-out drawers, and the teal bits are intended to be slide out shelves (that I'll probably mount at mixed heights), but I haven't built either of those yet.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7UyGN.png"" alt=""combination work bench and cabinet""></p>

<p>Again, my question is about re-smoothing the ""benchtop"" particle board that the water-based polyurethane seems to have raised, whether another coat will cause more problems after I do so. (Or if I need to just cover it with a layer of hardboard.)</p>

<p>Also, I'm thinking of priming and possibly painting the rest of this cabinet; do I have to worry about raising the ""grain"" there?</p>
","<blockquote>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p>The finish swelled the wood fibres in the particleboard/chipboard. So although it's not raising <em>the grain</em> as in the case of solid wood (or the surface of plywood) it is the same thing effectively.</p>

<p>Don't sand too heavily. Just as when sanding raised grain on wood or ply the idea it just to smooth off the raised fibres, not to sand the surface off. So use fine paper (150-240 grit) and sand minimally, with light pressure. </p>

<p>Only if using waterbased primer. </p>

<p>Even at that, some products raise grain much less than others. This is partly dependent on water content (higher solids content means less water) but also on other aspects of formulation.</p>

"Are active charcoal air filters effective against finishing fumes?","547","","<p>I do my woodworking in a small basement, with medium-poor air circulation. I will probably end up buying an air filter (I'm looking at the Jet AFS-500) anyway, since it seems like a good idea for the dust my dust extraction misses.  </p>

<p>I see that that many of these systems allow the installation of active-charcoal filters, and I'm wondering if using such a filter will allow me to safely apply finishes in my basement workshop (brush or wipe, not spray)?  Are there any common finishing products which produce fumes that would not be handled by such a filter?</p>
","<p>""All"" (like ""always"" or ""never"") is generally a bad wording, since unless the question is <em>""Do all people have to die?""</em>, the answer must obviously be ""no"". There are very few absolutes in nature.</p>

<p>But in general, <strong>yes</strong>, a coal filter will absorb fumes like solvents / paint thinner and other organic substances (like the ones that escape from PU coatings, or alcohols). It will not catch <em>all</em>, but a reasonably high proportion (upwards of 99.9%).</p>

<p><strong>However,</strong> in order to be reasonably safe, you should wear a mask <em>in addition</em> to the air filter, as it will take some time and a few revolutions of the air volume in your shop for the filter to pick up the fumes, and you still inhale them while swinging your brush.  </p>

<p>The air filter (or dust collection, likewise) is good at making the air breathable for when you come back after lunch or the next morning, but it's not sufficient while you are working and inhaling hazardous particles or chemicals as they're being generated and you're bent over with your nose close to the source. It's better than nothing, of course, but all by itself not sufficient.</p>

<p>When I say ""mask"", I mean something that looks <a href=""http://www.wolkdirekt.com/images/280/3M6200/atemschutzmasken-arbeitsschutzbekleidung-3m-atemschutzmaske-halbmaske-nach-en-140.jpg"">like this</a>. There exist different filters for these, and different normatives. ""SL"" is not optimal (designed for aerosols, but will also catch some gas) but should do (""S"" <em>will not</em> do!) but preferrably you want ""A1"" or ""A2"" which are suitable for organic gases with a ""normal"" boiling point and only differ in price and how many sigmas of absorption you get (price is not that much of a factor, so I'd go ""A2"" in any case). There's filters that combine A2 with E1 (acidic gases) and some combos that catch anorganic gases on top. I don't use these (you don't have chlorine gas in your shop, do you!).<br>
For woodworking <em>dust</em>, generally ""P1"" should be enough, ""P2"" catches stuff that you normally only get when soldering or laser-cutting... but alas, I'll also use the better one just in case.<br>
There's filters that combine P and A, but I'm wary of these. Wouldn't want to wear out the coal filter while brathing ""only "" dust... but of course they're comfortable, one thing catches all.</p>

<p>Do note that coal filters have a considerably limited life time, after which they will cease to absorb chemicals. Be absolutely positively sure to read the instructions and comply with them (that is, change filter after a said time), or  your ""safety"" equipment will eventually stop working without you being aware, leaving you a false sense of safety.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>I'm worrying about the picture-framing and expansion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good eye. There are multiple issues with the design of the table pictured, if you want to make it from solid wood. The first is not obvious, it's the 'edge banding' around the periphery. This frames the table, which is nearly always a very bad idea if the tabletop is made from solid wood (see <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/5255/thick-tabletop-movement"">recent Q&amp;A</a>).</p>

<p>This is one of the things that make me suspect that the table in the photo is made from plywood or another board material with veneers applied. I actually hope it is because there is an alternative explanation unfortunately — that it is built exactly as it looks, which will inevitably lead to cracks, various joints opening up and possibly other issues. It's sadly too common these days for things to be built with no consideration to wood movement. Periodically I see pieces built poorly like this where cracks have begun to form even before the piece has left the showroom.</p>

<p>The more obvious picture-framing in this top isn't the usual way it's tried, with just a relatively narrow frame around a wide field. And as a result it may be possible to do this using solid wood throughout. The main issue with picture-framing normally is the inevitable expansion and contraction of the central panel, which will push apart the framing (breaking some of the mitres) during wetter months and shrink in away from it during dry months, opening up gaps on the long sides. </p>

<p>Here the centre is just the one board and it's not too wide so you might be able to get away with it (although it will strain the joints somewhat). It would be highly advisable to use quarter-sawn wood for this centre board at least to limit its movement. QS material used throughout would actually be desirable, although what's available in your chosen species is going to limit you here.</p>

<p>Because the mitred elements are so wide here you do have to be concerned about those long mitre joints. Glued-up panels are primarily joined with simple butt joints which because they're long-grain joints are very strong. The 45° cuts making up four of the major joints in this top are end-grain to end-grain joints, which are famously weak and in need of reinforcement. And that's even in a picture frame which will be oriented vertically with no strain put upon it but its own weight! Not a tabletop that someone might lean their weight on..... so I think the table's apron will need to be large enough that it provides good support out to near the edges or you'll run into problems in service..</p>

"How do I properly care for my paintbrushes?","539","","<p>I have been diligently cleaning my paintbrushes after use by rinsing them in the recommended solvent (in this case mineral turpentine). Nonetheless, this last time my paintbrush hardened into a solid block of bristles, which caused me to question my understanding of paintbrush care. I'm going to try and <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3258/i-polyed-my-paintbrush-then-procrastination-left-me-in-a-predicament"">salvage my paintbrush</a>, but in order to avoid this happening again: How do I properly care for my paintbrushes?</p>

<p>In my case, I use my paintbrushes for applying varnish, however care for both paint and varnish (if there's any difference) would probably be most useful.</p>
","<p>TL;DR warning.</p>

<p>Rinsing is, usually, only the first step in brush cleaning. Many paints and varnishes will state on the label that brushes should be washed after use and if this advice is followed properly you'll never have a brush dry stiff or hard.</p>

<p>You don't need to beat yourself up about your brush having dried hard, it has happened to almost everyone at least once.... and for some it's a regular occurrence. I've rarely handled brushes other people have cleaned (and this includes numerous commercial painters) and not found them at least slightly stiff! Many have been much worse than this. Brush cleaning is a time-consuming and frankly boring task that comes at the end of the process where folks are already tired and want to just be done with it so it's very common for people to do a half-assed job. I'm guilty of this myself and I bet nearly everyone has been too.</p>

<p>Even if you thought you were rinsing the brush well you probably weren't using enough solvent, so in effect dilute varnish was left distributed uniformly through the brush head. The solvent container should be quite large in relation to the size of the brush for effective rinsing, as you want the dilution rate to be high. In practice this means that for a 100mm (4"") brush you should be rinsing in <em>something the size of a small bucket</em>. Personally I think that even a small finish brush shouldn't be rinsed in less than 500ml of solvent, and going up to a litre wouldn't hurt.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my case, I use my paintbrushes for applying varnish, however care for both paint and varnish (if there's any difference) would probably be most useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No effective difference. Although with paint it's much easier to see how successfully we've cleaned a brush since any paint remaining will stain the drying paper/cloth at the penultimate step.</p>

<p><strong>The proper traditional method</strong><br>
Rinsing is just one step of a multi-step process in the traditional method, but it's not actually step one.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wipe the brush as clean of paint or finish before you rinse. It's counter-productive to contaminate your rinsing solvent with a large volume of finish when you can so easily remove a large amount of it by simply wiping the brush dry beforehand.</p></li>
<li><p>Rinse in solvent. This does not merely mean swishing the brush back and forth in the liquid, you should press the brush out on the bottom or sides of the container to fan the bristles out and help the solvent get between them. Rinse a bit, wipe the brush against the rim, rinse a bit more, wipe. Do this a few times.</p></li>
<li><p>Dry out the brush on paper or cloth (it won't end up dry, you're just soaking out excess).</p></li>
<li><p>Rinse again as above.</p></li>
<li><p>Dry the brush as thoroughly as possible on more clean, dry paper towels or cloths.</p></li>
<li><p>Now you wash the brush in <em>warm</em> soapy water, splaying the bristles out in the palm of your hand or against the base of the sink, working up a good lather, and then rinse thoroughly. I can't stress how much difference warm water makes here. You can use cold where and when necessary, but warm water makes the job much much easier. </p>

<p>For the soap a block of basic hand soap is fine, also dish soap/wash-up liquid or liquid hand cleanser can be used, it doesn't make that much difference with coarse-bristled brushes and makes zero difference with synthetic brushes.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the washing if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you've thoroughly washed and rinsed the brush the bristles should be squeaky clean. Re-form the brush head and put it aside to dry. Flat, hanging tip-down or in a jar with the bristles pointing up generally makes no difference any more, but if you want to err on the side of caution hang them or dry flat.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Phew! You're probably tired just reading that, any wonder nobody wants to do this properly on each and every brush used every single time? And it's no joke, cleaning a few brushes really well this way can take the guts of an hour.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> when using the brush for solvent-based paint the brush should be absolutely dry before you use it again and overnight drying is often not enough. It's fine to use a slightly damp brush again if using a waterbased finish.</p>

<p><strong>Solvent only</strong><br>
You can clean a brush perfectly well using solvent only. The reason most don't do this is because of the amount of solvent required, and the space the containers take. Re. the note above in the traditional method about the amount of solvent, for this method to work well you'll need at least a couple of litres and again, more would not hurt.</p>

<p>For oil-based varnish I would use <em>at minimum</em> two rinsing containers, but three or more is better. Some people use as many as five and report that it does make a difference. Personally I doubt if you're doing it right that more than three is necessary, but a fourth could be added for security.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wipe the brush dry first.</li>
<li>Rinse in container one and dry out the brush as described above.</li>
<li>Now do at least two rinse cycles in the second container.</li>
<li>Dry again and rinse well in the third container. </li>
<li>Dry off the brush and re-form it into shape and put it aside to dry. </li>
</ul>

<p>This time it's okay if the brush is still slightly damp when you go to use it again as it's damp with the right solvent, and you'll probably want to dampen it before use anyway (see related point at bottom below the separator).</p>

<p>To monitor how well you're rinsing out the brush the solvent in the third container should remain clear, without any tinge of yellow, nearly indefinitely (literally years if you're not cleaning brushes on a regular basis). If it does start to become yellowed it is not the end of the world, but it indicates you should be being a little more scrupulous in the preceding steps or that you're not using a sufficient volume of solvent.</p>

<p>If you conscientiously use either of the above methods well your brushes will last and last — I have numerous brushes that are over ten years old and still going strong. But that's nothing, many professional finishers and painters report that they have brushes that are 20-50 years old o_O</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Preloading the brush with solvent</strong><br>
The tip given in the answer by LeeG of moistening the brush prior to loading it with the paint or shellac/varnish is one given in a few good guides to finishing. The primary reason to do this is that it's an aid in smooth brushing, it helps the finish flow out from the brush (and it is excellent at this). A second reason that might be given is that it helps with rinsing out the brush afterwards (note that the longer you paint the less help this is, particularly with fast-drying finishes). </p>

<p>Some guides may give both or just one of the above reasons, and may go on to state that it helps prevent the paint from wicking up into the base of the bristles inside the ferrule but they're completely wrong on this, <em>it actually has the reverse effect in practice</em>. This should be perfectly logical, thin liquids wick much better than thick liquids. But if anyone has doubts try comparison tests and see for yourself.</p>

<p>The best way to help prevent finish getting up into the ferrule is to never load the brush more than halfway up the bristles.</p>

<p>I've been following Paul Sellers for a little bit now absorbing his knowledge of how to use simple hand tools. But one thing that he either directly said or alluded to was to pay attention to the wood and work with it. I saw a documentary on Japanese woodworking and that got me thinking about how can I build things differently and ""work with the wood"" instead of against it. So that is why I am willing to spend the extra time to cut this all out for the framing. Now this isn't to say that I'm not going to use screws at all as I plan on using them to put the siding on, and I think I am going to need it for the roof (unless there is a technique for that too!) Anywho. Thoughts?</p>
","<p>TL;DR warning.</p>

<p>While using 'proper' joints is the way that some shed walls were constructed in the recent past* I think I should say something about why this isn't done as much today — because other ways are faster (<em>much</em> faster) while still producing a structure that's fit for purpose.</p>

<p>There's a strong parallel to be drawn with the way that a traditional timber-frame building was, and in some places still is, put together versus a modern house roof frame. The traditional timber frame uses various well-cut joints that intersect nearly perfectly, then often locked in place with pegs, and originally a house's roof frame would have featured some similar joints (derived as they were from trad timber framing practices). But today there's almost no actual joinery and we largely rely on metal hanging brackets, nails, screws and bolts.</p>

<p>Now it could be argued that the old way was better, producing stronger buildings that hold up better over time, but even if we accept that as a given there's no denying that the modern way produces structures that are <em>strong enough</em>. And they can be made significantly stronger than the norm by just exceeding code (e.g. using more numerous and/or longer fasteners, screws instead of nails in certain places, using every hole formed in a joist fastener and not just the minimum required by the regs).</p>

<p>So my advice would be to go ahead with this sort of construction** only if you want to do it as an exercise in laying out and cutting of joints, for the pride in knowing how the shed was put together when you're done. </p>

<p>But if your primary goal here is merely to end up with a solid shed then be confident that modern metal fittings, galvanised nails or screws will produce a structure that's good enough, both in terms of strength and longevity. My parents' back garden had a shed in it that was taken down recently; it was made of softwood of indifferent quality as most sheds are over here are and was largely put together with staples (yes, staples) and yet it withstood plenty of bad weather, including two or three hurricanes, in the 30+ years it stood without losing its roof, being structurally undermined or even losing a single siding board. It was heavily weathered when it came time to take it down recently, with many loose boards and some rot. But it still had to be cut apart using a reciprocating saw! So build just a bit better than this and your grandchildren will be wondering what to do with the shed grandpa Snyder built way back in 2016 :-)</p>

<p>*For a bit of historical perspective, I have electronic copies of carpentry books dating from 1875 through to approximately the time of the First World War and looking through them just now <em>none</em> show joinery used for stud wall construction that I could find. All the drawings appear to show basic butt-jointed timbers used throughout, presumably to be toenailed in place as is common practice today.</p>

<p>**But not exactly what you've shown. The orientation of the wood in the rail in the Sketchup image doesn't make best use of the strength of the wood. It should be edge-up, not face-up, to best resist bending forces (maximising 'beam strength'). And with this orientation you wouldn't go ahead with your planned M&amp;T joints, a better fit would be half-laps. You could use bridle joints as an option but they're more difficult to cut and probably provide no real improvement in strength.</p>

"Is dimensional lumber kiln-dried differently than a kiln-dried board meant for woodworking?","537","","<p>It may just be the species that are normally used for this purpose, but dimensional lumber such as studs, 2x6, 2x12, etc. works differently than any other wood I've used. It requires more effort to handplane and never develops a smooth surface. I encounter more pitch. </p>

<p>What is the cause of this? Is it harvested during a different season? Dried more/less?</p>
","<p>You're asking the right questions but before you blame the <a href=""http://www.mcilvain.com/lumber-drying-process/"">drying process</a> or harvest season, make sure you're comparing apples to apples.</p>

<p>You didn't mention what type of wood you're using when you buy dimensional lumber vs. rough lumber, but the type of wood may be a large factor. For example, Douglas fir, which is commonly sold as studs and dimensional lumber in some regions, does not hand plane as smoothly as hardwoods such as oak and walnut. A sharp blade will plane all three pretty well, but hand planing oak is like hand planing butter compared to hand planing Douglas fir. Generally-speaking, softwoods like those typically used to manufacture 2x4s are typically more resinous than hardwoods.</p>

<p>Getting back to your original supposition: yes, it is possible to improperly kiln dry lumber, and this causes case-hardening and can have cosmetic implications, as well, as mentioned in an article from <a href=""http://www.wood-database.com/wood-articles/drying-wood-at-home/"">The Wood Database</a>. Moisture content can also affect how easily you can work the wood. But the type of wood is probably the most important factor in determining how well you'll be able to work a given piece of wood.</p>

"How to shape a toy boat's hull accurately?","536","","<p>I would like to make a series of boat's hulls from a single block of wood. My first consideration is how to semi-accurately model the complex geometry of the stern and bow of a ship. The models only have to be optically accurate and will not be used for wave modeling or scientific analysis, but nevertheless the geometries are pretty complex. Has anyone had similar projects who can help?</p>
","<p>One method for reproducing complex curves is to mill the surfaces of the block flat and parallel, and then use a drill press to drill a series of holes to measured depths. You can then start removing stock by any means: band saw, hand planes, sanding, etc. until you've just barely removed the evidence of the holes.</p>

<p>Another possibility is to create a series of templates for use with a plunge router -- one template for each depth. This would leave you with a hull with a series of steps, and you'd again have to remove the remaining stock. This is a sort of manual version of CNC routing (which is yet another possibility).</p>

"Remove nails from table frame","536","","<p>I have an old table which I would like to disassemble and restore. The side and end rails of the table are joined to the legs using a mortise and tenon, which is then skew nailed from the inside of the rails, through the tenon and into the leg. The nail doesn't protrude at either the point or the head end. I'd like to avoid drilling around the nail heads if possible, although I fear this might be the only option.</p>
","<p>No option, you're going to have to dig into the wood a bit. You need to be able to get a grip on the nail heads to begin to pull them out and if they're sunk below the surface you can only do this by removing some wood. </p>

<p>With a bit of luck though you may only need to drill two small holes on either side of each nail, just enough to allow the tips of pliers to get a grip. Needle-nosed pliers are ideal if you have them.</p>

<p>Once you've gotten a grip on the nail pull straight up. The grip of wood on a nail can be very tight so this can be difficult at the best of times, but in the Comments you say the table has been in the weather so be prepared for the possibility that this will be much more difficult than you'd like (sorry!) as the nails are likely to be rusted, possibly along their whole length, and rust can virtually glue a nail to wood.</p>

<p>Assuming you can pull the nail up enough that the head projects, obviously continue pulling straight up if the nail is being cooperative. </p>

<p>If it's hard work and the pliers keeps on slipping free (at worst taking the nail head with it) it's wise to switch to using a nail puller, forked prybar (cat's paw) or the trusty claw hammer. These all require you to lever to one side of the nail so to protect the wood from being dented you need to insert a thin bit of wood or plywood. The blade of a putty knife also works well. </p>

<p><strong>Pliers only</strong> — if by chance the pliers is the only tool available you can greatly ease the pulling of nails by also taking advantage of leverage. I couldn't find a photo showing this method so I'll have to try to describe it as best I can. Firstly you switch grip, so that the pliers is holding the nail from the side, just under the head ideally. Insert a thin piece of wood or dowel (the end of a paintbrush handle will work well) underneath the hinge area of the pliers to provide a fulcrum, now lowering the grips will rotate the nose of the pliers upwards, pulling the nail with it. </p>

<p>This is amazingly effective, requiring little physical effort (go leverage!) and I've successfully removed rink-shank nails this way when I couldn't get a grip on them with the claw hammer I was using. It can be slow, as you need to lever, let go and grip again, lever, rinse and repeat, but it gets the job done.</p>

<p><strong>Afterwards</strong><br>
The drilling and maybe some of the levering is going to mark up the wood around the site of each nail and it'll look a bit chewed up, but as this is on the inside faces of the apron the damage won't normally be seen. If you're like most woodworkers though you will want to tidy it up. Obviously you can just slap in some filler and call 'er done but a better way is plug with wood. Often this is done with a piece of dowelling but because this is a mortise cheek I think it's probably best to drill a shallow hole (e.g. using a Forstner) and glue in a long-grain plug of similar, or if you prefer contrasting, wood. </p>

<p>In either case this is purely an aesthetic improvement, filled/plugged or not I don't think it will materially affect the stability of the joints once the table is put back together again. </p>

<p>P.S. If after cleaning off the joint faces you find that the fit of the tenons in the mortises is loose you need to carefully choose your new adhesive. None of the usual furniture glues, including <em>all</em> white and yellow types of PVA, hide glue and the common foaming type of polyurethane glue are suitable for a very sloppy joint. I think your best bet would be to use epoxy, which has excellent gap-filling properties. </p>

<p>If you find the straight epoxy is too liquid blend it with wood flour or fine sanding dust to thicken it up (see, <a href=""http://www.epoxycraft.com/peanut-butter-ketchup-syrup-mayonnaise-got-epoxy-resin/"">What have peanut butter, ketchup, syrup and mayonnaise got to do with epoxy resin?</a>).</p>

  <p>So my question is, do I need to countersink these screws?</p>

<p>Since these are going to be used on the floorboards and overlaid with another layer of subfloor sheet, so long as you screw these in enough that they don't stick proud of the floorboard surface, I see no need to countersink.</p>

<p>It's hard to answer that question.  Countersink bits are all kinds of different sizes and slopes, so you'd be better off going to the store with a screw and seeing what will work.</p>

<p>Hardboard that's only 3mm (1/8"") is going to be hard to fasten with screws since it's so thin.  If you're set on using screws, I would use 6mm (1/4"") hardboard or plywood instead with 25mm (1"") screws.  These you would want to countersink since hardboard doesn't really allow screws to self-countersink.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if you're dead set on using 3mm hardboard as your subfloor, I would consider using construction adhesive and <a href=""http://www.screwfix.com/p/easyfix-annular-ring-nails-2-x-25mm-0-5kg-pack/14437"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ring shank (annular ring) nails</a>.  These are specifically designed to not work loose in situations like flooring so that they don't squeak.  The adhesive is just a bit of insurance in case the nails work loose.  The size I have linked is 2 x 25mm, which should be fine for the 3mm hardboard.  You may have to predrill the hardboard for the nails, just FYI.</p>

"How can I strengthen my 3/4"" Plywood Bunk Bed Plan?","531","","<p>I'm working on a plywood bunk bed for our two 4 year olds. Obviously I need it to look cool, but more importantly not collapse on their impressionable skulls.</p>

<p>I plan on using 3/4 plywood (.706 or so) with 3/8"" dowels and some pocket screws (as well as titebond). I don't want to over or under engineer it.</p>

<p>The width and depth allow for about 1/2"" on each side of the matresses. I'm most concerned about
 1. racking left to right and back to front
 2. enough support across the top long spans of 3/4"" to prevent collapsing.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Actually you should seek to over-engineer this, or at least err on the side of stronger than you think you need, because it can't hurt given the dynamic forces this might be subjected to over time.</p>

<hr>

<p>One key thing separate from the construction methodology is to make sure it's as rigid as possible to begin with because the least amount of play will put great stress on all the glue joints (which won't be as strong as you'd like because this is plywood), all the fasteners and on the dowels. So after it's put together you want it stiff enough that no racking <em>at all</em> occurs when you push, pull or twist it. </p>

<hr>

<p>Corner glue blocks (either triangular or square in section) as you're considering are an excellent way of strengthening plywood constructions like this so very good idea to include some. </p>

<p>If you were just making a simple box (something like a blanket chest), the difference in rigidity before you put on the reinforcing blocks and after is like night and day.</p>

<p>Both glueing and screwing is advisable but note that for best strength you should screw through the ply into the block, not screw the block to the plywood.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My question is, am I missing something that could strength the whole assembly? Will what I have planned be good enough? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think what you have planned would be good enough. But as I say it can't hurt to go stronger if you can identify weak spots. You only need to increase strength a small amount in key areas to greatly increase the strength of the overall structure because once assembled all joints mutually support the overall shape as in most furniture (where individual joints can be so-so but all together produce a very strong piece).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Didn't want to user metal 90 degree connectors cuz of the sharp edges but I COULD put them out of reach for the children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm a big fan of these because of their strength, even though they are ugly. For this application their edges and corners are a bit of a worry of course. Probably <em>the</em> way to address that would be to mortise them into the plywood like butt hinges are. </p>

<p>Alternatively you could round over all the corners and arrises, which is easily done with a metal file as the brackets are only mild steel in most cases, which any decent metalworking file won't have any trouble with. I'd judge this would take less than 10 minutes for a set of four, but naturally it will remove any anti-rust plating they might have from the areas you work*. </p>

<hr>

<p>*This isn't a big deal in a lot of interior applications and even if they do begin to rust slightly I can promise it won't progress far enough to undermine their strength within the lifetime of the bed. Even in an unheated garage in a damp climate it might take decades for that kind of rusting to weaken a bracket like this. </p>

"Using smooth dowel pegs","530","","<p>Commercially available dowel pegs come with a spiral groove around their outside surface. How important is this grooving? </p>

<p>This comes to bear in the case when using smooth dowel stock to make ones own dowel pegs. Should one always buy the commercial grooved pegs or are DIY smooth pegs just as good?</p>
","<p>It probably doesn't make much difference, but I suspect it also depends on your application. If your joint must withstand more shearing force, I would expect the smooth dowels to be slightly stronger at resisting shearing, all else being equal. If you have a single dowel that must withstand rotational force (such as in a knob), maybe a grooved dowel is better (like treaded vs. bald tires). If the joint must withstand pulling or racking force along the length of the dowel, there may not be much difference at all, but I would somewhat expect the grooved dowel joint to be weaker since glue on its own is not a good filler and the insides of the grooves are just open space with no mating surfaces.</p>

<p>I've always thought the grooved dowels were simply designed to be easier to push in. The grooves provide reduced contact area between the dowel and the walls of the hole, and at the same time they provide channels for any excess glue if you didn't drill the hole slightly deeper than the dowel. This also means you won't get an air-tight seal that causes compressed air and/or glue to push dowel back outward.</p>

<p>On the other hand, perhaps the grooved dowels are slightly oversized, and they deform inside the holes so they remain compressed and tight-fitting at all times.  But you could just as easily make a tight fit using a smooth dowel.</p>

"Easy options to mount a 2x6 to concrete","529","","<p>I am adding shelves to my basement and I need to mount 2x6 to basement concrete.</p>

<p>I asked one of Home Depot folks and he suggested to use Tapcon as the most optimal option. He explained that a concrete nailer could be much more expensive. </p>

<p>I expect Tapcon screws are my lowest cost option. I wanted to post my question here and learn about my options. </p>

<p>Are there any other easier and cost effective options for mounting a 2x6 to concrete?</p>
","<p>If you have a hammer drill, then use tapcon.  If you don't, then you're going to have to buy or rent tools anyway, and the decision isn't clear.  Cost is largely a wash if you don't already have the appropriate tools for one or the other. Time is different, though.  Drilling holes and then screwing in screws is much more time consuming than simply shooting a nail.  The biggest advantage for screws, though, is that they can generally be removed if needed later.  Nails can be too, but they may chip or spall the concrete, or you may have to cut them off and grind them down flush with the concrete later if you decide to remove the item they are attaching.</p>

<p>With screws you can use a regular drill and a concrete bit, but the bit wears down quickly and the drill proceeds slowly.  If you have very few fasteners, though, this can be the most cost effective option.  If you have many fasteners you'll want to rent a hammer drill, which works with the concrete drill bit to drill significantly more quickly and easily.</p>

<p>Chances are good that a cheap drill will have difficulty driving the concrete screw in, though.  Again, a strong drill or a hammer drill improves the experience here, but isn't necessary.  If you use the hex-head screws you can use a socket set to drive them in, and again is a cheaper option to buying a new drill if you aren't doing very many of them.</p>

<p>With nails the work goes very quickly.  The powder actuated nailer isn't terribly expensive to buy or rent (cheaper than the hammer drill) but the consumables (powder and nails) are more expensive than the screws per fastener.  However, you can't beat the speed you can attach something with.  If you're doing many fasteners and don't have a hammer drill, being able to nail in the boards quickly allows you to move forward in your project.</p>

<p>Nails can cause problems, particularly in substandard concrete.  If the concrete is soft, or has evidence of spalling or a lot of cracking, you should probably shy away from nails.  You also have to make some decisions in the blind - without knowing how hard the concrete is you have to try a few different size powder charges to find the one that drives the nail to the correct depth.</p>

<p>And, again, if you believe there's a good chance someone will want to undo what you've done, screws can be slightly more forgiving in terms of removing them from the concrete and using that area in other ways.  Nails are hardly a deal breaker, but they can complicate removal later.</p>

<p>The timber is very well aged (at least 20 years), quartersawn thick originally, now it's been put through a thicknesser it's about 60mm thick. It came from some massive beams which were salvaged from a collapsed building  after an earthquake in another part of the country. I've previously used quartersawn wood from the same batch as massive shelves which I finished with Danish Oil and which came out brilliantly.</p>

<p>I would have oiled this tabletop too, but it needs a lot more sanding (by hand!) to get it perfectly even and level and smooth enough to oil (the laminate join between the two bits of timber that make up the tabletop is lower than the rest of the tabletop, it should have gone through the thicknesser a few more times AFTER being joined, but that's wasn't feasible), and unfortunately the weather isn't reliable enough to do that for another couple of months. Plus, it just cool just being raw timber as it is right now.</p>

<p>The sap has only come out in the last few days, and I am sure it is because I have been turning the heating up to stay warm. It's doesn't come off at the touch and it smells fine, so it's not a massive inconvenience, but I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice on how to 'cure' the sap? I would prefer to stick with my plan of oiling the tabletop, but I could varnish it instead if that is a more reliable option. But, like I said, I have used this timber elsewhere and finished it with oil and I have had no problems.</p>
","<p>Oil as planned, then seal with shellac? If shellac will stop knots bleeding through paintwork applied over it it could similarly prevent gross penetration of sap like this but only time would tell if this worked. To be an effective barrier the shellac couldn't be just a thinly wiped coat so it would of course change the look of the piece fairly significantly.</p>

<p>This sort of thing happens less frequently these days because of kiln drying being so common to quickly get wood down to workable moisture levels, and the heating 'sets' the sap in the wood (basically converting it to a harder, crystalline form, which is a permanent change). </p>

<p>You can mimic the effect to a degree with air-dried wood by just allowing it to get to a high temperature, even by sitting it in direct sunlight (the temps required are quite low, below the boiling point of water in fact).</p>

<p>It's possible that you may be able to locally treat the wood by heating with a heat gun, without much risk of scorching the wood. In theory you might also be able to do this with a domestic iron but I don't know how deeply the heating would need to go to solve the problem.</p>

I mention the desk since it opens up for the possibility to add support crossbeams on the legs if that should be needed.</p>
","<p>I see three inherent weaknesses, two of which critically compromise the strength of the bed.  I'd suggest looking at commercially-produced solid wood bed frames for some design ideas (don't look at cheap futons, etc.).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1LKQh.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1LKQh.png"" alt=""illustration with callouts for weaknesses""></a></p>

<p>The support beam running down the middle is inherently weak at the ends because the top half transfers the load to the outer frame, but the top has notches cut into it.  You want a single contiguous piece from end to end for maximum load-bearing capacity.  This weakness is not present in the other question you linked. You may be able to somewhat address it by using a box spring or sheet of plywood across the top, but if the mattress is going to lie directly on this frame, I'd be concerned about that center beam.</p>

<p>Similar to the other question, your design's legs appear to be very long but they don't have anything to reinforce them against racking. You may want to consider using wider but thinner lumber, as opposed to more square lumber for the outer frame. Although you will still want some additional reinforcement against racking with such long legs, a wider board will give you a longer and stronger joint between the legs and the frame. It will also be more resistant to deflection than a square beam if you orient it with its narrower edges facing up and down, and it will make your design stronger since you won't have to cut halfway through them in order to accommodate the cross bars in your design.</p>

<p>The third weakness involves all those cuts into the load-bearing parts. Some might argue that they are not very visually appealing, either, but that judgement is up to you or whoever will be using this bed.  Instead of making those cuts in the outer frame, consider installing cleats to bear the load without compromising the strength of the frame.</p>

"Does knotty wood dull a hand plane faster than normal wood?","520","","<p>While I was planing down a plank of Cedar this evening I noticed that the plane did not slide through the knotty wood, that it was a harsh stop.  It made me wonder whether I should attempt to plane wood that has knots in it.</p>

<p>Does knot wood cause a hand plane's blade to become duller faster than regular wood?</p>
","<p>Knots do in fact dull any cutter faster than the surrounding wood does because they are harder.  Knots don't leave severe nicks though.</p>

<p>The secret to good hand planing is to sharpen often - sharpness is the best thing to improve results.  When encountering knots it is helpful to skew the plane a bit and approach the knot at an angle but having the blade sharp is important.</p>

<p>I find that I need to sharpen every time I intend to use the plane if I know that I will use it for more than a few passes.  When I say 'sharpen' I don't mean grind, coarse stone, medium stone, fine stone - all that rigamarole.  I just mean 'honing', i.e., using the fine stone and then strop it on some leather.</p>

<p>At this point, I'll stop because sharpening is another huge topic and I don't want to go off-topic.  Suffice it to say that knots are indeed hard to plane but frequent honing helps.  </p>

<p>Side note:  when using a surface planer (big power tool), if the knives are not new and sharp, they can rip the knots completely out.  You can hear them rattling around inside the planer before then find their way out.  This is startling when it happens.  I should replace my planer knives more often than I do because in my case, it seems that the rollers do not pull the work through as well if the knives are not sharp.  This is probably unique to the planer I have.</p>

"Can some woods just never have a clean finish after sanding?","519","","<p>I am cleaning up pallet wood to be used for miscellaneous projects.

"Connecting the MDF corners, so there's no gap","519","","<p>One day I got bored, and wanted to play some Pac-Man. Playing it on PC didn't really felt right, so I wanted to buy an arcade cabinet. After checking the prices on eBay I made the best decision... ""$1,500 for a cabinet? I can build this myself!""</p>

<p>Needless to say, it's a great idea for someone with no prior woodworking experience...</p>

<p>Anyway, I am moving forward quite nicely, but I've stumbled upon a problem that I can't seem to find a solution.</p>

<p>I am thinking how can I connect MDF sheets together, so there wouldn't be a gap between them - basically how can I cut the angle of it (and what tools you may recommend?).</p>

<p>In the image I am attaching you can see my rough sketch of arcade cabinet on the left, and what I am thinking, how I'll connect the top sheet and back sheet together. They join on a slight angle, and I want to achieve the result on the right (where they blend together), and not on the left, where there's a gap.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eFd0B.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eFd0B.jpg"" alt=""MDF corner joining""></a></p>

<p>TL;DR</p>

<p>How do I connect the MDF sheets on the corners, so they align nicely, and there's no gap? As you can see in the sketch, the angles are not always 45 degress.</p>
","<p>It sounds like you want a <em>mitered corner</em>.</p>

<p>You will want to find the overall angle of the piece in relation to the vertical one. Just a guess but it looks like it is 15-20 degrees above horizontal level from the corner. Lets go with 20°. </p>

<p>The overall angle is 90 from the vertical piece to the level + our 20 above for a 110 degree inside angle. </p>

<p>This means the outside is (360-110=) 250. </p>

<p>Now you want a matching miter on both pieces so they line up, which means you will put half of the angle on each piece so they add up to 20.</p>

<p>You can come at this two ways, since the line of the angle through our imaginary 360° circle goes through both sides.</p>

<p>You can take 110/2=55, but you aren't cutting your piece on end so that's the wrong plane. You don't want 55, you want 90-55=35°</p>

<p>Or, 250/2=125-90=35°</p>

<p>Either way, you want a 35° angle on your saw.</p>

<p>If you have a table saw or skill/circular saw you can set the angle to 35 and cut the edge of both pieces. They will come together at our 20°.</p>

<p>(You can also think of it that if you started with a square 90° corner you would have two 45° miters, but you want to raise it 20, so you take 10 off of both. That may help you visualize it)</p>

<p>This process will work for any of your corners and is easy for any corner 90° or more. Sharp corners with inside angles less than 90 will not be possible with saw a that only miter up to 45°.
Also note, this is only for single angle miters. Pieces that come together with angles on two planes (ex. crown moulding) require additional calculation.</p>

<p>Is this common? Is it typical to do two runs and if so are there any rules of thumb with how deep a cut you can make with a rabbeting bit?</p>
","<p>It is generally advisable to take multiple passes with a router when removing large amounts of material. Adjusting your feed rate might also help</p>

<p>It's also a good practice to make some test cuts on some scrap material in order to ensure your depth of cut and feed rate won't cause any problems.</p>

<p>Doing this also gives you an opportunity to ""sneak up"" on the exact dimensions of the cut you are trying to make. Similarly, often times, round-over and other shaping bits might burn the wood and making a final small pass allows you to easily remove this leaving a nicely finished edge.</p>

"Is it better to let the tool run or stop in-between cuts?","515","","<p>When I started woodworking, I used to setup my tool, do a cut, stop my tool, re-position my piece (or take another one), start my tool, do another cut, stop, etc.</p>

<p>Today, I find myself leaving the tool run in-between cuts a lot more than I used too.  It's more time efficient, but is it more dangerous?  Is it better on the motor?</p>

<p>All it in all, is there a preferred method of working with stationary power tools such as table saws, jointers, router tables, drill presses, etc.</p>
","<p>Generally, that is the right thing to do. Obviously you wouldn't let a power tool run all day when you don't need it, or even walk away and let it run unattended. But keeping it running in between making several cuts in a couple of work pieces or drilling several holes is absolutely fine (I am almost inclined to say ""best practice"").</p>

<p>For the tool as well for work efficiency, it is a huge deal better to keep the tool running for reasonable amounts of time. On/off cyles are what generally limits the lifetime of switches and electronics (although their count is typically in the 6-digit order), and both the force (and thus wear) acting on and the power consumed by the electro motor is highest when switched on. Please refer to the Wikipedia <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inrush_current"">Inrush Current</a> article for an explanation why switching a tool on is stressful to its electric components. While it is possible to somewhat mitigate the effect, there is no way to eliminate it alltogether, it's just the way physics work.<br>
The prank described in the second half of Bastard Operator From Hell, <a href=""http://bofh.ntk.net/BOFH/0000/bastard07.php"">episode 7</a>, is based on that very effect: <em>""...clicky..clicky...clicky... BOOM""</em>.</p>

<p>Many modern tools have a rapid stop functionality for operational safety, which is no more than a motor brake that brings the blade to a halt within a second or two (so basically switching off may be seen as switching ""on"" in some way as the tool is going from running at ""idle"" load into ""full yield"" reverse).</p>

<p>If you have dust collection or suction / vac on automatic (master/slave), each on/off cycle further counts twice (once on the tool and once on the suction). On the other hand, having dust collection run for longer than absolutely necessary is surely rather an advantage than a disadvantage. It'll pick up some extra dust which you're not going to inhale. Fine. No harm done.</p>

<p>There is of course the concern of having a power tool run being dangerous by definition. Running it longer means more exposure to danger.</p>

<p>Opinions will inevitably differ on this point, bit my stance is that if you cannot assure safe operation of a power tool for prolonged time, <em>you should better not use it at all</em>.<br>
Power tools are dangerous, maiming and possibly lethal things, treating them with appropriate respect and safety measures as to exclude the possibility of an injury is a mandatory precondition. In that case, it doesn't matter if the saw is running for a minute longer. On the other hand, if you can't assert that, stay away from them.</p>

"Using 1x4 instead of 2x4 for laminated workbench top?","514","","<p>I'm getting into woodworking using hand tools. I'd like to make a 2'x4' or 2'x5' workbench for my apartment.  I'd rather not use power tools as the noise would be an issue, and using old hand tools is enjoyable to me.  </p>

<p>I was considering laminating 2x4s for the bench top, but construction/framing 2x4s have rounded edges that I would rather not take the time and energy to plane by hand (no matter how much I enjoy using hand tools). I also don't want to deal with finding someone to run them through a planer.  </p>

<p>So, could I just buy 1x4 stock that already has square edges and laminate those? Would there be any disadvantages compared to using 2x4s?</p>
","<p>Yes you can absolutely do this. It's just more glue joints to do but it's not really that much more work than if you were using 2x4s.</p>

<p>Because of the number of glue joints you might want to subdivide the glue-up into more subassemblies than normal. It's not uncommon to make three when doing a workbench top of this type, but with 1x4s you might want to make six instead. Once the glue has set on those they can then be glued together in one operation or into two or three subsections that you then glue into one piece as a final step. </p>

<p>Make sure to use cauls or some other clamping setup to hold the top as flat as possible at each stage. </p>

<hr>

<p>But if you were to go with 2x4s...</p>

<p><strong>On planing away a lot of material by hand</strong>  </p>

<p>It's maybe too early now to think this way but a dedicated handtool user should be able to deal with taking down the thickness of the 2x4s enough to remove those pesky rounded edges (especially as you really only need to do the top, not both sides). One mistake some make is in doing it to each board individually prior to the glue-up, when it's far easier to just glue them together and then plane the resulting panel in one go. </p>

<p>Removing this amount of material from a wide panel seems like it would be excessively effortful, and it is quite a substantial amount of wood that is being removed, but it can be done in a reasonable amount of time and without breaking your back if you use the right type of plane — one with a heavily cambered iron (curved cutting edge) — in the right way — across the grain. </p>

<p>A common choice for this job these days is a plane converted to a scrub plane (usually something of similar size to a no. 4) but a jack plane or no. 5 set up in the traditional way can also be used for this purpose and many pros prefer a plane of that size for this due to its greater weight. </p>

<p>Other than the curved cutting edge the secret to heavy planing of this type (sometimes called ""scrubbing"") is the planing across the grain — either directly across the width or diagonally. In this direction wood puts up much less resistance than it does when planing parallel to the grain.</p>

<p>After the bulk of the material has been removed cross-grain you can adjust the same plane to a lighter cut and work along the grain to flatten off the tops of the 'scooped' surface a little, then switch to whatever planes you'd normally use for flattening and smoothing, e.g. a no. 6 or 7 followed by a no. 4.</p>

"How should I go about restoring rusty clamps?","511","","<p>I've inherited about thirty or so clamps that I'd like to restore. Except for some rust and a some missing plastic/rubber pads, they work great. The clamps include a bunch from Bessey and ShopFox that I'm especially fond of. </p>

<p>The biggest problem is the rust. So far, when I've used them I just put a spacer in between the work piece and the clamps, but I'd like to not have to do that. Additionally, I'm worried that the rust is going to continue to spread. And of course, there's the vanity aspect -- I'd like my tools to look as nice as they can.</p>

<p>These ShopFox clamps are a decently representative sample of what I'm facing:</p>

<p>My first instinct is to take the clamps apart, but they aren't built to be serviced. They seem to have some sort of rivet at the bottom of the bar that prevents the movable jaw from falling off. The smaller clamps also have a rivet holding the fixed jaw in place. The larger clamp in the picture doesn't have a rivet holding the fixed jaw; I'm not sure what is keeping it on or whether I can get it off.</p>

<p>I'd like to clean up the rust on the bars. For the smaller clamps, I could sand as much of what I can see easily enough without taking them apart. But I'm not sure if that would mess up the finish of the black bars? For the larger clamp, there are serrations on the bar, and I am not sure what I should do to remove the rust on that. Naval jelly? Something else?</p>

<p>My primary concern is the rust, but sometimes I go overboard on projects like this, and so I'm also wondering what kind of paint would be appropriate to touch up the jaws. I'm not sure I want to go that far. But on the other hand, once I've gone to the trouble, sometimes it's nice to go the whole way. Also, is it possible to buy replacement pads for the jaws, or am I out of luck on that?</p>
","<p>Just read over this, TL;DR warning I guess! </p>

<p>Just to note from the start, you won't get a complete cosmetic facelift with any method because the rust is breaking through nickel (?) plating on some bars, but you'll get a smoother, rust-free surface that will give the clamps smoother operation so doing a little work on these is well worth the effort.</p>

<p><strong>Chemistry</strong><br>
On the smaller clamps which have no wood there's the possibility of using a rust soak to remove the rust, by immersing the entire clamp. Personally I would consider this overkill for clamps, but everyone has their own standards and it would be effective and thorough (reaching areas you can't even see, much less access by other means). </p>

<p>My favourite soak is molasses and water for a number of reasons (very safe, non-toxic, can be very cheap, doesn't seem to harm good metal even if parts are soaked for extended periods of time). Its only disadvantage is that it's relatively slow. </p>

<p>Note: Evapo-Rust is reputed to use similar chemistry to molasses solutions. I can't confirm this, but they work <em>very</em> similarly and apparently they smell quite similar.</p>

<p><strong>Electricity</strong><br>
Electrolysis could be used in a similar way. This shouldn't affect paint that's in good shape and firmly adhered to sound metal, but if there's hidden rust under any paint it will flake tend to flake it off. </p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: I would be hesitant to use either method above on these smaller clamps however if there are enclosed springs as you mention in a Comment. It's nearly impossible to dry these out thoroughly enough after soaking in watery solutions so that more rust wont be encouraged in future, even after drying with a hairdryer and drowning the area with WD-40. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Abrasion</strong><br>
Because these are just clamps this would be the method I'd most likely use myself. Also, because you can't soak the long ones due to the wooden handles it means you can use the same method for all clamps, probably ensuring the most consistent results.</p>

<p>This is also partly because the rust is so minor, heavier rust I think should always be tackled with chemical or electrical means first before any abrasion is used to finish off.</p>

<p>It's likely to also be the fastest method, since you can have de-rusted one or two clamps before you'd even made up a soaking bath or an electrolysis tank!</p>

<p>You might find that rubbing down with coarser steel wool (0 or 00 would probably work best) lubricated with mineral spirits or WD-40 will do everything you need here.</p>

<p>I wouldn't use Scotch-Brite or similar non-woven nylon pads sold as ""synthetic steel wool"" as a substitute for steel wool here. The abrasive action is not at all the same and the nylon pads will scratch any remaining plating more than steel wool. Steel wool has more of a scouring action while Scotch-Brite has a sort of sanding action (because it has small abrasive particles in the web).</p>

<p>After removing as much loose rust as you can you're pretty much done. Because you used an oily lubricant the exposed steel won't be prone to re-rusting immediately (as it can be with chemical or electrical methods) because the metal has oil impregnated in the 'pores'. </p>

<p>But you need to apply something more for long-term protection from further rusting. Obviously you can use whatever your favourite anti-rust treatment is but I would highly recommend <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1476/table-saw-top-treatment/1484#1484"">paste wax</a> here as it provides better protection on things that are handled frequently (who doesn't grip F-clamps by the bars when moving them around?) and it improves slip, without the surface being greasy. Win win.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>On some clamps with long bars of this type this is a roll pin, which can simply be knocked out. With rivets they can be drilled out (to be replaced with fresh rivets later) if you really wanted to get the heads off, but it's perfectly doable to service the clamps fully assembled.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But I'm not sure if that would mess up the finish of the black bars? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you decide it's necessary you can get proprietary colouring solutions to give metal a surface colour, similar to the treatment used in the factory to make these dark initially. </p>

<p>The dark finish is not merely cosmetic in case you don't know, usually it provides some rustproofing as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the larger clamp, there are serrations on the bar, and I am not sure what I should do to remove the rust on that. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is another reason not to use conventional abrasives, sandpaper especially. If you find the steel wool won't do enough you could switch to using a wire wheel in your power drill or drill press, but a hand-held wire brush might be sufficient (it often is for light rust). In case it's not obvious best to brush across the bar not along it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My primary concern is the rust, but sometimes I go overboard on projects like this, and so I'm also wondering what kind of paint would be appropriate to touch up the jaws. I'm not sure I want to go that far. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clamps are some of the real workhorses in the shop, they get used a lot, they can't be babied when your focus is on keeping the wood from coming to harm, they sometimes get dropped. So I think it's realistic to expect them to get banged up a bit over time and to look like it. However saying that I don't think it's going overboard to repaint tools sometimes. This isn't only about making them look nicer, paint is also a much more permanent rust preventative so it's not merely a cosmetic thing.</p>

<p>The paint type for this kind of thing would be an enamel. I can't give a specific recommendation but in general you'll get a much tougher paint if you go with a traditional enamel (brushes cleaned with spirits) than with a waterbased enamel. The latter have come a long way and they're not bad any longer by any means, but they're not generally as tough.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, is it possible to buy replacement pads for the jaws, or am I out of luck on that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many plastic pads have a slight texture in them to help with grip and this can be impressed even into some hardwoods (and very much so into softwoods) so I think it's better to affix plywood, hardboard or MDF pads to clamps, which provide good grip but no risk of transferring a pattern to the workpiece (also lessens the need for intermediate blocks of wood). </p>

<p>Normal PVA-type wood glue will work to attach the pads even though it's not for metal or painted surfaces, the grip is good enough to keep the pads in place but not so strong (as with epoxy) that replacement becomes difficult when needed.</p>

<p>The joiner would be the one to give you the most chips and any dust collector should be able to handle that.  Two of the big things that you would consider between a shop vac and a dust collector is what other tools are you considering getting in the future.

<p>Also the Shop Vac is VERY loud.  I have a large dust collector and while it makes plenty of noise, the shop vac was worse, but part of the problem is the short hose keeps the shop vac close to where you are working.</p>

","<p>Measure, mark, place fence, <em>measure again before you cut</em>. E.g. stick your circular saw on the piece like you're about to start, mark the blade position, check with a tape measure before pulling the trigger and adjust fence to correct. Check again after adjusting. </p>

<p>With just a circular saw for cuts like that measure distance from edge of blade (remember, blade is not infinitely thin) to edge of guide, draw a line with a square where you want to cut, move over by the blade-to-guide distance you just measured and draw another line. Clamp a long straight board along that line as a fence and ride the guide up the fence with the circular saw, double checking that the blade edge is at your cut line before you start. If you want, use a framing square to double check that your fence is clamped at 90 degrees before cutting.</p>

<p>Also if you have 48"" and want 45, measure 45, don't measure 3 and try to cut it off.</p>

<p>If your stock isn't square trim both sides like this, squaring each off <em>the same edge</em>. Always pick one edge as a reference edge and square the other 3 off that. Use a straightedge to check your reference edge first, if you want, and if it's not straight, trim it straight.</p>

<p>You might find <a href=""http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/tools/reviews/a3602/4283497/"" rel=""nofollow"">this guide</a> useful. Describes a really simple and useful circular saw guide. Nice thing about that one is it shows you exactly where the blade edge is. If you switch blades to one with a different kerf you might want to make another base (narrower) or run the saw over the guide once after changing (wider) for an accurate edge.</p>

<p>Also if you're using a tape measure start from the 1"" mark instead of the floppy metal end and remember to subtract 1 when reading. That's not your 1/4"" but it can sometimes be 1/32"" or so, esp. for cheaper tape measures.</p>

<p>You could use your table saw if it has enough capacity but I think a circular saw is an easier tool to work with for this kind of stuff.</p>

"Can one safely mount an 8"" blade in a 10"" saw if the arbor sizes are compatible?","506","","<p>I am looking to pick up a new cabinet saw.  I have currently two table saws, a 10"" and an 8"".  I use the 8"" with a Freud SBOX8 box-joint blade and pretty much use that saw exclusively for box joints.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if I pick up a 10"" cabinet saw, is it possible, given same size arbors, that I could run the 8"" blade in the 10"" saw or is there some danger I am not considering?</p>
","<p><strong>Yes you can.</strong></p>

<p>As long as the hole in the blade is the same size as the arbor, you can mount any blade with a diameter smaller than the maximum your saw can use.*</p>

<p>The only real difference, besides maximum cutting depth, is that smaller blades are often thinner and have a narrower kerf. I was curious if this could make them unsafe to run at the same speed as a larger blade, but actually the opposite is true.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/11wHm.jpg"" alt=""Freud blade speed chart""></p>

<p>Smaller blades can run faster since their mass is closer to the axis of rotation (I think), so they can be made thinner. But, the RPM of a smaller blade will be the same as that of a larger blade, and in fact the cutting edge will be moving slower. In other words: the blade isn't in danger.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that an identical cut should probably be made slower with a smaller blade, since the cutting edge of the blade is moving slower.</p>

<p><strong>More specifically to your situation:</strong> The <a href=""http://www.freudtools.com/admin/manuals/SBox-8.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">manual for the SBOX8</a> doesn't even mention the table saw's maximum blade size, which leads me to believe it isn't an issue.

<p>There is no reason why it can't.  The only thing is for the ""regular"" bench vise, you will have to make extra checks that the piece you are drilling is presented to the drill bit at the correct angle since the regular vise does not have indents for plumb/square.</p>

"What is the best way to get started with limited funds and space?","500","","<p>I enjoyed doing woodwork back in high school, but I haven't been able to do any since I started college. I want to get into it, but I lack the tools I had at the school shop, and similarly the space. Any recommendations/advice for starting with a college students budget and limited space? </p>

<p>EDIT: To be more precise on what my budget and space constraints are, my funds are probably sub $300 for now and space is a small shed (probably 8' X 6' usable space) on the property I rent. I don't know what kind of projects I want to do exactly, I really just want to explore and work with my hands. Graphus' answer seems like it will be a good starting place, but if these details help at all feel free to give your own answer. </p>

<p>EDIT2: After some thought, my initial interest is in building furniture to use in my home. I usually go for function over form, but want to move away from that and make pieces that are both useful, and look good. My past experience was mostly power tools so my hand tool experience is limited. I feel I'd be able to learn to use them and deal with the longer time it takes to make things. </p>
","<p>If you want to build furniture, you can certainly go the hand tool route, as Graphus suggested, or you can try to get by with a few power tools such as a circular saw, router, combination square, and a drill. Either way, it's really hard to build anything besides plywood projects without a way to dimension your own lumber, because even the ""dimensional"" lumber in a store is usually not very straight or flat.</p>

<p>However, you don't necessarily have to buy all of your own tools in order to get started in woodworking, as Carl Carlson suggested.</p>

<p><strong>Find a friend with a shop</strong></p>

<p>Find any local woodworking club(s) and go to a couple meetings. You may make some friends who are willing to share their shops with you. Most of the guys in my woodworking club are retired, and I get the impression that a few of them spend more time in other people's shops than they do in their own, to the point that they even keep their own tools in someone else's shop. On top of that, most of the guys are happy to trade their time and expertise for a 6-pack of beer or a cheap bottle of wine--to be consumed afterward and not while any of the tools are in use, of course. I'm not a drinker myself, but I know $300 will buy a lot more beer than it will tools. If you're too young or don't like the idea of dealing in mind-altering substances, you may be able to come up with something else you can trade for shop time.</p>

<p><strong>Find a community shop</strong></p>

<p>My local university offers use of a small basic woodshop to the public for $5/day or $35/semester (student rates are $4 and $30, respectively), and has lockers available for rent.</p>

<p>Some towns also have MakerSpaces which can range in style from that of a traditional hobby club to a commercial environment more reminiscent of a gym membership. (The gym-like type may be similar to the Maker Workshop that Carl Carlson mentioned; one popular example is <a href=""http://www.techshop.ws/"" rel=""nofollow"">TechShop</a>.) MakerSpaces try to cater to a broader range of hobbyists and DIY enthusiasts, commonly called ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture"" rel=""nofollow"">Makers</a>."" Typically there is a monthly membership fee of around $25-$100, though some commercial shops with more exotic equipment charge even more. The membership fee gets you a space in which you can work on your projects, and some MakerSpaces also let you check out tools.</p>

<p><strong>Talk to an existing woodworking business</strong></p>

<p>Look for a local cabinet shop or other established woodworking business. If you find one that's looking for help, they'll probably be happy to hire you part-time and train you to use their equipment, and may even let you work on your own projects after-hours or when business is slow. Even if they aren't hiring, you may be able to rent the shop at slow times or after-hours.</p>

I got my hands on a piece of Desert Ironwood that I would like to use for a knife handle. I am worried since this wood is extremely hard.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What precautions should I take before/while cutting it? (It's a pretty small piece and all I have to cut it straight is a table saw.) </p></li>
<li><p>Since I would like to make my knife handle as tough as possible. I wonder what I should use to treat the wood in order to protect it as much as possible while still keeping the beautiful grain that Ironwood has. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Please excuse my lack of knowledge and my bad English. :)</p>
","<p>Cut slowly. Watch out for kickback. Be aware that blades/bits will dull faster than they would on a softer wood.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what family ""desert ironwood"" belongs to, but Ipe (the most common ""ironwood"" sold in this area), like many tropical hardwoods, can cause allergies in some people due to the same chemicals that make them naturally resistant to insects and rot. Use dust collection, use a mask, shower afterwards to get the sawdust off your skin. I believe the issue is mostly sawdust, since that's the extended contact over wide surface area; as far as I know your knife scales should be OK.</p>

<p>(I haven't run Ipe thru my table saw yet, but the guys using it as decking seem to do OK with carbide blades, and it bandsaws reasonably so far.  Ipe is being used for decking due to its rot resistance; it has the advantages of real wood while lasting as long as the plastic/composite solutions. If you want more detail you should probably ask over in Home Improvement ... But this means you can sometimes get small offcuts of Ipe free by asking a decking team for their scraps before those get dumpstered. I have a few cubic feet obtained by cleaning up after a ramp was built in a local park.)</p>

<p>Re retaining the natural color: Wood tends to bleach under UV light. Look for a spar varnish or similar transparent topcoat that contains good ultraviolet blockers. Though realistically, a pocket knife spends most of its life shaded.... and the decking seems to regain a lot of its color when wet, so this may be mostly a surface effect.</p>

"Glue for butcher's blocks","496","","<p>I have made a chopping board for my kitchen out of some sort of hard dark wood. I don't know what it was. Because there was a crack in the product, I chiselled a slot down the crack and then glued a piece of wood into the slot, so that the crack was no longer there. </p>

<p>It works OK. Many months later the piece of wood is still firmly stuck into that slot. But whenever I wash the board with water and soap, the glue becomes visible, as though it is returning to its uncured state. A couple of questions: </p>

<p>Is this safe for food preparation area?</p>

<p>What kind of glue should I be using for this?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>whenever I wash the board with water and soap, the glue becomes visible, as though it is returning to its uncured state</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most PVA-type glues (the majority of woodworking glues used today) are clear/transparent in a thin film but slightly sensitive to water, going cloudy/milky if wetted, which I presume is what you're seeing. It's not much to worry about except aesthetically and the fact that the glued-in patch has remained firm with repeated washing cycles shows that what you've used is likely waterproof enough.</p>

<p>As it does indicate there's a thin smear of glue on/in the wood the surface wood fibres if you want to prevent the problem in future you can lightly plane, scrape or sand the surface. This is in order of preference :-) You'll only need to remove a very small amount to get down to unaffected wood, just a few passes with a smoothing plane set to take a light cut which is equivalent to ~0.008""/0.2mm. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this safe for food preparation area?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only a few glues are actually passed or certified as food safe, however, that <em>doesn't</em> indicate the others aren't safe, only that the maker's didn't bother to pay for the certification. It's likely that most glues can be considered safe for direct food contact once they are fully cured, like virtually all wood finishes. </p>

<p>For some context it's extremely likely that the majority of commercial butcher block countertops and cutting boards are not built using a glue with a food-safe certification because the makers don't consider it important, where invisibly-thin glue lines between boards are all that is coming into contact with the food. And only briefly at that. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What kind of glue should I be using for this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For working cutting boards, as opposed to mostly decorative boards that see little use (many bread boards and cheese boards) you should ideally be using a waterproof, not water-resistant, glue. So if using a PVA glue you want a Type-I*. </p>

<p>Just to mention, online very often the glue recommended for cutting boards is Titebond III but a little confusingly it's a Type-I PVA. </p>

<p>Foaming polyurethane glues, such as the original Gorilla glue, are also waterproof and although they don't seem to see much use in making boards they are a solid choice.</p>

"Corner butt joint, longer top or longer sides?","495","","<p>When making butt joints for corners, say, for small little cabinets to hang on a wall (think medicine cabinet), structurally is there any difference between longer tops and longer sides (I'm using biscuits and glue, and I find I like using cleats attached to the inside top for hanging)?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IZuUl.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IZuUl.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I personally prefer the look of longer tops and bottoms especially if I intend to use the top surface as a shelf, but having longer sides is much easier for me to construct since all the horizontals are the same length, and gives a slightly easier order of assembly.</p>

<p>A lesser question: In addition to structural properties, is there any traditional/historical stylistic tendency for longer tops vs. sides?</p>

<p>I realize the butt joint is a boring joint but in my limited experience I find that I keep agonizing over which to choose. </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>When making butt joints for corners... structurally is there any difference between longer tops and longer sides [using biscuits and glue]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, with longer sides it would be stronger. The reasons being: </p>

<ul>
<li>for the glue line to be broken it has to shear through at 0°, versus being pulled apart at 90° which is much easier (although it must be stated, still very difficult if made properly);</li>
<li>and with biscuits they'd have to be snapped across their centre for the joint to break, rather than simply pulled free from their slots which is obviously much easier in principle (again, still very difficult).</li>
</ul>

<p>For very large constructions that need to hold up a lot of inherent weight (the weight of the piece itself), even before the added load of items stored inside, longer sides would be far preferable. But for smaller pieces I suspect it doesn't matter in practice.</p>

<p>One additional advantage to longer sides is pure aesthetic: in this case (wall-mounted item) there's less end grain visible in the finished piece, which is considered very desirable by many woodworkers although some are less fussy about this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lesser question: In addition to structural properties, is there any traditional/historical stylistic tendency for longer tops vs. sides?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wouldn't have been common for boxes of this basic construction to have been built historically as they didn't often rely on 90° butt joints, but in more recent tradition where dowels have been widely used I'm fairly sure longer sides would have been the preferred orientation for exactly the same reasons as stated above for biscuits, where again the dowels can be pulled free more easily than snapped cleanly in two.</p>

<p>It shouldn't go unsaid though that many traditional woodworking techniques go toward making the strongest piece possible for any given joint type, and it's widely acknowledged that this means much furniture has over-engineered joints, i.e. much stronger than truly needed.</p>

"Polyurethane or similar on multiple sides at once, quickly, no drips","495","","<p>In general I have had good results with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Oil-based stain -> oil-based polyurethane</li>
<li>Oil-based stain -> shellac barrier -> polycrylic / water-based polyurethane</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to keep the look and at least some of the scratch resistance polyurethane/polycrylic provide.</p>

<p>However, I have found that when I apply any poly to vertical surfaces or bottom faces, it drips or becomes uneven as it dries.</p>

<p>Now, I have a piece that I had to assemble before finishing. It has faces of every orientation that I need to finish. I'd also like to avoid a shellac coat because I have trouble working with shellac. This limits me to oil-based polyurethane. All of the polyurethanes I have take 6-8+ hours to dry, and at least a few hours to stop being affected by gravity.</p>

<p>I'd really like to finish this piece in less than 6 (top, bottom, left, right, front, back) separate 6-8 hour steps (do the top faces, wait for poly to dry before flipping piece and doing a side, and so on).</p>

<p>So I'm looking for either a finish with the same look and some of the protection as polyurethane (I only need mild scratch resistance) that sets very quickly or doesn't run at all, or some technique for applying polyurethane to faces of arbitrary orientation without it running / beading / flowing.</p>

<p>What kind of finish can I use over oil-based stain, or how can I continue to use polyurethane but apply it in one or two sittings instead of six?</p>
","<p>Apply the varnish more thinly. Thinly is a pun here, as I mean thinned but this will directly result in a thinner coat being applied to the wood. </p>

<p>A thin coating is automatically less subject to problems due to gravity, and at best there is zero risk of runs, drips or sags. A thin coating also dries more quickly — varnish drying time is directly linked to coat thickness. </p>

<p>However there's no free lunch and there is a downside: this goes hand in hand with the finish building more slowly. </p>

<p>So it's fewer coats and risk some problems due to gravity, or sidestep those problems entirely accepting that more coats are needed to build coverage (6-8 to roughly equate with three full-strength coats of varnish applied by brush or roller).</p>

<p>Now this is not to say you need to apply the equivalent of three undiluted coats of varnish. Many of the people who wipe on poly in very thin coats will only apply three or four coats and they're happy with both the look and the level of protection. Note this is <em>not</em> enough to provide the full waterproofing that poly can provide (which you might want for a coffee table or kitchen countertop for example), but it is more than adequate for many other pieces of furniture.</p>

<p>What <em>is</em> a shadow line?</p>
","<p>Keshlam said it well, but I want to add a few thoughts.</p>

<p>Shades and shadows are an important design consideration in any three dimensional work of art (and any woodworking project is art as well).  Shadow lines can emphasize or hide a feature. Since they are created by the lighting of the work piece the importance of the lines can change according to the direction and intensity of light.  A simple wooden box displayed in the sunlight will change in character depending upon the time of day and direction of the sun. A projection or recess near the top edge of the box can emphasize the lid. Place the shadow line near the bottom and it may de-emphasize the box base and give the body of the box the appearance of floating above the table surface. </p>

<p>The shadow line may be applied to appear thick or thin, horizontal, vertical, or any angles (or curves) desired.  It can be continuous or dashed. Sometimes it is not even a real shadow as when inlaid contrasting woods are used to create the affect of a shadow for a 3D appearance.  After completing a woodcraft project I often try lighting it from various positions to see the impact the shadows have on appearance.  It may be too late for the current one, but there is always a next time!</p>

  <p>Does this then mean that pre stain is not necessary when using gel stain?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct. One of the prime purposes of gel stain (or ""gel stain"" as I prefer to call it) is that it sidesteps issues with blotch-prone woods.</p>

<p>""Gel stain"" is not stain in the conventional sense, it is coloured varnish that has been gelled with an additive to give it a thicker, less-penetrating consistency. As a result it should never normally be thinned, if you need a thinner coating wipe it on thinly, or wipe a heavier coating partially off with a clean cloth.</p>

<hr>

<p>On ""pre-stain conditioner"", for any readers unaware these are generally some form of finish in highly dilute form. Its purpose is to soak into the more-absorbent areas of blotch-prone woods and partially seal them off — reduce their absorbency — so that they don't absorb <em>too much</em> stain (these areas would otherwise be dark blotches in the stained wood).</p>

<p>Given ""pre-stain conditioner"" is heavily diluted finish it should be easy to see you can use finish you have diluted yourself. There are numerous advantages to making your own, the first being the one you might foresee which is that it's much cheaper. </p>

<p>The second is that you can use the final finish you've already bought to complete the project, saving buying another product that may sit on the shelf for a long time between uses. </p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>I am trying to figure out why that was the standard at the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure if this is a chicken/egg issue, but I think the answer has to do with a tool called a <strong>brace</strong>.</p>

<p>The first braces were no more than curved pieces of wood with a tapered metal inlet at one end that received different bits.  The bit was held in via the wedging action of the tapered end.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gTyOV.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gTyOV.jpg"" alt=""wooden brace""></a><br>
<sup>(<a href=""https://www.highlandwoodworking.com/woodnews/january_2007/tool_slideshow.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>)</sup></p>

<p>As brace designs evolved, the ends began to resemble more of the chuck-type designs we're familiar with today, though not matching the typical <a href=""http://www.jacobschuck.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jacobs chuck</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kmvs3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kmvs3.jpg"" alt=""chuck""></a><br>
<sup>(<a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/traditionalwoodworkingjjg/tools"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>)</sup></p>

<p>These types of brace jaws are pretty forgiving in terms of sloppiness of the tapered tang end of the drill bit.  They are able to clamp onto a fairly wide variety of tang ends with no issue in use.  This is very useful when the majority of your bits are hand-forged and have no real uniformity, precision, or universal standards.</p>

<p>Also, hand braces are very forgiving in terms of bit centeredness and eccentricity.  Since you're using arm power to turn the bit, you automatically correct for any off-centered behavior.</p>

<p>One additional thing - the bit you have in your question has a lead screw (a.k.a. snail) at the end that helps draw the bit into the wood.  This only works well at low RPM, and can be downright dangerous at higher RPM if the bit grabs the wood and whips it out of control.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One obvious thing solved by the tang is that you don't risk the bit coming out of the tool when you are pulling out of the work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the earlier years (before the chuck-type jaws), this could be a problem, since the bit was merely held by wedging.  In the later years, you are correct, the chuck jaws would help avoid this issue.</p>

<hr>

<p>Once power tools started taking over, the circular shank became more popular since it was easier to manufacture.  Jacobs chucks work best with a circular bit and are able to firmly clamp a cylindrical shaft very well.  The tapered tang ends do not work in a Jacobs chuck at all.</p>

<p>Minor eccentricities of rotating parts are a major issue for power tools since they operate at high velocity/RPM.  The previous hand-forged brace bits with their tapered tangs would vibrate like crazy and skitter around the workpiece.</p>

"how can I make sandpaper last longer?","490","","<p>Normally my sand paper lasts a day or so with palm sanding, is there something I can do to make it last longer?</p>
","<p>Sandpaper is a consumable, and in fact people should be encouraged to discard it more readily as it's very common — and not just with amateur woodworkers :-) — to use paper until it's worn out and no longer cutting as it should. Using worn paper doesn't give uniform results and of course has a reduced cutting action, directly leading to many of the issues people experience when sanding as they try to compensate for the slower results e.g. by pressing harder, which is always something to be avoided.</p>

<hr>

<p>We can't diagnose the situation in your case properly without more details than you've provided. </p>

<p>The type of wood you're working (harder woods v. softer woods, resinous v. non-resinous) and the type of sandpaper you're using have a pronounced impact on what you can expect of your abrasive. But perhaps most important of all is <em>the area of wood you're working</em>. </p>

<p>If you're working softwoods, these have resins in them that are well known for clogging paper so yours may not just be worn but also clogged (see related Question, <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1876/what-are-these-brown-spots-on-my-sandpaper"">What are these brown spots on my sandpaper?</a>). One additional tip is to dust down regularly, to remove any excess sanding dust that may be on the surface. Even with a sander hooked up to dust extraction this can help.</p>

<p>If your paper is actually wearing out it may be because it's of lesser quality, where the abrasive particles are bonded to the paper backing with less resin/glue or with a weaker one (cheaper glues tend to let go when they warm up in use). Even when sanding by hand the difference between a quality paper and a cheap paper can be remarkable, you can easily sand for five times longer with a good paper compared to something cheap. A really excellent paper will outlast the low-end competition by a factor of ten or more.</p>

<p>Getting ""a day or so"" from your paper unfortunately doesn't tell us how much sanding you're actually doing. This could equate with working periodically throughout the day, sanding a bit then doing something else, but you might be production-sanding panels nearly continuously and obviously the wear on the paper would be completely different. In the first case a day would usually be less than you should realistically expect, but in the second case you'd be doing very well :-)</p>

"What are the advantages of band-saws with multiple speeds?","489","","<p>I'm currently thinking about buying a band-saw.  While searching in my price range, I found that some models offer a single speed, others 2 and some even 3 speeds.  I'm fairly new to band-saws and I wonder what's the purpose of multiple speed.  Is it a useful feature?  When should I change speed?</p>

<p>I'm planning on doing mostly re-sawing and a bit of curves.  I currently have no plans for metalworking.</p>
","<p>The primary reason for speed adjustment on bandsaws is to accommodate different materials (mainly metal). That said, dropping the speed down for some operations can stretch the capabilities of an underpowered machine further. For example, if you're resawing particularly thick or dense wood with a 1.5 hp machine (or high-TPI blade), reducing the blade speed will reduce the power needed for the motor to keep the blade moving, allowing you to make the cut.</p>

<p>In reality, it's not something that gets used very often, especially since most bandsaws require changing the belt to a separate gear to change the speed, and that's a bit of a chore.</p>

<p>Probably the simplest explanation is to spread the clamping force more uniformly. Although this can be done using fewer larger clamps too, with use of clamping blocks, which appear to be in the photograph anyway.</p>

<p>With conventional clamps of any kind keeping alignment can be tricky because so many woodworking glues lubricate the joint surfaces so well. Really it's not a matter of what clamp to use that prevents the problem but a clamping process or procedure that'll counteract it, or modifying the joint to maintain its own alignment: more traditional options including dowels and a long floating tenon (spline), and more recently biscuits. </p>

<p>Another option is to use cauls of some kind to physically hold the glue-up firmly flat, basically by clamping downwards across the boards as well as across the main clamping axis:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r4lsU.jpg"" alt=""Wavy clamping cauls for wide glue-ups""></p>

I clamped the 3' long glue-up with 5 clamps that I tightened pretty securely. I'm wondering why this gap exists, and what I can do better next time, since I still have to glue up the entire top.  I did glue up all four legs at the same time, so will take the previous advice to do a pair at a time from this point forward.

","<p>I have several suggestions for gluing this type of slab.</p>

<ul>
<li>The glue does not spread itself.  Always distribute it evenly before making contact between pieces.  You can do this using a brush or a roller.  I keep a rubber ink roller to distribute glue in large areas and then simply rinse it to clean off the glue for its next use.</li>
<li>Glue on both contact faces will insure maximum contact better than on only one face.</li>
<li>Run the bottom of the boards through the jointer to insure the base of the slab is flat so that the pieces will set flat during and after gluing.</li>
<li>Do not glue and clamp all the pieces at the same time.  These pieces are larger and it will take a lot of pressure and a lot of clamps to make full contact between all the pieces.  For a 2x bench slab like this I would plane the contact faces of two boards, glue them together, let them set, plane the outside faces and then join the pairs together  and then repeat for the 4 piece slabs until done.</li>
<li>Use plenty of clamps (1 per foot would be nice).</li>
<li>Once the slab is as wide as possible for your planer, runt the joined sections through the planer. (This will reduce the amount of hand planing needed to get the top surface flat and eliminate the ridges caused by the milled edges of the original 2xs</li>

","<p>I think I wrote an answer some time ago that addresses this, but I cannot find the link...</p>

<p>The simplest way I know to get the correct geometry is to do what cabinet shops do to make and install countertops.  Get some long lattice strips approx 1/4"" x 2"" (+/-).  Create a temporary platform at the elevation you want to fit the slab to and arrange the strips along the perimeter to create a template.  Hot glue them together along with a diagonal between opposite corners to insure that your template is rigid.  If there are indentations along the three wall surfaces, you can scribe a cardboard sheet along each edge to match the deviations and then glue it to  the lattice strips.  And that's your perfect template for the opening.</p>

"Accidentally used steel wool before water based poly","474","","<p>I'm finishing my black walnut table top. I have already applied 2 coats of Old Masters Tung Oil Varnish.

","<blockquote>
  <p>I began sanding about half the table top with 0000 steel wool </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just to address this point first, using steel wool is not a sanding operation and it shouldn't really be thought of as being in the same category. </p>

<p>The results seem quite similar but its cutting action is not the same — the action of steel wool is more akin to microscopic planing than the outright scratching from the abrasive particles bonded to the surface of sandpaper.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I be worried? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't know that you should be overly worried but yes there is the obvious concern.</p>

<p>For anyone unfamiliar with the subject, waterbased finishes can react with particles of steel wool trapped in the wood and they can rust, leading to tiny rust spots and subsequent dark staining if the iron reacts with tannins in the wood.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there anything I can do to get these steel fibers out completely?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A tack cloth might be your best removal option, but thoroughly brushing over the surface with a stiff-bristled brush, followed by wiping down with a microfibre cloth may be sufficient. </p>

<p>Possibly the best thing to do here would be to apply one additional coat of the Old Masters product, which with luck will successfully seal off any remaining specks of steel.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is a personal opinion only, but since you've already used an oil-based varnish blend on the piece I don't really see why you'd choose to use a waterbased varnish on top. Using an oil-based poly as your topcoat would seem to be the ideal solution here, and it is inherently a better product (easier to apply to a high standard, stronger and more water-resistant).</p>

<p>For this hardwood joint, I've chosen 1:8.</p>

<p>Here's the process I used:</p>

<p>If the board is 48x48 mm, I said ""let's call that 1 unit"". From there, I mostly made decisions based on fractions of the unit. 1/4 unit = 12 mm, and 1/2 unit = 24 mm, etc. I wiggled things around until they <em>looked</em> like most stuff I've seen elsewhere.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It's worth mentioning that some of this is a tradition thing and to some extent that is based on aesthetics; you do see exceptions for specific decorative effect. </p>

<p>Dovetails are inherently strong, both structurally and because of the large glue surface area, so you can get away with a fair amount of variation and still end up with a very strong joint. Broadly speaking, the main things to keep in mind are not to make the pins or the base of the tails too thin, and not to make the slope too excessive (because this would tend to leave <em>short grain</em> at their corners which is weak). </p>

<p>And going on from this, to some degree many joint dimensions are a matter of choice — excluding very fat or very skinny options almost anything in between will work acceptably well. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wiggled things around until they <em>looked</em> like most stuff I've seen elsewhere.</p>

<p>That's often perfectly acceptable. In joint-making things that look right will many times work fine.</p>

<p>What you've drawn up there I think could be called a shouldered dovetailed half-lap (UK: shouldered dovetailed halving joint) and it looks like it will function perfectly well in the way I presume you intend it to. </p>

<p>It's slightly more complex to lay out and cut than a conventional dovetailed half-lap (with I think little or no added benefit for most applications) but if you're happy with how it looks I don't foresee a problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there any basic science/math to picking dimensions for the joints ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are some, but it mostly pertains to structural wood joints where strength is more critical, and the maths is very heavy going as it takes into account the structural strength of the wood, e.g. moduli of elasticity and rigidity. If you'd like to read up on this publications from the <a href=""http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/"">Forest Products Laboratory</a> (a division of the US Department of Agriculture) are a good place to start. If you'd like to look into it in even greater detail there are <a href=""http://www.astm.org/"">ASTM</a> standards for structural joint strength and testing of wood.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What techniques do you use to layout a joint from scratch ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rough rules of thumb are the usual starting point for laying out joints, and some people have their own preferences for how to lay out joints (some based purely on expedience and not with an eye to maximising strength). </p>

<p>In a furniture-making context, because wood is generally more than strong enough for the application much variation in joint dimensions is not critical and doesn't have any noticeable impact on strength. </p>

<p>For mortise-and-tenon joinery for example, older guides may say that tenons are generally 1/3 the thickness of the wood being used. With thinner stock tenons half the thickness are not uncommon however, and with thicker boards tenons under one third can be used; or alternatively, and to be preferred, a pair of thinner tenons are formed (twin tenons). Mortises are generally just a little deeper than the length of the tenon they're intended to mate with, as it's difficult to form the bottom of a mortise perfectly flat it gives you a little leeway so the tenon can seat fully, as well as providing a small pocket for excess glue to collect in (rather than all of it trying to squeeze out when the tenon is pushed home).</p>

<p>Because joinery is such a wide and deep subject it would be best to ask joint-specific questions as and when they crop up.</p>

"Router bit speed as a function of wood hardness","474","","<p>I understand why larger router bits should be operated at lower speeds and there are a multitude of router bit speed charts out there to help you choose the correct speed for any given bit.</p>

<p>It all revolves around (haha, see what I did there?) the rim speed of the bit and, from what I've been able to work out, it looks like most recommended rotational speeds equate to a rim speed of something between 100 km/h (60 mph) and 180 km/h (110 mph).</p>

<p>But then every article you read about this will state that the size of the bit is only one of the factors to determine the speed at which you want to run the router. Another important factor is the hardness of the wood. But, while every article gives you a chart to illustrate how bit size affects the speed, I have yet to see something illustrating how hardness of the wood affects the speed.</p>

<p>Yes, I get it, harder wood = slower speed, but how much? If the bit size speed chart tells me that the max speed for a bit is 20,000 RPM for instance, I'm presuming that is if you're cutting a soft pine. But if you're cutting African Blackwood or Ipe, you should use a slower speed but how much slower?</p>

<p>I'm not sure this is really true.  <strong>Router bits cut more efficiently at their top speeds.</strong></p>

<p>I'm not aware of any rule of thumb or any tables/charts giving you this data.  It's more of a feel thing that you develop over time - or at least, that's how I did it.  Basically, you should be able to use your hands to feel the vibrations and ears to hear how the bit is cutting to see if you're feeding too fast.  Also, if you're getting too rough of a cut, that's a good visual/tactile indicator that you might be feeding too fast.</p>

Think top reaching floor when folded, so when unfolded it needs support that is as long as the top is deep. But wall mount (a horizontal bar with piano hinge) takes up space needed by the folded leg.</p>

<p>So to solve that I'm planning to fold part of the leg itself by connecting L-shaped assembly of 3 cubes all rotating against each other. Pretty much exactly like is done in this wooden cube puzzle.</p>

<p>When extended and unfolded leg would stand on the last cube, when folded cubes would fold flat under the top.</p>

<p>Question is, how to join the parts? Joint won't be load bearing, but should be fairly tight without wearing down wood after repeated rotating. </p>

Below is a rough illustration of folded leg on the left and unfolded on the right. Difference between pictures is cubes are rotated 180 degrees around red axes. </p>

Here is how wall/top/leg(s) are related. Red arcs are folding points (piano hinges). Blue lines are of equal size. So first leg folds up to the top, then top folds down to the wall. Idea is that folded top lays flat against the wall and looks pretty, hiding leg assembly under some trim (thus I'm going for fold down instead of fold up). There will be a second leg on the other side as well (with a bar between them if needed).</p>

","<p>Glue in some strong magnets and you have swivelling points.<br>
That is an answer to your question.</p>

<p>But if I might dare change your solution, instead mount a hinge on the leg so you only have 2 parts instead of 4, and only 1 moving instead of 2.</p>

<p>Also; if the table is wider than its depth, and you allow for one leg to be further in, you can fold them sideways.</p>

<p>For some joints screws can be stronger than glue, but where face grain meets face grain a properly done glued joint is stronger than the wood itself, so not much need to reinforce that :-) In some cases it would be better to use both, a glued and screwed joint can be much more secure than either used alone. </p>

<p>So for the columns the legs rise in I'd go with glue only. </p>

<p>Where I would probably retain screws is on the angled braces. They would very likely be more than strong enough if simply glued in place, but no harm in reinforcing. If you want those braces to be removable though screws only of course.</p>

<p>Deck screws should be fine. They may be overkill in terms of size (gauge) and/or length, you could very likely use basic wood screws without the result being weakened enough to worry about, but it's rare to regret going too strong instead of the opposite!</p>

<p>Although some woodworkers seem to be pathologically opposed to using screws in 'proper' woodworking jobs I have no issue with them myself, but, with few exceptions I don't like seeing screw heads on the finished job and they'd remain plainly visible if you just countersink them.

<p>The small hole that the screw head hides at the bottom of could be filled with fillers of various kinds, a long-grain wooden plug or dowel (showing end grain), either to try to blend in or in a contrasting colour or grain if you want to make them more decorative.

<p>In addition to their decorative value these have a practical advantage if you haven't glued the respective joints. They can easily but levered from the hole, giving access to the screws should you need to do any adjustments or break the table down into its constituent parts for moving.</p>

<li>Don't screw near a corner (even if using the clamp trick). Place screws at least 5-6cm from a corner.</li>

<li>Glue the plywood butt joint, that way the screws aren't being relied upon for strength but are mostly there to initially hold the case together while the glue dries.</li>

<p>So as per the above you should ideally glue the edges of your ply to the case sides but you may want to avoid that for a few reasons. </p>

<ol>
<li>the surface plies of modern plywood are often too weak (too thin, and not bonded well enough) to reliably glue to.</li>
<li>it makes assembly much more difficult and frustrating if you've never done it before.</li>
<li>much less glue squeeze-out to clean up when you're done (this is surprisingly difficult to do properly, and even harder on plywood surfaces than on solid wood because of the way the veneer is peeled from the log). However, you can protect adjacent surfaces with tape to prevent the problem in the first place, similar to how it's used <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2813/should-i-finish-before-during-or-after-assembly/2815#2815"">here</a> to protect joints from finish.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>I do not know what length screws to use and the distance between them and dowels. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Longer is better for strength, but increases the potential for the screw to split or bulge the plywood at the edges. But screw <em>type</em> is arguably more important than length. Basic wood screws aren't ideal for plywood, although they can work OK. <strong>Confirmat screws</strong> are often recommended for use on plywood due to their superior holding power but common <strong>chipboard screws</strong> should work perfectly well and are far easier to find, these screws are made to hold in material much less dense than you'll find in the edges of plywood so should hold extremely well in anything better.</p>

<p>Once you've selected your screw it would be advisable to do a few tests screwing into some offcuts of your plywood, because the quality of ply varies so much what one person has had success with does not guarantee success for you, using a different make or type. Test to find out what size of pilot hole works best and whether or not you need to clamp the plywood to help prevent it bowing or splitting — the larger the diameter of pilot hole the less the chance of these problems, but at the cost of lower holding power.</p>

<p>Truth be told the dowels you're planning on using as well will add a lot of strength here, much more than they often do in a joint (in solid wood). If you're buying lengths of dowel and sawing it down yourself you should groove the dowel pegs to aid them being driven home, see previous Question, <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3841/how-can-i-flute-my-own-dowel-or-create-dowel-with-similar-properties"">How can I flute my own dowel or create dowel with similar properties</a>.

If I could get access to a real Gerstner (not the fake ones made now) I could answer this myself, but they cost about $700 for real ones, so I am hoping somebody who has access to a real one can check it and let me know exactly how the drawers are done. This is what they look like:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQzaySe-CjY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://img.youtube.com/vi/aQzaySe-CjY/mqdefault.jpg"" alt=""Video thumbnail""><br>
Drawer Fitting/Assembly Demo - <strong>Gerstner &amp; Sons</strong> on YouTube</a></p>

<p>The drawer slides are tongue and groove (I think that's what you'd call them). They're just fit snuggly. Jump to 20:00 in the video where drawer fitting is discussed. In the kits, the drawers are provided slightly taller and wider intentionally, and then the drawers are sanded down until the fit is perfect. This is probably the key: If you build your own, give yourself a very small bit of extra material rather than trying to cut to fit to begin with, then sand to fit after assembly of your drawers and cabinet. The grooves are pre-cut, probably to a pretty good tolerance (in the video it doesn't appear that the slides are touched up during fit), but perhaps in your own drawers you could cut your grooves <em>slightly</em> narrower then widen them during assembly to fit. Also the video suggests marking the drawers to indicate their positions after fitting, since drawers will be fit to specific spots. It does not appear that any wax or anything is applied, although that may not be uncalled for.</p>

<p>Another point in the video is the drawers have ""tails"", that is the sides extend beyond the back by a half inch or so. This is intended to help keep the drawer on track even when it is pulled out all the way. (Whether you choose to view this as the sides being longer vs. the inside being smaller is just a matter of perspective. It's really just so that the drawer can stay on track without ever having inside space that is obstructed by the door above it, at the expense of inside space.)</p>

<p>While pine is soft, it's pretty well suited for projects that infants/toddlers use.  These types of projects will see a lot of abuse just because they're used by little humans who have no concept of their own strength or of the value of things and have little spatial awareness.  If they bash it around, no big deal, it's just pine.</p>

<p>If you use 2x pine stock, it should hold up just fine.  You might have to make a few running repairs occasionally, but that would be expected in just about any toy made for a small child, regardless of the material.</p>

<p>Also, if your friend has wood floors (usually a hardwood like oak), pine won't scratch them as easily since it's much softer.</p>

"Noise ratings of equipment","460","","<p>Do any wood-working power-tool manufacturers provide noise ratings for their equipment in typical usage scenarios?</p>

(1 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sone"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sone</a> = 40 dB.  Doubling the number of sones is the same as a 10 dB increase, so 0.25 sones = 20 dB, and 4 sones = 60 dB.)</p>

<p>In the European Union, getting the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE_marking"" rel=""nofollow"">CE marking</a> requires the machine manufacturer to provide the measured emission sound pressure level if it exceeds 70dB(A). This data has to be specified in the product manual.</p>

<p>Due to the above, if the power tool or woodworking machine in question is sold both in your region and in the EU (chances for well-known brands are good, EU being an 500 million people market), the EU version of the User's Manual will be a good source for noise information. Sometimes this is also displayed in the product specification on the website of the manufacturer or distributor, given it is an important property of the product.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You can inlay pretty much any wood you want.  Some will work better than others (even within individual species of wood) just due to that piece's temperament, grain structure, and stability.</p>

<p>I would stay away from very open-grained woods, like red oak or ash.  At the thinness you likely need for inlay, the open grain is very much more prone to splitting/cracking along the grain.  Also, you'll get weird bumps at the edges due to the porosity of the grain.</p>

<p>Close-grained woods (like maple, holly, cherry, etc.) work well for inlay because of how tight their grain is.  However, some may not work for a cutting board (like holly) because they discolor/stain very easily.</p>

"Hiding factory machine marks","459","","<p>After staining a piece of poplar a series of subtle, regularly spaced cross-grain markings appeared on the factory cut faces (I've attempted to make markings more visible with the green indicators):</p>

<p>It was not on every board, only a few. I sanded the wood smooth first (and put down a probably-inappropriate coat of shellac), and the markings were not visible to my eyes prior to staining or when the stain was wet. They appeared as the stain dried. There are 4 markings every 1-1/8"".</p>

<p>I tried applying a second coat but it still did not hide them.</p>

<p>My question is: What are these from and how can I either hide them, prep the wood before staining to eliminate them, or determine if a board will have them ahead of time so I can avoid using it?</p>

<p>I am assuming they are artifacts from how the board was cut at the factory. My only thought is perhaps as a rule I could trim all factory edges off all boards on the table saw ahead of time, but this seems cumbersome.</p>
","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>These look to be leftover striations from the planing process.  As you probably know, a planer is just a rapidly-rotating knife on a cylinder with a board being fed through it.  Minor differences between the different knives in the planer cutting head lead to these striations.</p>

<p>The only truly effective way to get rid of these marks is to remove the wood that carries them.  Therefore, you have to plane/sand/scrape to a level of wood that does not have them.</p>

<p>There is no staining or finishing process that will really be effective in removing the marks since they are a defect in the grain of the wood.  Removing the ""bad"" wood is the only way to get rid of them.</p>

<p>I don't know that there's a very fool-proof way to avoid boards that exhibit these markings.  Usually, if you buy rough-planed stock, you can clearly see the marks and plane them yourself to remove the marks.  If you buy the stock pre-planed, you might try looking down the board using a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raking_light"" rel=""nofollow"">raking light</a> to see if you see the patterns left by the planer cutting head.  Also, as @keshlam pointed out, you can give the board a quick wipedown with a rag soaked in mineral spirits to ""preview"" what the finished grain will look like (don't worry, the mineral spirits will evaporate away pretty quickly).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and put down a probably-inappropriate coat of shellac</p>

<p>I would not consider a coat of shellac ""inappropriate"" unless you were planning to stain before finishing and didn't sand it back to bare wood.  Shellac is a good sanding sealer and will help make a smooth finish in the end.  Also, shellac can help with splotchiness in some woods that exhibit it.</p>

<p>You don't have to pigeon-hole yourself with hybrids like what is pictured above. You could easily make the entire frame from bamboo. </p>

<p>I have not built one myself but did look into it a couple of years ago. The great thing about the bamboo is you don't need to do a lot of shaping with the wood since it is already cylindrical in shape and lends well to modern bike designs. Note that there are <em>many</em> varieties of bamboo and they are all not as strong as the next. I have some bamboo that grows in Canada but it is not near the strength of the typical bamboo you would imagine. </p>

<h1>Plywood</h1>

<p>I would consider laminated plywood as well for its dimensional stability but the might jack up the weight a bit depending. So <a href=""https://www.google.ca/search?q=plywood+bike&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=939&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMImqHk1fmZyAIVCn6SCh1BbwLy#imgrc=_"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">many wonderful pictures of these</a> on the internet. You can see some with, what I will presume is, steam bent wood so the frame is one visual piece. There are some open frame plywood bikes as well (hollow inside as supposed to being a solid frame) so that would be a consideration as well. Between this and bamboo you would have an easier time acquiring plywood. </p>

<p>Oh be careful for cheap plywood. Some like baltic birch comes highly recommended. </p>

<h1>Other woods</h1>

<p>As for other woods I don't have any specific advice and more of a warning. Having a lighter weight wood could have a trade off of stability. Lightweight and durable don't always go together. Shock resistance would be a key feature as well.  Some of the woods that do fit those criteria might be too expensive for use for a bike. This off course comes back to availability again. </p>

","<p>A flush trim bit has the bearing at the bottom of the bit.  This is so that it can trim a top laminated surface flush to the substrate.  </p>

<p>A pattern or template bit has the bearing at the top of the bit (between the shank and the cutting blades.)

However, for your case it will work fine since you're trying to get into a spot that ""normal"" sanding techniques can't get into.  If you want to avoid the subtle dishes that can occure from using your fingers (or keep your fingers from getting too hot), you can put a piece of leather between your fingers and the sandpaper to spread the force out more evenly.</p>

"Water-based filler on a cutting board?","454","","<p>I made a cutting board the other day and while I was inlaying another type of wood into it I made a mistake and cut some holes into the board. The local hardware store had some water-based wood filler which they said are food safe. I do use those fillers occasionally and I can get a good color match.</p>

<p>I understand that ""water-based"" and ""cutting board"" doesnt sound like a good idea, but was wondering if it is possible to use this type of filler given that the board will be finished with Tung oil, would the oil protect the filler from water? From previous experience, water-based fillers absorb the oil.</p>

<p>I know that I can use foodsafe epoxy or glue such as titebond 3 and mix with sawdust but would prefer the filler if possible.</p>
","<p>Water-based doesn't necessarily mean water-soluble.  Water is just the solvent used to carry the finish.  Once the finish cures, the water-solubility is usually gone.</p>

<p>For example, consider <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B003FWK5BO"" rel=""nofollow"">Timbermate Wood Filler</a>.  Per the product description, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...Timbermate may react with low grade steels and turn black. If this happens, simply add water and remove it, or wait for it to dry and sand it off. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, while the product is still wet (uncured), it is water-soluble.  Afterwards, it must be sanded off, which to me means that water will no longer dissolve it.</p>

<p>Therefore, finishing with tung oil really won't matter in terms of water resistance since the filler is resistant to water once cured anyway.</p>

<p>You can test the water-fastness of your dry filler on a scrap piece to be sure if it will last over time.  Just drill some holes on a scrap, fill with filler, let cure, and soak for a few days.  You should be able to tell if the filler holds up.  A cutting board shouldn't be soaked anyway, so this type of test should be sufficient to test the filler.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the board will be finished with Tung oil</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, I would avoid tung oil for finishing a cutting board.  Please have a look at <a href=""http://familywoodworking.org/forums/showthread.php?31049-Tung-oil-finish-for-cutting-board"" rel=""nofollow"">this thread</a> for further discussion on why it's a bad idea.  I'm not certain of the food-safety of <em>pure</em> tung oil, but most products sold as tung oil nowadays have very little actual tung oil in them and are instead mostly polyurethane.  </p>

<p>Most people just use food-grade mineral oil and renew it every so often.  My previous statement about the finish not affecting the filler's water-resistance still stands with mineral oil.</p>

"What is a board foot?","449","","<p>Considering this <a href=""http://www.macbeath.com/product/walnut-lumber"">lumber sales site</a>, what is a board foot?</p>

<p>I am use to seeing lumber measured width by height, but these products are measured thickness by board feet.</p>
","<p>A board foot is a volume of wood 1 inch by 12 inches by 12 inches; i.e., 144 cubic inches.</p>

<p>If the board is 1/2"" thick and 12"" wide, one board foot would be 24"" long.</p>

<p>If the board is 2"" thick and 6"" wide, one board foot would be 12"" long.</p>

<p>Note that although rough lumber closer to advertised size than dimensional lumber, it is still often sold in nominal sizes; i.e., even the dimensions of rough lumber may be slightly larger or (more likely) slightly smaller than advertised.</p>

"Wood types in Southeast Asia","439","","<p>What sort of wood found in Southeast Asia is lightweight and can be used to build teething toys for children?</p>
","<p>Based on the woods listed in the Comments:</p>

<p><strong>Rosewood</strong> would be a great choice in terms of durability. Potential for toxicity is a concern but anyway ""rosewood"" doesn't mean much these days. Much wood sold as rosewood is either of a lesser species of <em>dalbergia</em> or something that looks (a little) like rosewood but is actually a completely unrelated species. So I think you have to discount this because what you'd buy is an unknown quantity.</p>

<p><strong>Teak</strong> may be a poor choice in part because it has a high natural silica content that may wear baby teeth down excessively. Also unfortunately when you buy ""teak"" these days that isn't always what you're getting and one of the common substitutions in particular is splintery and might be extremely hazardous to use for a teething toy.</p>

<p><strong>Mahogany</strong>..... I hate to say it again but ""mahogany"" has the same issues as the above! The most likely mahogany being sold there is probably not quite as robust as you'd like for this purpose, being soft enough to easily mark with a fingernail. It is fairly smooth-textured and easily worked however.</p>

<p><strong>Albasia</strong> is a lightweight wood and light woods are generally quite soft and weak (balsa being the supreme example of this) so I think that rules that out.</p>

<p>So of the woods you list only <strong>jabon</strong> is left and I think it may be the best choice anyway. Jabon, also referred to as kadam (<em>Anthocephalus chinensis</em> or <em>Anthocephalus cadamba</em>) is a tree that has edible fruits, which is often a sign the wood from the same tree won't give toxicity problems. It is not overly hard so easily worked, but note that it has a wide range of listed densities, so try to pick pieces that seem heavy in the hand as the wood in those boards will be denser and more durable than lighter boards of the same species.</p>

<p>I also like that jabon is a tree that is heavily planted, so not restricted by CITES or on an endangered list like some of the others.</p>

"Creating a tarnished bronze look on wood","436","","<p>I am working on a bar/entertainment center and had an idea to make the facial boards (1 x 8) that will run the length of the front look like tarnished bronze.  </p>

","<p>Jason's link in the comments was a really helpful starting point and introduced me to chalk based paint which is interesting to work with.</p>

<p>What I ended up doing is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Prime the board with bin (any oil/alcohol based primer will do).  Spray paint is a pain to work with in terms of evenness and bleed through.  Prepping the board with this stuff helps you get an even coat.  Sand well once dry.</p></li>
<li><p>Spray the board with metallic gold paint, 2 - 3 coats as needed.  Looking back I probably should have gone with a bronze/copper/brass color.  The gold was shiny and metallic but more subdued than what I was looking for.  </p></li>
<li><p>Apply the chalk based paint.  Slap it on like a first grader, sloppy and uneven, don't even worry about brush stroke direction.  Knowing copper for example, tarnishes green I used a dark green color.</p></li>
<li><p>As the chalk paint begins to dry get a damp to wet rag (more wet will remove more paint) and rub down the chalk paint removing as much or as little as you want.</p></li>
<li><p>Clear gloss.  Spray three or four coats of clear gloss, go light, make sure it goes on even and doesn't run.  This gives the boards you are working on some dimension.</p></li>
<li><p>Lightly sand</p></li>
<li><p>For my topcoat I ended up going with something rather dark.  I used a hammered brass finish.  Spray to taste, I tended to spray where I had left more chalk paint behind. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>That's it (ok it admittedly took a while) but the effect turns out pretty well and having done it once I have ideas for how I would get different effects now.</p>

"How can I bring an old, disused table saw back into active and safe use?","434","","<p>I am about to purchase a Powermatic ""contractor style"" table saw for a very good price from a friend.</p>

<p>The saw has not been used in years. It will also have to be disassembled to fit into my car, then re-assembled in my shop.</p>

<p>I am looking for a comprehensive list of things to do/adjust/clean/replace/add in order to make it perform well and be safe to use. </p>
","<p>If the table saw has been properly stored, you may not have to do much before you can start using it. Find out if there's a reason why it hasn't been used other than a loss of interest or lack of time--for example, maybe it needed the bearings replaced and your friend just never got around to it.</p>

<h2>Has it been subjected to the elements?</h2>

<p>If it has been subjected to the elements, you may have to deal with rust removal and the motor could be damaged, in addition to any other issues it might have had otherwise.</p>

<p>If it was stored in a non-climate-controlled garage, the table could still have surface rust but should clean up fine. There are many ways to remove surface rust, from WD-40 and steel wool, to sanding, to rust-removal chemicals.</p>

<h2>Check the owner's manual</h2>

<p>The owner's manual should be your first resource. Read through it so you know how to properly disassemble and reassemble the saw. The assembly instructions will also include some information on how to calibrate the fence, at the very least. If your friend does not have the owner's manual, you may be able to download it from the saw manufacturer's website. Failing that, check <a href=""http://vintagemachinery.org"">vintagemachinery.org</a> or <a href=""http://owwm.org"">owwm.org</a>.</p>

<h2>Before you take it home</h2>

<ol>
<li>If the saw is currently fully-assembled and it worked fine the last time your friend used it, test it before you disassemble it for transport.</li>
<li>Check that the saw includes a riving knife/splitter, blade guard, fence, other accessories (like a miter gauge), and any wrenches necessary for making adjustments or swapping the blade. Familiarize yourself with how to use them correctly. This may include reviewing the manual.</li>
</ol>

<h2>After reassembly</h2>

<ol>
<li>Align the blade parallel to the miter slots</li>
<li>Align the fence parallel to blade and miter slots</li>
<li>Check that the belt from the motor to the arbor is in good condition and not rubbing on anything</li>
</ol>

<h2>A riving knife is safer than a splitter</h2>

<p>If the saw is old enough to have a splitter instead of a riving knife, it will have a greater chance of producing kickback. Although a splitter and riving knife both prevent the blade from being pinched, a splitter is always positioned at the same height, while a riving knife raises and lowers with the blade. This allows the riving knife to maintain a constant distance from the back of the blade. This means that when the blade is lowered for a shallow cut, there is a huge gap between the back of the blade and the splitter, as illustrated in a <a href=""http://lumberjocks.com/topics/86698"">kickback incident analyzed on LumberJocks</a>. A splitter only performs as well as a riving knife when the blade is raised to full height--which itself is considered unsafe unless you need the full height of the blade to make a cut.</p>

<p>Aftermarket riving knives are available for some saws, and you should consider getting one if your saw comes with a splitter.</p>

","<p>Normally, being rather new to woodworking, I refrain from providing answers to people's questions, but I think I have a method that might help here. </p>

<p>If you start out with an oversized piece of wood (say, 3x4x1) you should be able to clamp a sacrificial board to your piece and cut at least 3 of the 4 sides with the mitre saw set to a 45° cut. For the last side, I'd recommend clamping into a mitre box and using a hand saw. Cleaning up the piece with sanding should be fairly easy at that point.</p>

"How can I taper a slightly misaligned board with a handheld power planer?","428","","<p>Is there a method or technique for tapering a board with a handheld power planer? I have an assembly that's got one board butted up against another board at each end, kind of in an ""H"" configuration. The cross piece of the H is 1/16-1/8"" proud at one end, but flush at the other.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Whiz4.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>(Sketch courtesy of Damon)</p>

<p>Without disassembling the whole thing, I'd like to plane it flush. However, powered planers generally only have two parallel shoes, not one that can be angled up or down. How can I achieve a smooth taper?</p>

<p>Or is there a better tool for this job that's relatively inexpensive?</p>

<p>The project that generated this question is a king bed frame constructed of raw 2x6 boards lagged together. I'm planning on adding stained ""finish boards"" screwed in from the back when I get the chance.</p>
","<p>Having never used a handheld planer for this I think you can do this the same way you'd do it with a hand plane, <em>if</em> it can be adjusted to take a light enough cut. </p>

<p>You're simply planing the board more towards one end, in stages:</p>

<ul>
<li>plane first from about 3/4 of the way along the board</li>
<li>next couple of passes from about halfway along the board</li>
<li>last passes to get the edge nearly flush over approx. the last quarter of the board</li>
<li>one or two very very light final passes along nearly the whole length to flatten out</li>
</ul>

<p>I do a lot of tapering by hand this way on a small scale and the process does translate to longer surfaces such as board edges, although it's more difficult when working larger to get a flat edge after you're done. </p>

<p>Which direction you plane the board to prevent tearout is an additional uncertainty. Most wood has a preferred planing direction, and if on your board edge that's away from the lip then you'll have to work opposite to the above outlined method, planing towards the 3/4 mark, then the halfway point etc. This will involve lifting the planer away from the wood as it runs, and I don't know how easy or safe that is.</p>

<p>In either case I think you should protect the edge of the wood at 90° to the board you're planing with a couple of layers of tape. </p>

<p>Once the uppermost layer of tape is getting chewed by the planer then it's time to stop planing and switch to something else. I would take the last of it off with a file, then do finish scraping or sanding, but you could of course skip the file and do all the work with sandpaper, it'll just take longer. In case it needs to be said: back the paper with a block.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or is there a better tool for this job that's relatively inexpensive?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm presuming here that you don't have a belt sander, which is the tool I would use for this if I didn't own a hand plane. </p>

<p>If you wanted to buy something specifically for this I'd get a low-angle block plane. One of these has a lot of potential future utility, so it's a very worthwhile investment (lifetime tool too, won't ever wear out and has no consumables like a sander). But, unless you buy high end you will need to sharpen it for it to work successfully first time.</p>

"Substitute for Bench-Top Jointer","428","","<p>My old Sears 5 1/8"" jointer motor is dead.  I can't find a replacement.  Trying to haul a new one to my shop in Mexico seems impractical.  I'm contemplating buying a jointer plane or a hand held electric jointer.  Any recommendations?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I'm contemplating buying a jointer plane or a hand held electric jointer. Any recommendations?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on a few things, in my opinion: how accurate you want to be, how hard to you want to work, and how much do you want to spend.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>

<p>Jointer planes can be amazingly accurate in the right hands.  They have the ability to finesse an edge by thousandths of an inch per pass of the plane.  However, there is a bit of a learning curve to using one.  If you do it all the time, though, it will become second nature.</p>

<p>I should add that using a jointer plane <em>alone</em> in lieu of a power jointer is not an entire solution.  To dimension rough boards, you will want to have at least a jack plane or a fore plane to do the rough dimensioning, then come back with the jointer plane for the final flattening passes.  Jointer planes are usually set up to take very fine shavings, whereas jack/fore planes are set to hog out material.</p>

<p>A handheld electric jointer can be accurate if used correctly.  They have two plates that you can adjust to a pretty fine shaving (&lt; 1/16"" in most models).  You can finesse an edge just as well with an electric jointer as with the manual one mentioned above.  However, just due to the powered nature of the tool, it is a bit less controlled than a hand jointer plane.</p>

<p>Mostly, I've seen electric handheld jointers at construction sites where a carpenter needs to hog off the edge of a board to fit it in a space.  I don't know that I've ever seen one in a ""fine"" woodworking shop.  This may be because the ""fine"" woodworkers use a tabletop jointer like what you just broke.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Effort</strong></p>

<p>Hand planes take sweat equity to use, there's no doubt about it.  In the time it takes you to flatten a board with a combination of a jack/fore plane and a jointer plane, you could have done two or three with a tabletop jointer and planer.  If you're not averse to that, hand planes work well, like they did in the hundreds of years they were used before electricity.</p>

<p>Electric handheld planers take minimal effort to use, as is expected from an electric tool.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Cost</strong></p>

<p>You can probably find a used electric handheld planer for under $100 USD.  Heck, find some retiree who used to do carpentry as a hobby and he will probably give his to you.</p>

<p>When you enter the world of hand planes, you enter a big rabbit hole.  You can definitely find hand planes for cheap if they're in poor condition or if the owner doesn't know what he has.  They will often require some work to get into usable shape.  Otherwise, you can do the <a href=""http://www.leevalley.com/US/Wood/page.aspx?cat=1&amp;p=41182"">Lee Valley</a> or <a href=""https://www.lie-nielsen.com/nodes/4063/handplanes"">Lie-Nielsen</a> route (among others) and buy new, but those babies are <em>expensive</em>.</p>

  <p>Can a picture frame be made from wood molding from a DIY/Big Box store?</p>

<p>Short answer: yes.</p>

<p>You can of course make picture frames from just plain flat boards, even 2x material, so mouldings are certainly a workable starting point for a more elaborate surface profile than flat wood.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to make a picture frame while avoiding the routing involved to inset the picture, glass, and supporting backer into the back of the frame. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is actually the core of the question and it's actually easily resolved since you don't need to do any routing. You can use a build-up method instead. </p>

<p>Here's a cross section of some standard frame profiles with a routed groove along the back:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ekf3n.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ekf3n.jpg"" alt=""One-piece picture frames""></a></p>

<p>Shouldn't be hard too see that the top portion, the wide part, could be a bit of standard moulding from the DIY or big-box. The rabbet/rebate can simply be formed by glueing on a second, narrower, piece of wood.</p>

<p>So here's the built-up equivalent:</p>

<p>As you can see this is really very simple and easy so I don't know why it isn't more commonly done by early or beginner woodworkers who don't have a router or other means to easily form the groove, but I suspect it's just that people don't think of it themselves. I know I hadn't, I read of this method in a book and it was an ""Ah-hah!"" moment because after you see it it does seem head-smackingly obvious.</p>

","<p>In addition to using scrap to support the wood during a cut, as Bert said, grain direction can affect tear out.  In your photograph above, the cuts are being made on end grain, which greatly increases the odds of tear out, unless you can change the direction of the cut in some way to avoid pulling at the grain as you leave the cut.  I don't have any experience with routers, so I'm not sure what your options would be if you have to make an end-grain cut.</p>

<p>However, in this specific case, the grain should be running along the length of the dovetails, instead of across the dovetails.  (Dovetails are subjected mostly to tension forces, and wood does not have very good tensile strength across the grain.)  Putting the dovetails on the correct sides of the board should reduce or eliminate the tear out.</p>

<p>I sanded off the yellow before using the pine, but now I wonder what it was and if that was the right thing to do. So what exactly is the yellow stain on the endgrain of the pine I bought?</p>
","<p>The paint isn't only used to identify the wood boards by lumber yards, but it's also used to seal of the end grain to slow down the drying process.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because exposed pores or tracheids on the end-grain surfaces promote too-rapid drying and result in checks, it is wise to coat the ends of boards to slow the moisture loss from the end grain. Almost any impervious material will do. Wet wood can receive a primer of acrylic latex paint first. Aluminum paint, oil paint even melted paraffin will seal the wood. Coat the ends as soon as possible after sawing to minimize end checks. In wood such as beech, checking can begin in a matter of hours. Oak is also quite susceptible. Once checking occurs, the damage is done. </p>

  <p>How can I get these price tag stickers off in a way <strong>that the wood will okay to take stain in those places</strong>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Re. the highlighted portion, you shouldn't need to worry about that because the surface of the wood should be worked enough that this stops being a concern — it's good practice never to attempt to stain, or otherwise finish<sup>1</sup>, any wood bought pre-dimensioned without at least doing something to prep the surface (these days usually light sanding). </p>

<p>For the sticker residue, scraping should get most or all of it off. This can be done using a card scraper, any sharp blade or the long edges of a chisel, whatever works best for you..... or whichever happens to be closest :-) Any traces remaining will be dealt with when you surface the wood, either by planing, scraping or sanding. </p>

<p>Note: although the right solvent<sup>2</sup> will deal with 99% of sticker residues if you use this as the only step on wood there's a risk some of the dissolved adhesive will soak into the surface wood fibres, which will act as a 'resist' (stain-blocker). This can sometimes be visible even if only varnishing. So physical or abrasive means are the right call here.</p>

<p>Finally, is there an optimum depth of dadoes? In some of the youtube videos I've seen, it seems that 1/4"" dadoes are fairly common in 3/4"" material.

</blockquote>

<p>Broadly speaking yes. </p>

<p>In just about any wood, with any joint, if you end up removing more wood than remains you're obviously undermining the strength of the material. So with a dado (UK: housing joint) going deeper than half way should be avoided. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And, going the other way, is there a minimum depth of a dado before it's either not adding any strength, or not assisting with alignment? Maybe 1/8"" or 1/16""?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is less clear cut I feel because so much depends on the inherent strength of the material. While a 1/8"" (3mm) dado wouldn't be particularly strong in any wood in stronger hardwoods it could be more than sufficient, while in something like pine the same joint depth would probably represent a noticeable weak point.</p>

<p>The expected load and the outright thickness of the material obviously tie in here as well. In a small campaign case in pine 1/16"" dados may be appropriate and provide suitable strength, but obviously not for a pine shelf in a sizeable bookcase or cupboard where you want to give the ends of the boards much more support. </p>

<p>I suppose one way of looking at it is if there's no good reason to do a shallow dado then don't. Many joints in woodwork are actually stronger than strictly necessary, but erring on the side of greater strength is rarely a bad thing. And as it may be no more or less effort to create a weaker version then why do it anyway?</p>

<p>I suspect some of this will come down to habit or ease of setup rather than being carefully considered and done with best strength in mind.</p>

<p>But it is actually quite a common rule of thumb to have a joint be 1/3 the thickness of the material, although that's by no means set in stone and variation either way is possible and acceptable. </p>

"What can be done to correct wipe-on poly that is still tacky after 24 hours?","415","","<p>The project is an oak dining table top. The varnish had worn off in spots. After stripping a few spots that had been exposed for longer still had a gray, aged look. It is a veneer so I didn't want to do too much sanding; therefore, I used Bar Keeper's Friend (oxalic acid) to bleach the spots. That and light sanding lessened the stains enough that I moved on to staining after cleaning the entire table with mineral spirits. Used Minwax penetrating stain and it looked beautiful. The ""problem"" occurred when I applied Minwax wipe-on poly. The first application dried fine, except for the spots where I had used the bleaching solution. Those spots stayed tacky. After letting it sit overnight they seemed sufficiently dry to apply second coat. But the tacky feel is again present only in those spots. I am considering trying a shellac finish over the poly. Other options y'all might suggest? Any advice on how to proceed is much appreciated.</p>
","<p>Your best option at this point is to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, so just wait longer and see if the varnish will dry properly given enough time. </p>

<p>Be patient. Sometimes drying is slowed by one or more factors and sometimes it's slowed <em>a lot</em>, but often (usually?) it will cure if you can just wait it out. Many times when you read someone complain that their varnish ""just wouldn't dry"" you find out they only waited a few days to a week, when in my experience retarded drying might take weeks to resolve. </p>

<p>However that is not to say that drying will always complete, unfortunately it is possible to have something that remains permanently tacky :-( And in this case the best course of action is often to strip back and begin again*. </p>

<p>For now, if you can, put the table somewhere warm with good airflow to provide the best drying conditions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am considering trying a shellac finish over the poly. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would work to seal off the areas of new varnish, but it would be best to apply the shellac to varnish that is dry to the touch because otherwise the tacky surface could interfere with application — you'd have 'draggy' spots.</p>

<p>And in order to have a varnish-tough surface you'd need to apply further coats of wipe-on over the top, the shellac then being used as a barrier coat (something it is often relied upon for).</p>

<p>If you create a new surface of shellac it'll be like you <em>only</em> applied shellac, your tabletop will remain permanently sensitive to water, will be damaged by alcohol, and won't be as resistant to scratching as you'd like it to be.</p>

<hr>

<p>*Although if it's very slight a coat of paste wax over the top can resolve the issue enough that the surface is usable. But be aware the tackiness indicates the varnish hasn't dried thoroughly so the surface won't be as tough as it could be.</p>

","<p>A jigsaw and chisels are quite adequate for making finger joints in thick stock like that. Some tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Carefully mark both sides of the joint, making sure to mark the waste clearly.</li>
<li>When cutting the waste with the jigsaw, cut away from the line, into the waste area. This will make the waste area a little too small, and can be fine tuned with the chisel.</li>
<li>Fine tune the joint by dry-fitting, trimming a little and fitting again. Do this until the joint is snug (meaning you can join the parts by hand with some effort, but don't need a mallet to force the parts together).</li>
<li>Use the jigsaw to cut away as much of the waste as possible, reducing the amount of wood you need to trim with the chisel.</li>
<li>Keep your chisels sharp. Even though it's just redwood, a sharp chisel is always much easier (and safer) to work with than a dull one.</li>

<p>Beech is a fine choice for a chopping board.  You can buy food-grade mineral oil at just about any grocery store (I get mine at IKEA since it's convenient for me to do so).  The rule of thumb for oiling a cutting board is to soak it until it stops absorbing oil once a day for a week, then once a week for a month, and then monthly after that.</p>

<p>Oiling the board won't necessarily make it more durable in terms of chop resistance.  However, it will make the board last longer just because it keeps it from drying out.</p>

<p>TiteBond III is the universal standard for gluing up cutting boards.  It's food-safe and has a bit more open time that regular TiteBond.  There are food-safe epoxies, but I haven't been able to find one that's easy for me to get and as inexpensive as TB III.</p>

"What features to look for when buying a router lift?","409","","<p>I recently discovered the existence of a thing called a router lift, in answers to <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2196/is-a-plunge-router-suitable-for-router-table-work"">this question</a>.  I'm intrigued and would love to get one. </p>

<p>A bit of internet research later, and I see there is quite a bit of variety, not only in price, but in basic feature sets.  </p>

<p>Assuming I would like to purchase (rather than construct) a lift, what features seem to be important to you?  For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do I need a ""quick change"" ring to facilitate bit changes?</li>
<li>Do I need to be able to lock the lift to a particular height?</li>
<li>Does a flex-shaft controller (that I can attach to the side of the router) work better/worse than a screw controller (that means I have another hole through my insert plate?</li>
<li>Others?</li>
</ul>

<p>If it is important to answering the question, I have a DeWalt 625 plunge router (as long as my frustration with fine-setting bit heights hasn't caused me to throw it through the workshop wall).</p>

<p>My router usage: finger/dovetail joints, chamfers/roundover/edge decorations, picture frames, etc.  I tend to use the smaller bits (i.e. not panel work).</p>
","<p>For what it's worth, your <em>DeWalt 625 will not work with most router lifts</em> on the market. Most lifts are designed to work with a removable motor from a fixed-base router, and you'll need to look into a <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/2199/49"">different solution</a> such as one of those that I suggested in my answer to other router question that you referenced. The DeWalt 625 is a plunge router with an integral, non-removable motor. But for the sake of argument and the benefit of others, let's pretend you also have another router which <em>is</em> compatible with most lifts. </p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the only feature most people <em>need</em> from a router lift is the ability to easily raise and lower the router by very small increments.</p>

<p>Let's address a few of your questions about specific features:</p>

<p><strong>Do I need a ""quick change"" ring to facilitate bit changes?</strong></p>

<p>If you're referring to the red rings in the illustration below, these are important not just for changing bits, but to use different-diameter bits. You want to give your workpiece as much support as possible as it passes by the bit, so you should use the smallest insert ring that gives your bit adequate clearance through its entire height range.</p>

<p>Many router lifts include a router table insert plate (the gray rectangular flat piece) with insert rings, but some do not. You can also buy router plates with or without the rings, or you can make your own. For this reason, I consider this part not so much a part of the router lift, but an accessory that you can add separately. That said, the mounting plates included with some of the more expensive router lifts do have additional features such as precision markings or easier adjustments.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tnLs2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tnLs2.jpg"" alt=""Router lift with plate""></a></p>

<p>(<a href=""http://www.woodpeck.com/prlv2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Do I need to be able to lock the lift to a particular height?</strong></p>

<p>I could be wrong but I would suspect that this feature is included on most commercially-available lifts. This is good to have in order to guarantee that your router won't drift up or down with vibration and use, but it depends on what's more important to you and whether your specific lift has a tendency to travel out of adjustment with use. Is it more important to be able to change settings quickly, or to keep the same setting for a long time? Whether or not you use the height lock may also depend on the job. If you're producing mating parts with tight tolerances, you may want to lock the router height. But if you're just cutting an ogee or roundover as a cosmetic detail, and your lift more or less doesn't go out of adjustment on its own, you're probably fine.</p>

<p>I just use a Bosch fixed router base as my lift and haven't had a problem. I would suspect most screw-driven lifts hold their settings pretty well, but if you find a router lift that has a lot of slop in its adjustment mechanism, you'll probably want to lock the height once you've adjusted it.</p>

<p><strong>Does a flex-shaft controller (that I can attach to the side of the router) work better/worse than a screw controller (that means I have another hole through my insert plate?</strong></p>

<p>As with many tool features, this is largely a convenience since you can have a ""remote"" adjustment crank or knob on the side or your router table. You don't have to potentially move your workpiece out of the way to make an adjustment.</p>

<p><strong>Others?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A touchscreen- or foot-controlled <a href=""http://www.eaglelakewoodworking.com/post/The-PowerLift-has-Arrived.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">powered router lift</a>/automatic height adjustment would be great in many situations, for example, when making many successively deeper passes (which is pretty much every time you use your router, right?).  But if it causes you to speed up too much, you might stop thinking about safety and you could potentially raise the bit directly into your hand (for example, if cutting out a circle and raising the bit a little on each pass).</li>
<li>Quick bit changes. Some router lifts have ways to speed up bit changes and/or make them less awkward. If you're buying a router lift instead of building one, you might use this feature as a tiebreaker when deciding between two lifts, but there are other accessories you can buy to speed up/simplify bit changes, which are not tied to a specific router lift. I certainly wouldn't spend any extra money on the lift for this feature, but here are a couple ways lifts implement quick bit changes:

"What are these blemishes called and how do I avoid them?","408","","<p>I'm just beginning bowl turning and can't seem to avoid these deep blemishes in the exterior and interior of the bowl. Are these pockets naturally occurring in the wood or am I causing them through poor technique? </p>

<p>I have only used a Ellsworth Signature Bowl Gouge so far.</p>

","<p>It's called Tearout.</p>

<p>That is tearing the fibers.  Most of the time when you see that the fibers of the wood are tearing out instead of being cut/sheared by the gouges.</p>

<p>There are three thing that can cause this.  One is the wood itself.  Some species are a little more prone to this than others.  Also wood that is starting to spalt or rot is more likely to do this as well.</p>

<p>It can be reduced quite a bit by technique.  The more aggressive the cuts you make with the gouges the more likely it is going to tear vs. cut the fibers.  So as you get closer to the finished shape you want (especially if you see this happening, the finer and gentler the cuts you want to make.  </p>

<p>Also KEEP the Gouges <strong>SHARP</strong>.  Sharper gouges are more likely to cut the fibers instead of pulling them out and causing this problem.  It took me a while to figure these things out. (I also don't like how it looks most of the time and it takes FOREVER to sand them out once you make the mistake.</p>

<p>So, to reduce/eliminate this, when you see your piece is prone to this, make sure your gouges are sharp and if it continues, then take less aggressive cuts.  I've done this to save bowls.  I sharpen the gouge and then take very light cuts, it can 'erase' those big holes, at least to the point it doesn't take long to sand them out the rest of the way.</p>

","<p>There is two simple ways I would go about it.</p>

<p>1) Go to a store that sells stains. If they have that I am sure they will also have wood filler. Get the one that would match the wood color. Some also simply go by 'oak' wood color, something like that. If you used a stain then your in luck! These are usually stain-able. </p>

Anyway using a sander just sand away. When you have a good amount of sand dust collected but it in a little dish. Add some wood clue and mix till you get a nice paste. Just like that you would have made your own simple wood filler. The only thing is I am not sure this is stain-able. It could be since there is wood in it, but it could simply not stain well in that spot. Something to test on. </p>

"What kind of wood blanks should a beginner use for bowl turning?","402","","<p>I recently took a bowl turning class and want to build experience in a frugal way. From a quick online search, I see bowl blanks cost around $10 ~ $30, depending on the wood.</p>

<p>What kind of wood blanks should I start out on, negating aesthetic qualities and focusing on dollar value? Should I be buying 6 x 6 x N stock and cutting it down?</p>
","<p>If dollars is your biggest concern, (and with the cost of some blanks, it should be!) I would recommend firewood.  If you have access to a bandsaw then this is doubly easy.  The majority of the wood I turn is stuff I've set aside while cutting fire wood.  Either as I cut it into chunks or later when I split it in half to dry.  </p>

<p>If you are an urban dweller, then keep your eyes open for places where they are cutting down trees.  Often especially if it is the city they don't mind letting someone else take some, it's that much less they have to clean up and deal with.  Also sometimes when they cut trees, it is stacked on the curb for later pick up, ask and you can probably get more than you can fit in your car.  </p>

<p>Firewood gives you a lot of free wood to practice an learn on, and since it's free, you don't have to worry about 'messing it up'.  I have yet to buy any wood for turning, but then I have had access to LOTS of firewood.  </p>

<p>Another one might be if there is a mill nearby.  You might be able to pick through and buy a bunch of slabs.  I have my own mill, so provide my own slabs, but they can be very cheap, maybe even free, and you can cut circle banks from them.  I use a lot of these as well, for flatter, thinner bowls plates.  Often they are still quite pretty.</p>

"Should I use aluminum and copper to make woodworking tools?","400","","<p>I can make aluminum tools here at home. I can melt metal and anything like copper to 2000 F degrees. Would aluminum not be a good idea when it comes to tools? I want to make a thing for a lathe like a flat edge. But with it being aluminum would it keep its edge on wood? Would it bend? What if I used copper; would it still keep its edge or not and bend like aluminum? I am very curious as to what will happen, and if it is a good idea or not. If not why is it such a bad idea. I know it will more than likely not last as long as steel on wood but does anybody have a guess?</p>
","<p>In short, copper and aluminum are soft metals, and you'd need to consider the quality of the casting and the metallurgical treatment of the tool as well. It sounds like a fun project, but watch out for potential catastrophic failure of the tool.</p>

<p>The first metal tools used by man were copper and copper alloys (bronze and brass). The main problem with these metals is that they are much softer than steel, thus holding an edge for less time and also in a greater risk of bending the tool itself (and not just the cutting edge). Aluminum in pure form (i.e. not an alloy of aluminum) is even softer than copper.</p>

<p>A further issue is with the quality of the casting. How well can you create a uniform alloy and then cast it so that the finished tool will not have any voids or weak spots due to poorly mixed alloy or other flaws? Any such issues will impact the strength of the tool.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a large difference in metal hardness with different treatment methods after the initial casting. Metals most often can be annealed (softened), tempered (toughened) and hardened. A good tool steel alloy can be hardened to twice (or more) the hardness of the original steel.</p>

<p>Now for some numbers (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness_comparison"" rel=""nofollow"">comparing different hardness scales</a> is difficult, but just so that you have the right impression):</p>

<ol>
<li>On the most commonly used <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_scale"" rel=""nofollow"">Rockwell hardness scale</a>, steel and copper/aluminum don't even use the same scale (there are HRC for steels and HRB for softer metals). Typical tool steel is about 60 HRC, while brass (which is harder than pure copper) is about 70 HRB. However, 70 HRB is much softer than even 1 HRC.</li>
<li>On the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brinell_scale"" rel=""nofollow"">Brinell hardness scale</a>, tool steel has a hardness of about 700, while aluminum is 15 and copper is 35. And just for comparison, hardwoods have a hardness of 3 to 7, so your aluminum tool might be only slightly harder than the wood it is cutting. I would imagine it would be like cutting pine with an oak chisel. The most dense hardwoods are probably even harder than copper (woods like Lignum Vitae).</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, since you are asking about tools for a lathe, I would be very careful. Lathes exert a lot of force on the turning chisels, and it might cause a catastrophic failure, especially if there is some flaw or void in the casting. The tool might snap suddenly, sending shards flying at high speed.</p>

<p>At the end, it does sound like a nice project to try out, but I would start from tools that don't have such a high risk of damage. A marking knife would be a good start - it will allow you to assess the edge holding capabilities of the metal you are working, and would be pretty safe should the tool suddenly break. Then I would step up to small hand chisels (not for lathe work) and then progress from there if results are satisfactory.</p>

"Router tears wood, leaves streaks","399","","<p>I bought a router and am practicing. When I cut across the grain (actually, it does not matter, see ""conclusion"") I noticed that sometimes it tears bits of the wood out. For example, here are two ends of the same piece of 3/4"" pine:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C1WYV.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C1WYV.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Both ends were cut by me but on the bottom you can see the rough cut. This is a hand held 1.5 hp router at ~20000 rpms using a straight blade with 2 flutes. The blade is 3/8"" diameter and I removed about 1/8"" of uneven material. I used the router base against a clamped piece of wood as a guide. The feed direction was against the blade rotation.</p>

<p>Why is this happening and can I avoid it? Did the router actually rip those bits out or do those pockets already exist in the wood? Is it a problem with my technique, wood quality, or just a normal unavoidable thing?</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion (Probably)</strong></p>

<p>Following CoAstroGeek's answer I inspected my equipment and tried more consistent cuts to repeat the problem.</p>

<p>I sawed away a portion of the wood near the tear and verified that it was not an internal defect, it looks like I did the damage:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pzp7I.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pzp7I.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I then cut material off in the same way as above using all four straight bits from the same set, increasing diameter each time. I kept my speed more consistent this time and tried to go a bit faster. Cuts were made right to left in images below. Looking closely, even though I did not have tearing as above, the results are very poor (I burned the first one a lot cutting off too much material, so I couldn't move quickly):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hULjc.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hULjc.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The second bit was OK. The third is the one I was using in the original images. The streaks are in the same positions as the tears. This is probably not coincidence. All four blades also leave light horizontal streaks the whole way down, which I initially attributed to sanding.</p>

<p>Also while I thought my cuts along the grains had no issues, on closer inspection there is still notching:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uwkJi.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uwkJi.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>When I inspected each bit under a magnifying glass, one of the flutes was slightly chipped or dented at the location of every deep scratch. I could not determine the cause of the lighter more frequent scratches. </p>

<p>I tried similar experiments with my other bits, not part of this set and from a different manufacturer, and none had any of these issues.</p>

<p>The general conclusion is this set of bits is probably just crap. It was fairly cheap. It also taught me that I should be very careful when storing bits because even small defects can ruin a cut. I do not know if the dents are manufacturing defects or damage to the bits done by me in storage (all of the bits used were brand new before this post). Time to go shopping.</p>
","<p>I don't think I've ever seen that.  Is the bit sharp?  Have you checked it for burrs or other defects?  The top picture seems to have some artifacts going across the face also, but they didn't result in tear outs.</p>

<p>The burn on the right side indicates that maybe you paused or slowed down at that point, which may contribute or may be a separate problem.</p>

<p>Was the feed direction the same for both cuts - ie. from the center of the log (right side of both pics) toward the edge, or vice-versa?</p>

<p>In summary, check your equipment, and try to replicate taking note of your feed direction, speed, other aspects of your technique.</p>

","<p>Unfortunately, the only way to correct uneven stain is by sanding to bare wood (in your case, MDF) and reapplying the stain. There isn't a way to rescue the stain. Sanding doesn't just lighten the stain, instead it strips the stained wood off. And once you've done that, it's also not possible to re-stain the stripped area and blend it evenly with the other stained areas. So the whole thing has to come off before you can put new stain on, I'm afraid.</p>

<hr>

<p>That said, in these cases it's often much faster to use a card scraper instead of sanding. A quick google search confirms that you can use card scrapers on MDF, with the usual caveat that MDF dulls a tool's sharp edges faster than wood.

"Can water based wood dyes be mixed to be more opaque?","392","","<p>I'm working on building a Les Paul style guitar, with a figured maple top, and am just trying to figure out how to do the finish, to achieve a nice sunburst effect.</p>

<p>I lack the equipment and experience to do the finish with an airbrush and tinted lacquer, so I've set my sights on using water based wood dyes to rub on, and then coat with clear aerosol lacquer.</p>

<p>These are the dyes I purchased:
<a href=""https://generalfinishes.com/retail-products/water-base-wood-stains-dyes/waterbase-wood-dye-stains#.Vkn8CK6rRR4"">https://generalfinishes.com/retail-products/water-base-wood-stains-dyes/waterbase-wood-dye-stains#.Vkn8CK6rRR4</a></p>

<p>Now, these do a pretty great job, but the one thing they lack is that they are very transparent, which is great for the center of the guitar, but I'd rather have the color thicken up a bit around the edges and get more opaque, hiding the natural wood grain a little bit more.</p>

<p>The General Finishes brochure I had for these dyes stated that they could be mixed with a clear finish to create a ""toner"". I'm not entirely sure what they mean by ""toner"" in this case, but I was thinking perhaps this was would be what I was looking for.. But I also don't know which clear finish I would be able to mix it with if so.</p>

<p>The important detail is that whatever I do has to be safe to use the clear lacquer over top. I had thought maybe I could mix the dyes with a bit of polyurethane to do a second coat of color around the edges before the lacquer, but I read that this could cause issues as the lacquer shrinks over time and the poly does not, increasing my risk of chipping.</p>

<p>So I'm looking for some advice on any techniques I can use to get this more opaque coloring around the edges, without removing my ability to lacquer afterwards? Are these dyes even the best choice for me, or is there another better alternative that I can use? (without the need to get an airbrush setup going - or maybe I really do need to do that to get the best finish?)</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I lack the equipment and experience to do the finish with an airbrush and tinted lacquer, so I've set my sights on using water based wood dyes to rub on</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me stop you right there. Believe it or not you've actually set yourself a harder task, where it's <em>more</em> difficult to achieve the result you're aiming for.</p>

<p>You'd want to do some pretty extensive testing to see whether this is even practical for you, much less give you the exact effect you're hoping to achieve. I've used waterbased products of various kinds over the years and even at a far smaller scale than you're working the fast drying time can begin to be an issue. You'd potentially be fighting two things here: evaporation of the water 'base' and absorption by the wood. Combined, the finish can begin to dry in places before you've even completed a single wipe across the area you're coating. And once that happens you can basically say goodbye to any sort of blemish-free application.</p>

<p>If I had to attempt something like this by hand to say that I would prefer to do it with an oil-based product would be a massive understatement. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The General Finishes brochure I had for these dyes stated that they could be mixed with a clear finish to create a ""toner"". </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A toner is one traditional term for a coloured overcoat. </p>

<p>In the past these were more heavily used to blend in (tone) individual panels where the wood was a slightly lighter colour, to match others in a piece that were a bit darker. Or to blend in an unavoidable bit of sapwood to match the heartwood in the rest of the piece.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had thought maybe I could mix the dyes with a bit of polyurethane to do a second coat of color around the edges before the lacquer, but I read that this could cause issues as the lacquer shrinks over time and the poly does not, increasing my risk of chipping.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would be highly dependent on what's actually in the can. That advice I'm sure stems from experience using true lacquer, but a spraycan finish that calls itself lacquer might not actually be lacquer in anything but name. There are many confusing and contradictory names in retail finishing products, because the target market is not professionals so they use generic terms as sort of keywords for the buyer, e.g. clear, hard finish = lacquer. Even if what's in the can is a waterbased acrylic finish of some sort.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(without the need to get an airbrush setup going - or maybe I really do need to do that to get the best finish?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes I'm afraid spraying is <em>the</em> way to do this kind of thing. It is possible using hand methods (wiping, padding, flogging, stippling) but it's not an exaggeration to say that reliably achieving a really good result would be expert-level finishing. </p>

<p>Now re. the spraying, an airbrush would not be the tool of choice for work of this scale. It can be done by airbrush (using a suitable nozzle), but some kind of spraygun is better suited to the job and that's what is used in the Gibson factory. Even using the right tool it's still work that requires a deft touch, so a few practice pieces would be advisable to ensure a good result on the completed guitar body.</p>

<p>If you decide to go down this road, be sure to factor in the cost of the compressor and any necessary added parts, e.g. a moisture trap if one is not fitted already. A compressor will usually cost quite a bit more than the airbrush or spraygun so it's not an insignificant part of the setup costs to spray. </p>

<p>Also if you'll be spraying real lacquer you'll want to invest in a good respirator and the appropriate organic-vapour cartridges. </p>

"Evening reflectivity of a finish after ""finishing the finish""","390","","<p>I recently installed butcher block countertops in my kitchen. Several weeks ago, I put four coats of varnish on them, but (as always) they ended up with dust nibs. So yesterday, I wet sanded with 400 grit sandpaper (using mineral oil and water as a lubricant). That made the surface very smooth to the touch, but left an uneven sheen across the surface because the dust nibbed areas (i.e., the high points) were matte while the crevices were satin (the luster I chose for the finish). Normally, one would keep sanding until the sheen is even, but I figured I'd just add a top layer of finish thinned with mineral spirits (i.e., a wiping varnish). Theoretically, applying another layer of satin finish <em>should</em> make the sheen even.</p>

<p>Alas, it did not. Look at the picture below. Why has my top coat not evened out the finish? How can I even out the sheen?</p>

<p>A couple things I have considered.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Bump up the sheen to semi-gloss. The top coat was a different brand of varnish, so maybe the undercoat (the un-dust-nibbed part) was more shiny than the top (thinned) coat, which could cause this diversity of sheen. </p></li>
<li><p>Bump <em>down</em> the sheen to matte. Maybe dampening everything to the dust-nibbed sheen is the best way to go (for the opposite reasons stated in #1). </p></li>
<li><p>Keep adding coats. This is, after all, thinned varnish I'm applying. Maybe it will take several more coats to even the sheen. </p></li>
<li><p>Live with it :(</p></li>

","<p>Finishing should probably get its own SE site. :) I only partially jest.</p>

<p>In this case you will be up against several limitations to getting the finish that I think you are looking for, none of which should be considered insurmountable.</p>

<ol>
<li>Flatness</li>
<li>Contamination</li>
<li>Flow</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to keep at it and try to get a nice even finish you will need to begin to flatten the actual varnish that is currently on the counter top taking care around the edges and corners not to sand through the finish. You need to physically cut the finish flat before considering adding more varnish on top of what is currently there because you are correct, future coats will only follow and magnify any contours that are present.</p>

<p>You have a couple of approaches to do this now with a varnish.</p>

<li>Fine grit sandpaper and a sanding block. </li>
</ol>

<p>Most of the time you don't actually need an actual block of wood to back up your sandpaper, sometimes you can get by with a stiff pad of some kind when sanding finishes such as lacquer. Varnishes are harder and stickier so you may want to opt for something pretty stiff to back up the sand paper.</p>

<p>A few more tips. Get a high quality 400 - 600 grit sticky back paper for finishing. 400 is about right. With the sticky back stuff, it comes in 4"" or 4.5"" rolls, you can get more creative and work faster when sanding finishes. You can wet sand it or dry sand it after a few days of curing. Wet is probably the way to go here. Be prepared to change to paper often. It will gum up and stop cutting then the temptation will be to just sand more vigorously which can lead to unevenness and sanding through.</p>

<p>I usually keep a sharp wedge of wood handy (picture a 5 degree incline plane 2 inches wide) to scrape the finish off of my sanding block / pad to get more milage out of the paper. The wood scraper does not damage the paper like a metal tool would and you can keep cutting at least twice as long per piece of paper.</p>

<p>Work in sections and dry the surface and evaluate your progress. You do want to evenly flatten the finish. I think you know what you are looking for, an even sheen indicating you have cut down the high points to the valleys.</p>

<p>If you completely sand though one coat into another you will sometime see ghost rings that can be seen under the correct light. These appear at the boundaries of coats of finish and are usually not something to worry about in a varnish finish as additional coats will cause these to be unnoticeable.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Cabinet Scraper</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GUvcb.jpg"" alt=""Cabinet Scraper""></p>

<p>A properly sharpened cabinet scraper can work miracles with a thick varnish finish. I add this just to tantalize you :). I have created mirror flat poly finishes with this tool and some good luck. I would consider this an advanced technique and would recommend practicing before I tried flattening a finish on an important project. However the time that a scraper can save you in sanding make it worth considering.</p>

<p>The key to this technique is to get a supremely fine and even burr on this guy and actually shave the finish with the lightest of pressure. On a well cured varnish, several days, you can almost produce little curls of finish. Care should be taken not to dig into the finish with the corners. (I usually round the corners on my cabinet scraper anyways for this very reason, not much mind you.)</p>

<p>Using a scraper has the disadvantage of being a more difficult technique but it can save hours if you get it right. The scraper will not gum up like paper and can produce a surface that is superior to all but the finest sandpaper. I would also only use a scraper with a varnish finish, the thicker finish the better.</p>

<h2>Applying Final Coat</h2>

<p>After you have satisfactorily flattened you finish, often done between coats of lacquer as well, you need to lay down the final coat or coats. The finish will need to flow properly but not be too thin and with a varnish, contamination is a big danger as these finishes take much longer to set up compared to a spray finish.</p>

<p>Applying the final coat of a varnish finish is probably beyond the scope of your question and I mainly wanted to highlight ways to flatten an existing coat varnish as this seems to be your most obvious next step. Best of luck Sir! </p>

"How can I fix wood to some metal in a neither destructive nor permanent way","388","","<p>I sadly have no additional space for a real/standalone workbench, but what i do have is a powerrack (a cage made of steel used for weightlifting). Looking at one half ot it, it looks like this:</p>

<p>I have a piece of wood that i can lay over those bars and use it as a simple Desk, but this alone is too shaky for using it as a workbench. </p>

<p>I am looking for ideas how I can put the piece of wood on there really tight. I don't want to modify anything on the metal side, and once finished attaching/detaching the wood should not take more than a few minutes.</p>

<p>My only idea is using something like hose clamps to fix the wood to the bars. Do you have other/better ideas how i can do this?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I like the ideas so far, and in fact I already have something like Jason suggested in place (only on the insides). This works fine for using it as a desk, as it cant move left to right. </p>

<p>But for using it for woodworking, i am planning on putting a vice on it. If i then put force on the workpiece in the vice in direction of the bars, I fear the whole thing will tilt in that direction as it only relies on gravity.</p>

","<p>I'd add four simple blocks of wood to the underside of your work surface.  I made this out of 2x4x6"" long scrap.  Drill hole in center with fostner bit, then use jig saw to cut access groove.

You should use some flush mount screws to hold this block to your work surface.   Quick, easy, cheap, use all three!</p>

<p>Note, I'm assuming you have very little overhang at the ends of your table top.  You don't want to have the table flip up because someone placed a heavy load at the cantilevered end of the table.  You always want the heavy loads to be between the steel supports.</p>

<p><em>Update to match the restatement of the original issue above. 9PM PST, 27 Feb 2016:</em><br>
Okay, lets use the same basic design, but we'll change things up a tiny bit.  We're not going to be cutting a deep groove, instead we'll flip the whole wood piece around, drill two 7/16"" holes. (i.e. 3/8"" plus clearance!)  Now you are going to have to drill eight 3/8"" countersink holes in your work top.  You will need eight standard countersink bolts, eight washers and eight wingnuts.  Obviously you will be bolting the bars tight at the hold down in each corner of the worktop.  Does this make sense?  It's still pretty easy to make; it will take a few minutes to tighten up eight wingnuts, but for the actual tabletop install, no tools are required.  </p>

<p>The block of wood will rest on the bottom of the bar.  3/8""-16 bolts will keep things way tight.  </p>

<p>This is similar in concept to the design from Daniel B, but I'm thinking this is pretty easy to make.  Oh.. note on safety.  Its okay to drill a hole in an edge like that if you are using a Forstner bit on a drill press.  If you don't have those tools, you can use a spade bit in the center of a WIDE block, then cut the block narrow after you've drilled the hole.  Trying to drill a hole in the edge of a piece of wood with a spade bit is much too dangerous.  Be careful out there!  If you don't have a table saw, you can easily use a hand saw to safely do the post drilling cuts.  </p>

"Can a track saw make glue-ready surfaces?","385","","<p>I have a worm drive circular saw that I have converted to a track saw using the <a href=""http://www.eurekazone.com/product_p/ezts36.htm"">EZSmart system</a>.

  <p>Also, most 7-1/4"" blades don't specify if they are for ripping or
  crosscutting. Does it not matter with these saws?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's because most people don't want to stop and change blades just because they're cutting in a different direction, and often the wood you cut with a 7 1/4"" blade is dimensional lumber, etc., so general purpose combination blades are popular.</p>

<p>But they do make rip and crosscut blades in the 7 1/4"" size. As with table saw blades, the differences are mainly the number and shape of the teeth. Crosscut blades have more teeth than rip blades, and they're more likely to have beveled (ATB) teeth where a rip blade is more likely to have flat top (FTG) teeth. That said, there are plenty of ATB blades marked for ripping.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I upgrade to a finishing blade, will it be enough to cut out the hand plane work?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That depends on what kind of work you're doing, what kind of wood you're working with, and what your standards are. If you're trying to create an invisible seam for, say, a guitar top or a piece of fine furniture, you'll likely still want to take a pass with the plane. Using the right blade for the job should at least improve the cut surface; only you can say whether it improves it <em>enough</em>.</p>

","<p>The hole in the pictured jig should have the same diameter as the diagonal measurement of the square stock that's to be made into a dowel.

<p>The height difference between the table saw blade and the bottom of the jig hole will determine the final diameter of the dowel. Raising the blade will make it a thinner dowel, and lowering the blade will make it a thicker dowel.</p>

"How can I tell if wood turning (lathe) chisels are sharp?","382","","<p>I have a set of large wood chisels given to me by a person that has never used them and doesn't know their history.</p>

<p>I attempted to turn a small test bowl with them, but had tear-out type issues.</p>

<p>How can I tell if the wood turning chisels are sharp?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>How can I tell if the wood turning chisels are sharp?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As with any edged tool you can simply feel the edge (carefully) to check if it's sharp. Almost all traditional woodworking books show a chisel or plane iron's edge being testing with the thumb. However, it can be difficult to judge just how sharp something is by feel — sure it's sharp, but how sharp? — so more empirical tests can be a better idea. So directly testing the edge for cutting performance would be my recommendation.</p>

<p>One empirical test that is often used today is to see whether a tool will easily shave hair from your forearm, which is a particularly good test of a high degree of sharpness but it is not ideal as you can easily run out of arm hair if you are testing many edges over a short timeframe. And there is obviously the problem that not everyone would find bare patches on their arm acceptable in the first place :-)</p>

<p>Probably a better test is to directly use the tool on wood. Paring the end grain of a softwood such as pine is a very good acid test of sharpness. You do this with a softer softwood and not a hardwood because the soft parts of something like pine will easily bend over (showing as tearing of the fibres) instead of being sliced cleanly. A good edge will slice pine end grain and leave a uniform surface behind, if it's very very sharp indeed the surface will be nearly glossy.</p>

<p>In case you are unaware, woodworking chisels usually need to be sharpened or honed frequently in use, as often as a few times an hour. As well as that, few are supplied sharpened and ready to use so they need honing before their very first use too.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on fixing this? I cut the mortise about 1/16"" too large in both dimensions. :(</p>
","<p><strong>Enlarge the tenon</strong><br>
Oh I wish I could leave it at just that one sentence ^_^ But it's not obvious how you'd do that. </p>

<p>Usually the error in an undersized tenon is quite small and you'd glue slips of veneer to each side that needs it (often it's the cheeks only that need attention). Here you'll need to use thin slips of wood that you cut yourself. When doing this ideally you're supposed to match the grain orientation of the tenon closely but it's not that vital at this scale unless you were using a completely different wood.</p>

<p>Glue the packing pieces to the tenon firmly and wait for the glue to harden, then check fit and adjust if necessary, then glue the M&amp;T as normal.</p>

<p><strong>Loose fit? No problem, glue with thickened epoxy</strong><br>
This sounds sketchy but actually it's a perfectly reasonable way to go. Epoxy is one of the few adhesives that can bridge gaps while still producing a strong joint and if you thicken the epoxy with a fine powder (wood dust is usually used but there are <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3807/large-hole-filler-products-what-is-available/3809#3809"">other options</a>) you can get it to a consistency where it stays where you apply it and doesn't slump from the pull of gravity. </p>

<p>The usual aim point given for the consistency you'll need here is similar to peanut butter<sup>1</sup>..... and if you use wood dust as the filler the mixture often looks disturbingly close to peanut butter!</p>

<p><strong>Next time</strong><br>
For next time the obvious reminder is to mark out more carefully but you may have had the problem where your marking out was on the money but the walls of the tenon moved back unintentionally as you cut due to how you're chiselling, which is a common enough error when starting out<sup>2</sup>. </p>

<p>Now the best thing is to try to avoid this as you work, by working more carefully and stopping to check your dimensions every now and then, but there's a good workaround and that is <em>cut your mortises first and then size the tenon to match</em>. This way you'll never end up with an undersized tenon again. And usually it's much easier to cut a tenon to match a mortise than to cut a mortise to match a tenon anyway.</p>

<p>Dovetails don't hide end grain anyway, they make a feature of it so if you don't want to see any end grain they aren't the right choice. And by the same token neither would a box joint or finger/comb joint. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could the dovetailed joints on the C&amp;B stand be replaced with doweled miter joints</p>

<p>In theory yes, but in practice perhaps not. </p>

<p>The main problem here as I see it is not the joint you propose but that it's in pine. I regularly sing the praises of softwood and remind people that it can be surprisingly strong, but use in this design could well be expecting too much of it.</p>

<p>This isn't because it's pine, but because of the specific pine you're likely intending to buy. In addition to there being numerous subspecies of pine, which vary widely in strength,  the faster you grow any softwood the weaker it is. And pine sold for building (2x material) is grown as fast as possible and is therefore often the poorest example of the species. While more utilitarian furniture designs built using it can be plenty strong, once you get into more experimental territory like this you're really pushing what the wood is capable of, both in terms of strength and in stability*.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and maybe route shallow grooves in the horizontal boards for the vertical supports to fit in</p>

<p>Yes, do that. Regardless of what wood you used it would be a good idea. Housing the uprights like this will add a significant amount of stiffness to the overall structure, far more than you may realise.</p>

<hr>

<p>*In addition to its innate weakness it is often not dried well (both too quickly and not taken down far enough as a rule, simply because neither are required for its intended purpose) and then on top of this it is frequently stored poorly where it's sold. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would they be equal to, or greater than, nails/screws in terms of strength?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like so many things it depends. To begin with the size of barrel nut you're comparing to is a variable, obviously the larger they are the stronger they are.</p>

<p>Nails are a good first point of comparison since screws are widely known to be stronger. But nail type and length matters (just as it does with screws) but with nails perhaps most important of all is <em>how they're driven home</em>. If you 'dovetail' or 'toenail' the nails in the strength of the connection is increased hugely compared to every nail being driven in at 90°.</p>

<p>For what you're looking to do some kind of screw-in / screw out connectors do seem the ideal choice though. And IMO no major connections in indoor furniture should be done with nails any longer, that's for rough carpentry and outdoor pieces only these days.</p>

<p>Since you're willing to do the drilling for the barrel nuts it's little extra effort to drill for the insertion of hardwood dowels instead, which can be used with conventional screws to provide essentially the same build, the same ability to be taken apart* and may actually prove stronger and more stable long-term:</p>

<p>This method is also slightly more forgiving of minor issues with alignment, if that matters!</p>

<p>If you decide to go ahead with barrel nuts you might consider locking them with Threadlock or something to keep them from loosening due to vibration. But how prone to working loose the bolts will be is down to how closely they're machined as much as the amount of movement or vibration in the piece.</p>

  <p>How can I sand an irregular edge to the same smoothness as the planed edges of my piece?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Short answer is you you don't. You can sand a live edge (UK: waney edge) if you want, but there's no reason you have to and many people want that natural surface as a contrast to the machined surfaces and edges. </p>

<p>If you need to smooth it out somewhat instead of sanding, which tends to level off high spots, the usual recommendation is to use a <em>conformable abrasive</em>, the two main choices being steel wool and nylon abrasive pads such as Scotch-Brite. </p>

<p>In either case you want to dust down thoroughly afterwards (don't be afraid to vacuum as well) but you have to pay particular attention with steel wool as the tiny flakes of steel can be harder to see in grain and other recesses before finishing, but after the finish goes on you'll spot little sparkles from any you missed without any difficulty! Additionally over time they can rust and discolour the surrounding wood due to a reaction between iron and tannins that may be present in the wood.</p>

"What are some guidelines to consider when determining the thickness of boards to use?","377","","<p>Assuming one has the necessary tools to mill their own boards, what are some guidelines to consider when determining the thickness of boards to use in the various parts of a project?</p>

<p>For some context, my wife has asked me to build a children's art table similar to this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/dce07b8c-920a/k2-_57f7c31f-8723-43d4-adf3-6308d23c1503.v1.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">Art Table http://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/dce07b8c-920a/k2-_57f7c31f-8723-43d4-adf3-6308d23c1503.v1.jpg</a></p>

<p>Now I can probably guess at the various thicknesses used here from the picture, but I'm more interested in how I would arrive at this on my own.  At what point would I need to use 3/4"" boards over 1/2"" boards, etc.  My initial plan was to use a combination of Baltic birch plywood and maple.</p>

<p>If it helps answer the question, assume that cost and weight are factors but so is longevity. </p>
","<p>The <a href=""http://www.woodbin.com/calcs/sagulator.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Sagulator</a> is a good quick calculator you can use to work out the type and thickness of material for any shelf or tabletop spans. It also factors the type of material into the load-bearing capacity.  Consider the maximum weight any load-bearing horizontal member is likely to hold, and confirm that your design will be able to hold that much without too much deflection.</p>

<p>Also consider static loads (e.g., putting a heavy box on a shelf and leaving it there) vs. dynamic loads such as people dropping things on top of the structure, leaning on it, jumping on it, etc. Static loads can warp a shelf or table over time, as you probably know if you've ever stored heavy books on a particle board bookshelf. But on the other hand, dynamic loads can involve someone plopping heavily into a chair, in which case you need to be able to support significantly more than just the weight of the person--like when you first step onto a bathroom scale and the reading zooms way past your weight before settling on your actual weight.</p>

<p>The tried and true method is to look at other pieces similar to those you want to build, and use those measurements as the starting point for your own piece. Aprons and other reinforcements can add a lot of strength. You can always beef up load-bearing components, but also remember to consider the relative sturdiness of the materials you're using vs. the materials someone else used. You can plug both materials into the Sagulator to see how they compare, given the same dimensions.</p>

<p>I don't want them coming crashing down on our head while swinging. Note that this is a pentagon and the beams will form a horizontal pentagon.</p>

<hr>

<p>(note that I posted an answer below how I ended up solving it)</p>
","<p>There are many ways this could be done, including multiple pure framing/joinery options some of which wouldn't even require any metal fasteners. These kinds of all-wood joints are best done by pros though since even though this would now fall under ""rough carpentry"" the fit would have to be at a level far in excess of what's normal for that, approaching that of cabinet work with tolerances well under 1/64"" ideally.</p>

<p>A more modern joinery option that first occurred to me is to cut off the ends of the five beams at the correct angle (72°) and then form half-laps on each of them so that they can interlock. The ends would look somewhat like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FdGUM.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FdGUM.png"" alt=""Half-lap ends""></a></p>

<p><sup>Source: <a href=""https://hexabana.wordpress.com/tag/half-lap-joint/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hexabana</a></sup></p>

<p>Then drill vertically through the joint and into the top of the post for a bolt which will tie the structure together. </p>

<p>I'd be tempted to just used metal reinforcement plates myself though, with plenty of screws, or bolts for maximum security. Much faster and possibly more secure at the end of the day. If you use a basic T-shaped connector on the inside angles for example these can be easily bent to suit the interior angle. For the outside a basic steel band can be used, again custom bent to fit. </p>

<p>Regardless of the main joining option used some diagonal bracing I think is a must-do, although joining a pentagonal structure to square-section beams at each corner will require some tricky fitting work.</p>

","<p>Not all steel is quench hardening. I do not know that HSS or High Speed Steel (common wood tools) is easily hardened by this method. Typically, the cobalt and vanadium content makes this difficult. It can be done, but only by a controlled heating between 1260-1280°C, controlling the quench (or thoroughness of the heating) and then rapidly cooling, usually in oil. The difficulty in this, is without a controlled induction unit, you end up heating the ENTIRE tool, which would make it brittle and unusable.</p>

<p>If you are going to do this, I would consult someone with at least some blacksmithing skills, and definitely do not use any prized or favorite tools.</p>

<p>Yes 2"" would be more than sufficient. You can install dogs in vice linings much thinner than this but for the style of face vice you're making thick chops are usual.</p>

Since you are going with hardwood you should give thought to lining the chop with leather to help prevent marring of workpieces in softer woods. </p>

<p>Leather linings substantially increase grip at more modest clamping pressures anyway, reducing wear and tear on the mechanism. Not a big deal here but an important consideration with cheaper modern all-metal vices that aren't made as robustly as their vintage counterparts.</p>

"Follow up, camber extendable table with the rack and pinion","373","","<p>In <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3040/what-is-a-camber-exactly"">my last question</a> of camber I was in the dark.<br>
Through WW.SE I got good answers, now I know what it is, and why it's needed in extendable tables. </p>

<p>Now my question: is it necessary to put camber on the slide of an extendable table to compensate for eventual sagging when the table is extended to its utmost?</p>
","<p>Table slides are those pieces of wood that join the two halves of a table and support the leaves.  The bigger the opening the more pieces necessary for each slide (Normally two slides per table, each made of two to several pieces of wood that mate in dovetail slots and rails.)  The slide set shown here employs rack and pinion mechanisms to assure that the slides move equal distances when the table is pulled apart.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tFd5O.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tFd5O.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
<a href=""http://www.boisouvreswaterville.com/table-slides"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a></p>

<p>Any table with leaves is going to sag.  </p>

<p>The problem to be solved is how to minimize the sag or how to make the table top level while the slides are sagging.  One way to achieve this would be slip well placed shims between the bottom of leaves and the sliders such that the entire table top becomes level.  Obviously, this is impractical.</p>

<p>Enter camber. </p>

<p>In this solution the slots in the sliders are slightly angled so that as the two halves of the table are pulled apart the center rises, negating the sag and creating a sort of stepped camber. I think that I have heard of the slots and rails being slight curved, also, but that sound exceedingly tricky.</p>

<p>The need for camber depends on your tolerance for sagging.  If I were making such a table, cambered slides would be near the top of my list for desired features.</p>

<p>If you are going to make a table with leaves you are likely to be well-advised to look at the commercially available slides (Google ""wood table slides"".) They are available with and without camber.</p>

<p>The above discussion applies to four legged tables. It is interesting to note that camber is also applied to pedestal tables where the natural sag occurs at the ends and camber is introduced in the slides so that as the table halves are separated the center goes down.</p>

<p>In the past where gaps were filled they used various methods, including the same way gaps were dealt with on ship decks, using oakum and tar (!), as well as with melted wax or wax/resin compositions (also used as a filler material for furniture in this era).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes those are both definitely factors. Of these two the amount of setup required to get the most from the plane — or to use the older term, <em>fettling</em> — is far and away the more significant factor. </p>

<p><strong>Steel quality</strong><br>
This is actually a little overplayed, starting with the manufacturer's own claims (which we should automatically be a little wary of just on general principles). It's actually not quite as clear-cut as they make out that one of the modern alloy steels (e.g. A2) makes a cutting iron superior to the traditional high-carbon tool steel; while edge retention can be better there are certain trade-offs, including in peak sharpness, and for some users they're essentially overkill.</p>

<p>In addition to the steel itself, the greater thickness of most modern cutting irons is often cited as a key advantage, preventing chatter. But hundreds of thousands of users of traditional thinner-bladed planes — both historically and today — show that chatter is not an inherent problem with planes that have thinner cutting irons, as long as other aspects of the plane's setup are all working together properly. So don't believe the ""Thicker irons are better."" hype!</p>

<p><strong>Fettling</strong>
<strong>High end:</strong> with a quality expensive plane you should expect to have to do virtually no fettling for the plane to work, or none at all. In fact some makers specifically highlight that their planes are ready to use straight from the box (note that this doesn't stop some users from doing one or two minor tweaks to suit their preferences).</p>

<p><strong>Cheaper end:</strong> quality at the lower end of the market is about what you would expect, with wider tolerances and an acceptance of far more defects (both in number and magnitude). </p>

<p>In general it is the quality of the iron castings that are most prone to variations, and it is on these that most fettling is done so this is a key factor. Almost all of the other metal components, in steel and brass, are machined to their final shape so far less subject to variation. They tend to be fairly uniform in being rougher, but still serviceable.</p>

<p>The body components (the main body and the frog in most cases) on virtually all planes of this type are cast iron cast in sand moulds, with machining work in only a few key places and on the cheaper planes all of the as-cast surfaces are prone to significant variation: surface blobs, overall rougher texture and indifferent painting should all be expected.</p>

<p>Note: because there is so much variation in cheaper planes it means that some are much better while some are poor or very poor (these ones tend to get the most press from dissatisfied buyers, colouring the view on planes of this level as being not fit for purpose). So there is an element of luck in how good or bad the one you get actually is. This doesn't mean the less-good ones are all not worth getting, but unquestionably <em>the worst ones are not worth the effort to try to get working well</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Mechanism</strong><br>
Planes which are clones of the Stanley/Bailey design tend to inherently have some 'slop' or 'backlash' in their adjustment mechanism, simply a by-product of the 19th-century mechanics. This is definitely more pronounced in lower-end planes than in high-end ones however.</p>

<p>It should be emphasised that this doesn't in any way make cheaper planes unusable, or in fact significantly harder to use. It just takes a little longer to make adjustments — a few more <em>seconds</em> in some cases — and those adjustments can be as precise and can be held just as well. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But what if we replaced the blade in the cheap plane with the same high quality blade and a skilled worker tuned both planes? Is it just ergonomics &amp; looks after that, or are there other qualities which set apart high quality (or even mid quality?) planes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it would mostly come down to these, yes. In some cases it is aesthetics that are the key difference, in others there are major ergonomic problems*, with the shape of the tote (rear handle) in particular coming in for criticism, but the front knob as well. In addition to their shapes, the material these are made from: not a quality hardwood with a nice finish but an inexpensive plastic casting. </p>

<p>My personal observation on the plastic handles is that despite their obviously cheap appearance they can be comfortable to use, so if you can get past their looks they may actually be surprisingly user-friendly. And it is worth noting that a few of the cheaper planes do still feature wooden handles.</p>

<hr>

<p>*I think I should highlight here that there's a <em>significant</em> amount of subjectivity when it comes to handles amongst tool users. Some people are pathologically opposed to plastic so regardless of their shape a plane with plastic handles would not meet with their approval, others are very particular about the shape of a tote... often it is this: if not almost exactly like the Stanleys they trained on they're bad, by definition! This is one of those areas where your own preferences have to trump everything else.</p>

<p>Yes that would reinforce the joints hugely. Even with a hammer you wouldn't be able to take the joint apart without breaking the wood.</p>

<p>But there are a couple of better ways of doing this.</p>

<p>The main weakness of the pedestal as shown is the exposed end grain. This is both aesthetically less pleasing and potentially a weakness depending on what the pedestal is for (not really a problem for indoors though). So it's better to use a mitre joint of some kind:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tpPop.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tpPop.jpg"" alt=""Quadrilinear leg sections""></a></p>

<p>The above image is for what's called a quadrilinear leg (intended to show quarter-sawn figure on all four faces) but obviously the same joints can be spaced apart to produce a post such as you're making.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the best of these, the lock-mitre joint at the right, requires a specialist router bit sized to the thickness of stock you're using. </p>

<p>All aspects are noteworthy in different ways, but at the end of the day, just a few features (as marked in bold above) will narrow your options dramatically.</p>

<p>Many models with straight knives can be upgraded with a spiral or helical cutterhead.  Typically knives are HSS (high speed steel) and require periodic sharpening. Segmented cutter inserts are usually carbide, last longer, and are either 2- or 4-sided, allowing you to rotate individual cutters as they become nicked or dull.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a big difference between the ""portable"" or ""benchtop""
  planers as compared to the big floor-standing models (I now know there

</blockquote>

<p>The main difference is that stationary planers are more heavy-duty, often run quieter, and can remove more material in one pass (1/8"", vs. 1/16"" for a lunchbox planer).</p>

<p>Segmented cutterheads are not as common on lunchbox planers, and installing an aftermarket segmented cutterhead on a lunchbox planer is not necessarily advisable since the segmented cutterhead forces the motor to work harder (because the cutters are constantly in contact with the material).  Also a lunchbox planer's cutterhead has a smaller diameter so the cutters perform a more severe scooping motion against the material, as opposed to a stationary machine with a larger-diameter cutterhead.</p>

<p>Yes, you can use a planer to do face jointing, but a table saw would be better for edge jointing unless ganging up many pieces.

"How can I give a circular saw blade a flat top grind?","362","","<p><a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1236/non-angled-tablesaw-blade"">This question's</a> answers suggest buying a table saw blade with a flat top grind (FTG). I haven't seen any of these locally, and I happen to have at least one dull carbide-tipped, alternating angled tooth blade, so how can I re-grind this blade to have flat topped teeth?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I happen to have at least one dull carbide-tipped, alternating angled tooth blade</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I doubt that it's even possible to create a FTG blade from a ATB blade. You might be able to flatten the tops of the beveled teeth somewhat, so that they're still beveled but leave a flat bottomed kerf, but you'd have to remove a lot of material to do it. Since silicon carbide is among the hardest of materials (it's a 9.5 on the Mohs scale, where diamond is a 10), removing a lot of material isn't going to be easy. Your best bet, if you really want to do it, would be to send it out to a saw blade sharpening service that can do the job right.</p>

<p>I think the right solution, though, is to send your ATB blade out for resharpening as an ATB blade, and buy a blade that was designed to be FTG from the start. Amazon carries FTG blades with prices as low as $16, so it's hard to see much point in paying someone to convert an old blade to FTG and getting a mediocre (at best) substitute for the real thing.</p>

<p>Another good option is to use one of the blades from a stacked dado set. Stacked dado set blades are always flat ground because they're meant to produce flat-bottomed dadoes, and there's no rule that says that you can't use just one of the blades. Choose one of the outer blades, as the outer blades generally have more teeth than the inner ""chipper"" blades.</p>

Think roofing and home exterior finish work... they are used to attach the aluminum trim used to surround the roof, or on a home with aluminum siding with trim around windows.

  <p>Is spruce wood a good choice ? Or maybe I should choose a stronger one ? </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Wood species</strong><br>
Spruce is one of the strongest woods in the world for its weight. Beds of a similar design to yours have been made from other softwoods, including pine and fir, which are not nearly as strong, so I think spruce is a fine choice and you're lucky you have a source of it.</p>

<p>If you wanted to go with a stronger wood you would be looking at a hardwood, e.g. oak, which would be significantly heavier and very likely <em>much</em> more expensive.</p>

<p><strong>Dimensions</strong><br>
In addition to the inherent strength of the species of wood you use, the size and thickness of the pieces you use is very important. I think you've chosen material that is the right size for each component so nothing to worry about there. </p>

<p><strong>Stock selection</strong><br>
One additional factor to bear in mind is the presence of knots in the wood. Small knots, relatively far apart are not a big problem but a very large knot in the centre of a piece can weaken the wood there significantly. </p>

<p>When buying the wood, if possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>select pieces with straight, uniform grain;</li>
<li>don't buy boards with many knots (where you have to buy knotty boards the knots should be small and ideally not numerous);</li>
<li>prefer boards where the growth rings are close together, not wider apart;</li>
<li>don't buy any boards that are bent or twisted.</li>

<p>Thinner and thicker boards expand equally pretty much, for any given type of board (rift, QS or flat-sawn). The issue with this isn't differential movement, it's movement period.</p>

<p>Let me pass on verbatim a piece of advice from a pro that I read a couple of years back:<br>
<em>resist the urge to picture-frame a tabletop</em>.</p>

<p>There's nearly no way to get this to work properly with the glued-up centre panel. You could just about get away with it using the right wood (QS mesquite being a rare example) but with most other woods you're asking for trouble and both oak and mahogany (all types) are no exception.</p>

<p>At maximum expansion the central boards will have no problem at all breaking apart two or more of the mitre joints, even if they're reinforced with biscuits, splines or Dominos. </p>

<p>If you managed to secure the mitres somehow so that they couldn't be broken open (e.g. by using metal fixings) the central panel will be put under enormous strain when it tries to expand but can't, and the result then is warping and/or cracking.</p>

<p><strong>Getting the look without the drama</strong><br>
Probably the best way to do this is using plywood or another board material for the central panel, with veneer applied if necessary.</p>

<p>Am I guessing right? Or is the ash really spongy like this and not suitable for bowls? Or have I overlooked something. Sorry I'm only starting with bowl carving...</p>

<p>This makes sense since beech is close-grained.  I would imagine that maple and cherry would make a good kuksa for the same reason.  Red oak would not.  Black walnut has some chemicals that I might not want dissolved in my tea (and its grain is a little open too).</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>No finish will keep wood from expanding and contracting over time</strong>.  It's in wood's nature to do that, and there's nothing you can do to prevent it.  Also, tung oil isn't all that great at sealing moisture to begin with.</p>

<p>Instead, what you must do is design the piece of furniture with this limitation in mind.  One of the most critical things is to use wood that has reached its equilibrium moisture content (EMC) with the area the piece of furniture will be kept.  In other words, don't use wood that's wetter than the air where you expect to keep it.  An easy way to do this is to keep the wood in that room for a couple months and let it acclimate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Preventing these things is especially important as I am trying to create a tight fit between the upper leg shaft and the lower leg.</p>

<p>If I'm reading the Instructables link right, he uses a linear actuator to raise and lower the desktop.  Thus, having the perfect fit between the inner and outer legs isn't particularly critical so long as they don't bind or have excessive play.  With the dimensions you'd be working with and they way the legs are fastened together, I wouldn't worry about it so long as you make them properly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, do I need to pre-seal the maple wood somehow before I even assemble it? If so, then what is the best method to do this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would say that you don't have to pre-finish before assembly, though that does make things easier down the line sometimes.  For example, if you're <a href=""http://lumberjocks.com/topics/39985"">making door panels</a>, finishing the panels before installing them in the rails and stiles is a good idea.</p>

<p>The method for doing this just involves applying the finish to the piece, letting it dry, and then protecting the finish during assembly.  Masking/packaging tape is a good thing to use for spots where glue might squeeze out or you have to stain an adjacent piece.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, on the outer part of the inner leg (see project link below) it was suggested by the same person that I put a wax or waxy layer on the shaft to ensure smooth leg operation. Would you agree? And if so then what would you recommend for this?</p>

<p>Paste wax is one of my favorites for things like this.  It gives a decent finish and is pretty inexpensive.  Parrafin wax might be a good choice too.</p>

"What type of blades should I use for machining MDF?","338","","<p>I need to machine a 10x10mm chamfer along the edges of a large quantity of MDF (medium density fibreboard) boards, on an ongoing basis. </p>

<p>Previously I've been using standard tool-steel blades for this on a spindle moulder and have noticed that the blades dull and become too blunt to use effectively very quickly - much more quickly than when using the cutters on hardwood. Generally these cutters will run something like 100 linear metres of a 10x10mm chamfer before they're useless and have to be replaced or resharpened.</p>

<p>Is there a better blade material to use for this? I seem to remember I've read that tungsten carbide blades are not great to use on MDF for some reason? Are diamond tipped blades better / more cost-effective in the long run for this purpose?</p>

<p>(Also before anybody mentions that you're not supposed to use power tools on MDF, I have the proper extraction setup etc. to deal with the hazardous MDF dust/fumes.)</p>
","<p>MDF is tough on blades, since it's basically sawdust and glue. You may want to consider trying a blade specifically designed for cutting laminate flooring, since the majority of the material in laminate is usually MDF.</p>

<p>Table saw blades designed for this purpose are usually polycrystalline diamond tipped, and have a surprisingly low tooth count (~12-16 for a 10"" blade!), but still produce a smooth cut. A bit of Googling yielded PCD router bits that are designed specifically for use on MDF, but I'm not sure if a similar blade is available for a spindle moulder/wood shaper though.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, the diamond tipped blades and cutters will be pretty expensive, but if this is something you'll be doing often, it should pay off in the long run. Otherwise if it's a one time project, you may just want to buy a cheaper blade you can throw away afterwards.</p>

<p>I've seen a linseed oil finish on bare wood, and after 10 or 15 thin coats, allowing each coat to dry, the wood ends up with a glossy finish. Would it still be possible to get that kind of finish after spraypainting?</p>
","<p>No you don't want to do that. Linseed oil is not a suitable final finish over paint as it doesn't form a hard, durable film. It's only good when it soaks directly into the wood so that it isn't sitting on the surface but is within the wood fibres. </p>

<p>Your best choices to protect paintwork are a varnish or lacquer, both of which are intended to make durable surface films. </p>

<p>The easiest option here would probably be a waterbased polyurethane varnish, I think this should bond well enough to a very lightly sprayed wood surface however I'm not certain so it would be advisable to do a test piece or two to check. </p>

<p>If you would prefer to go with a lacquer (many spraycan clear finishes) you'll need to test for compatibility with the paint you're using as many spray finishes can interact with paints that they were not intended to go over. If there is a clear finish in the same range as the paint you're using that shouldn't be a problem.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It shouldn't require 10-15 coats to get a glossy finish, that's just masochism ^_^ Using linseed oil you should start to get a decent sheen at about the third or fourth coat (if you don't you're not doing it right) and it's about as good as you can reasonably expect after about 6-8 coats. That number of coats already requires a little more than a week, who wants to be finishing something for longer than two weeks? </p>

<p>If a gloss level higher than this is needed then the piece should really be varnished because as few as three coats can give you a really good shine and this may take as little as a day and a half in suitable conditions. With the added advantage that varnish also produces a surface that's about ten times more resistant to scratches and water!</p>

","<p>Your idea seems good at first, but I'm not sure it's the best idea long-term.

Keep in mind that any part that's attached to the tree will also incidentally pull on parts of the tree that are attached to other parts of the treehouse. I would try to avoid attaching to any smaller limbs, and try to limit your attachment points to the trunk and perhaps a couple very large limbs that don't sway very much in the wind.</p>

<p>On the flipside, if your brackets don't damage the tree, they could restrict the tree's growth.

","<blockquote>
  <p>Is it safe to ""bake"" these in an oven? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really, no. You wouldn't be the first person to try this and you might get away with it as some have in the past, but if it doesn't work as hoped it could lead to the only option being a complete strip and re-finish.</p>

<p>There is a potential health risk involved in doing this in the oven you cook in, but to focus on the woodwork you can't reliably do this in an oven with a minimum temperature of 170°F (77°C). </p>

<p>Warm is good, but that's a bit hot for safety. And in addition you can't be sure how hot the oven will get because most ovens don't hold at the set temperature the way we think — ""hold"" in this case being a misnomer since ovens don't do that at all. Instead they cycle on and off to <em>approximate</em> the set temperature. Additionally the thermostats of ovens are infamous among cooks for being off (reportedly by as much as 50°F!) which with wood is all kinds of bad as the water in it will turn to steam and bubble through your finish. I've seen it happen and it ain't pretty!   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or, could I place an electric space heater in the same vicinity as the items?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much better option. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What can I do to speed the drying of these items? </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Increase air flow (to begin with to take away the evaporative portion of the varnish, after that oxygen is needed for the curing process to progress).</p></li>
<li><p>Increase temperature (both reactions proceed more quickly at higher temperatures).</p></li>
<li><p>Decrease humidity (water vapour can retard varnish drying and curing).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously that last one shouldn't be an issue for you.</p>

<p>As for the first one, in reality normal rates of air exchange for typical domestic interiors are enough for reliable varnish drying so the main thing to focus on is increasing the temperature. There is such a massive difference in varnish drying with only a 10° change in temperature just giving it a little boost should make a world of difference.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(I will wrap them individually in bubble wrap or similar when packed for shipping).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is the least tackiness still remaining it would be advisable not to put the bubble wrap directly in contact with the varnish. Instead cover the pieces in a smooth plastic (black refuse bags can work well) and then wrap in bubble wrap.</p>

<p><strong>For next time</strong><br>
I can highly recommend thinning your varnish with between 25 and 50% additional spirits, turning it into 'wiping varnish'. This can be wiped on as the name suggests, or applied by brush or roller if preferred. Regardless of the application tool you then wipe away some or most of the excess. This builds a shiny finish much more slowly, but each coat is very much thinner so dries far more quickly and reliably than when the varnish is used at full strength.</p>

"6"" or 8"" bench grinder","331","","<p>I am looking to sharpen drill bits, wood turning tools and what ever else you would sharpen in the wood shop. I am told that a 6"" is okay but should really get a 8"". I am looking at Ryobi brand bench grinders. How long would the big one last to the small on? Is there better sharpening quality on the bigger than smaller since there is a smaller radius in the angle. I like the 8"". </p>
","<p>This is unfortunately one of those things where there'll be many differences of opinion, for some people it's 8"" all the way and things smaller are nearly toys. But for tool sharpening and the occasional metalwork shaping job 6"" is most definitely adequate. In fact for a lot of leisure woodworkers even smaller than this is perfectly usable, just somewhat slower. </p>

<p>It's worth remembering that as far as sharpening goes grinding is only necessary every now and then unless you're a woodturner. For bench chisels, plane irons and anything else you might run over a grinder's wheel to shape the edge, grinding is not a daily, weekly or even monthly task for the majority of users. It may not even be necessary once a year given the slow rate of wear for the typical woodworker!</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Some people argue that there is, but in most cases it makes no practical difference in the edge produced.</p>

<p>Larger grinders are generally more powerful (which is good for a couple of reasons) and can often be faster as well, and while there's a perception that this is a Good Thing too, it often isn't in sharpening. With just about any grinder we already have to take pains not to overheat the tips of chisels when shaping them (sometimes called 'blueing' because the steel turns blue when it has overheated). As should be obvious the faster the grinder the more care you have to exercise, generally speaking. </p>

<p>In addition to the outright speed of a grinder another reason an 8"" needs to be used more carefully than a 6"" because for any given speed the surface of an 8"" wheel is actually moving much faster — so <em>at the same RPM</em> an 8"" grinder is more likely to overheat a tool than a smaller one, everything else being equal. </p>

<p>It's beyond the scope of this Answer but you should also look into the various wheel types available, how fast and how cool they cut can vary quite a lot (but not uniformly, CBN wheels are generally the best of both worlds but you do pay for the privilege).</p>

<p><strong>Closing note:</strong> also remember that you don't absolutely <em>need</em> a grinder. They are very handy, but as far as care and maintenance of woodworking tools goes you can quite happily do without one, as was fairly common until quite recently. </p>

I am thinking the pieces would be big as a piece of firewood.  I guess it could be a little bigger.  I don't know.  I was just kind of intrigued by the whole resawing thing.</p>
","<p>The limit in size you can resaw width and height-wise is established by what size wood can fit through the exposed blade area of the bandsaw, so measure the distance between the blade and the support column that holds the upper blade wheel and the length of the exposed blade and you have your maximums.  Length-wise, of course you can go on forever, provided you can support the wood in order to feed it through the blade.</p>

<p>Proper support becomes more challenging as the board/log becomes larger.  The wood must pass through the blade without twisting.  You are trying to cut bread slices from a loaf and any twist in the slice will result in a more difficult milling job with a the jointer and planer including much greater waste.  Twist is also very hard on the blade and can easily cause binding and breaking of the blade due to the increased tension it provides.</p>

<p>When I resaw previously rough sawn lumber I can support it using portable roller stands before and after the table.  For log type resawing work I have rigged up a long roller feed that replaces the bandsaw table and has a mounting sled so that the log can be securely anchored to avoid any rolling to the side as the log is fed through the blade.</p>

<p>As for power, my bandsaw has 12"" of exposed blade and 14"" side clearance to the column, is 1 HP and does fine with hardwood logs up to 12"" high, although the feed rate is very slow (I'd guess approx. 1/8 to 1/4"" in 10 seconds).  </p>

<p>That certainly used to be a worthwhile general shopping guide, one that is repeated in many early woodworking books that I've read (the same principle is repeated outside of woodworking circles too of course).</p>

<p>But to be honest I'm not sure it has ever been universally true. And it's absolutely not the case today that high price guarantees quality, or that low price automatically means you're buying a mediocre or outright poor tool.  </p>

<p>Many of the bigger name brands are not the same company that they were, and their name (and the consequent higher/high price commanded by their tools) are <em>not in any way</em> an assurance of high quality. Perhaps the best example of this in the broader woodworking scene is Stanley; the current company has for all intents and purposes zero relationship to the Stanley of old, except that they own the name. Even by the latter part of the 20th century Stanley's standards had slipped noticeably, and now much of their product line is considered from mediocre to outright junk, depending on whose opinion you're listening to.</p>

<p>A great illustration of the potential for high quality at a low price (note: low, not low<strong>er</strong>) are the bevel-edge chisels sold by Aldi. Their reputation has spread online due in no small part to Paul Sellers in the UK plugging them so consistently. And he's right to, as I think they still are the cheapest chisels on the UK market while still being full size, and featuring hardwood handles and not moulded plastic. Their qualities, as judged by many experienced woodworkers including Sellers, are right up there with some competitors that cost upwards of five times more. </p>

<p>The simple fact of the matter is that this is an opinion and you can be assured that anyone who says that everything made in China is junk, or should be avoided on principle, is ill-informed and outright wrong. The Aldi chisels mentioned just above? They are of course made in China. </p>

<p>What's particularly sad about this is many of the tools that these same people buy, from some name brands they trust, <em>are now also made in China</em>. Which highlights how foolish it is to make that kind of sweeping condemnation. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They both seem to be made of high speed steel (which I'm told is important and what I want). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is important but it's not necessarily what you want. HSS could almost be considered obsolete for turning tools (almost) because carbide-tipped tools are now on the market, offering far longer service life — reducing the <em>constant</em> need to re-sharpen that has dogged turners since, well, forever.</p>

<p>The sharpening of turning tools shouldn't be downplayed: in turning you may sometimes have to sharpen multiple times before the shaping of a single project is completed. So a grinder should be factored in as not just a desirable additional purchase, but almost a necessity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is one more durable? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's possible, but I wouldn't want to say in which direction TBH.</p>

<p>Note that the ""HSS"" label is just a starting point, it doesn't really guarantee anything specific. In addition to HSS being an inherently tough steel type with good hardening properties, the exact alloy used (there are a few), and the way the tool was formed in the factory are critical factors. </p>

<p>It's much the same as with basic high-carbon tool steel, as used pretty universally 100 years ago for all sorts of cutting tools; it didn't mean that all chisels or plane irons produced at the time were of equal quality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is handle shape/material of any importance? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and yes, but personal preferences are very important here. </p>

<p>Many turners make it a point to turn their own tool handles to suit their individual tastes on the ideal handle shape (often going for a much long handle for example), and will go so far as to immediately replace the handles on expensive chisels they just bought. </p>

<p>Re. material, once you pass a certain strength the type of hardwood doesn't appear to matter that much. It would seem from practical experience that material properties like vibration dampening (a traditional reason that ash was favoured) aren't as critical as was/is supposed, given than many people are very happy with handles made from maple, rosewood, even ebony, none of which share this characteristic. These days plastics and even the occasional metal handle are seen, which again argues strongly that material qualities are not a critical factor except in terms of what the user likes or doesn't like.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>which kind of wood could be good for this kind of work </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have the choice you want a close-grained, hard wood for this sort of thing. Normally that will mean a hardwood, although yew (a softwood) would also fit the bill. </p>

<p>There are many decent possibilities depending on where you're located. Going over my memory of commercial puzzles I've seen in the past, numerous Asian-made ones I think used sheesham. More recently I think I've seen some made from rubber wood, which is neither as hard nor as close-grained but adequate nonetheless. </p>

<p>If you're in North America maple would probably be ideal, being easy to come by there and not particularly pricey. Some maples are softer than others, hard maple (sugar maple, rock maple) will be tougher as the name suggests, and although this makes it harder to work it may be worth it in the end product.</p>

<p>Beech would also be excellent if you can find it and birch might work as well. Although it's classed as open-grained I have seen 'executive' puzzles made from black walnut which indicate it can be suitable, and walnut is prized for it workability by woodworkers (being only a little harder than cherry). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>which finish guarantees a good user experience (e.g. pieces slide smoothly).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you could get away with many things on something like this, including leaving the wood bare. I'm sure I've handled puzzles in the past which were bare wood.</p>

<p>Commercially I think most puzzles probably have a spray finish applied, which could be either varnish or lacquer. And with modern finishing moving away from high-VOC products it's likely that some are now finished with a waterbased finish or some kind.</p>

<p>My personal choice here would probably be a light coating of shellac, two or three thin coats brushed on. This would not be enough to build up much of a film on the surface but will partially seal it, enough that it won't easily get grubby from handling and slightly reduce any tendency for the pieces to expand/contract or warp with changes in humidity.</p>

<hr>

<p>You haven't asked about shaping the pieces, but if high accuracy is important to the functioning of the completed puzzle then I'd give serious thought to cutting the internal notches by hand as though they were mortises. Or alternatively buying a suitable mortising bit for a drill and using it to do the same job.</p>

<p>If you do use a scroll saw you're surely going to need to smooth the sawn faces. For that I would highly recommend filing over sanding. If you don't have any files then glue abrasive paper to strips of hard wood so that it can be used in a similar manner to a file.</p>

<p>For sanding the external surfaces bring the wood to the paper and not the paper to the wood. Small pieces are nearly always best sanded this way, with the paper flat on the table (taped down taut or glued in place on a scrap board) and the pieces rubbed over it, rather than attempting to hold the workpiece in one hand and a sanding block in the other and rubbing them together!</p>

<p>You only need to sand up to between 180 and 220 grit.</p>

"Finishing with Arm-R-Seal After Oil and Wax","322","","<p>I am working on a couple of end tables, and am really new to woodworking. Thus far, I've worked on cutting boards and finished with a combination of walnut oil/beeswax for a food safe finish. For the end tables, I went ahead and applied one coat of oil/beeswax then started researching how to prevent water stains. It seems like Arm-R-Seal in satin is a really popular choice. </p>

<p>Can Arm-R-Seal be applied over the top of a single coat of oil/wax?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Can Arm-R-Seal be applied over the top of a single coat of oil/wax?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As it stands, no, but with surface prep yes. </p>

<p>There's a rule in finishing, nothing goes over wax but wax. Wax is a resist, nothing will stick to it properly but more wax. </p>

<p>Now obviously you've used an oil/wax blend which isn't just wax, but there's still wax in there and it will affect adhesion of a varnish topcoat.</p>

<p>The ideal fix here would be to skim off the surface of the side tables, just removing a few thou should be enough to get below the treated wood fibres (penetration of all finishes is surprisingly shallow in nearly all woods, except on end grain). This can be done by sanding, scraping or planing, or a combination, whichever process(es) you prefer.</p>

<p>It's probably a good idea to then clean the freshly surfaced wood down with solvent to remove any last traces of the existing finish that may remain, unless you go deep enough that you're sure you've exposed pristine wood. If you want to do the solvent thing start with a few wipes of mineral spirits then finish up with something stronger like acetone or lacquer thinner.</p>

<p>You might possibly get away with just thoroughly cleaning the surface with the solvents, but I wouldn't be inclined to rely on this alone myself and it would require copious amounts of solvent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>prevent water stains</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another way of looking at this: do your end tables actually need protection from water? </p>

<p>If they're to be used regularly for holding drinks then a polyurethane varnish is a great choice as a topcoat, but if they aren't then the oil/wax blend you've used already is a perfectly acceptable finish for them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Arm-R-Seal in satin is a really popular choice</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally I would recommend you get gloss varnish, thin it to wiping consistency and then wipe it on. You'll naturally get a satin finish this way, with a gloss finish available for any future project without a subsequent purchase being necessary. </p>

<hr>

<p>Just wanted to add a couple of bits on this in case it's of use or interest. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus far, I've worked on cutting boards and finished with a combination of walnut oil/beeswax for a food safe finish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, note that most cutting boards don't actually need to be finished in any way to withstand use and regular washing. Finishing is nearly entirely done for looks, not because boards actually need it to prevent them falling apart, cracking, etc.</p>

<p>Now about ""food-safe"" finishing, there's masses of humming and hawing about this online but virtually all wood finishes are broadly considered food-safe by regulatory agencies worldwide <em>once fully cured</em>. This includes varnishes and lacquers. </p>

<p>While neither of them seem at first glance to be suitable finishes for a cutting board (because you don't want an actual film on the surface which can be cut and start to chip, possibly ending up in the food*) if thinned heavily they will soak into the wood. </p>

<p>*Even if you did build a film and it did chip and some got ingested this is still no big deal — film finishes are passed for use on children's toys, that's how safe they are once fully hardened.</p>

"Finishing an indoors pine table","320","","<p>I've made a table of pine, it's natural and sanded and all that nice stuff. I've never finished a table, so I'm not sure what I should be using. My constraints are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should be completely transparent</li>
<li>Should be silky (as opposed to shiny - not sure what the exact term in English is)</li>
<li>Shouldn't take a month to cure/dry</li>
<li>Resistant to heat/wetness/stains as it's gonna be a dining table</li>
</ul>

<p>What type of product should I be using to satisfy all points?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Should be completely transparent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All standard finishes are transparent, but some are not without a little colour, or ""water white"" as it's usually referred to.</p>

<p>If you don't mind that it imparts a noticeable yellow/amber tone to the wood (which will increase slowly over time) then an oil-based polyurethane is a good choice here. This is the finish you can use that is toughest and most waterproof, as well as easiest to apply, for those who don't have access to spray equipment. </p>

<p>But if you'd prefer to keep the wood as close in colour to the way it is now then I'd go with a waterbased polyurethane finish. Waterbased polys are one of the classic water-white finishes and some are greatly improved over the versions available earlier one, when they were pretty <em>meh</em>.</p>

<p>Do note though that pine itself will darken slightly and go more yellow naturally with exposure to light, so the colour of the table will slowly alter over time. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should be silky (as opposed to shiny - not sure what the exact term in English is)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can say less glossy, or more matt (American: matte). </p>

<p>Semi-gloss, satin and matt/matte finishes are what you want as each of them is less than fully glossy. Sorry can't help with what each of those might be referred to in your language, even the direct translations of these words may not be of any help because the terminology is very varied*.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shouldn't take a month to cure/dry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both oil-based poly and waterbased polyurethane finishes take far longer than their drying time to fully cure. However that doesn't mean the table can't be used before then, just that the finish is not at maximum strength.</p>

<p>With oil-based polyurethane approximately a week to ten days after the last coat goes on the finish should be tough enough for light use, but baby it for the first month. </p>

<p>With waterbased polyurethane finishes as little as three or four days is enough to be able to use the surface, but it's still advisable to wait a week or longer before subjecting it to heavier use. With some versions it may take two full weeks for the finish to get as hard as it can get even if the drying time is less than a few hours.</p>

<p>The above are generalisations as all products are different. As well as that this is dependent on the conditions, primarily the temperature and humidity (the warmer and drier it is the faster a finish will cure usually). On top of that is coat thickness — obviously the thicker you apply a finish the more slowly it will dry and subsequently cure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Resistant to heat/wetness/stains as it's gonna be a dining table</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good versions of both oil-based polyurethane varnish and waterbased polyurethane finish will provide the level of protection you're seeking.</p>

<p>Important to be aware that the total amount of any finish that you apply to the surface determines how resistant it ends up, most noticeably to scuffs/scratches and water penetration.</p>

<p>So even a very good version of poly won't provide high levels of protection if you only wipe on a few thin layers, but will give the level of protection that it's advertised to provide with three or more full-strength coats. I think personally that it is nearly always worth applying <em>at least</em> four coats for a dining table or similar surface.</p>

<hr>

<p>*How shiny or not shiny a specific product is unfortunately varies because there is no standardisation across the industry. So regrettably you cannot assume that one company's version of Satin Polyurethane will give the same level of dullness as that of a competitor's product which you may have seen pictures of online. </p>

<p>In some cases there is a wide disparity, with one company's satin being close to gloss and another's being much more matt. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A coping saw is a type of hand saw used to cut <strong>intricate external shapes and interior cutouts</strong> in woodworking or carpentry</p>

<p>Still should have worked easier than you are describing though.

Higher tooth count would have made for a cleaner cut. Sawing works best if you let the tool do the cutting and not use force. Also keep in mind that the coping saw is a push <em>or</em> pull tool. (Depends on blade orientation of course)</p>

<p>If you were making a dollhouse I would have expected lots of straight lines and edges. While a coping saw should be capable of doing that task I would not have thought it to be the ideal tool. Regular fine tooth hand saw would work for this if you have the piece clamped and immobilized as much as possible. </p>

<p>If I was going to use power tools I would look to bandsaw first for smaller projects or a fine tooth blade on a table saw. For a hand tool approach a smaller style bow saw would work but those tools are not readily available in stores. The bow saws you find in retail stores are more for cutting branches of trees.</p>

<p>Scroll saw would have similar issues with straight lines (without a fence of some sort) unless you are really good with one (I still need more practice). </p>

<hr>

<p>I thought more about this and I wonder about the plywood quality as well. Cheaper plywoods will have the plies chip apart so they would tear more than cut. This would bind the coping saw making it harder to make fluid motions. </p>

<p>Which tool would be best to accomplish this and keep the cut reasonably straight? Using the pull saw is my first guess but the board is about 5 feet long and I worry about deviating from the line on material that's about a half an inch thick. I plan to plane down the material once it's sawed so I don't mind losing some of the waste material.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Which tool would be best to accomplish this </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of the saws you list I think the pull saw is the best choice, in fact while it's theoretically possible to do it with one or two of the others doing it with the pull saw may be the only reasonable option. </p>

<p>The Japanese routinely resaw boards by hand with their saws* and many Western woodworkers who use Asian-style saws find them good for this, better than the Western-style saws they've tried for the same operation. I should mention though, when comparing it should be done using a sharp, properly set rip saw on the Western end, and not a modern panel saw with general-purpose teeth which not infrequently is what the comparison is against.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>keep the cut reasonably straight? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of this depends on you. There are some standard techniques that can help ensure a straight cut but just as with anything involving hand tools it usually requires practice to get good results (some people have more of a knack for it than others). </p>

<p>Fundamentally it starts with careful marking out and good sawing technique. You saw slowly (letting the saw do the work and not forcing it, and deliberately not trying to saw fast), and pause often as you go so that you can spot and correct for drift when it occurs. Note these points are just as important for an experienced sawyer as for a beginner, so it's best to get into the habits early.</p>

<p>And also you shouldn't expect to saw a board through in one operation start to finish, that's nearly never done when resawing by hand. Instead expect to work in from both ends to meet up in the middle, repositioning the wood at least three or four times but frequently many more times than this. </p>

<p>Since most people tend to drift in the same direction try not to flip the board when doing this so that the drifts go in opposite directions. </p>

<p>If you do drift off your line a fair bit the sawn faces will require quite a bit of planing to get them flat so you can loose quite a bit more thickness than intended. You may want to factor this in to begin with by working to a greater thickness than eventually needed, or be flexible about the thickness of the stock you end up with. </p>

<p>I hope these help get across the importance of having your work firmly held as you saw. While using a vice for this is one of the simplest and best ways it's not the only way so anyone without a vice don't despair, you can get creative with a few clamps if that's all you have. But the work <em>must</em> be held firmly or you're setting yourself up for a world of trouble.</p>

<p>The larger triangular teeth are the rip teeth.</p>

<p><strong>Kerfing tool</strong><br>
This is <em>the</em> way to 'cheat' on the experience of doing these cuts many times so you have become very good at it. Using a kerf established around all four edges of a board is the number one way to guard against drift and a dedicated kerf-cutting tool is the best way to create those kerfs. </p>

<p>On shorter boards it's quite doable to use a marking or cutting gauge, a knife &amp; straightedge and a chisel to create a definite groove on the edges to work in from, but a properly established kerf is far better at keeping the saw on track (you still have to do your part). </p>

<p>Unfortunately it means you either have to buy a kerfing tool (or kit) or make one from scratch, but if you plan to resaw a lot by hand you may find it worth the money or effort. So far I haven't bitten the bullet and made one but it's on my to-do list as resawing any significant length is proving challenging.</p>

<p>That's correct, and in addition you could easily find it nearly impossible to withdraw the hole saw from the wood (for the same reason that it can be difficult to remove the plug from a hole saw when it is used to cut through a board).</p>

<p>Probably the ideal tool for this is a Forstner bit (or saw-tooth bit, similar to a Forstner and often mistaken for one):</p>

<p>There are two buts though, and unfortunately they're both biggies.</p>

<p>The first is a safety issue: in general Forstner bits (and bits of a similar design) are not intended to be used freehand, but instead with a drill mounted in a drill stand, or in a drill press/pillar drill. Although many people do use them freehand chucked up in their power drills this is not good practice and the manufacturers of the bits themselves will often warn against it — ""For use in a drill press only"" or words to that effect. The greater the diameter of the bit the more caution you want to take on this front, and 64mm is a <em>very</em> large bit.</p>

<p>The second is that a 60-70mm Forstner bit is fairly specialised and as such is not cheap. Expect to pay around $50 or the equivalent for a good one.</p>

The two short legs shouldn't receive much lateral stress - You can probably get away with just a mortise and tenon joint there.  If you change the orientation of the long horizontal boards, you could eliminate the middle legs all together (a 2x4 will only sag about 0.1 inches with 250 pounds directly in the middle).

","<blockquote>
  <p>I've been dealing with a problem where standard screws keep getting pulled out of a wood frame. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even with options on screws I think the first thing you should look at is <em>why</em> are your current screws pulling free? It sounds like there's an issue with one or more of the following:</p>

<p>A) the wood being too weak (in which case no screw of reasonable gauge may hold successfully)<br>
B) the load is too high for the number of fasteners (if possible increase the number to spread the load)<br>
C) the pilot holes were drilled too large</p>

<p>A and B can be linked, so a fix for A can mean that the existing number of screws will be sufficient now that they have a firmer hold.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether C was the case initially since you've already had screws pull free I think we can assume you have stripped holes, which means you have to go up a gauge or two in screw size and/or repair the existing holes before driving in new fasteners (see <strong>Loose screws</strong> in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3735/what-options-do-i-have-to-repair-this-chair/3737#3737"">this previous Answer</a>). </p>

<p>If your wood doesn't have the strength to support conventional wood screws then one of the fixes for a stripped hole can be used to provide a more secure hold, including drilling out for a glued-in hardwood dowel or wooden plug (note: only drive screws home after the glue has fully cured). In addition to inserting dowels or plugs where the screws will go dowels can also be installed at 90° to the screw's axis. When driven home the screw then bites into the side of the dowel (long grain) which provides a very much stronger hold if it is going into end grain. This is often done if strength is important:</p>

<p>Coach screws can have larger threading in comparison with a typical wood screw, although this does tend to go hand in hand with them being quite beefy. Many would to too large or ugly for some applications. Although there is some variation they typically look like this:</p>

<p>Many modern deck screws also have larger threading (or twinned threads). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most threads seem to be between .60-.75 pitch, but is there something on the scale of 1.5 pitch? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Machine screws have a lower pitch. Although they also have a very shallow threading usually if they fit their hole well they can have an extremely good hold in wood (hardwood in particular). Two reasons they're not more widely used is that they're slow to drive and the head style is usually not what we're looking for.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or would the material of the thread not be strong enough to add any practical gripping power?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The wood is nearly always going to be the weak point here. It's the threading in the wood that may not be strong enough as it's created partially or wholly by crushing of fibres. There's little fear of the thread on the screw itself stripping off unless it's been damaged, e.g. by corrosion. But even at that I've pulled heavily rusted screws and bolts from wood numerous times and the threading usually remained intact!</p>

<p>As far as the effect of the hardness. </p>

<p>First the harder metal is the longer it will generally hold a sharp edge.  So less sharpening involved.  Also the hard a metal becomes the more brittle it becomes.  This means that the edge could more easily chip or the entire scraper could snap/break.</p>

<p>So as far as actual use, you might be able to use it to do more on harder woods with less sharpening, but you have to be more careful about chipping/breaking it.  These are fairly thin pieces of metal so the temper probably needs to be in a relatively small range to keep an edge and to be flexible.  better tempering techniques will allow it to be harder toward the edge while leaving plenty of spring in the rest of the tool.</p>

<p>Spalting, as you probably know, is the result of fungal attack on the wood.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spalting"">Wikipedia</a> lists several conditions that need to be met for spalting to occur:</p>

<p>Thus, if you want to preclude spalting, do the opposite of the things listed above.</p>

<hr>

<p>Since you are attempting to season whole logs, they will retain water much longer than if it were sawn and hence be susceptible to fungal attack for a longer period of time.</p>

<p>If you keep air circulating around the entire log to quickly get the moisture content down, it <em>might</em> reduce the risk of spalting.  That's a double-edged sword because rapid drying leads to rapid cracking of the log cross-sections.  However, you state that you have </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whole logs with bark retained on full circumference</p>

<p>which will not help drying at all.  Bark helps the tree retain moisture and greatly slows air drying.</p>

<p>In terms of finish, the only sure way to waterproof wood is with a good film finish. While epoxy finishes, such as used in marine applications, are absolutely waterproof common interior varnish is actually surprisingly water-resistant. So a good coat of oil-based polyurethane (not thin, no pinholes or missed spots, paying particular attention to cut edges) will provide quite reliable long-term waterproofing. </p>

<p>I would in general dissuade you from trying to make something like this from common plywoods which have glue joints of questionable durability. It would be much preferable to make a piece like this from solid wood. </p>

<p>Wood is surprisingly durable in solid form and even untreated softwoods should give you years of service, although of course you should expect staining. Choose a naturally rot-resistant species such as true cedar, white oak, black walnut and juniper I wouldn't be surprised if a piece like this help up for decades without any surface treatment given they can survive more than ten years outdoors with exposure to the elements.</p>

  <p>How can I improve the results I get?</p>

<p>Based on your pictures, I surmise that it's due to a combination of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Your chisel not being sharp enough,</p></li>
<li><p>Planing against the grain,</p></li>
<li><p>Not having the edge of your chisel slightly proud of the side of the plane body, and</p></li>
<li><p>Taking too thick of a shaving with each pass.</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>I find it hard to control the depth of cut, tapping the chisel usually results in a very coarse shaving.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the nature of wooden planes.  They take a bit of fiddling to get set right.  Once you get the depth of cut set correctly, it should glide through spruce with no problem.</p>

<p>The shavings in your first updated picture are much thicker than I would look for if you're going for a fine finish.  If you're just trying to hog off wood, those thick shavings are probably ok, but your surface finish will be worse off as a result.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rebate depth is hard to control to get uniform depth from end to end, I guess I need to add a depth stop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A depth stop would help you get a consistent depth of cut.  However, it can be a crutch that keeps you from developing the proper technique.</p>

<p>You can also mark lines on your piece to shoot for the correct depth and just keep cutting until you get to that depth across the entire cut.  This will probably result in you having to work only parts of the cut at a time when things get uneven, but again, this is the nature of wooden planes.</p>

"Planing a laminated curve","297","","<p>Preface, I have not worked with a planer before.</p>

<p>I have a curved piece of wood which was created by laminating three 1/4"" oak boards over a form.  The curve looks good but I would like to clean up the edge.  I can do this with a sander of course, but was wondering if I could pass it through a thickness planer.  Basically place the piece on its side (its about 3"" wide) and pass it through.</p>

<p>Is this ""safe"" to do on a planer? Should I pass the form through too to provide support?  </p>
","<p>It depends the exact profile of the curve (how ""thick"" it looks to the planer), but I would hazard that a thickness planer is not a safe option for this. Due to the irregular surface that will be given both to the rollers and the cutting head, I would be concerned that the piece tips over unexpectedly while inside (probably at the beginning, before the second roller engages).</p>

<p>Bracing the curved piece in a form that is the same height as the width of the piece will alleviate these concerns. </p>

<p>However, due to large amounts of glue in the laminated wood I would worry about marring the planer knives. Matthias over at woodgears.ca documented this effect from <a href=""https://woodgears.ca/jointer/plywood.html"" rel=""nofollow"">running plywood on his jointer</a>. Commercial plywood is probably rougher on the knives than your laminated oak (with only 2 glue lines), but together with the risk of going through the planer I wouldn't try that.</p>

Generally avoid rapid changes in its environment. If dust and handling are a concern, consider displaying it in a glass case. This will also have the affect enhancing the drama in displaying it.

"Use a miter gauge or a rip fence for cutting square stock on a table saw?","290","","<p>I have the following understanding for table saws:</p>

<ul>
<li>A cross cut is against the grain, and should use a miter gauge (w/ the rip fence removed).</li>
<li>A rip cut is with the grain, and should use a rip fence. </li>
<li>Boards that are being cut length wise get pushed along the rip fence, and width cuts get pushed with a miter-gauge. </li>
</ul>

<p>What do you use for a square piece of plywood then (alternating grains, and length / width is identical) - use a rip fence or miter-gauge?</p>
","<p>You can use whichever one is more practical for the size of your workpiece and your saw setup, but in general a miter gauge is not as well-suited to working with square stock.  The miter gauge's capacity is limited unless you have an auxiliary infeed table, since it falls out of the track once it extends too far past the front of the table. Also, the bulk of a square piece's material is only supported at the outer end of the miter gauge's fence (if you have one). Using a basic miter gauge with no attached fence to cut a square piece of material will be awkward at best, and probably dangerous.</p>

<p>If you're talking square sheets, you're probably not looking at anything larger than 5'x5' (e.g., Baltic birch plywood). On the table saw, it will be easiest to cut this with an appropriately-sized sled or the fence. For small parts, you should use a sled.</p>

  <p>Is there any good way to recover from this? Or should I give up and order a replacement top?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I doubt you'd need to order a replacement top, no matter how bad the rust seems to you compared to the pristine surface around it. People have restored Craigslist finds where the rust was old and far more pervasive than what you're facing...... and the after photos sort of speak for themselves I think:</p>

<p>So no need to panic :-)</p>

<p>Once the surface rust is gone discolouration may bother you since the saw was so new, but the main practical issue is of course pitting. It's a safe bet that the rust won't have progressed far enough that any pitting left behind is a dealbreaker based on all the rusty garage/barn queens posted online that have been brought back to working condition!</p>

<p><strong>Removing the rust</strong><br>
So the main way to deal with this is abrasive methods. You could take the bed off to immerse it in a rust-removal soak or to do electrolysis but it's very unlikely to be necessary to go to that extreme.</p>

<p>Remove the loose surface rust first by scrubbing with coarse steel wool or a Scotch-Brite, lubricated with something oily — mineral spirits, WD-40 or some oil (baby oil is just fine if it's all you have). Then wipe clean and assess the bed surface. </p>

<p>If there's some minor pitting you could do some sanding <em>but only if you want to</em>, once the active rust is gone you can pretty much leave it if the slight discolouration doesn't bother you. Some pitting usually doesn't affect function in any way that you'd notice so it's not actually vital to remove it. </p>

<p>So after tackling the surface rust you can apply a fresh coat of your usual waxy or oily rust-preventative and put the saw straight back to work.</p>

<p>If you do want to sand, first response <a href=""http://forums.finewoodworking.com/fine-woodworking-knots/power-tools-and-machinery/rust-removal-jointer-bed"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in this thread</a> on Fine Woodworking's forum is well worth a read to reassure yourself you won't do any harm to the bed of your saw by sanding it.</p>

"How-to disassemble a pallet for up-cycle pallet wood projects?","287","","<p>I tried using pallet wood for a small project, but it was really hard to take apart. Spiral looking nails everywhere. I ended up tearing more wood up than what I could use.</p>

<p>How does one disassemble a pallet for up-cycle pallet wood projects?</p>
","<p><strong>Pulling the nails</strong><br>
Initially most people who do this will start with a claw hammer. While that can obviously work it has some definite downsides. Other than the aching backs most people will experience some wooden-handled hammers simply can't take the strain of pulling ring-shank and spiral-shank nails, that have often rusted into the wood, again and again and again. I found this out the hard way.</p>

<p>All-steel hammers and those with fibreglass handles should be immune to this problem, but the effort involved in pulling nails with a hammer is still more than you need to expend. It's better to use leverage to your advantage and use one of these instead:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Bob5.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Bob5.jpg"" alt=""Wrecking bar""></a></p>

<p>These make the job a lot easier.</p>

<p>You will also run into the problem of nails with weak heads, or heads that have become weak due to rusting, which means they bend or break off when you try to pull them using a hammer's claws. A well-made claw hammer or wrecking bar doesn't require the head to be in place, but if you don't have one with sharp enough internal edges in the 'V' you usually have to resort to pulling some or all of the nails from some pallets using a nail puller, although you can do a surprisingly decent job with a pair of pliers. </p>

<p>Using all of the above tools it is a good idea to protect the surface of the wood from being bruised by with a small scrap of wood. With pliers especially this provides some much-needed levering advantage too.</p>

<p>Related previous thread: <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/430/what-is-the-best-way-to-remove-nails-from-pallets"">What is the best way to remove nails from pallets?</a></p>

<p><strong>Breaking pallets down</strong><br>
Beyond pulling nails to get boards off there are dedicated tools now made for taking pallets apart. In addition to the ones you can buy there are a few projects posted online with instructions for making your own (note that this usually requires welding). Most have a soft of family resemblance to the commercial varieties and end up looking something like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/w9Kil.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/w9Kil.jpg"" alt=""Pallet-breaking tool""></a></p>

<p>These <em>greatly</em> speed up the breakdown of a pallet (see YouTube videos for just how much) but you are of course still left with the nails to remove after. Or perhaps not.....</p>

<p><strong>Leaving the nails in place</strong><br>
Many people who do this a lot eventually stop their attempts to pull nails because of the time and effort involved. But more than this there is also the great chance of damaging the wood as you've experienced. In addition the wood at the site of the nails can be cracked already, something I'm sure everyone who has taken apart a number of pallets will have experienced. </p>

<p>Where this is done to break the pallet down the two main tools used seem to be an angle grinder with a suitable wheel or a reciprocating saw. The boards are levered up slightly from the blocks they're nailed to, just enough for clearance of the wheel or saw blade, and then the nails are cut through at the back. With practice this can go very quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>Leaving the nails in the wood might seem actively risky given that further processes are going to run into the embedded metal, which can damage tools and even pose a significant personal safety risk in the case of planers and other power tools. But if you really want to upcycle the wood from a pallet you would ideally lose any nail holes, so the wood in that area is always going to be discarded anyway. Obviously this does greatly limit the size of the pieces you get but it's worth it. When you do this you end up with material that nobody can tell used to form part of a pallet, which I think is the ultimate goal myself. </p>

<p>And there is some very nice wood indeed being used to make some pallets. Not that softwoods are inherently inferior but I've gotten Honduran mahogany and others have harvested purpleheart, padauk, teak or something very similar, oaks of various kinds and numerous other hardwoods. Quality wood like this shouldn't be marred by nail holes and any associated iron staining if it's to look its best. </p>

<p><strong>Cleaning off the surface</strong><br>
Not directly tied to disassembly but the rough-sawn surface of much pallet wood can of course be very dirty. It can harbour a significant amount of grit, which can itself pose quite a risk to your tools. It is worth the time to wash and scrub down the wood, or at least give if a thorough going over with a stiff wire brush to get the worst of this off before you begin any finer processes, especially surface planing.</p>

<p>Almost certainly yes. Just to mention, almost any oil of vegetable origin would be as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to try soaking wooden spoons and such (things which will come into prolonged contact with hot food) in tung oil. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are seeking to make the utensils waterproof I'm afraid you won't be happy with the results of your experiment, but I encourage you to try it anyway and see the results first hand.</p>

<p>No oil used in wood finishing actually provides a really good waterproof finish. Pre-polymerised tung oil may come the closest, but oil finishes of all types (using oil only, not a blended finish with resins in it) are inherently water-permeable.</p>

<p>Partly this is because oil doesn't penetrate that deeply into wood except into exposed end grain so there's actually very little of it left in/on the wood surface. </p>

<p>There is a method to greatly increase the oil uptake of wood in a reasonable timeframe, one used to produce oil-soaked wooden bearings — in short you deep fry the wood, displacing water in the wood's structure with oil. But this leaves the wood permanently oily which I don't think would be a desirable outcome here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it a good idea to add a small amount of orange oil (food safety)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think there's any benefit to using that but this is something you'll have to make your own mind up about after reading up on it. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> there is a problem in that ""orange oil"" will often not be what you'd assume from the name. Obviously the expectation is that it's oil extracted from oranges but there are products with that on the label (ditto ""lemon oil"") which are not that at all, but instead a type of finish or wood treatment (or furniture polish!) with a citrus smell. Some of them would absolutely not be suitable for application to something intended for direct food contact.</p>

<p><strong>No finish is <em>necessary</em></strong><br>
Gotta add this FYI. Wooden utensils, just as with serving boards and most cutting boards, don't need to be finished in any way to work well in their intended roles. </p>

<p>A long while back it was the norm not to finish things like this and while it's still done today in some parts of the world in the West the idea has largely been forgotten about, or pushed aside in favour of one or another finish... but a great deal of this is about <em>making things look better</em>. While there's nothing wrong with that as a goal it tends to go hand in hand with an idea that the wood needs to be finished, but very often the treatment does nothing to improve the serviceability of a food-prep item and might even negatively affect one or more attributes.</p>

"Should I treat end-grain on garden table with wood glue?","286","","<p><strong>The Preface:</strong></p>

<p>I'm building a table for the garden and did some research into how I might seal and protect the most vulnerable parts of the table. The end-grain. The wood I have available is old(30+ years) and very dry larch-wood.</p>

<p>Beside the steps one could take, that are already covered in various questions across this and other sites I stumbled upon a method that is called ""sizing"". I hope I spelled that right. The sealing of end-grain is covered in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2305/do-i-need-to-seal-the-ends-of-hardwood-fence-boards"">'Do I need to seal the ends of hardwood fence boards?'</a> and this here might be a duplicate to that question.</p>

<p><strong>The Story:</strong></p>

<p>While watching <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/stevinmarin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Steve Ramsey</a>'s channel I stumbled over his video about '<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Esvb64fUQ10"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">What You Need to Know About Glue</a>'. He also covers gluing end-grain (starting at ~5:20) and suggests making a ""sizing""(at ~6:00), which is basically wood-glue mixed with some water to ""size"" the wood before the actual glue-up. To me it seems this sizing is just sealing up the end-grain pores with wood-glue. And the mixing with water is done so the thinner substance might penetrate deeper into the wood.</p>

<p>My thought now is that I will try to use this technique for the end-grain parts of my table (probably all of them) to close the pores and make it more durable. </p>

<p>To achieve that I would put masking tape around the edges of the wood and soak the end-grain with my ""sizing"". The masking tape would protect the surface of the wood from ugly glue-stains during the sizing. After all is dried up I would take off about half a millimeter (~1/64"") with the table-saw/miter-saw for a smooth end and start to apply the actual finish everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>The Question(s):</strong></p>

<p>In theory I think this method to be quite ingenious and am wondering why I haven't heard of it before. Or am I missing some fundamental problem with this here?</p>

<ul>
<li>How far will this sizing penetrate into the end-grain? (Of course that answer will probably be dependent on the density and type of the wood)</li>
<li>Will this help preventing/delaying rot?</li>
<li>Will the masking tape prevent the other faces to get ugly glue stains?</li>
<li>Is there any drawback with this method concerning the expansion and shrinkage of the wood? Which will probably be severe as  I plan to let the table sit outside all the time.</li>

<blockquote>

<p>Yup, as you'll read in the above link that's exactly what it's doing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And the mixing with water is done so the thinner substance might penetrate deeper into the wood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How far will this seizing penetrate into the end-grain? (Of course that answer will probably be dependent on the density and type of the wood)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes it will depend on the type of wood, not its density but how absorbent it is. Red oak for example is much denser than pine but will absorb liquids <em>much</em> more deeply into end grain under normal circumstances because of its structure. </p>

<p>Still, size is normally relatively viscous so absorption should be expected to be fairly shallow, on the order of 2mm at best, which is very approximately 1/16"", but possibly as low as the 1/64"" that you mention you plan to trim off so I wouldn't do that.</p>

<p>Any anyway I wouldn't suggest you seal the end grain using dilute wood glue. </p>

<p>Soaking finish into the end grain is much more commonly done, but a superior alternative is to coat it with epoxy. See <a href=""http://www.rockler.com/how-to/achilles-heel-outdoor-furniture-projects/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How to Weatherproof Outdoor Furniture by Curing It with an Epoxy Coat</a> on Rockler.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will this help preventing/delaying rot?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that's exactly what this is for. By preventing water penetrating deeply into the wood at the end grain (which is far and away the most absorbent surface on any wood) it will greatly slow deterioration.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will the masking tape prevent the other faces to get ugly glue stains?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. As you'll see on the Rockler link using tape is exactly what they recommend.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there any drawback with this method concerning the expansion and shrinkage of the wood? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.</p>

<p><strong>More details</strong><br>
The Rockler link suggests straight epoxy applied directly to the end grain but that's not always the best idea as epoxies vary in their viscosity. It's best to have an epoxy that's quite thin. </p>

<p>If the epoxy you're using doesn't have the desired flowing consistency its viscosity can be lowered by two main methods: adding solvent or heating. The usual solvents mentioned are an alcohol of some kind, usually denatured alcohol (DA) in North America, or acetone. Note: diluting epoxy does affect its final strength, but for this it shouldn't be a big deal (especially if you don't overdo it, and only a little solvent will be needed to get to the right consistency).</p>

<p>If you want to use heating you can gently heat the separate hardener and resin, or the mixed batch, using a hairdryer or a heat gun. You'll see it immediately makes the epoxy much more fluid. If doing this it's also worth heating the end grain because as it cools it will suck the epoxy deeper into the pores.</p>

","<p>@bowlturner gives a good suggestion, but with pinewood derby cars (I'm assuming?) it's going to be really hard to get a dowel to sit well since the slot is at the edge of the wood.

Currently the only tool I really have is a Dremel, so I don't plan on doing it with that. Is it possible to cut out something like this with a router? If so which bit would I need?</p>
","<p>It's exactly the job for a router. I'd recommend using something like a 1/2"" (~13mm) cutter, with 2 straight flutes as a minimum - if you can get an upcut spiral bit or a 3-flute cutter, or even a cutter specifically for MDF then that may be better. A carbide-tipped cutter will fare better/last longer but is more expensive than a basic steel bit. MDF is pretty abrasive on cutting tools anyway, so cheaper may be a better way to go.</p>

<p>Basically just take it slowly with the feed speed and you should be alright. Maybe practice on a small scrap piece first if you can. Routing MDF is easier than routing timber because you don't have to pay attention to grain direction. You'll want some good extraction and/or to do it outside with a good dust mask as the dust from MDF machining is nasty.</p>

<p>You might also want to construct yourself some sort of rudimentary guide or just use some planks of wood clamped across the width of the workpiece, moving it along to support the router base - you could run with the router base directly on the surface of the MDF but you might run into trouble with the router tilting if you're not careful.</p>

<p><strong>Sand by hand</strong><br>
You mentioned sanding by hand and while it's not the ideal method it is an option, particularly if you only have a modest amount to do.</p>

<p>One of the main tricks to doing this efficiently is not to start with too fine a paper — if you're still shaping the curve you're only shooting yourself in the foot by starting with 180 grit..... or 240 as I read someone doing just the other day! When shaping you should be using something like 80 grit to start with, then 100, 150 and then finish at 180 or 220.</p>

<p>Another trick is to use shaped sanding 'blocks', if necessary fitted with a fence of sorts to help ensure the edge is square to the face of the board. The simplest block for sanding inside curves is a piece of dowel with the sandpaper just wrapped around it, and this can work surprisingly well. Remember to finish the sanding in the direction of the grain!</p>

<p>Sanding by hand is of course hard work but if it's the only method open to someone it shouldn't be discounted, it can and does work. But there are better ways.....</p>

<p><strong>Don't sand</strong><br>
<strong>Compass plane</strong> This is obviously a pretty specialised plane and they can be costly, but if you do enough work to warrant one they'll be worth the outlay. Obviously because of their size and shape they can only do certain tasks, but they do excel at it when they can be used for the purpose. <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1772/what-is-the-old-school-way-of-smoothing-a-curved-surface/1775#1775"">A little more in a previous Answer.</a></p>

<p><strong>Spokeshave</strong> With a very sharp edge, practice in controlling the tool and experience in reading grain you can do a lot of your curved edges, concave and convex, using spokeshaves. This includes shaping, so potentially no need to saw the profile first, and finish-ready surfaces are possible straight from the spokeshave just as with a plane, although they're harder to achieve (more user control required, plus most spokeshaves have a greater tendency towards tearout because they have wide mouths and no means to alter this).</p>

<p><strong>Files</strong> Files offer a very useful alternative for many shaping tasks, and doing curved edges is one of them. Much rough shaping and quite a bit of the smoothing can be done using a selection of files, leaving just a minimal amount of sanding or scraping to finish off.</p>

<p>When using files it can be worth doing something similar to when sanding — filing in the direction of the grain. With files this is often done with the file held at 90° to the direction of motion (referred to as <em>draw filing</em>) and this can sometimes leave the smoothest surface the file is capable of producing. But the technique does tend to work best of harder materials than wood.</p>

<p><strong>Scraper</strong> You an scrape edges just as you can scrape face grain on boards, and the results can be just as good. <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1134/what-are-the-differences-between-sanding-and-scraping/1159#1159"">Lots more on scraping versus sanding in a previous Answer.</a></p>

<hr>

<p>*It's worth noting that sanding drums, wire brushes and other things intended to be chucked into hand power drills have been around since <em>before the 1950s</em>, so there is tons of practical evidence that drills can withstand this type of use. But, cheaper modern drills won't be built to the same standards of the past so proceed with caution and as always don't press hard, let the abrasive do the work.</p>

","<p>Often (not always*) when something like this happens with a wooden product it indicates a problem with the way the piece was constructed, which is sadly not uncommon in manufactured pieces (this is not, as might be supposed, only a recent issue as books from the early 20th century mention it was not uncommon even back then). </p>

<p>Just from looking at the one image you've provided the only thing that jumps out is there's a cross-grain situation, with the boards making up the tabletop panel running one way and the grain in the frame (?) element or decorative bullnose running the other way, so there are definitely at least some problems with the way this was put together.</p>

<p>Rectifying something like this can usually be done, but it may not be easy or practical. It may require basically restructuring the table, or it could be as simple as changing the fixings used to hold the top in place, we can't tell without seeing more photos of other aspects of the table's construction — a key one being how the top is attached to the framework or apron.</p>

<p>*Other times it's a problem with the wood used. The construction details of a piece can be perfectly good and it can still warp or distort if the wood isn't quite up to snuff (e.g. it wasn't dry enough before being used) or perhaps if the factory was drier than where the table ended up, so some expansion took place in every piece of wood used which the design can't accommodate.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit after update:</p>

<p>Those pics help a bit in understanding what's going on, although it's hard to visualise the entire piece the way you would if you could look at it in the flesh. See that bent metal (?) bracket screwed into the underside of the top? That's the equivalent of a hardwood button (on the left <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qaQKK.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>), one of my preferred methods for attaching tabletops. If there are matching ones spaced around all four sides the top is attached properly, and the raised boards may have been caused by a poor glue joint or one or more damper boards. </p>

<p>My money is on less-than-perfect glue joints being at least part of the problem. The underside shows us the joints 'warts and all' and they are not great. In fact a few are pretty bad — glue joints should be very thin for strength, at best invisibly thin (less than a human hair). Certainly no open gap! This indicates that either A) the jointing of the edges wasn't done well initially (so they weren't straight and square) or B) the glueing wasn't done well. One or both of these allow the joints to open up over time.</p>

<p>Best of luck with that! If we assume ""a few hours"" is three hours that's one cut every 21 seconds with no breaks or pauses. If you decide to go with hand-cutting these ganging the strips up as recommended in rob's Answer is the only way you're likely to be able to do this in the timeframe you've set yourself. </p>

<p>Although I realise you might have no choice in the matter, personally, this is the type of thing I would strongly resist doing to a very tight schedule but instead approached in a piecemeal manner, plodding along at a comfortable pace over a couple of days until you're done. It's both stressful and mind-numbingly boring to power through it in the minimum time possible.</p>

<p><strong>Sawn v. milled</strong><br>
Not sure if you'd thought about the <em>quality</em> of the sawn surface. You mention you're profiling the stock, since you can't or won't want to sand the sawn surfaces you need to be able to use them straight from the saw and not every saw is capable of achieving a cut that smooth. So you might need to buy a saw, or a blade for the scroll saw, specifically for this job. </p>

<p><strong>More work</strong><br>
Sorry, but your work isn't done once you've finished sawing. You don't specify the wood you're using but regardless of the species you're going to get <em>some</em> splintering on the exit face no matter how fine the saw used, so to be realistic you need to factor in not a little extra time for clean-up sanding, unless you can rig up some kind of tumbler to clean up the blocks in large batches or all at once. </p>

<p>Note that tumbling will slightly round all corners and edges. </p>

"Cleaning old hard wood","274","","<p>I am building a computer desk out of some old oak boards that had been on the side of an old tobacco barn for around 60 years. I tore the building down and thought, hey I wonder what this would look like cleaned up.  After running the boards through a planner they looked awesome. </p>

<p>My question to you: Is there anything to be worried about with these boards? They were pretty well coated in black mold. </p>
","<p>I think the most dangerous part was putting them through your planner.  I hope you used a good dust mask.  Lots of that stuff gets airborn when you plane it. </p>

<p>However, if you made it to clean wood, then you are likely to be pretty good.  You still might want to take precautions when cutting it up, but then you should be doing that anyway, since 'clean' saw dust is still a hazard.</p>

<p>But once you build your desk, and put a seal and finish on it, you shouldn't have much to worry about.</p>

"How do I cut a blind half-lap T-joint?","274","","<p>(Apologies if this has been answered before. This probably has a really obvious answer.)</p>

<p>I need to connect two 4x4s in a ""T"". (These are one leg and a center / longitudinal support for a long table.)</p>

<p>I decided on a half lap joint since it looked relatively easy to do, but my wife doesn't want to see the back of the joint on the table feet. I thought:  easy enough, I'll just make it a blind joint so that the end of the long board doesn't go all the way through, leaving about 3/4"" on the end of the lap. </p>

<p>However, I'm not sure what the best way is to cut this into the table foot (about 32"" piece of 4x4). My initial attempt on a piece of scrap was to drill a few holes in the corners of the waste area, hit it with the jig saw and chisel out the rest. This works, mostly, but is something of a pain and doesn't get me a smooth surface at the bottom of the cut for the long board to mate with.</p>

<p>I'm not super-comfortable with the idea of putting a 1.5"" bit on my router as I'm a bit afraid of snapping the shaft if the teeth catch on a knot.</p>

<p>Suggestions? I considered a mortise-and-tenon joint, but that leaves me with the problem of cutting a 1.5-1.75""-deep mortise, which is basically the same issue I'm having here. </p>

<p>I could probably just get a large bit or hole saw, use my neglected drill press and clean up the excess with the jig saw or chisel, but is there a better / more accepted / safer way to do this?</p>
","<p>Kudos for doing a test run first and identifying the problem ahead of time!</p>

<p>Standard advice from older woodworking guides (or any modern handtool book) for doing many things like this: cut the bulk of the material out with the chisel (if you like drilling out some waste first), then smooth the bottom of the recess/channel/dado with a router. In the old days this would have been a hand router but you can do the same thing with a powered router of course.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not really, since the bottom of a mortise doesn't need to be clean <em>at all</em>. In fact the bottoms of most mortises probably look like they were chewed by a beaver. Long as the side walls of the mortise are clean though that's all that matters.</p>

<p>The M&amp;T is the stronger joint, but the half lap (UK: housing joint) is plenty strong enough for what you're doing here if it's cut well and the parts are glued together properly*.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You can use a long bit with safety to cut deeply even into very hard wood if you just take a little off at a time. If you had to you could just nibble away 1/8"" or less at a time. </p>

<p>A slower feed rate helps reduce the strain on the bit as well, although this can increase the chances of scorching.</p>

<p>Just thought I'd tack this on for anyone with a table saw who might like to try an alternative......</p>

<p><strong>'Cheating' using a table saw</strong><br>
If you have a table saw and the raw material for the legs is thick enough that you can afford to lose some there is a workaround method. </p>

<p>First you saw a thin strip from the leg (you'll lose about 1/8"" or so to the kerf), then you cut the lap through on the thicker portion, which is straightforward to do and it's easy to get a nice flat surface using a sharp chisel with fine paring cuts to finish off. Then you simply glue the strip back on the leg, closing the back of the joint.</p>

<p>This can create a seamless joint on the leg if the grain is nice and straight or if the wood is a tight-grained species without obvious grain lines or figure that would be interrupted by the cut.</p>

","<p>First, if you plan on gluing the end grain edges together, the joint will not be reliable itself.

<p>For any joints into the side grain (your left side face), I would recommend sanding the surface with a course paper or planing approx. 1/16"" off of the oiled faces.  The oiled surfaces will reject the glue (oil and water don't mix) but the oil does not penetrate very deep and removing the outer surface will provide enough contact surface for effective gluing.</p>

","<p>This is really too broad for SE but at some point there was going to be a question that asked about wood glue generally and I think it makes a good reference point for future visitors so I'm going to try to answer it. But be aware that despite how long this is it's only a brief overview of the subject and not at all comprehensive.</p>

<hr>

<p>Some previous Q&amp;As covered quite a bit of the ground here so I think I should link to all of them I could find to start with, for cross-referencing:<br>

<p>It's perhaps not that important but I think it's worth mentioning that while there are glues sold to bond wood the reality is that few were actually developed specifically <em>for</em> wood. Instead we use glue that has been packaged/sold for use by woodworking trades. Where this is of interest is in deciding on an adhesive not sold specifically to woodworkers for certain special applications. Probably the best example of this is the early experimenters who tried cyanoacrylate adhesives (CA, superglue) and found them useful for a few specialist jobs.</p>

<p>If I try to list all the glues used in woodworking I'm sure to miss out a few, and the list would be overly long anyway, so this is just a few key ones. As for listing the various strengths, weaknesses and ideal applications for all of these that is definitely beyond the scope of SE so I'm not going to attempt that but I'll touch on a few interesting points.</p>

<p><strong>Casein</strong><br>
AKA milk glue or milk-protein glue. No longer widely used but a very important adhesive in its day. Can be made at home fairly easily if anyone wants to experiment with it in a small way, but it's still possible to buy this and the quality and consistency would be better. </p>

<p>When you make it at home you produce a wet paste, the commercial version comes as a dry powder that you mix as needed into a paste with water. It doesn't keep very long, even in the refrigerator, so don't make or mix too much.</p>

<p><strong>Hide glue</strong><br>
Hide glue is not one thing, it is many closely related products, part of a broader class of protein glues derived primarily from animal skins.</p>

<p>This and fish glue used to be <em>the</em> wood glues, and for many centuries were almost the only adhesives used in furniture making. In the past it was a hot glue (often referred to in English sources as ""Scotch glue"") and had to be kept warm for use in a double boiler, and the wood surfaces usually warmed prior to application as well. </p>

<p>You have to be very careful not to overheat the original form as that spoiled the glue, which along with the sometimes rank smell of the old glue pots made using it not particularly pleasant. Today we have room-temperature versions such as Old Brown Glue and Titebond's Liquid Hide Glue that make it a lot more user-friendly, at the cost of a little of its strength (still plenty strong enough though). Unlike many glues hide glue joints are reversible, using moisture and heat, making them very popular still with instrument makers for example.</p>

<p><strong>Fish glue</strong><br>
Derived from the skins or swim bladders of certain species of fish, e.g. sturgeon. Originally a very important adhesive (not just to woodworkers, it was widely used in other crafts) and while not commonly used today still valued for certain specialist applications.</p>

<p><strong>Starch</strong><br>
Starch glues are well worth experimenting with particularly with children because you can turn an everyday food product (flour, starch, rice) into something that will glue. Starch glues can be quite strong, good enough for smaller items but they don't usually form bonds that you'd rely on for furniture work.</p>

<p><strong>PVA</strong><br>
You could probably devote a chapter of a book on these alone. As you can see from some of the information in the above links there are a few types. The main class difference might seem to be between the white and yellow forms but they're broadly similar.</p>

<p>In reality the main thing that separates PVAs into two nearly distinct categories of glue is whether it is water-resistant or not, and it is not just the yellow form that can be water-resistant or waterproof.</p>

<p>PVAs of all types are the most important woodworking glues in the modern era, and their relative cheapness, ease of application, lack of a strong odour, easy cleanup with water and other advantages ensures they'll remain popular.</p>

<p><strong>Epoxy</strong><br>
Obviously there are many different types of epoxy, almost everyone is familiar with there being fast-setting types (3-min, 5-min or quick-set epoxy) and slow setting types with 'drying' times of an hour or more but it goes much deeper than that. </p>

<p>As a general rule the slower the setting time the stronger the epoxy. </p>

<p>Where gap-filling is important epoxy is the glue of choice and it can/should be filled with wood flour or fine sanding dust when used to fill major gaps.</p>

<p>Note: epoxy is one of the few glues that doesn't require clamping pressure to achieve a strong bond. </p>

<p><strong>Polyurethane</strong><br>
We're probably most familiar with the foaming type (the original Gorilla glue being the classic example) but there are actually a number of classes of polyurethane glue, including types that are a paste consistency, e.g. ""construction adhesive"".</p>

<p>The foaming quality of the usual type used by woodworkers has led to the belief that it can fill gaps, and it does — with a weak foam that has little strength. Polyurethane requires good clamp pressure to ensure a good bond, and it's important to watch out for the foaming pushing a joint apart with the pressure created.</p>

<p><strong>Urea-formaldehyde</strong><br>
Extremely important industrially (for most of the 20th century this was the glue used in plywood manufacture) and in some production woodworking shops, not widely use by home woodworkers. Can gap-fill to a small degree but it shouldn't be relied on for this. It and some closely related glues create coloured glue lines, which obviously limit where they can be used.</p>

<p><strong>Superglue</strong><br>
Generally what's known as ""superglue"" is cyanoacrylate. Also used as a finish, most commonly among pen turners I think. </p>

<p>There are actually a few versions of this glue (not just liquid and gel types) with a broader range of properties than you might suppose. This is not used as a general-purpose glue in woodworking in that you would not use it e.g. to glue a large joint together, but it does have some uses, mainly for small repairs and/or in non-loaded applications. Superglue can cure very quickly, and even more so when used with a chemical ""activator"" which usually comes in an aerosol spray can. Woodturners in particular sometimes use superglue to repair smaller/very fine grain splits, and it can also be of use to bond small mitre joints such as on picture frames.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong><br>
It should be noted here that many glues sold to woodworkers tout their strength (including the now-infamous old marketing tagline for Gorilla glue). And there are various adhesive test published in magazines and done by various woodworkers online that do show that there is a range of joint strengths produced. But this can obscure the fact that the <em>weakest</em> of them is generally capable of producing joints strong enough for use, and <em>the least expensive PVA can make joints as strong, or stronger, than the wood around them</em>. </p>

<p>Once you match or exceed the strength of the wood itself you've done all you need to, any stronger than that is interesting but unimportant.</p>

"What wood/finish would hold up to use in a video game controller?","272","","<p>A while back, I went on a spree of replacing handles with wood in some tools/toys I had, since I quite liked the feel. In the past couple years, I've picked up competitive gaming, and would like the comfort of wood in <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CdKCZnG3L.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my controller</a>, if possible. </p>

<p>However, compared to my previous projects, this would be handled much more extensively, and would require much smaller parts for buttons/stick caps, so I don't trust my judgment on what a reasonable choice of wood and finish would be. </p>

<p>I've worked with redwood in the past, and it seems like it would hold up well for the grips both from past experience and from some articles I've found. </p>

<p>For the buttons and stick caps, I'm guessing that no wood I choose will be able to have the fine detail necessary while still maintaining the strength required, and that I'll need to instead make the structural portion out of metal or plastic, and add wood caps.

<p>I've never used a finish, since longevity was never really a concern. Having the feeling of wood is rather the point of the project, but from my research, that seems at odds with decent protection from wear/hand oils. </p>

<p>Do redwood and basswood seem like reasonable choices for this project? </p>

<p>Are there any finishes that wouldn't feel like varnish, but would also protect the wood from frequent handling?</p>

<p>In woodworking circles you'll generally be told to rely on hardwoods or fruitwoods where you want a tough, resilient handle for something. </p>

<p>Certain hardwoods and fruitwoods were the traditional picks for tool handles of all types for many centuries (and still are today in some cases) and for good reasons as they're strong, tough and generally resistant to splintering. Not that softwoods are necessarily weak, but comparatively they aren't in the same league for this sort of application.</p>

<p>While redwood might hold up well enough (it would depend on the piece to a certain extent) I'd be more inclined to go with a close-grained hardwood if possible. There are numerous possibilities but maple would be a good candidate among species that are relatively easy to get, especially if you're in North America, and beech would also make an excellent choice.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Basswood is fairly soft to very soft (wood varies) so would be a very poor choice I think for something like this. You won't easily get it but a much better choice would be rosewood. Other dense, oily/resinous tropical hardwoods would also work well, but all tend to be expensive and some are no longer available commercially because trade in them has been banned due to over-logging at source.</p>

<p>You might consider instead using a resin-impregnated wood such as those sold for pen turners and as handle blanks for knifemakers.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You don't need to protect from hand oils, they don't actually pose any risk to wood*. </p>

<p>Up to a certain point finishes don't protect wood from much in the way of wear. You'll get some protection from minor scrapes and gentler hits that would otherwise result in a ding or small dent, but in general the finish gives when the wood gives from an impact so really what finish is doing in general is protecting <em>the appearance</em> of a piece, not so much protecting from wear outright.</p>

<p>If you go with a tight-grained hard wood for the handles you could easily go without a finish, just sand to a fine surface and use it immediately. If you would prefer to finish then there are many alternatives, from oiling using a straight oil (e.g. BLO) or a penetrating finish (e.g. ""Danish oil"" or ""tung oil finish"") through to shellac or varnish. All of these options are used by someone out there to finish their tool handles, and each user likes how the wood looks and feels, and how it wears over time.</p>

<p>*In fact handling and the inevitable buildup of skin oils etc. in the surface are one of the traditional ways that some things were finished, this is sometimes referred to as ""hand finish"".</p>

","<p>You can devise a jig of some kind to help in making multiple pieces of smaller size but at heart producing strips of wood like this doesn't have to be any different from getting a board to final dimensions for the face of a drawer, a shelf, the side of a bookshelf etc. etc. </p>

<p>The thinner dimension does mean you have to be more careful in sizing as there's a smaller margin of error allowable, but the basic principles remain the same. </p>

<p>For pieces of small cross-section often you'll saw roughly to size from a larger board, i.e. resawing or ripping lengths from it, after that the same process you'd use to make a shelf to the size you want comes into play.</p>

<p>You start with one face of each piece (usually you pick the one that's flattest already, sometimes the side with the best grain) which becomes your first reference or <em>datum</em> surface — the face side. After it is flattened and smoothed then you plane an adjacent edge — the face edge — dead square to the face side. Once these are established (and marked so you don't lose track of them) you can gauge lines for width and thickness from them, then you plane to final dimensions. Working from surfaces you know to be straight and square helps in producing a finished board that's straight and square.</p>

<p>This is a fundamental of hand-tool woodworking, laid out in any good book on the basics for learner woodworkers, e.g. Robert Wearing's <strong>The Essential Woodworker</strong> which many good city libraries will have a copy of. Online, there's a very detailed show and tell of the entire process starting from rough-sawn wood available on Wood and Shop's site, <a href=""https://woodandshop.com/square-flatten-dimension-boards/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How to Square, Flatten, and Dimension Rough Boards with Hand Tools</a>.</p>

<p>If you had to produce a great number of lengths of wood to exacting standards it does become a process that perhaps is best jigged, for speed as well as to help with consistency, and actually Robert Wearing would be a fan of that sort of thing. I think he covers something applicable in one or more of his other books on jigs and workshop aids.</p>

"How can I properly sharpen my knives with power tools?","269","","<p>I have drawers full of knives and blades that have never been as sharp as when they came from the factory.  I have some whetstones, Lansky sharpeners, and leather strops.  I have tried to use those but eventually realized that I'm as likely to make an edge worse as I am to improve it.  In large part this is because:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can't maintain a proper and constant angle of attack while working a curved blade across a series of stones by hand.</li>
<li>I don't know which step to use or for how long, given a blade's condition.</li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile, I have benches full of power tools: Bench grinders, belt sanders, drill press.  I believe I can hold a reasonably constant angle while dragging a blade once or twice across a tool that's doing the work for me.</p>

<p>As I understand it, there are only three steps to producing a perfect edge:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Sharpen:</strong>  In this step the blade is run <em>against</em> the grit to grind a new edge.  Perhaps two grits (usually 100 and 400) are used in this step.  (Optionally, one might grind a relief angle that's more shallow than the cutting edge angle, but it's the latter one that has to be maintained going forward.)</li>
<li><strong>Hone:</strong> Here the blade is run <em>with</em> the grit to knock off burrs and nudge dings back in line.  Power honing is done with finer grits, but not sure how fine.</li>
<li><strong>Strop/polish:</strong> Once again the blade is run <em>with</em> the grit to smooth the edge.  You know you're done when the edge is as shiny as a mirror.</li>
</ol>

<p>With this in mind I began searching for sharpening wheels preloaded with an appropriate compound for each step.  Instead I've found a smorgasbord of wheels ranging from glass to paper, and <em>separate</em> polishing compounds of widely varying composition, many of which users report needing to supplement with oil and wax.  Great.  Am I missing a shortcut around selecting and loading the power sharpening tools?</p>

<p>Now, suppose I manage to find or prepare a line of 3 or 4 powered wheels.  I pick up a knife.  How do I know which step to start at?  And how do I know when I'm ready to move it to the next step?  I know that if I do it right then at the end I have a blade that will catch and slice cleanly through a loose sheet of newsprint.  But is there a foolproof way to get there without grinding away undue amounts of time and metal?</p>
","<p>The power tools are really only useful for putting the initial bevel on the edge or significantly changing the bevel angle.  In my usage they are much more aggressive than you would expect and make any fine sharpening quite difficult (for me at least).  One useful thing about the grinding wheel is that it will give you a hollow grind, making it a lot easier to use a sharpening stone (since the hollowness of the bevel sort of locks it in place at a fixed angle as you run it along the stone -- hard to explain but it makes sense when you feel it).</p>

<p>You can tell if you would save a lot of time using the grinding wheel by simply examining the bevel.  Look at how the two edges come together to form the cutting edge.  </p>

<p>If this is all bent and broken, or round, then you would save a lot of time by grinding a V shape bevel on.  Or if you want to significantly change the cutting angle (generally the thinner the cutting angle the sharper but also more fragile the cutting edge will be).  Otherwise stick to the stone.  </p>

<p>In regards to your tendency to roll the blade: it happens.  Until you get more comfortable always keep the knife at a less aggressive angle than you would expect (since you already know you have the propensity to roll the blade).  Use a sharpie on the bevel as and check it often / reapply as you are using the stone.</p>

<p>Another thing you mention was when to move up to the higher grit stones.  Pretty much just check for the burr on the opposite side that you are working with your fingernail.  Until you get a burr keep on the lower grit stones.  Once you get a burr, put sharpie over the entire bevel.  Now move up a grit until all the sharpie is gone.  Repeat for each higher grit, then strop it on leather with compound. </p>

<p>For your concave blades I find that it is actually a lot harder than you might think to grind it on a wheel without biting into the edges.  Instead I prefer the crock sticks (Lansky turn box) to sharpen followed by a strop.  Or a drum stick wrapped in 600 grit sandpaper.</p>

<p>It is really not so hard to learn and gives a lot of enjoyment.  But the grinding wheel is a great time saver for grinding out any deep nicks or dings.</p>

"Quick corner joints in practice","269","","<p>I'm practicing building drawers, quickly and on the cheap. The drawers I'm making now have sides that are 3"" high x 7/16"" actual thickness, decent quality birch veneer plywood.</p>

<p>I know this is really basic, but I'm struggling with the corner joints on the drawers. The reason I'm practicing is ultimately I want to build a few storage cabinets with about 40 drawers total = 160 corner joints I'm going to have to make. I'm trying to come up with a workflow that is both <em>quick</em> and <em>precise</em>. I also really want the joint to be hidden. I'm not too concerned about super high strength.</p>

<p>The relevant tools I currently own are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A table saw, one of the cheap but relatively decent Ridgid ones.</li>
<li>A biscuit cutter, the Makita one.</li>
<li>A Kreg jig.</li>
<li>Tons of clamps of various sizes.</li>
<li>A portable bandsaw with a little table for it, although the miter slots aren't lined up properly with the blade.</li>
<li>A scroll saw.</li>
<li>A trim router, hand-held, with a makeshift table. 20000 RPM min speed and terrifying. In the table usually I just end up shooting large wooden projectiles across the room.</li>
<li>All the basic stuff, drills, hammers, chisels, various hand saws and such.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's countless ways to join corners in theory but in reality I'm actually really having a hard time with even the most basic stuff. The techniques I've tried so far have been mostly successful but <em>not quick or easy</em> -- at least not as quick and easy as I'd <em>like</em> them to be -- and also pretty error prone:</p>

<ul>
<li>Butt Joints:

<ul>
<li>Using glue only, do the <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tZikx.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">clamp-a-square-thing-into-the-corner</a> technique. I put wax paper in the corner to keep the square from being glued to the piece. Problems: 

<ul>
<li>It's actually very difficult to keep the joint flush and straight while at the same time somehow positioning the block in the corner, putting two clamps on, and not getting glue everywhere. It's <em>really</em> easy for this joint to become not flush any more.</li>
<li>It's impossible to wipe wet glue off the interior corner, and it tends to squeeze out and be forced along the wax paper and make a big mess.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Current best:</strong> Using glue only, use <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9XGRF.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">these 90 degree clamps</a>, one on top and one on the bottom. This is the best technique I've found so far, but it's still pretty rough. Problems:

<ul>
<li>It's tough to position the wood in the clamps so that the outside remains perfectly flush. It's totally doable, but takes more finesse than I want it to. It's a many-step process to get everything set up to be flush.</li>
<li>I only own 8 of these clamps, which means I can only glue up 1 drawer at a time. At $10 each I'd need to buy another $80 of hardware that I wouldn't really need for any other project just to raise my throughput to 2 drawers at a time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Biscuits for alignment: Should work in theory. Problems:

<ul>
<li>In practice it's very difficult because despite how often I've practiced with this thing, I have yet to discover a good technique for perfectly straight, positioned cuts on the <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7O2Cs.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">side that you have to cut into the face of</a> (i.e. the end-grain cut is easy, but I really have a hard time keeping the biscuit cutter straight and properly positioning the biscuit on the face cut).</li>
<li>It's tricky to design everything so that the biscuit doesn't interfere with the dado I've cut for the drawer's slide track.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Line up the butt joint, drill pilot holes, glue, and screw it together. Then remove the screws after the glue dries and plug the holes. The main problem with this is it takes forever, and still has the same difficulties holding the joint true and flush.</li>
<li>Pocket holes: The Kreg jig just doesn't do that well with 7/16"" thick material, it's a bit too thin, and the plywood tends to get torn apart. Plus, same alignment difficulties when driving the screws in. Also I have to use these just as temporary screws, because since the material is so thin the screw heads hang out past the face.</li>
<li>Nails to temporarily hold wood in place. Same set of problems as above + lots of bruised fingers. And the nails end up permanent, really hard to pull nails back out without tearing up the pieces. I don't want the nails to be visible on the outside.</li>
<li>Drill holes, insert dowels: Aesthetically acceptable but a huge pain and has same alignment issues as just putting screws in.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rabbetted corners: I can't actually figure out how to cut these quickly. I can do it on the table saw but making the two rabbets line up properly is way harder than it sounds. Also this doesn't really gain me anything at all in terms of speed or alignment ease over gluing the butt joints.</li>
<li>Tongue-and-groove variants: No idea how to cut these easily. Same difficulty getting the tongue and groove to line up properly as with the rabbets. Plus the plywood starts to become very weak and the thinner bits tend to snap off during assembly.</li>
</ul>

<p>So how can I do this, in reality, given that e.g. my grandfather hasn't been passing on his mystical woodworking knowledge to me for the last 35 years of my life? I'm just a normal person, not one of those legendary woodworking samurais who can hand-cut perfect dovetails in 5 seconds, while drunk, with their eyes closed.</p>

<p>I'm really struggling to find a quick and precise technique given my current set of tools and fine motor control skills. It's easy with large pieces but the 3"" x 7/16"" plywood seems to be introducing new challenges.</p>
","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Butt joints are inherently prone to shifting about as you're trying to clamp, glue is very lubricative and it's just two flat surfaces trying to slide past each other.</p>

<p>Like anything you'll get better at juggling things with practice and by slightly improving how you go about it. For example without any other changes to your current setup you could have an easier time of it, e.g. by using more and/or different clamps — quick clamps shift slightly at penultimate grip point, four smaller clamps allow for much less shifting or rotation than two large ones. But best and simplest of all, <em>clamping firmly to one board before you've even applied glue</em>. Yeah I didn't think of that last one early on either, obvious though it is.</p>

<p>In addition there are a few simple things that can really help you out here. The most simple being a larger block. If it's nearly the full 3"" height it gives you a much larger registration surface so reduces the ability of the drawer pieces to rotate on the horizontal axis.</p>

<p>One step up from this, build a dedicated right-angle clamping fixture specifically for this drawer size. Same basic benefit of the much larger block but slightly lighter and easier to manipulate.</p>

<p>Or best of all, make yourself a set of something like these:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o8QZI.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o8QZI.jpg"" alt=""Corner clamping jigs""></a></p>

<p>As I hope is clear from the picture you can form the grooves by glueing and screwing blocks in place on a base board, or routing crossing dados at a perfect 90°, whichever is simplest for you.</p>

<p>Also have a look at the version locked by wedges, such as <a href=""http://lumberjocks.com/projects/109202"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one on Lumberjocks</a>, reducing the number of clamps being tied up during the process to nearly zero.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's impossible to wipe wet glue off the interior corner, and it tends to squeeze out and be forced along the wax paper and make a big mess.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can try applying slightly less glue to the inside edge to try to limit squeeze-out on that edge, but the first thing I would do is ditch the wax paper. You can get away with this by relieving the inside corner of the block or clamping fixture, so the glue will just squeeze out and stay put (to be cleaned up later, at the rubbery stage or after hardening). </p>

<p>I think butt joints have a lot to recommend them for quick-and-dirty drawer construction where you don't need a lot of strength. It's very easy however to add something to them to take them up a notch, making the joint very much stronger while allowing for perfect registration during the glue-up.</p>

<p>Biscuits are obviously one of those. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's tricky to design everything so that the biscuits don't interfere with the dados I've cut for either the drawer tracks or the bottom panel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don't use two biscuits. A biscuit is a linear alignment aid already so inherently helps to keep things straight. Two is overkill on a 3"" joint face.</p>

<p>Dowels are another. </p>

<p>These are a favourite solution of mine because they're so simple and pre-date biscuits and Dominoes. They offer the same assurance of alignment, and reinforcement of the joint is just as good if not better, with the key benefit of requiring no specialist (expensive) equipment to be bought. At the most basic you can do it using one drill, one bit and some dowel rod*. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Drill holes, insert dowels: Aesthetically acceptable but a huge pain and has same alignment issues as just putting screws in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One or more of the above tips should solve your alignment issues but if you were forced to work without aids something you can do to make drilling easier is instead of drilling after glue has been applied to make the joint slippery, do it before. </p>

<p>It seems like one additional step that just adds to the workload but you could set up a production line to do the operation repeatedly (the heart of all mass production) and you'd work through them all in no time. Then come assembly time everything is ready to go, greatly speeding up that part of the operation so you'd probably have a net gain in speed.</p>

"Painting a kid's bed frame","267","","<p>I'm going to be building a bed frame for my daughter and would like to paint it. I want the finish to be durable (no chipping, and be able take some abuse from toys being hit against it), so am wondering what the best procedure is. I saw this <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3791/painting-a-built-in-bookcase"">similar question</a> but that didn't indicate if the built-ins would need to hold up to abuse from children.</p>

<p>The bed will probably be plywood and pine or poplar. My thought was to prime it, then put two or three (as needed for proper color coverage) coats of paint (most likely Sherwin Williams). Does it need more coats of paint, any polycrylic or similar sealant, sanding between? Would glossy be preferable to satin paint? Anything else I'm missing?</p>
","<p>No chipping at all is an unrealistic expectation, but obviously there are paints that are harder-wearing than others. In general if you can find a paint that specifically plugs its durability it will include an ingredient or additive that improves scratch-resistance and usually resistance to chipping as well. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bed will probably be plywood and pine or poplar. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps surprisingly the wood underneath the paint plays a part in how well the topcoat holds up if it's subject to knocks and scrapes. </p>

<p>In brief, the softer the wood is the more easily it can be dented and dents along edges and at corners are places where paint can crack and start to flake or peel off. </p>

<p>So given a choice between modern 'pine' (which can be a number of commercially grown softwoods, but all tend to be quite soft) and poplar I would suggest you go with poplar if the budget allows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My thought was to prime it, then put two or three (as needed for proper color coverage) coats of paint (most likely Sherwin Williams). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Priming is a good idea on general principle but I must add that wood is one material where priming is by no means a must-do, because paints in general bond <em>extremely</em> well to clean wood.... just <em>try</em> to get it off when you've made a mistake and you can see how well!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does it need more coats of paint</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two or three coats is almost always enough on interior pieces, but for high-traffic areas four might be worth the effort. </p>

<p>I would resist the urge to add more coats because weirdly past a certain point applying more coats doesn't incrementally add to the durability. For paints on woodwork once you pass about five coats the paintwork can end up <em>less</em> durable, not more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>any polycrylic or similar sealant, sanding between? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can apply a clear coating over paint but whether it's worth it depends on the paint really. Over certain paints varnish is a must-do if you need a wear-resistant finish, but interior trim paints and that sort of thing are specifically formulated to be a topcoat or final finish and have durability built in. </p>

<p>So as a rule you shouldn't need to use a varnish or other clear coating over paint if you pick the right type.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would glossy be preferable to satin paint? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably makes no significant difference. It's said that glossy paints are most durable but the difference between full gloss and satin/semi-gloss is likely to be minimal. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anything else I'm missing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All surfaces to be painted should be equally 'clean'. This isn't just about removing finger grease from handling, wood itself exudes stuff over time that can hinder the adhesion of paints (just as it does with glue).</p>

<p>So try to have all surfaces freshly sanded before painting. Just a light pass with fine-ish paper (280-320 grit) following the grain should be sufficient if there's no visible grubbiness. Obviously this is a lot of sanding so you can concentrate your effort on areas that will see wear, on the backs of panels etc. you can probably safely skip this.</p>

<p>If you go with primer your process might be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sand all important surfaces lightly.</li>
<li>Wipe off dust.</li>
<li>Apply primer and let it dry thoroughly.</li>
<li>Apply paint as per directions (see point below though). </li>
<li>Wait for the paint to dry/cure thoroughly before putting it into service. For waterbased paints I'd wait at least a couple of days, for oil-based paints I'd give it a week if you can.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that it can help to achieve a good finish if you slightly thin the paint, for the first coat or two at least (adding 5-15% of the appropriate solvent). It's usually wise not to exceed that level of dilution, especially for paints thinned with water, except for a first 'wash coat' or primer coat.</p>

<p>If you choose not to prime it might go something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sand all important surfaces lightly.</li>
<li>Wipe off dust.</li>
<li>Thin your paint approximately 30-50% <em>for the first coat only</em>.</li>
<li>Apply finish coats of paint just as above.</li>
<li>Wait for the paint to dry/cure as per the above.</li>
</ul>

"What other uses are there for a shop press?","267","","<p>I'm looking at possibly buying a shop press to use in making a skateboard deck (to shape the wood by pressing it into a mold), and as this is a tool I haven't seen used before, I'd like to ask: what other good uses does a shop press have in a woodworking shop?  Is it worth $100 for a little one, or $200 for a 20-ton press?</p>
","<p>If your need is to produce skateboards then I think the press would be a worthwhile investment given the prices you quote, but for just one (or occasional decks built periodically) then clamps can do what you require, with a little more effort. </p>

<p>Bigger clamps can exert enormous pressures and combined you could easily get to the pressing force of one of these presses. And you'll always find further uses for whatever clamps you get*, while the shop press will sit there taking up valuable space while you struggle to find other ways to make use of it. </p>

<p>Excluding pipe clamps which I don't think are applicable here C-clamps are the most powerful clamps woodworkers have available, but both larger C-clamps and well-made F-clamps are good candidates here.  8"" C-clamps can individually produce nearly 7,000 psi so it's easy enough to imagine what four of them spread around a forming jig or clamping caul might be able to do. </p>

<p>If you need a wider opening than an 8"" model will provide the clamping force goes up the larger the clamp is so you'll potentially have even higher pressures available to you if you have to go larger. But larger Cs are increasingly expensive and tend to be less useful (in addition be being very heavy) so F-clamps begin to make more sense if you need a large opening, and they're more versatile in woodworking. As well as being lighter of course they're faster to set and both can be boons in future clamping situations.</p>

"Drying Wood Methods","265","","<p><strong>What are the main ways of drying wood whether it be wood you milled into boards or just cut into turning blanks?</strong> </p>

<p>I have heard of sealing the end grain and then just leaving the piece to dry on it's own but then I believe there are even different ways to each of those. </p>

<p>Please share how you personally do it or how you have seen others do this.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I have heard of sealing the end grain and then just leaving the piece to dry on it's own but then I believe there are even different ways to each of those.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes that is the standard way of drying all wood, regardless of whether in board form or the type of piece that would be a turning blank. </p>

<p>The reason for sealing the end grain is to <em>slow</em> drying, since it is through the end grain that wood loses and takes on the most moisture.</p>

<p>As the goal is to get the wood to dry it seems counter-productive to do something that slows the process but unfortunately in most cases it is only by doing it slowly that you reduce the chances of various types of cracking defect and warpage. Force-drying as in a kiln is different since the wood is dried quickly but under controlled conditions. </p>

<p><strong>How to seal end grain</strong><br>
If you don't use a commercial product made for the purpose (e.g. Anchorseal) the best thing to use to seal end grain is melted wax. Any type of wax will do so no harm in going cheap. Most of the wax can be recovered though, scraped from the end grain, remelted and reused indefinitely so it won't work out too expensive if you use something like beeswax.</p>

<p>There is much help online on this in all the woodworking forums that says you can coat the end grain with anything, and almost inevitably the next words typed will be ""using latex paint"" (UK: household emulsion) but this is bad advice and needs to stop being repeated. Paint of this type is actually far too porous to provide a good seal. Is it better than nothing? Probably. Is it actually a good way to go though? No. </p>

<p>If doing it with molten wax isn't feasible or too much hassle and a product like Anchorseal too expensive the next best things to use are varnish or oil-based enamel paint, both of which form a good water barrier in a thick coating. Ideally you'd want to slop either one on heavily, and if you want to go to the trouble to apply more than one coat so much the better. </p>

<p>You won't regret sealing end grain too heavily. You're sure to regret it if you seal it too lightly.</p>

<p>Note that with boards you usually (nearly always) dry them flat, <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/636/what-does-stickering-wood-mean"">stickered</a> but with one or two species that are prone to staining the convention is to dry them vertically, which if you're doing it yourself will usually mean leaning against a wall. With turning blanks as well as with sticks it's quite common to dry them upright.</p>

<p><strong>Speeding drying at home</strong><br>
You can sometimes get away with speeding up drying wood with smaller pieces. There is still the chance of checks, particularly with rounds or small log sections, but in general the smaller a piece of wood the less the risk. One of the best methods to do this at home on a small scale is using your microwave, but you may decide to buy a cheap second microwave for this purpose only if you do this regularly. Read more about that in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1367/can-i-use-a-conventional-oven-or-toaster-oven-as-something-similar-to-a-dry-kiln/1374#1374"">Can I use a conventional oven or toaster oven as something similar to a dry kiln?</a></p>

"How can I match a finish on furniture when re-finishing?","263","","<p>I have two pieces of maple furniture, a desk with a large water stain, and a kitchen table with minor scratches an exposed wood. My problem is my wife <strong>loves</strong> the finishes on these pieces of furniture, so ideally what ever finish I use will match what is already there.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions for insuring the new finish you are apply matches the character of the piece as is?</p>

<p>Both pieces of furniture are manufactured by Room &amp; Board and where bought second hand. Based on similar looking pieces of furniture on the R &amp; B website, the finish is ""lacquer"". I would describe the desk as having a more ""natural look"" with a very light gloss, not so much as painted on the surface, but soaked in. I would describe the table as having a bit more gloss, a more painted on the surface feel, but still a ""natural look"".  Both pieces seem easy to damage (scratch,  water stain, etc...), but the desk is particularly bad. (Note: This is not something I am looking to chance I am just reporting this for description services.) </p>

<p>Below are some pictures. Thanks!
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3jd5u.jpg"" alt=""table"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/y1jKX.jpg"" alt=""desk"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ND0Oh.jpg"" alt=""table up close""></p>
","<p>The water stain on the desk looks like it could be blush in the lacquer itself rather than damage to the wood. Blushing is caused by moisture trapped in the finish. There are a number of ways to address it, but the goal is always to allow the moisture to escape. Some ideas I've read about in the past:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>mild abrasive:</strong> Rubbing the affected area with toothpaste or other mild abrasive can remove just enough of the surface of the finish to allow trapped moisture to escape.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>heat:</strong> Careful application of heat from a heat gun can drive out moisture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>oil:</strong> Rubbing with mineral oil or even (sounds crazy) mayonnaise is supposed to let oil seep in and displace trapped water. (I'd go with mineral oil over mayo.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>solvent:</strong> Like the abrasive, the idea is to remove just enough of the surface to let the moisture out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>more lacquer:</strong> A fresh coat of lacquer will include some solvent, so probably works like the solvent option above.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, for the desk I'd try some of the options above on a small area starting with the lowest impact (heat, mild abrasive).</p>

<p>It's hard to see any real damage to the table in the photo, but it does look like the table has a clear finish rather than something with color. Lacquer finishes have a hard resin component dissolved in some solvent. They're easier to repair than finishes that cure (like epoxy or boiled linseed oil) because the solvent in the new layer partially dissolves the resin in the old layer, allowing the two layers to merge into one. To repair the table, I'd pick up a spray can of clear lacquer finish that has about the right sheen (matte, semigloss, etc.). Test on a hidden area first to make sure the new stuff is compatible with the old, of course. Spray the affected areas, let dry, and use steel wool or very fine sandpaper to adjust the sheen so that the repaired areas blend with the rest.</p>

If so with what? Use a piece of hardware to straddle a piece of wood and clamp onto it, giving me a D loop on top? ...does that hardware even exist...?</p>

<p>The constraint that is fairly rigid, given this project, is that the piece is suspended from above by cables or something similar. The piece weighs about 200 pounds, it's about 12 feet across, and will be held by about 20 or so cables.</p>

","<p>Consider adding triangular corner gussets. According to the diagram you show, these could go on the inside of the corners, near the top. You could brad nail these to the piece, and then secure decent sized eye bolts or hooks through the gussets to take the suspension wires.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Here's <a href=""http://railwaybobsmodulebuildingtips.blogspot.com/2010/01/triangular-corner-gussets.html"" rel=""nofollow"">a site with some pointers on the technique.</a></p>

<p>Just using 4 corners would put you at about 50 lbs per gusset, which should work fine with, say, #4 wire (about 1.5 mm thick, 85 lbs breaking strain). </p>

<p>If you want more attachments, you could either double up on the attachments to the corners - running two wires to each bolt, say - or add one or more blocks along the edges of the piece and mount more bolts. </p>

<p>I'd recommend just going after the corners. Also, if this is important to you, please do <em>test</em> your rig on a dummy work. If nothing else, make a hollow frame and hang it with milk or soda bottles filled with water to get the weight.</p>

"Is the wood worm active or not?","260","","<p>I live in India [tamilnadu]. Recently we are building our new home with wooden frames for the windows and doors, but the wood being used contains strange markings. When asking the carpenter about it, he reported that they were the rings of the tree. Typically I don't trust him because it had small holes within them. The wood being used is country wood [African] which the carpenter bought for making the frames and doors. I've attached the photos taken around most of the places where I find them as bug active zones.</p>

<p>For my satisfaction, I went to many places to verify whether it's worm active or bug affected. Something like that. I got a 50/50 answer, half I consulted said it was active but half denied it. </p>

<p>Also to note.  Even if there were worms, most lumber is heat treated to remove moisture and this process should kill any worms living in the wood at the time.  I suspect most wood shipped internationally will have something like this done, just to prevent new bugs from infesting new shores.  </p>

<p>As one of the comments pointed out, the biggest thing to look for is if there are new holes or fresh sawdust showing continued activity.  But ultimately, most worms eat the wood, turn into an adult and leave.  Once gone, unlikely to lay new eggs on 'dead' wood like that.  </p>

"What is the proper humidity for a shop and how should I achieve it?","260","","<p>I'm off to build my own workshop for mostly woodworking projects in the (huge) basement garage of a very old house. The garage is about 5 by 30 meters(16 by 100 ft) and has a varying height of 3 to 6 meters (10 to 20 ft). It has just a huge garage door (approx 4 by 4 meters (13ft)) and no windows. </p>

<p>I haven't gotten around to test all the corners for their average humidity, but I fear that it may vary quite drastically from season to season (Central Europe) and even be different in various locations inside the place.</p>

<p>I think I'd be aiming for <strong>somewhere around 40%</strong>?!? in average humidity and hope that to the rear of the room (which is basically a dead end tunnel) the humidity will drop and I can store and dry my lumber there.</p>

<p>In winter I will probably heat the place up with a gas powered heater as it's fast and relatively cheap but I fear that this will cause fast and rapid changes in humidity -> which I think is quite bad.</p>
","<p>There's a lot written about the ideal conditions for the workshop but you have to be careful about the source since the figures quoted aren't as universal as sometimes implied or stated, some sources not taking into account very different conditions to theirs (much drier or much damper). </p>

<p>Yes. The bottom line is this, proper humidity for a workshop depends on where you are. It should match, or be close to, the typical humidity of domestic interiors where you live if you're making pieces for the home. </p>

","<p>My dad put plastic caster wheels on the twin beds he made for my brother and I as kids (granted, these were not bunk beds).  On carpet, the wheels made enough of a dimple that it took a bit of pushing to get them to move out of the dimple.  On wood floor, it will be much easier to push.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only concern I have is if the child leans against the wall while on top and the bed pushed out. Allowing the child to fall between the bed and wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a valid concern.  You could mitigate it by adding a railing on the wall-side of the bed, or possibly tying the bed to the wall when your wife doesn't need to change the sheets.  If you live in a seismic area (looking at you California), tying a bunk bed to the wall might be a good idea anyway.</p>

<p>From a purely mechanics point of view, adding casters won't make the bed more tippy than if it had plain legs.  It would just feel more unstable since it can move side to side.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This risk could be reduced with casters that can lock.</p>

<p>Depending on the floor you have, this might not make a big difference.  Plastic sliding on wood has a pretty low coefficient of friction.  It will be harder than if the wheels weren't locked, but not much.</p>

<p>You could also use some sort of chock block to keep the wheels from moving, similar to what you should do to a car when jacking it up for maintenance.</p>

<p>You can, in theory at least, completely seal off wood from the elements but it's really only possible using epoxy and even with that it must be applied at a substantial thickness with no pinholes or gaps in the finish.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No. </p>

<p>Wood doesn't expand and contract much with changes in temperature only (not enough to care about). </p>

<p>The reason temperature generally matters is that higher air temperatures often go hand in hand with higher humidity, lower temperatures with lower humidity, and it is its <em>internal water level that makes wood change dimension</em>. </p>

<p>That would depend on if you designed the piece so that wood movement isn't allowed for :-)</p>

<p>It's an attractive idea, that we can seal off wood from moisture in the air to make it as stable as possible, but in reality it's a PITA to do and <em>it's just not necessary</em>. Only where it hasn't been allowed for is it an issue..... such as in cheap furniture built from dimensional lumber using bad plans provided free on the Internet -_- It's worth remembering that virtually everything that's ever been built from wood expands and contracts and it's not a problem because allowance has been made for it. </p>

<p>Where you want or need to make something that doesn't change dimension you shouldn't use wood, not solid wood at least. MDF or plywood are very good options to make something that looks like wood but is more dimensionally stable and of course there are now a wealth of synthetic materials to pick from as well.</p>

"Hitachi electric miter saw leaves a strange, slightly undulating non-square edge","258","","<p>I own a Hitachi C10FCE2 10-inch miter saw, it is my first miter saw. I'm a woodworking beginner but learning fast. I recently installed a ""Makita A-93681 10-Inch 80 Tooth Micro Polished Mitersaw Blade"" to replace the pretty crappy blade it came with.</p>

<p>I just noticed today while cutting some 3/4"" cherry for a box that the miter saw isn't cutting a flat edge, even though the edge seems to be square. I've calibrated all of my tools to an obsessive degree. I have several accurate engineer's squares, double squares and combo squares that all agree with each other, and they (plus a digital angle gauge) all agree that the miter saw blade is perfectly perpendicular to the back fence and the floor. I didn't really expect a discrepancy, so I hadn't been meticulously checking the resulting wood. Thus, I don't actually know whether this problem has always been here, or if it appeared some time down the line. I only bought it a few months ago, and the blade just a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>The ""problem"" I speak of is not that the cuts are off square in the traditional sense. A try square doesn't show significant deviation from square. However, when I place the two halves of a fresh-cut bit of wood together, they don't line up smoothly along the entire surface. There's sort of a gap there that is most prominent on one side. There's also some blade marks that are deeper than they should be, so much so that I can feel some parts of the end grain are a few thous higher than others.</p>

<p>I switched to my crosscut sled after noticing the problem and my ends are nice and square and flat again. Does anyone know what this is, if it can be fixed or if I need to dump the saw and/or the blade? Is it my technique, machine setup/calibration, a hardware fault or something else like I messed up installing the blade? If the blade is the culprit, I might still be in the return window for Amazon. If I had a shooting board I'd probably just clean up my ends, but until then I depend on a clean cut right off the saw.</p>

<p>FYI, all parts of the saw are tight with no play/wiggle where there shouldn't be. My technique is to push the wood against the back fence and down on the widest part of the saw bed, clamp the wood down, spin the saw up to speed, slowly drop the saw through the wood while applying light pressure down and back to keep it square, stop when it reaches bottom, wait for it to stop, then lift it.</p>

<p>I took some pictures of the gap and also the end grain, though the saw marks probably don't even show up in the pics.

"How brittle is carbide?","257","","<p>I have Carbide grade tools like router bits, saw blades, etc. like everybody else. There are grades C2, C3 and C4, most of my tools are C3. They do say that it is brittle and if it hits the ground or something it shatters. I have dropped it a few times by accident but they never have broken before. Which makes me have the question as to how much it takes to break the carbide of the tools. Does it take a certain amount of pressure (like pounds or something) of impact for the carbide to shatter? Or is the cracking so small that I have no idea because it is so hard to see?</p>
","<p>It depends what it falls on :)</p>

<p>When I worked with a CNC mill, letting the tool drop 30cm from the spindle onto the steel worktable would practically inevitably chip it.</p>

<p>OTOH they would occasionally roll off the utility table about 120cm tall, onto linoleum floor and I never chipped one that way.</p>

<p>Also, the damage is usually small and localized; a ~1mm chipped corner or such - hard to notice unless you inspect the tool closely. It matters a lot with precise machining of small metal elements, but may go unnoticed with large tools for woodworking.</p>

<p>edit: (I finished reading the question.) The tools are very durable against constant pressure type stress, very hard and difficult to break. They are vulnerable to shock though - impact against a hard object, and with  carbide tools ""hard"" needs to be really hard - brass counts as ""soft"".</p>

"How do I align threaded inserts","257","","<p>I'm making a box with 1/2"" thick sides. One face of the box has to (occasionally) be removable, so I'm intending to use threaded inserts. </p>

<p>The face of the box (and the edges it aligns to) hasn't been drilled yet.</p>

<p>How do I ensure that the holes in the face align with the threaded inserts? I have the usual shop tools - drill press, etc., plus the tool to insert the threaded inserts. Getting the inserts in straight isn't a problem - getting them lined up is the issue.</p>
","<p>You can do this in two ways that I can think of. Actually three, since you could do this in the most basic way of all — using standard marking procedures if you're careful, just as dowel holes used to be done back in the old days (and they didn't even have the benefit of through holes).</p>

<p>The second is to drill a small pilot hole into the face piece, position it against the sides of the box (much as when transferring marks from tail board to pin board when dovetailing) and then push the drill bit or a matching scratch awl/ice pick through that pilot hole until it makes a definite mark in the other piece of wood. This is now perfectly in line with the existing hole, you then drill the holes for the threaded inserts as normal using these reference holes.</p>

<p>Whichever of these two options you were using once you have your marks it's vital to have no shift at all during the drilling operation, so workpieces must be firmly clamped up and ideally use a drill press/bench drill for the drilling. This <em>can</em> be done using a hand-held power drill or even a hand drill of some sort if you use a jig of some kind to ensure the drill is held perfectly square.</p>

<p><strong>Third option, no threaded inserts</strong><br>
Fit the front to the three-sided box and clamp up. Drill the front boards and the side boards in a single operation, then drill, ream out, sand or file the holes in the front boards so they just give clearance to the threads on the bolt or screw you'll be using to hold it in place. </p>

<p>Now position the front board and clamp it in place (you're using its holes as guides for the next operation) and thread the holes in the sides <em>using the bolt/screw itself</em>. You can force them in if the threads are not too coarse and the wood isn't too hard, or <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1716/how-can-you-make-a-regular-screw-into-a-self-tapping-screw/1735#1735"">modify the bolt or screw to be self-tapping</a> if you prefer (the safer option). </p>

<p>In either case it's worth squeezing the wood with a clamp to help prevent it splitting.</p>

<p>Threading made directly in wood by either method can be surprisingly robust and last years of regular use, particularly in harder woods that aren't too brittle. On softer woods the threading can be greatly strengthened by running some thin superglue into the hole after the threads are formed. </p>

<hr>

<p>*Chuck the rod (or a bolt with the head cut off) into a drill and run it, rotating, against a coarse belt sander or grinder wheel. A sharp point that should be perfectly aligned with the centre line of the threaded rod will be created in a surprisingly short time.</p>

"Best way to make a small detachable ramp on a dog house?","256","","<p>I hope you guys bear with me on this as it's a little bit of a silly project. I'm mainly doing it to practice some joinery. My aunt has a Pomeranian and she's wanting me to make something better for him than a blanket on the floor.</p>

<p>They have a lot of beach themed stuff, so my thought was to make a little indoor dog house that looks like a beach house. Beach houses tend to be up on stilts, so you can park underneath and it won't flood. I'm going to do the framing with 2""x2"". I plan to have it 2' square at the outside. I will have a floor downstairs that has a little built in food and water dish. Upstairs will be a pad for sleeping on and a little fan in the ceiling they can turn on if he's warm.</p>

<p>My issue is that the dog is scared of steps and while he can mount them, he's typically scared to. He'll stand at the bottom and bark till someone carries him up them. In this vain I want to build a ramp. It'll need to rise ~2' from the floor to the level of the second floor. I'm figuring all measurement based on him plus clearance. he's roughly 8"" wide when his hair is grown out, so I figure the ramp will be 12"" wide. </p>

<p>I plan to attach safety rails and I've figured them out already. I'm also going to add grip tape to the ramp. I think it'll give solid traction and make it look like a boardwalk. My current plan is to use the some triple-ply plywood as the ramp. I figured I could use a flat hinge at each point where bends. That way, instead of trying to get the angles perfect, it'll just go where it needs. I thought to support it, I could cut a 6"" piece of the 2""x2"" and drill a hole through it's center and the vertical leg. Then run a bolt through to the other side to secure it. The platforms at the top bottom and corner would rest on these.</p>

<p>I would permanently attach these to the dog house, but my fear is that this is going to be almost 3' wide exactly. Most exterior doors are 3' and at best it'll probably scrape the door or the house. If the ramp was only on one side, it wouldn't be an issue, but due to his small stature and the rise, I think I need to use two sides to give the ramp a gentler rise. I'm also not in love with the way I want to attach it, since it will look bad. I could possibly use an L-bracket, but I don't want it to stand out and I think removing the screws too often would bore the holes out over time. I will be painting the frame, probably white, so I could cover something like that.</p>

<p>I just haven't had anything hit me. Do you guys know of a good way to make this ramp and have it detachable? Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Combination Core</strong></p>

<p>There are two types of Combination Core construction. The first type consists of a center veneer core and a crossband veneer on both sides of the center with a layer of MDF, particleboard, or hardboard under the face and back veneer. The second type consists of an oriented strand board or wafer board center with a veneer crossband on both sides, under the face and back veneer. Combination Core can be used when the project calls for consistent flatness and good screw-hold ability, without the weight of a MDF or particleboard core.</p>

<p><strong>Lumber Core</strong></p>

<p>Lumber edge glued into a solid slab is considered Lumber Core. Lumber Core plywood is most often found in the construction of import panels, usually only 18mm thickness panels. Lumber Core plywood consists of a face &amp; back veneer, then a layer of crossband veneer, with the edge glued lumber in the center. Lumber Core plywood should be used for the bending strength and screw-hold ability. The ability of Lumber Core plywood to bounce back makes it an excellent choice when constructing long or wide shelves in cabinets or closets.</p>

<p><strong>MDF Core</strong></p>

<p>Medium Density Fiberboard Core has the most uniform thickness and consistency of any panel core. The face and back veneer are glued directly to the MDF Core without the need for a crossband veneer. The consistency in thickness and flatness makes MDF Core panels the preferred choice for 32mm construction.</p>

<p>Particleboard Core panels are constructed similar to MDF Core panels, with the face &amp; back veneers glued directly to the core. Particleboard Core lays flat like MDF, but does not have the screw-hold strength of other cores. Particleboard Core is the least expensive of all core types.</p>

<p><strong>Veneer Core</strong></p>

<p>Veneer Core plywood consists of a center veneer and crossband veneers alternately layered on both sides of the center to the desired thickness producing an odd number of veneers for the core. The weight-bearing strength of Veneer Core plywood is excellent along with its bending strength and screw-hold ability. Veneer core panels are lighter in weight than any other core type.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XhFNv.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XhFNv.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In addition, the veneer on the panel can be cut one of two ways.</p>

<p><strong>Plain Sliced</strong></p>

<p>Plain slicing a log occurs when a log is only turned a few inches at a time when slicing it, versus a constant turn and peeling method used for Rotary Cut veneer. Plain Sliced veneer produces a cathedral grain pattern, similar to the pattern produced when plain sawn lumber is produced. Plain Sliced veneer is cut along the growth rings, producing the highest yield of any “slicing” method.</p>

<p><strong>Rotary</strong></p>

<p>Rotary is the process of peeling the entire long. Turning the log, while shaving the veneer as it turns produces Rotary Cut veneer. This process is the only cutting method that is capable of producing whole piece face veneers. Rotary cut will yield veneer with a broad grain pattern with no plain sliced or quartered appearance. Rotary cut veneers are used in the majority of panels produced in North America. This process yields the most veneer per log and is usually less expensive than sliced veneer.</p>

"Should I locate a centralized dust collector in a roof crawlspace above a garage shop?","254","","<p>I live in a single story home with an integrated garage shop.  I'm considering leveraging the crawlspace above the ceiling as a mounting point for a centralized DC.  Running the lines within the crawlspace would be preferable to messing up my shop with all that PVC.  I'd also like the idea of having the additional sound barrier.</p>

<p>Operating temperatures are a concern as it gets HOT up there.  I was thinking about placing a small remote camera to monitor the dust bin... However I'm not sure that this is really realistic as most of the containers are steel.</p>

<p>I was also thinking about cutting out and mounting a drop-down stair system for dust retrieval.</p>
","<p>Unless there is a space concern within the shop area, I'd keep the dust collection bin inside the shop, but run the PVC piping up through this crawl space. In other words, run the PVC directly up into the ceiling and then through the crawl space over to a central point where you'd have a down pipe going to your collection vacuum. </p>

<p>There are two potential issues with keeping the dust bin up in this space. One is space itself. A dust collection vacuum and bag are usually fairly large, larger than what a ""crawlspace"" would lend itself to. Secondly, if you can fit the bag up there, when it's full it's going to be big, bulky, and heavy. Getting the collection material out of there is going to be very tough. Even with a drop down stair, this is not going to be an easy or fun proposition. If you have a dust collection bag which is small enough to fit in the area you are talking about, you'll be in the position of having to clean it out on a very regular basis. You'll also have to ensure the roof structure is strong enough to support the weight of the collection vacuum as well as the load of dust when the bag is full. </p>

<p>On a separate note, if heat build-up is a factor in this space, I'd suggest you install an attic fan to draw out the heat. There are plenty of options out there for this and are fairly easy to install ... once you get past the idea of cutting a very large hole in a perfectly good roof.</p>

"Getting sanded poly slurry out of wood grains","250","","<p>I am towards the end of finishing a bench that has paduak.  The wood (I found out after the fact) is quite oily and so the finish takes forever to dry.  It also turns out that it loses its red color over time, so I won't be purchasing it again.</p>

<p>I waited on the finish for a couple of days and it finally hardened (total of about 4-5 coats of arm-r-seal gloss rubbed on.</p>

<p>Afterwards to prepare for the final coats I wet sanded the finish with 600 grit and soapy water.  Unfortunately the slurry has settled into the wood pores.  It appears very white when the piece is dry.  </p>

<p>I have tried using mineral spirits to get it out.  It looks fine with the mineral spirits on, but once it dries the white shows back up in the pores.  This gives me hope that maybe if not completely cleaned out, it will not be so visible with a layer of finish.</p>

<p>Anyone got any experience that can chime in?  Thanks, john</p>
","<p>The white residue is abraded varnish, settled in the low spots. Ideally this should be rinsed or wiped away as the final stage in the wet-sanding before moving on to the next step. A damp microfibre cloth is an excellent tool for doing this, but just flushing the surface with water and any cloth will get rid of it, just as everyone had to do before microfibres came along :-) I've even seen some finishers using their hand as a type of squeegee when wiping the surface down, although I'm not convinced this is better than using a cloth.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes exactly so. When you apply varnish this is said to wet the surface and the effect as you've now seen is permanent. This is much the same as the difference between bare sanded wood, which looks pale and dry, and the richer colouring once the first coat of any finish goes on, wetting the surface fibres. Note that the wood is still said to be 'wet' by the finish after it has dried.</p>

<p>Some addition points:</p>

<p><strong>Do all your sanding in one go</strong><br>
You can do all of your sanding at the end, so rather than sanding to prepare the surface for the final coats as you've referred to you are smoothing off and perfecting (""flatting off"") the surface of the varnish. </p>

<p>Sanding between coats isn't necessary unless you're removing dust nibs or other defects — on most finishes it is <em>not</em> needed to ensure bonding between one coat and the next. All excessive sanding between coats is doing is removing finish you don't need to remove and slowing down the whole process.</p>

<p>Bit more on this here:<br>
<a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1420/leveling-a-finish-finishing-the-finish/1421#1421"">Leveling a finish/finishing the finish</a>  </p>

<p><strong>Grain fill/pore fill</strong><br>
You can fill the wood prior to applying the final finish to minimise the potential for this problem. If the wood's surface is very flat and smooth to begin with you won't easily have any low spots that can harbour sanding residue.</p>

<p>With varnish, which can have a very substantial body so it builds thickness well, you can fill grain using the finish itself (often done by luthiers for example, usually with shellac in that case but the same principle applies with most film finishes). </p>

<p>Another option is to sort of do both things at once, by sanding in the first coat of varnish. This creates a slurry of wood dust and varnish, which is an excellent grain filler and of course you have no worries about any compatibility issues between the fill material and your final finish since they share the same binder.</p>

"Flush trim Router bit question","246","","<p>I have seen the flush trims that are either flat or normal if you will then they have some that are up-cut or down-cut. What is the main purpose with these? what makes them so special compared to a normal flush trim?</p>
","<p>The key to spiral bits is in the way they handle the waste material. Flush trim bits are intended to flatten an exposed edge of a board.  The bits usually have a roller matching the diameter of the bit above or below the bit and use an edge guide or template to trace the profile of the edge on the work board.  Spiral up-cut and down-cut bits are used primarily in plunge conditions away from the edges of the project board.  They differ in the direction of their spiral twist and how they handle the waste.  Up-cut bits move the material out of the wood or up towards the router bit, while down-cut bits move the material in the opposite direction. For that reason waste tends to clog up the operational area of the wood more. So why have the options?</p>

<p>First consider the orientation of your router.  In hand held operations the router is oriented with the bit at the bottom. If the board had a clock face and the router is lowered onto the work piece, the bit turns clockwise.  The up-cut spiral works to lift the wood disturbed by the rotating bit to turn with the rotation and lift the waste up and out. The opposite is true for down-cut bits.</p>

<p>Up-cuts are desirable for plunging deeper into a piece of wood.  The waste material is lifted out of the work area preventing clogging which can actually break a bit in a deep plunge.  Unfortunately, the lifting action of the bit will also cause fraying at the edges which can be unsightly.  Up-cut bits are often used for cutting mortises and the edges of the opening are usually covered by shoulders on the tenon piece so the fraying is not noticeable.  </p>

<p>Down-cut bits force the material down and create a much cleaner edge.  Since they are not removing the waste it is necessary to move much slower with shallow cuts and frequent stops to remove accumulated waste. Down-cut bits are more useful for shallow dadoes or rabbets, exposed slots or grooves.</p>

"How to increase maximum load capacity of a table?","246","","<p>I've never worked with wood before but would like to create my very first desk. </p>

<p>Please let me know if this is a good idea and how to improve upon it! </p>

<p>It states the maximum load capacity is 110lbs (50kg) but I'd like to increase it to like 170-200 lbs (80-90kg) so I can be sure my computer and monitors won't be stressing it. I might occasion put pressure from leaning on the table so I want to be extra sure it won't strain. </p>

<p>I'd love to build it on my own but I don't have any proper tools and getting a sheet of wood that is thick enough is difficult. If anyone could comment on the above idea or have recommendations, please let me know!</p>
","<p>First of all, the 110 pounds they say for that desk almost certainly is being very conservative, it will probably actually hold at least twice that.  That being said, we can look at the ways it can fail and help mitigate each of those.</p>

<p>Looking at the specs on that desk , the top material is probably the weak point.  Putting a lot of weight over the middle of the desk could over stress the top itself causing it to break.  The easiest fix there is to put more of the weight directly over the legs.  If you want to strengthen the center, you can affix ribbing to the bottom to help spread the weight.  I wouldn't really expect that to work well in this case due to the fact that there isn't much material on the top to attach to - it is really just a thin torsion box.</p>

<p>This thin top material will lead to another probably source of failure - lateral movement.  If you apply much lateral force in either the X or Y plane, the fasteners holding the legs in will probably fail cause the table to collapse.  Since the legs are metal, there probably isn't a 'good' way to give them lateral bracing.  You could use some angle brackets and attach the desktop to a wall so that it cannot easily more side to side or front to back.  This coupled with keeping the weight above the legs would probably be your best bet.</p>

<p>He attaches guides on either side of the board that is to be planed/jointed and builds himself a sled for his router with which he subsequently takes many passes over the board to make the board's surface flat. I recommend watching it though for my answer to make easier sense.</p>

<p>While using the router table would work similarly as his method, i think you would still need the screwed in/glued on guides on both sides. The downside of using the table is that you don't see what you are planing/jointing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What modifications would I need to do to the router fence (maybe?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None at the fence as you build a secondary fence attached to your piece of wood.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there an easy way to set the bit to the right depth?</p>

<p>Yes and no. You would search for the high-point of your piece and set the router to take away only a little bit, probably 2 mm (1/16th of an inch). Then you would increase the depth step by step for little increments until the piece is flat. Drawing a raster onto the wood with a pencil helps to see what has already been taken away.</p>

"Tenon dimensions and orientation","242","","<p>I'm joining 4x4's in a tee with a mortise &amp; tenon, and am not sure what the dimensions should be. Everywhere I've looked has either contradictory or nonsensical information, so I thought I'd add some more noise to the giant archive that is the Internet.</p>

<p>So, in the table that I am building:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WpCPG.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WpCPG.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>BUT, it feels like the bottom/left joint should be vertically aligned, as the longer dimension of the tenon would provide more torque resistance. If I do that, though, there won't be much material left outside of the mortise on top and bottom, so THAT seems stupid.</p>

<p>Am I correct? (As in, is my Sketchup wrong, and the bottom-most board should be rotate 90 degrees?)</p>

<p>Also, I'm unsure of the correct mortise / tenon dimensions when joining two 4x4s. I've seen references to 1/3 of the stock depth, five times tenon length, etc. Most of these seem to be written by and for people who already understand how this works. Much like the EE textbooks in undergrad, such explanations are useless to me.</p>

<p>Help?</p>

<p>My geometry-saturated brain (game developer) tells me to make the tenons 1 3/4"" square and deep and call it a day, but I really don't want to make my wife a new table in 3 years if this sags / cracks / whatever.</p>
","<p>You really don't need to over-think this. Let me emphasise that for you, you <em>really</em> don't need to. Even the most modest of tenons provides a very strong joint (assuming it is well cut and glued naturally) and as mentioned in previous Answers many traditional joints are over-engineered for strength.</p>

<p>To give two practical examples of why you don't need to over-analyse this, take the dowelled or the modern Domino version of the same joints you have here. In their respective ways they both sort of simulate a mortise-and-tenon joint, the dowels or Domino acting as tenons and their drilled holes as mortises. It's quite common for both to give <em>significantly</em> less glue surface area than a M&amp;T joint on the same members, but yet each give sufficiently strong joints in service that this isn't an issue. </p>

<p>If they're good enough then it shows that most of the time even a slightly undersized tenon will do, so no need to follow a rule laid down in print to the letter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>contradictory information</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case it reflects that there isn't just one way you can go. A lot of woodworking is like this unfortunately so you have to get used to their being no One Good Way to do <em>anything</em>.</p>

<p>For mortise-and-tenon jointer there isn't just one set of proportions that work best, any more than there's one <em>style</em> of M&amp;T that is always suitable*.</p>

<p>A tenon approximately 1/3 of the thickness of the material is a useful rule of thumb, and for a lot of work you can just apply this principle and you won't have any problems. But for thinner material it's fine (actually desirable) to make the tenon thicker than this proportionally. </p>

<p>And on very thick material because the tenon is going to be so beefy anyway it's already very strong. <em>And it wouldn't have been uncommon to size the mortise to the widest chisel available.</em> The tenon would then be cut accordingly. Even if this meant the tenon ended up 1/4 or 1/5 the thickness of that piece it's often no big deal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BUT, it feels like the bottom/left joint should be vertically aligned, as the longer dimension of the tenon would provide more torque resistance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As drawn is the way this would usually be done traditionally in simpler joinery (many variations are possible, with some cabinetmakers choosing to use what seem like the most difficult and complicated versions possible .....just to torture their apprentices perhaps LOL). </p>

<p>The torque resistance thing may or may not be true, but anyway M&amp;T joinery is already strong in this way. The main thing is how much torque does it actually need to resist? Once the table is fully assembled, very little more than likely. The joints throughout a piece mutually support each other by locking the structure into a given shape so individual joints can be weaker/less strong without significantly undermining the overall strength.</p>

<p>*In almost every case more than one style would be equally suitable. Fox-wedged, wedged through-tenons, drawbored tenons and one or two others probably give joints that are close to equally strong, without any real strength advantage. It becomes more a case of traditional or personal preference which way you go. Always remembering that as far as furniture is concerned they're probably stronger than actually needed in every instance.</p>

","<p>It is probable that the joint is stronger where it is glued than in the surrounding wood. The original crack was most likely due to the nail so placing another nail could apply pressure to the adjacent wood risking a similar crack.  Drilling the gue out will help, but you will want to keep the hole smaller so that the nail gets a firm grip.  The firmer the grip, the more pressure exerted on the wood.  One alternative is to drill the hole to accommodate a exterior coated wood screw. A screw will provide greater holding power to join the wood pieces and I believe will provide less overall stress in the cracked area.</p>

<p>Oh and also from many furnitures I've seen before, there's ugly brush strokes on the finishes, is there anyway I can prevent it and have a smooth finish?</p>
","<p>This is a <em>massive</em> topic, and I'm personally not well equipped to completely answer it, just approaching the novice &rarr; intermediate transition myself (nor would I attempt to -- volumes of books by hundreds of authors have been written about this over hundreds of years), but maybe I can at least point you to a few resources on here that might help you with your immediate problems.</p>

<p>First, before that, a lot can be learned by <em>experimenting</em>. Not on your actual piece of course; but just get some scrap wood and go to town. You don't want to know how enormous my pile of scrap finishing samples is.</p>

<p>Anyways, from one beginner to another:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So from what I understand, this is the process of finishing wood (excluding the sanding part). Stain, then apply finish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some terminology:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Finish"" is the entire collection of things you do to your raw wood to get its surface to its final form, which may include stain if you use it.</li>
</ul>

<p>And about sanding:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's a hot topic. More experienced woodworkers understand that constantly sanding between every coat of whatever is a bit overkill, even if products advise it in their instructions. Over time, I have confirmed this for myself. Sanding as a first step, however, is of course pretty useful and typical. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>And the finish that I can choose from are shellac, polyurethane, lacquer and varnish. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are others (e.g. paint, or various oils, like linseed or teak, and you need not put a stain on first if it gets you the looks you're going for), and even within those there are subcategories, e.g. oil- or water-based polyurethane, polycrylic, spar urethane/varnish, oil- or water-based stains, etc.</p>

<p>Also be careful with the term ""varnish"". Colloquially it's meaning has expanded and personally I find it to be confusing in conversation unless I make sure everybody is on the same page first. <a href=""http://www.diffen.com/difference/Polyurethane_vs_Varnish"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This page sums it up</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Varnish is an older type of finish made from resins, oils, and solvents, but very often, the term ""varnish"" is misused as a generic name for all types of wood finishing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the ones you identify, the best I can do is point you to <a href=""http://www.diynetwork.com/how-to/skills-and-know-how/painting/whats-the-difference-between-polyurethane-varnish-shellac-and-lacquer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this nice little write-up</a>. From my own limited experience, maybe this will help:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Shellac (dewaxed): A nightmare, never useful to me, not for the faint of heart. The only way I've ever figured out how to apply it smoothly is wipe-on, <em>heavily</em> diluted, about a dozen coats. It dries extremely fast, and doesn't really offer much protection against anything, although it does look nice. I went through a phase where for some reason I tried to use shellac for <em>everything</em>, mostly I was lured in by its fast dry times -- looking back, my success rate was 0%. The only thing I actually use it for now is coating the work surface of random MDF jigs to keep it from getting torn up; it's a pretty good ""sealer"" for MDF (e.g. my router table has an MDF surface, finished with shellac and a well-maintained coat of paste wax).</p></li>
<li><p>Oil-based Polyurethane: My favorite general category. I find it easy to work with and strong, takes a long time to dry and requires patience, but pretty versatile. I've <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3658/how-do-i-de-nib-polyurethane-after-it-dries-but-still-maintain-its-finish"">learned a lot about working with it</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>Polycrylic: This is easy to apply, not as good scratch resistance as a more ""hard core"" polyurethane but still great especially for shelves and stuff, and dries very quickly. Problem is it doesn't stick to oil-based stain well (I found this out the dumb, hard way). You could lay a coat of shellac down between the stain and the polycrylic, although that's a pain. Instead you could go for a water-based stain. A water-based stain plus a polycrylic finish is a great balance of protection + dry times and cleanup ease, IMO.</p></li>
<li><p>Lacquer / varnish: I've never really used lacquer. Varnish is still a pretty generic term, so if you count e.g. Minwax Helmsman as ""spar varnish"", that's about my experience there (incidentally, I'm a <em>huge</em> fan of that stuff on top of stain for indoor and outdoor projects alike).</p></li>
<li><p>Boiled linseed oil, Teak oil, ""danish"" oil, etc: I love the look of BLO in particular; it doesn't offer much protection but it's <em>really</em> easy to apply (and to repair) and can really give some beautiful results, especially without stain.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There's other random fun things you can do, too. For example, for a while I was experimenting with bleach or oxalic acid on poplar to remove the green tint, with various oils on top of it, with great results.</p>

<p>As for application methods you just kind of have to experiment. For stain, oils, and shellac, I like wiping it on with a rag. For polyurethane and spar urethane I'm a big fan of foam brushes. </p>

<p>Preventing brush strokes depends on what you're talking about. For oil-based stain I always apply it like so:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wipe on thick with a rag. Don't really care about evenness so much as long as you don't leave big drips. Primary purpose is to just get it <em>on</em> the wood.</li>
<li>After 5-10 minutes wipe / gently buff out the excess.</li>
<li>Let it sit for 15 minutes or so then repeat from step 1. Also shake / stir the stain periodically, sometimes it can separate and settle quickly then it's very light when you apply it.</li>
</ol>

<p>For thicker stuff like poly I usually do some variant of the following (how many coats, how you sand, etc. really depends on the look you are going for and how much time you want to spend):</p>

<ol>
<li>Slop it on quickly with a foam brush, just to get coverage.</li>
<li>Working fast, smooth out any drips on other faces (besides the one you're working on) as you go.</li>
<li>After slopping it all onto a section (do this within a minute or two tops) run the brush in single, continuous, even strokes along the grain to smooth it all out.</li>
<li>Repeat as necessary.</li>
<li>Sand lightly at the end if you want. For glossy finishes I like to wet sand once then hit it up with ultra-cut car polish and a buffer (Ryobi makes a cheap but effective buffer that they sell at Home Depot). For non-glossy I've found that, after it's fully dry a quick single pass with 400+ followed by a quick wipe with a rag + water / mineral spirits to get rid of the dust smooths it out nicely.</li>
</ol>

<p>For shellac; books have been written about application techniques. It carries a lot of traumatic memories for me so I won't get into it, although if you're feeling masochistic check out <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_polish"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">French polishing</a> (there's way easier ways to get a nice shiny finish in modern times, though).</p>

<p>For paint I just cut in the corners and stuff with a brush then use a roller.</p>

<p>Anyways I've already typed more than I wanted to and I'm sure others here can answer this much more effectively than I can. If there are any take-home points from all of this I would say:</p>

<ul>
<li>Experiment on scraps.</li>
<li>Decide on a look you want <em>then</em> try to figure out how to achieve it.</li>
<li>Feel free to ask more specific questions here about any of this as you experiment.</li>
<li>There are definitely multiple bad and multiple good ways to do things, but generally there isn't always a single <em>Right Way™</em> for everything. There's a lot of cats and a lot of ways to skin them so you just kind of have to settle on whatever you like to work with, in whatever way works for you, that also gets you an end result that you are satisfied with.</li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck!</p>

"Stain won't take on wood stair nose","239","","<p>I've been trying to stain a piece of wood for the last few days that refuses to take stain. Started by sanding the original finish and using Rustoleum Kona stain that did not really apply to the wood.</p>

<p>Then I used a stripper, sanded the wood first with coarse then with fine sandpaper and tried again. That gave me a blotchy finish and barely took as well so I stripped and sanded again.</p>

<p>Then I used Minwax Wood Conditioner and applied a new Minwax ebony stain which took just about as awful as the first stain. Here's a picture after 2 coats of the the ebony stain:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/38yam.jpg"" alt=""Brown plank of wood, not darkened after two coats of ebony""></p>

<p>Why does it refuse to stain?</p>
","<p>It's very hard to be sure but that doesn't look like it's a known blotch-prone species. If so that you are getting blotching is a sure sign that the wood is contaminated. Although you've stripped and sanded you haven't gotten deep enough to expose completely fresh wood, without a trace of the original varnish and/or any floor polish applied over the years. </p>

<p>If you want to try to get deeper I would suggest you scrape instead of sand (I will nearly always recommend scraping over sanding anyway) but to be quite honest I'd be tempted to just use ""gel stain"" myself and sidestep the problem entirely. So-called gel stains aren't stain in the conventional sense, they're jellied coloured varnishes and they're the ideal pick for blotch-prone woods and troublesome staining jobs like this. </p>

<p>Gel stain unfortunately is not the perfect finish for areas of high wear since if (when) it wears off you'll expose the uncoloured wood beneath. So after you've achieved the colour you want I would recommend applying at least two or three coats of a floor-grade clear varnish as protection.</p>

"In what cases is it NOT useful to have more than one of the same tool?","236","","<p>I want to take <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/q/1604/49"">In what cases is it useful to have more than one of the same tool?</a> and flip it around to find out what tools are NOT useful in multiples.</p>

<p>In other words, I'm now looking for cases in which a woodworker eventually might own two or more of a given tool, but keeping more than one of them is difficult to justify objectively because having more than one provides little or no practical benefit.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this turns out to much more difficult than I had originally thought, because one most prove that there is NO situation in which the tool is useful in multiples. As it turns out, it's very difficult (or impossible, in many cases) to prove this objectively.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to create a list of tools that are not useful in multiples, what factors should I consider in order to determine whether or not I should limit myself to just one of a given tool?</p>
","<h2>No single specific answer will apply to everyone.</h2>

<p>Trying to enumerate the tools that aren't useful in multiples doesn't seem helpful — there are as many valid answers as there are woodworkers. Instead, then, let's consider the criteria that anyone can use to decide whether they need more than one (or zero, two, three, or ten) of a given tool, or conversely, when they don't need more than some number of that tool.</p>

<h2>The cost of a tool should be less than the benefit derived from the tool.</h2>

<p>The cost of a tool is more than just the <strong>purchase price</strong>. Every tool takes up some amount of <strong>space</strong> and many require a certain amount of <strong>maintenance</strong>.</p>

<p>The primary benefit of a tool is usually that it <strong>facilitates some task</strong>, but there's also the <strong>pleasure of ownership</strong> and sometimes the <strong>security</strong> or <strong>convenience</strong> of having an extra copy of the tool.</p>

<h2>For most tools, the main benefit of owning more than one copy is time.</h2>

<p>You can only use one table saw, router, hammer, or 1/8"" chisel tip drill bit at a time, so having more than one isn't necessary but might be convenient. Anything that can be done with two routers can be done with one, but having more than one lets you keep one in a router table or use multiple cutters without changing setups. It's hard to swing two hammers at the same time, but having one in the shop, one in your truck, and your tool bucket saves the trouble of moving a single hammer to different sites.</p>

<h2>The higher a tool's cost, the harder it is to justify multiples.</h2>

<p>It'd be cool to have a second table saw that's always set up for dadoes, but I can't afford to give up that much space in my small shop. This is a case where the convenience of two doesn't match the cost.</p>

<h2>It's harder to justify multiples if they can't be used simultaneously.</h2>

<p>Clamps are useful in multiples because they're used in parallel. They're more like fixtures than tools in that they do their work <em>after</em> you've operated them. Most tools are useful <em>while</em> they're being operated, which makes it hard for a single woodworker to benefit from more than one at a time. On the other hand, if you ever work with other people, multiples might make a lot of sense.</p>

<h2>It's harder to justify multiples of tools that are seldom used.</h2>

<p>If a tool isn't used often, you might not even need <em>one</em>, let alone several. A single adjustable finger dovetail jig can be useful enough to justify the cost even if you only use it a few times a year, but a <em>second</em> adjustable finger dovetail jig really doesn't provide any extra utility.</p>

"Are there alternatives to buying flocking fibers?","235","","<p>I enjoying flocking boxes and other wood working projects. It's much preferable to trying to line with sheets of felt. But, flocking fibers seem oddly expensive.</p>

<p>Are there alternatives to buying flocking fibers?</p>

<p>Is it possible to make flocking-like fibers?</p>

<p>Are there other techniques like flocking or with other fibers that are less expensive and have similar results?</p>
","<p><a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3435/are-there-alternatives-to-buying-flocking-fibers#comment6883_3435"">Ast Pace</a> took part of the sentiment here. Flocking fibres are not that expensive. Also a stat/faq for a <a href=""http://www.craftflocking.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">particular supplier</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How Much Flocking Do I Need?</strong> 1 ounce of flocking fiber will cover about 3 square feet. (depending on recovered fibers)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are doing something like bandsaw boxes you don't need that much (as long as you are not too liberal and reclaim loose flock). However I am all for DIY so I will present the two solutions that seem applicable and that require tools and materials related to woodworking.</p>

<h1>Sandpaper and Paper</h1>

<p>This option yielded better results aesthetically but was also the biggest pain. Just take some sandpaper and mount it on a block or foam. Run it on the paper and it will make / pull fine fibers of the paper. This has a better result then the next suggestion I found. </p>

<h1>Sawdust and Paint</h1>

<p>I know that I can get a good amount of sawdust powder when I am working on some of the finer projects. Using small amount of paint you can mix it with saw dust powder (finer the better) to get half decent flock. Issues here are that sawdust is not good for the lungs so you need to be careful working with it. Also it will not be as fine as commercial products as the use much more involved materials and processes. </p>

<p>This came up more wear people were making terrain for models and game boards that size and texture were considered good points as it added to the authenticity. True flock would not have been as aesthetically pleasing. </p>

<h1>Honestly just buy it.</h1>

<p>I think you will get much better results. I am not sure what size the projects you are thinking of are but the stuff is rather cheap. True there are some tools considerations for apply it but they are only useful if you plan on doing this alot. Again, not advocating the site or product but the first thing I came upon sells 1oz bags for under 2$ (without shipping of course). Your local craft stores would unexpectedly carry products like this. My local hobby store has this stuff but only in green. </p>

"How could I have designed this cabinet to avoid assembly and alignment problems?","232","","<p>I built this wall-hanging cabinet with a door on the front that opens upwards (plain old hinges on exterior face, not installed yet) (there's space on the back for a cleat, not super apparent in images below):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/boVgE.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/boVgE.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>It did not assemble well. It is not usable. It was assembled like so; consider the following drawing:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KPtwr.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KPtwr.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<ol>
<li>I built the side and door frames. Pocket hole joints used for frame components because I had to assemble to chamfer inner edges before finishing, but had to disassemble to insert the screens after finishing.</li>
<li>I cut the three panels and glued them together, just butt joint. When gluing I clamped around the outside in line with the vertical panel and inserted spacers as well.</li>
<li>I then glued the side frames on.</li>
</ol>

<p>The frames are pine and the panels are 7/16"" ply.</p>

<p>Now, I had designed, measured, followed the rule of cutting to reality instead of design, dry fit and dry fit again, followed all the rules I've discovered (make all same-length cuts at once without adjusting settings, all that, etc), but still I ran into the following issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The top and bottom panels weren't glued at perfect right angles. I had to apply significant force to hold them true when gluing the sides on.</p></li>
<li><p>Gaps, somehow things weren't flat any more when assembled:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ukw2K.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ukw2K.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
<li><p>Panels were too short vertically, and it was inconsistent (some corners looked OK, others were way off):
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CgVOu.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CgVOu.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
<li><p>Biggest of all, the door, despite looking fine throughout the whole process, was somehow magically a good 1/8"" or so too wide at the end, and with gaps on the sides:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdjKA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdjKA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
<li><p>Also the top panel was bowed downwards in the center, mostly as a result of the forces applied to the edges trying to make it straight when gluing the sides on; problematic because the hinges need to go there:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GHmuq.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GHmuq.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I think the frames (sides and door) came together well, and almost all of the problems were due to various issues with the panels. I shouldn't have even proceeded to glue it up to begin with after noticing that the panels weren't 90 degrees. I also didn't do that one final dry fit. I'm not sure where in the building and finishing process I lost material on the panels. The frames are sized consistently with each other.</p>

<p>I have since cut the sides off, removed the panel stubs, and refinished the sides, so I have a second chance at this. I now have the frames, assembled and finished, ready to go again.</p>

<p>So my question is: <strong>How could I have designed this differently from the start (particularly joining the panels to the frames) that could have both avoided all these problems and also lessen the tolerances that I needed to cut things to?</strong></p>

<p>And how can I salvage it given that I have the sides detached again? </p>

<p>As far as salvaging goes: What I am <em>thinking</em> is rabbeting the top and bottom of the side frames, and cutting a slot in the side frames for the vertical, and also cutting a slot in the top and bottom panels for the vertical. Then the top and bottom will be flush, and any slop / inaccuracies in the back can be hidden in the slots. And I won't glue the panels to each other first, instead I'll glue the sides and panels all in one shot. My side frames probably aren't flat any more anyways due to sanding so even if I wanted to butt them against the panels I don't think it would work now. Does this seem reasonable? The minor downside is just aesthetic; it will make the side frames appear thinner than the door from the top and bottom, and you'll see the rabbets with the door open. The other alternative is biscuits, although the plywood feels a bit thin for that.</p>

<p>How would you have built this cabinet, from the start, to avoid the problems?</p>
","<p>In general (IMO) when using plywood paneling like this it can be very hard to treat it like a regular board.  So I would recommend (almost always) to frame it where ever it is being used for a panel.  (what you are planning on doing with rabbets and slots).</p>

<p>No matter how well I try to cut sheet material, I get a little curve on long cuts or just a catch and either a dip or bump.  If you have a cabinet saw and/or a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000EZVVJA"" rel=""nofollow"">carriage</a> for the saw to make long cuts cleanly you have a much better chance.</p>

<p>So for this one, I would do what you are saying for the sides and bottom, 'frame' in the panels and I would have likely made the top out of glued up wood.  Also to help (in either case) I would run a small board, maybe 1"" x 3/4"" along the front of the board on the inside to help stiffen the front edge of the board to keep it from sagging in the middle.</p>

"Why do (electric) routers spin so fast?","232","","<p>I was just noodling a possible milling operation for some slide-in dividers and was thinking it might actually be faster and more accurate in the set-up if I did it on my (metalworking) vertical milling machine.</p>

<p>This raised a question I've puzzled about several times, which is why woodworking router motors spin so darn fast. The top speed on my milling machine is about 2500 RPM. My go-to router spins at 25,000 and my trim router at 30,000 RPM.</p>

<p>I kind of suppose the reason is that a hand-held router has to be light-ish, so can't have a big 1HP motor, and so the inertia and smaller chip size (therefore lower cutting force) produced by a high-rev cutter allows a small fractional horsepower motor to be used.</p>

<p>But it also occurs to me that perhaps wood cuts best at high cutter surface-velocity (surface feet per minute, SFM) and the generally small diameter bits used in a router just require the revs to get the required cutter surface velocity.</p>

<p>Can someone who knows the technical details set me straight?</p>

<p>FYI there are 1-2hp professional routers as well as production routers with motors in excess of 3hp. All are still hand-held, although admittedly the heavy and very powerful ones are beasts and need strength to use.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But it also occurs to me that perhaps wood cuts best at high cutter surface-velocity (surface feet per minute, SFM) and the generally small diameter bits used in a router just require the revs to get the required cutter surface velocity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think this is as much a factor as one might at first think. Wood can be cut extremely well at very low speeds if the cutting edge is very sharp (think paring with a chisel). </p>

<p>Router bits tend not to have edges that sharp, and the high speed does help compensate for this — although that's not the reason for the speed, the same speeds were around back when bits were commonly sharper because their cutting edges were made of steel.</p>

<p>One of the things the high rotational speed is yielding that's less obvious is a <em>flatter</em> cut surface. So for a given feed rate the interval between one cutting edge and the next coming into contact with the wood is reduced, meaning the surface is less likely to show a repeating cut/not cut pattern<sup>1</sup>. </p>

<p>But as basic as the following seems speedy cutters simply yield faster results. Not long ago a wide range of cutter heads were sold for mounting in power drills, for routing and other milling jobs (including panel raising if you can believe that). While they were apparently capable of good results by comparison they worked much more slowly and the advent of lower-cost routers that most home woodworkers could afford killed them off pretty comprehensively, which is a shame as I think they would still have something to offer<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> You get this is you use a feed rate that's too high, the bit's edges then aren't keeping up with the advance of the wood so slight gaps open up in the cutting action, yielding to scalloping. In some woods it can lead to terrible tearing too.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> A couple of advantages for the home woodworker are that they were much easier for the user to sharpen (carbon steel and HSS, no carbide) and they would tend to produce more parings/shavings and less dust, certainly much less fine dust as routers do, which is a boon for anyone who doesn't have the means or space for a proper dust-extraction system.</p>

<p>The desktop has gotten kind of worn and is a little small for my current needs, so I've been considering replacing it with a larger solid wood surface, like <a href=""http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80274963/#/40274960"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this Ikea countertop</a>.</p>

<p>The desk is made of particleboard, and the original desktop is attached with cam lock fasteners. The cam screws go into the bottom of the desktop and engage with cam nuts in the drawer unit and side support. (General illustration of fasteners below, not indicative of how they're actually used in my desk.)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/G1NOR.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/G1NOR.jpg"" alt=""cam lock fasteners""></a></p>

<p>My first thought was that I could simply screw the cam screws into the solid wood countertop and attach it to the drawers and side support the same way as the original desktop. However, it then occurred to me that I might need to account for the solid wood expanding and contracting with changes in humidity (as I understand, this isn't really a concern with particleboard).</p>

<p>Am I right to be concerned with wood movement? If so, how can I best attach the countertop in a way that allows it to move without damage? I've read about <a href=""http://www.craftsmanspace.com/knowledge/17-ways-to-fasten-a-tabletop.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">various ways to fasten a tabletop</a>, but some of them don't seem appropriate - for example, anything that would require me to cut a groove in the particleboard doesn't seem like a good idea. (In general, I'm not sure what kinds of fasteners I can expect to work reliably in particleboard.)</p>

<p>Or would this project be inadvisable for any other reason? Is it just not worth the trouble?</p>
","<p>You are correct to worry about wood movement.  A solid wood top it will move along it's width (in this case from the front to the back of the desk) with seasonal humidity changes.  Particleboard is a stable material due to the amount of binder in it (i.e. glue) and the lack of an organized grain.</p>

<p>If you secure the top to the particle board without allowing for movement something will break, most likely the particleboard.</p>

<p>I would use ""figure 8"" fasteners to attach the top.  These are essentially two washers joined edge-to-edge.  One hole is attached to the apron (or leg in this case) and the other is attached to the underside of the tabletop.  They can then pivot as the top expands and contracts.</p>

<p>Due to the unstable nature of particle board you'll want to use a screw that is bigger than you'd normally use for wood, both in length and diameter.  You'll also need to drill a pilot hole that is slightly deeper than the screw and about 85% of the screw's outside diameter.</p>

"Need help understanding workbench design and build process","227","","<p>I recently asked a question here regarding the use of 1x4s rather than 2x4s for a laminated workbench top and got some helpful advice. I decided to go with 2x4s, and now it's time to build. Before I do, I'd like to run my general plan past this community to see how it sounds.</p>

<p>I plan on laminating 16 5' long 2x4s to make a 5x2' bench top.  I'll use a plane to skim the face of each board to help the gluing process, use my 6 5' long bar clamps to hold the glue-up together overnight, and then build the base.</p>

<p>For the base, I have 8 3' 2x4s to laminate in pairs for the legs, the depth of the legs being 3.5"" each and the width being 3"" each. I have enough material for two sets of pairs of laminated 2x4 stretchers, one at the top of the legs, to be tenoned into the leg mortises, and one at the bottom of the legs to be tenoned in.  Then I have enough for 4 sets of 2 laminated 5' 2x6s to run the length of the bench, also tenoned into the legs. </p>

<p>So, I'll end up with a frame that is 2'x5' with fairly stout legs and good bracing across and along the depth. Then I'd like to use dowels to attach the top, so it could be removed to be semi-portable. Those would be between the top and the stretchers on the left and right sides, either one on each side or a pair on each side.</p>

<p>Is there anything wrong with this design? Most designs I see have the top overlapping the base by a few inches on each side, especially when considering the length. Is this a requirement?</p>

<p>Edit: here's a quick sketch of my idea: 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gGnhp.jpg"" alt=""workbench sketch""></p>
","<p>I made a bench similar in construction to what you describe only a bit bigger ( 8' long with two 1' wide top slabs separated by 1 1/2"" gap - roubo style split top).  I made mine with 2x6 instead of 2x4s; I use it for hand planing so I wanted it to be a bit heftier. It also has a leg vise and an embedded wagon vise running along the front face of the top. I have several considerations for you:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's good to skim the boards in the planer to insure flatness.  Do not plane the top and bottoms until your slab is glued.</li>
<li>Do not try to glue up all the top pieces at once. I worked with pairs first and after they set I glued pairs of pairs etc. to get to the final width.  When I got up to 12"" width I ran the top through the planer to get the top nearly flat and get rid of the rounded edges of each board.</li>
<li>My stretcher tenons (connected with the legs to a depth of 2"" and were tight to insure maximum glue contact.  I did not need to add an apron brace at the top of the legs.  If the base needs more rigidity you can add a top brace later on the inside face of the leg ( see next comment).</li>
<li>I made my legs 3 boards wide (4 1/2) so that the mortices for the stretchers could be 1 1/2"" wide.  I simply notched the middle leg board to the depth of the tenon and avoided custom chiseling.</li>
<li>Keep the face of the legs and top front and back face flush.  You can clamp larger pieces to the face that way.  </li>
<li>I routed a mortice on the underside of my top to snugly receive the legs as tenons to a depth of 1 1/2"". The top just sits on the legs but because of the weight the top and legs act well as a unit. I would allow a little extra width on the mortices to allow the table top width to expand and contract against the fixed width leg structure. (My split top  absorbs that expansion and also serves to hold tools and provide a stop for planing materials. (see roubo table designs on the net for details).</li>
<li>Allowing the top to overhang the legs on the sides will provide good clamping opportunities and make the leg structure more ridgid due to the shorter spans.</li>
<li>The 'workbench"" tag wiki has a couple greate references books for design and construction details</li>
<li>For me it's all about clamping my work so I included the vises, as well as strategically placed holdfast holes.</li>
</ul>

<p>After you added your design sketches I want to add the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>You didn't clarify what you will use the bench for. In this answer, I assume it will be for heavier woodworking tasks.</li>
<li>Although not to scale, I assume the 2x4s are long side vertical.  This adds a great deal of strength to the bench. If the bench is only 1 1/2"" thick it will not be as suitable for heavy loads or work such as planing.</li>
<li>2x4s will work at the lower level for all 4 sides.  2x6s are not needed.  Keep the bottom of the 2x4s up 5""-6"" (or more) so that you can get a broom under it.</li>
<li>If the top is 3 1/2 thick then the 2x6 aprons should not be necessary if the legs tenon into the top 1 1/2"".  </li>
<li>The tenons of the sides into the legs are shown smaller than the 2x4s.  I made mine full sized to increase the gluing surface.  This was easier to construct and added strength for heavy duty work. </li>
<li>The top need only overhang the legs enough that you can use clamps at the full depth of the edges.  4""-6"" each side should be more than enough for most wood clamps.</li>
<li>When looking at your side view, note that the top will expand and contract while the legs assembly will not.  Your connection between the two should allow for the differential movement.</li>
<li>You can add a shelf on the lower leg supports for storage.</li>
</ul>

"How does wood glue create a strong joints?","224","","<p>I've been reading about joining pieces of wood a 90 degree angle, and the religious war between pocket holes and mortise-and-tenon joints. The thing I find fascinating is that both still suggest the use of wood glue.</p>

<p>I understand how harsher glues work -- Typically they essentially melt two materials together. Wood glue on the other hand doesn't seem to do this, instead of just bonds the materials some how, but I can't see that as being a very strong joint. Through what action do wood glue joints get their strength?</p>
","<p><a href=""https://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fplgtr113/ch09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here</a> is a pretty detailed, technical discussion of gluing wood.  There are two primary mechanisms of adhesion: valence forces, and interlocking action.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Valence forces are forces of attraction produced by the interactions of atoms, ions, and molecules that exist within and at the surfaces of both adhesive and adherend. Interlocking action, also called mechanical bonding, means surfaces are held together by an adhesive that has penetrated the porous surface while it is liquid, then anchored itself during solidification.  Here are a couple of key excerpts:</p>
  
  <p>Mechanical interlocking is probably the primary mechanism by which adhesives adhere to porous structures, such as wood. Effective mechanical interlocking takes place when adhesives penetrate beyond the surface debris and damaged fibers into sound wood two to six cells deep. Deeper penetra- tion into the fine microstructure increases the surface area of contact between adhesive and wood for more effective me- chanical interlocking. The most durable structural bonds to wood are believed to develop not only when an adhesive penetrates deeply into cell cavities, but also when an adhe- sive diffuses into cell walls to make molecular-level contact with the hemicellulosics and cellulosics of wood. If an adhe- sive penetrates deeply enough into sound wood and becomes rigid enough upon curing, the strength of the bond can be expected to exceed the strength of the wood.</p>

"Proper grain orientation for a box","223","","<p>I'm making a small box that will be used to hold mail, and I came up with the following design, with keyed miters on all the outside joints and dados for the dividers:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Zd7o.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Zd7o.png"" alt=""box""></a></p>

<p>I've been reading recently about wood movement and I'm wondering if this design won't work, or if it's something I won't have to really worry about. Is there a certain grain orientation I should use? Currently, the grain on the front, back and sides runs horizontal and the grain on the bottom piece runs the length of the box. Should I change the grain of the sides to run vertically so their width can expand/contract with the width of the bottom piece?</p>

<p>Details:</p>

<ul>
<li>Made with poplar (not sure yet which wood to use for the keys)</li>
<li>Size is about 15"" x 5.5"" x 5.5""</li>
</ul>
","<p>Running the grain vertically on the sides would be highly unusual. If this were a problem to consider, you've now shifted the issue to expansion differences between the sides and the front/back! </p>

<p>I've built dozens of jewelry boxes and perhaps a hundred other boxes. All have the grain of the sides parallel to that of the front and back. </p>

<p>That said, there's no reason to not run the grain of the sides vertically if you like the idea. However, this will expose end grain on the top (and maybe bottom depending on your design). This is where moisture is more frequently exchanged with the atmosphere so it would be prudent to seal this in some way, most finishes will suffice. If you run the side grain horrizontally, the glue joints with front and back will do the sealing.</p>

"How might I make a template to fit the top of my desk?","222","","<p>My desk is nearly finished; all that's left is to have the glass top cut. To do this, I need a template to give the glass shop. I can't just give them dimensions since it's not perfectly square. More importantly there are pegs on the frame. The glass is to be ""keyed"" so that the pegs will keep it from sliding, and I need to ensure that the glass aligns near perfectly with them (perhaps 1mm of play on either side of the pegs).</p>

<p>An image of the desk is below. note that the center of the desk is set roughly half an inch below the borders, so simply laying paper down and marking it is somewhat troublesome.</p>

<p>How might I go about creating the template?<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vvuhb.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vvuhb.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
","<p><strong>Geometric solution</strong></p>

<p>Using a large compass or trammel, you can precisely gauge all the distances and transfer them to a large template of whatever material you choose (paper, cardboard, hardboard, plywood, etc.). For each point you need to lay out, you just need at least two reference points and the distance from each reference point to the point you're trying to transfer.</p>

<ol>
<li>Place the (center) point of the compass on a reference point on your table and adjust the radius to match the distance to the point you're transferring.</li>
<li>Lock in the setting, then move the compass to the corresponding reference point on your large sheet of paper and strike an arc.</li>
<li>Repeat for the second (and optionally third) reference point. The point you're transferring will be at the intersection of the two (or more) arcs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Repeat the above steps for as many points as you need to transfer.</p>

<p>Note that if you gauge and mark from 3 or more reference points, any error will be apparent because not all the arcs used to transfer that point will intersect at a single point.</p>

<p>There are also various other geometric construction techniques you can use to construct regular or irregular shapes using just a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass-and-straightedge_construction"" rel=""nofollow"">compass and/or straightedge</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Direct solution</strong></p>

<p>Originally I was thinking you needed to cut square holes in the glass, but after rereading your question it sounds like you just want to notch out the corners of a rectangular sheet of glass. That makes creating a template much easier:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cut a piece of cardboard, hardboard, or thin plywood several inches wider than the half the distance between the left and right pairs of pegs.</li>
<li>Using a knife and metal rule or straightedge, mark the positions of the pegs.</li>
<li>Cut out notches for the pegs.</li>
<li>Repeat for the other side.</li>
<li>Securely glue or tape the two slightly overlapping sides together.</li>
<li>With the template still in place, use a knife and metal straightedge to trim (or mark, if using thicker material) the template to match the outside perimeter (the perhaps slightly out-of-square rectangle that encloses the pegs).</li>
<li>If the material was too thick to trim with just the knife, remove the template and use a track saw (or a circular saw with a straightedge guide) to finish trimming the template along the knife marks.</li>

<p>Links and images are provided as examples only.</p>
","<p>It seems to me your question is really, ""what will happen if I don't use the recommended type of blade for a given application?""</p>

<p>Simply put:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you use a blade with too many (smaller) teeth and consequently shallower gullets, the gullets will not be able to carry away enough material and will clog, resulting in burning and possibly a wandering cut, as well as possibly binding depending on the depth of your cut and power of your saw's motor.  If the blade binds and the motor does not stall, there is a good chance you will experience kickback.  A workaround for this, in case you really need to get the job done with the wrong blade, is to make the cut in several shallow passes and/or using a very slow feed speed.</p></li>
<li><p>If you use a blade with too few (larger) teeth and consequently deeper gullets, you will get a more jagged cut when cutting perpendicular to the grain, with chipout at the cut line which will be evident when crosscutting and when cutting plywood.  Using a rip blade on plywood can produce an extremely splintered edge.  There are some techniques you can use to minimize these effects, such as scoring or taping the cut line before making the cut, or putting a piece of sacrificial material on the side where the blade exits (e.g., on the top when using a circular saw or on the bottom when using a table saw).</p></li>
<li><p>Combination or general-purpose blades try to find a happy medium, and will work more or less well enough on rip cuts, crosscuts, and plywood; however, they will not produce as clean a cut in plywood or crosscutting applications as a more specialized blade, and they will not work as fast as a rip blade on rip cuts.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you only have 1 blade, it should be a combination or general-purpose blade.</p>

"Is a shorter rip fence safer?","221","","<p>I've seen people online claim that table saw fences should not extend very far past the rear-most part of the blade. They say that kickback is largely due to the fence being too long.</p>

<p>This doesn't make sense to me. I get that the piece will be less likely to get trapped between the blade and the fence, but if the front of the piece were to move past the plane of the fence, presumably the back end could be picked up by the blade.</p>

<p>Will a shorter fence reduce the likelihood or severity of kickback?</p>

<p>Here's the relevant part of a comment on <a href=""http://www.finewoodworking.com/item/24638/new-study-discusses-tablesaw-injuries"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another obvious flaw: rip fences are too long.
  There is no good reason to have the rip fence extend beyond the cut. Doing so invites kickback.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, I really thought John Heisz mentioned something about a shorter fence on <a href=""http://www.ibuildit.ca/Workshop%20Projects/rebuild-table-saw-2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">his table saw</a>, but now I can't find it. Maybe it was in a video.</p>
","<p>I believe the European table saw safety rules require the shorter rip fence. The theory of the shorter fence is that wood can have internal stresses (due to grain structure) which are relieved when cut, which can cause the fence side board to curve into the fence, pushing the board into the back of the blade causing kickback. The shorter fence allows the board to curve into space,</p>

<p>The shorter design does not address stress relief causing rear blade contact in other ways, such as closing down on the saw blade. A riving knife will prevent kickback in all of these situations.</p>

<p>Any full length fence can have a shorter piece of wood attached to the side to act as a shorter fence. My opinion is that a riving knife is the best choice for preventing kickback because it will prevent kickback any time the wood is forced into the back off the blade from either or both directions. With a riving knife in place, the shorter fence would prevent binding between the blade/riving knife and fence in the event the board curved into the fence.</p>

"Does having more teeth on a saw blade help it last longer?","220","","<p>I do know that the more teeth there is on a saw blade means a more finished cut, but could that also mean a longer lasting blade since each one takes less off at a time?</p>
","<p>Intuitively, yes, this would be the case, but the question you are asking is potentially putting the cart before the horse. One generally would not choose tooth count based on how long they want the blade to last.</p>

<p>Tooth count is primarily a function of the type of cut and the material you are cutting.  As discussed in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/q/307/49"">What is the difference between a rip-cut and a cross-cut?</a>, crosscut blades typically have more teeth compared to rip blades. In some cases, as with table saws, you can also buy a combination blade, which has fewer teeth than a crosscut blade but more than a rip blade, and often works well enough for both types of operations.</p>

<p>Many other factors also influence the longevity of a blade between sharpenings, such as the hardness (e.g., steel vs. carbide, or one grade of steel or carbide vs. another) and initial sharpness of the teeth, whether the blade is properly maintained, the operating temperature, and the materials cut with the blade.</p>

<p>Note that higher-quality carbide-tipped blades will also have thicker carbide teeth which can be sharpened more times than those of a cheaper carbide blade.</p>

","<p>You're correct that the planer can remove much more material at a time. With the planer, it is also simple to adjust the depth for removing more material in a pass. With the drum sander, you can change the grit of the paper to take off more material (nowhere near as much as the planer) but that is a more painstaking process.</p>

<p>That said, I own a drum sander but no planer. I used to make acoustic guitars and work with figured wood. In this case the planer is of little use since it will take out chips where the grain angles up. The drum sander does not chip-out the stock and allows smooth and uniform surfacing of wood down to 2 mm thickness, even thinner if required.</p>

<p>So, preference rather depends on what you're doing. I've also used my drum sander to fashion oak window jambs and trim. It required more passes than a planer would have but I would have wanted the drumb sander for finishing anyway, I was happy with my choice of tools.</p>

"Best way to apply stain","218","","<p>I made a shoe-rack from Spruce and applied a couple of coats of clear matt varnish. My wife wanted a darker colour so I went to the local store where the only suitable product with the right colour was a small tin of ""woodstain"", the instructions on the tin said to thoroughly sand any previous varnish so the ""stain"" would adhere. The product is intended for outdoor use and requires 2 or 3 coats. So I guess it is more than a mere staining colourant and has some other stuff in it that produces a waterproof protective coating.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Wr1c.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Wr1c.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>After a satisfactory test on a small chunk of wood I went ahead and lightly sanded, cleaned and then applied the stain using a paintbrush. </p>

<p>The results were hideously blotchy and uneven, mostly due to the fact that the stain seemed to be drying (more like coagulating) before I could brush out any drips/runs. I am now looking forward to sanding it down to plain wood and refinishing.</p>

<p>It is possible I applied too much ""stain"" at a time, or maybe conditions are not right (I brought the work indoors as my garage temperature is below the minimum on the tin).</p>

<p>What techniques should I try with this product?</p>
","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, this type of product isn't stain in the conventional meaning of the word. </p>

<p>This is another example of the dilution of the proper meaning of woodworking terms by manufacturers *sigh* This Ronseal product is a coloured acrylic 'varnish' and I don't know why they don't just market it as coloured varnish to save the inevitable confusion. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the stain seemed to be drying (more like coagulating) before I could brush out any drips/runs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well it does call itself quick drying :-) Finishes are indeed coagulating in a way as they dry on a surface and if you pick up some of the part-dried finish as you brush back over previously coated areas you'll get a horrible mess as a rule.</p>

<p>It seemed clear to me that the product is really intended to go onto bare wood and doesn't like going on top of existing finishes. The data sheet confirmed my suspicions. I don't know how strongly this is stressed on the tin but:</p>

<p><em>""All previously applied film forming products, for example paints and varnishes, should be totally removed.""</em>  </p>

<p>So just a light sanding was not sufficient. </p>

<p><strong>Sidenote on finish removal:</strong> I would actually try to dissuade you from sanding off previous finishes as your go-to technique. Chemical strippers are usually the best way to get finish off thoroughly. If a purely physical method is a necessity for reasons of cost, toxicity or just smell then scraping is much preferable to sanding: it is faster and more efficient, always cheaper, safer for the user (much less dust) and there is less potential for accidental damage to most furniture. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What techniques should I try with this product?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Work as smoothly and efficiently as possible using a larger rather than a smaller brush, but a foam or short-nap roller may be a better application tool.   </li>
<li>Try to apply the varnish and leave it alone. Resist the temptation to go back over the finish already applied after even a short time. </li>
<li>Keep a clean brush or lint-free rag dampened with water on hand to deal with drips or runs on edges, don't attempt to deal with them using the application brush.  </li>
</ul>

<p>One last note if using a brush, synthetic bristles are highly recommended rather than natural bristles.</p>

"How do I prevent the rungs of my loft bed from moving slightly in their join with the legs?","218","","<p>I have a fully-assembled loft bed from softwood, in use for about of year, that has head and footboards of this design:
<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/pcJNiFK.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>There are 4 rungs on the foot and 5 on the head; the legs are each 85"". The headboard feels slightly unstable when pressure is placed on the bed. Even just pulling with my hand against the leg can produce this. I want to figure out a way to remove all movement and make it feel sturdy (I assume the existing movement is not really unsafe but can feel disconcerting).</p>

<p>The assembly instructions had me glue the rungs into the pre-cut notches and then screw them in using two #7 2-1/2"" (drywall) screws into each leg. I already drilled a pilot hole in between the two screws and sank another screw trying to stabilize the rungs, but it didn't seem to make much of a difference. I suspect the issue is that the top and bottom screws may have slightly stripped the wood and are too loose, plus the wood glue may not have been applied properly.</p>

<p>As it currently exists, each attachment point looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/757jmll.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>and under pressure moves slightly like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/LEDqGPj.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>The screws are this deep, but have been sunk past surface level in the rungs so may not have much ""bite"" in them either:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/psDy1l8.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>I'm wondering what the best strategy to fix this might be. I have a few ideas but don't know which is good, or if I'm missing something better:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Remove the top and bottom screws and drill 3/8"" holes instead, and place 3"" dowels with wood glue in the holes. This should provide grip against the entire length of the rung and the leg and I'd assume would shift less than metal screws. The middle screw would still provide strength against being pulled away from the leg.</p></li>
<li><p>attach metal L-brackets from the inside of the rungs and legs and just screw them in using short wood screws.</p></li>
<li><p>just try unscrewing each rung and re-applying wood glue on the contact point between the leg and rung, then re-screwing it using the existing screws.</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>OK to begin with, you shouldn't be getting any movement of course and because there is some it indicates you have no glue joint and that some or all of the screws holes in the uprights are either stripped, or if pilot holes were drilled originally, that they were a little over-size. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The assembly instructions had me glue the rungs into the pre-cut notches and then screw them in using two #7 2-1/2"" wood screws into each leg. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Glue + screws would normally be more that sufficient for a secure and long-lasting joint on rungs such as this. There are two reasons I can immediately see for why they've begun to move. </p>

<p>Firstly, there appear to be two problems with the screws. The length suggested was not nearly long enough and additionally those screws look to be drywall screws. Passing reference to drywall screws in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2708/are-there-specific-types-of-screws-i-should-use-for-woodworking/2714#2714"">this previous Answer</a>. Re. the length, screw length should be three times the thickness of the piece being attached where possible. Where that's not possible the rule of thumb is <em>as long as you can get away with</em>, i.e. just a little shy of poking out the opposite side of the piece you're screwing into.</p>

<p>Secondly, joinery. The half-laps/halving joints that the rungs go into should be cut to a tight fit, the amount of play in the one joint you photographed closely is very far outside acceptably tight and ideally (note: <em>not</em> essential) the joint should be shimmed or packed out so that the rung can't move within the notch. </p>

<p>Initially one simple way of doing this would have been by positioning the rung at the bottom of the joint (hard up against the lower edge of the notch) and then just inserting a shim at the top. </p>

<p>Anyway, if that joint is typical then the others should be addressed as well if you're doing this one. But as I say this isn't essential and with a solid glue fixing and screws holding properly the rungs should be perfectly secure enough for service.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>just try unscrewing each rung and re-applying wood glue on the contact point between the leg and rung, then re-screwing it using the existing screws.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is partly the ideal fix. </p>

<p>Yes you should re-glue, but the mating surfaces should be scrupulously cleaned of old glue first before re-glueing, by scraping and then by sanding. This is because wood glue is not actually strong, <em>well-glued joints</em> are, and in practice a strong joint is formed only when the layer of glue is very thin between the two pieces of wood. </p>

<p>You shouldn't re-use the existing screws as they're not holding in the wood, so unless you pack out the holes they'll continue to do very little to hold the rungs in place. If these are drywall screws they should be replaced with wood screws anyway, and when doing so you can move up to a larger gauge so that they hold in the wood firmly. <strong>Note:</strong> you may need to drill larger clearance holes in the rungs to accommodate the larger screws.</p>

<p>Once you're ready to re-attach the rungs you want everything lined up and ready to go before you apply fresh glue, as you want no delay between applying glue and bringing pieces of wood together. Apply fresh glue generously to one face, position each rung and drive the new wood screws home (this provides the necessary 'clamping' force to ensure a good glue joint). As the screws snug up firmly will get some glue squeezing out of each joint, this is normal, but be prepared for it and wipe it away with clean, damp cloths. </p>

<p>Leave the joints for about six to eight hours for the glue to dry before subjecting them to load, or overnight if possible.</p>

Since you're only talking a few degrees, you could also make a slanted base for a larger router, but if you needed to tilt significantly (e.g., 30 or 45 degrees) the broader base of the larger router would interfere and you would need a much longer bit in order to make the same cut.</p>

"How to make large table less springy in the middle","217","","<p>I needed a workbench for working on stained glass (so no heavy pushing like with hand planing). I took a spare sheet of 3/4"" particleboard with melamine finish on the faces and cut it to 6x3', rounded the corners with a jigsaw and attached 4 IKEA screw on legs that I had from an old table. The legs are very strong but the table seems to be a bit too long for the material and if I press in the middle it bends considerably and springs back to place with a wobble when Iet go. This wouldn't be a problem except that for stained glass I need to do very precise movements and I can't have the thing wobbling on me every time I make a cut.</p>

<p>I also thought about adding another set of IKEA legs in the middle but they don't make them anymore.</p>

<p>The last thing I thought about is screwing two strips of pine running parallel to each other, fastened to the underside of the table so that you wouldn't see them but I'm not sure if that would work (though it's the same effect as siding, right?)</p>

","<p>Think of a classic dining table, which has a framework underneath (commonly called the apron) that supports the table top. I think this is what you should probably build on to the workbench. Failing that join each pair of legs, front and back, with long boards (used edge-up) that run under the long dimension of the table. If using construction wood 3x1s might be enough but use 4x1s or 3x2s if you want to err on the side of caution.</p>

<p>Regarding the material you used for the top, particleboard (UK: chipboard) is quite a good choice for worktops if used appropriately. Unfortunately long unsupported spans is not one of the things it does well, in fact in thinner sections it's notorious for bowing ....even under its own weight! </p>

The usual problem, rather than breakage, is that the hole they are in deforms or loosens and the pegs fall out. Few vendors seem to have opted to thread the peg and hole, which I think helps with that problem. Wedging from the back can also help, but requires mounting the pegs to the board before the board is mounted to the wall (or some creativity in wedging.)</p>

","<p>Your bench design is related to a style called ""Roubo"" named after a French woodworker who originated the design style.  Many workbenches, including mine are based upon the Roubo split top.  This photo shows a removable filler that is inserted in the 1 1/2"" wide gap between the two slabs.  When placed with one side up it is flush with the bench top surface providing a continuous surface.  When inverted it protrudes above the top surface to provide a stop for boards useful for planing or other tasks.  The slot in the center provides a very useful tool holder to drop saws, chisels or other tools into prevent them from rolling off the top while working on your project.</p>

<p>You are right on target mounting the two slabs independently. Dowels are fine. I would recommend placing one centered on each leg extending up into the slab and leg approx 1/1/2"".  That way you can use a larger diameter  (or square dowel) of 1"" to 1 1/2"" width.  Since the slabs will expand and contract and are only pinned to the base near the outside corners of the base, the slabs will expand into the gap in the center of the top. allow clearance between the filler insert and the gap of approx 1/4"" to accommodate the seasonal changes in width.</p>

<p>As fr finishing the top.  I would recommend leaving it natural.  Friction between your work pieces and the top is good for holding the work in place during operations.  In addition, your surface will get scratched and dented and may require planing to reestablish a level plane surface over the years. Refurbishing the top will be more difficult with an old finish surface in the way.  Besides, I like the aesthetic of a well worn bench top. In my opinion, let the bench reveal its work history.</p>

"What level of inaccuracy is considered tolerable for a miter saw?","215","","<p>I have a brand new skil 12"" double bevel compound miter saw. The fence is aligned properly - It creates a perfect 90% angle with the blade when set to 0 degrees. however, if I set it to 45 degrees on either side, it is actually cutting 44 degrees, meaning I have to set it to ~46 degrees to get a perfect 45 degree cut.</p>

<p>This is the first miter saw I have purchased, and I would think that for most projects this small of error would not really matter, but in this case I am making a large picture frame so having the sum of corners be 360 degrees is necessary.</p>

<p>Are miter saws expected to make cuts to accuracy of less than a single degree? Is there some other variable that I have failed to consider that may be affecting this?</p>
","<p>It sounds like the detents and/or scale may be improperly calibrated.  Sometimes the detents on cheaper saws also have some slop, so you may need to wiggle the blade one way or the other after locking into a detent and before locking the setting in place.  Also keep in mind that you should tighten the adjustment knob to lock your setting in place even when using the detents, so the setting doesn't drift out of adjustment during the cut.  If you're getting consistently wrong results, you might be able to loosen a couple screws and make a slight adjustment, but the saw you're using is an entry-level saw and may not be able to do much better. Higher-end tools are often easier to calibrate and hold their settings better once calibrated. </p>

<p>If you can't get the results you want with this saw as-is, you have a few options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't rely on the detents or scale, and use a square or drafting triangle to set up your blade for a cut. If accuracy is important, this is a good solution regardless of how good your detents are. You can also get an aftermarket laser guide if your saw doesn't have one, but personally I'm not a fan of a laser guide.</li>
<li>Leave a little extra when making a cut, and clean up with your table saw (with a miter sled), hand plane and shooting board, or sander. A lot of people consider the miter saw a rough tool, and the only people I know who cut all the way to a line on their miter saw have very high-end models that cost $700+. But to be honest, I don't cut nearly enough miters on my miter saw to justify that kind of purchase.</li>
<li>Return the saw. If you think you got a dud, you can try getting another of the same model, or you can upgrade to a higher-quality (read: more expensive) miter saw.</li>
</ol>

<p>Regardless of which of the above you choose, it's always good practice to make a test cut after making any adjustment to the tool. Also note that you may combine any of the above solutions. I only use my miter saw when a piece is too long to comfortably crosscut on my table saw, but when I do use the miter saw I usually cut a little outside my line and clean up on the table saw (option 2 above).</p>

"How to hand-sharpen a badly worn gouge?","212","","<p>I picked up a couple of gouges at a local thrift shop. Some of them are in good order, but some of them are in bad shape and should've been sharpened long ago.</p>

<p>I've seen a couple of instruction videos on YouTube, but those feature nice clean gouges that just need a little touch up. Is sharpening a badly worn gouge doable by hand? Or should I either just toss them, or keep them around until I get my hands on mechanical means?</p>
","<p>I just went through a very similar process.  I bought a bunch of old Mifer (Spanish) gouges from craigslist.  I tried to bevel them on the stones but the steel was way too hard and thick and just took too long.  After about an hour on one chisel I decided to give the grinder a go.  You can do nearly the same thing by hand but it will just take a lot longer.  For your time, it is probably worth it to spend $50 bucks on a 6"" bench grinder.  Most come with a wheel on each side (you won't need the course one) and you can replace it with a 6"" cloth or whatever type of honing wheel.  This makes rehoning every 15-20 minutes much quicker when carving.</p>

<p>Thankfully they did not have hardly any surface rust.  Red rust is what to watch out for as it can mean deeper pits in the blade than you might suspect.  In this case you can take off metal from both sides until hopefully you find a clean center from a stone grinder.  I had to do this to a old planer blade which was gifted to me recently and turned it into a double-bevel chisel.</p>

<p>If you are free of surface rust I suggest using a bench grinder to set the initial bevel.  Hold the blade sideways and turn the handle as if it was a screwdriver while gently touching it to the grinder. Be patient.  Go slow.  Dip the tip in water constantly.  If you burn the metal (heat generated due to friction) it will change colors.  The temper is lost, and you need to grind out all the way. </p>

<p>Like the image below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pA0mM.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pA0mM.png"" alt=""gouge sharpening""></a></p>

<p>The goal is for after polishing for the bevel to be FLAT from the start of the bevel to the cutting edge (the gouge will obviously have a curve to it, but this should be from one cutting-end/bevel to the other, not from the start of the bevel to the blade).  This means light reflected will have minimal bend, and be more like a flat mirror.  The more bend the reflection has, the more the bevel was bent towards the edge, giving a more cannel (or Moran) bevel to the blade.  While this Moran edge can be desired in certain situations, typically when done unintentionally (aka on accident due to poor flat bevel sharpening) the quality is not so good.</p>

<p>I have attempted to show it below:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Mejt.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Mejt.png"" alt=""bevels""></a></p>

<p>I attached a picture showing the bevels on the gouges I sharpened.  They are not perfectly flat, but they are acceptable (to me):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HOLH7.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HOLH7.jpg"" alt=""reflections in gouges""></a></p>

<p>You can put sharpie all over the bevel to make it really obvious where you are hitting.  Frankly it will be obvious anyway since the grinder leaves fairly course markings.  Afterwards hit it with honing compound on either a wheel or strop for a few minutes, alternating sides until the small wire burr at the end of the blade comes off.</p>

<p>I will sometimes grind the end flush if the gouge is way off, leaving a very thick end.  Then as I grind (as shown in the image above) I will check the thickness of this edge constantly to make sure I am grinding evenly along the radius of the gouge.  The goal is to cut through the thick dull spot on all parts of the blade simultaneously, which implies an even grind.  As the tip gets thinner and thinner it gets easier and easier to burn.  Dip it in water every 1-2s of grind, seriously!! It sucks to burn the metal right at the end of a otherwise good bevel.</p>

"Improve Grip on Shavehorse","212","","<p>This weekend I was using <a href=""http://lumberjocks.com/projects/168674"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my shavehorse</a> to make some wooden spatulas.  After a while, the head started losing grip on the pieces I was working.</p>

<p>To help improve the grip, I wrapped a piece of leather around the top crossbar and tacked it into place.  While I don't have a picture of this, you can see the crossbar above the platform in the image below.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kCzew.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kCzew.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Adding the leather seemed to help a bit, but the issue still remained.  Looking a little closer, I noticed that the surface of the platform was getting burnished, which would explain why it was so slippery.</p>

<p>At this point I was out of time to work on stuff, so I set it aside.  I could add another piece of leather to the platform, which would probably help with grip.  However, <strong>I'm curious if there are any other ways that I might increase the grip of my shavehorse</strong>.</p>
","<p>It may just be the perspective or the setup of the photo, but it appears to me that your shave horse is not adjusted quite right.  When you push on the footrest, the swinging arm should not have to travel very far past vertical, and the grip should not be able to swing closer to you than the platform.</p>

<p>You should either use a taller platform or, better yet, you should move the grip further down on the swinging arm (with your shave horse, this will mean adding more holes).  In your comment, you also mentioned raising the pivot, and that would be even better than simply lowering the grip. Either of these adjustments to the pivot will give you significantly more hold-down pressure without having to exert more force on the footrest.</p>

<p>As you might recall from grade school or high school, your mechanical advantage with a lever is the ratio of the lengths on either side of the pivot. So if the footrest is 24"" and the grip is 12"" from the pivot, you have a 2:1 mechanical advantage. If you bring the grip down to 8"" from the pivot, you now have a 24:8, or 3:1 mechanical advantage. If you instead raise the pivot by 4"", your mechanical advantage is 28:8, or 3.5:1 (i.e., 3.5). Raising the pivot point even higher will amplify your hold-down pressure even more.</p>

<p>One final suggestion: make sure your platform is not too smooth.  It shouldn't be necessary to add friction material; but if you do, add it to the platform that the workpiece rests upon, rather than adding it to the grip (top crossbar).</p>

"Is this a case of just using the wrong wood? (Warping)","212","","<p>I resawed a 2x4 I've had in my garage for a couple years down to about 3/8th in strips to make the following:</p>

<p>Did I not wait long enough during various stages of the project (only about a week from start to staining) or was my decision to use garage 2x4 the problem?</p>
","<p>The strips you secured to the bottom are the cause of the warping.  The main boards can't expand and contract because they are fixed to the strips at a few points.  If the boards were just glued to each other then it would expand/contract as a single panel.  This is the same problem you face with tabletops, hence the need for connections that allow movement.</p>

<p>Also, not sure if you did in this case, but alternating the boards up/down/up/down will help prevent this type of warping as well.</p>

<p>At this point I would try removing the strips to see if it flattens out.  If it does, and you wanted to keep the strips for support, the solution would be to cut keyways (or large holes) where the screws attach so that the panel can move relative to the strips.</p>

<p>Placing cauls across the panel while you glue and clamp it will also help keep it nice and flat as the glue dries.</p>

"Pocket Hole Joint Strength","212","","<p>I'm in the process of building a table saw/router table extension. I've been using pocket hole joints made with a Kreg jig for the case so far. I was wondering if the pocket holes screws would be enough to hold the drawers and shelves without a dado. I'm using 3/4"" construction ply for the sides and back and solid wood for the front. I'd like to have a couple of drawers at the bottom and an open space for the router and the lift. In everyone's experience are the pocket hole screws enough or should I add more support to the inside shelving. 
First post with the app. Might edit on the computer later if requested</p>
","<p>Yes, pocket screws AND glue are enough to hold most drawer boxes together. We will often use them in a pinch for drawer boxes in the cabinet industry, and some shops will even use them regularly.</p>

<p>That being said, there are usually two weak spots in drawer construction, the bottom, and the drawer front.</p>

<p>For our typical drawer construction, we use 1/2"" - 3/4"" sides with a 1/4"" bottom dadoed into all 4 sides. This makes construction and assembly simple, and results in a sturdy box. The drawer front is a separate part, applied to the front of the drawer box, usually using screws through the subfront of the box.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0oGou.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0oGou.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Building the box this way accomplishes a few things. First, your box itself has 4 sides, with the sub-front and back running between the drawer box sides. This hides any end grain from view. Also, you can put your pocket holes on the drawer box sub-front and back, where they will be completely out of view once in use.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you were to just screw the sides directly to the drawer fronts in a butt joint, those screws would be more likely to fail and pull out over time, and your drawer then has completely fallen apart. Having the sub-front, the screws holding the box together are perpendicular to the force from pulling the drawer open, and that force will be shear force, so that joint will be stronger.</p>

"Building a Cabin; only un-powered hand tools. Need advice","207","","<p>Recently I had a crazy plan. And I need some advice about how to go about doing it. </p>

<p>I wanted to build a small garden shed, more kinda like a cabin actually. 
So I started drawing it out, and listing the timber I would need. But then I started thinking... What if I would build it by just buying a bunch of logs, and do it the old fashioned way? </p>

<p>Note that I live in Belgium, all wood needs to be bought from a nearby mill. </p>

<p>Several reason why I want to attempt this, but that doesn't really matter. </p>

<p>First thing first, the design! 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vayn5.png"" alt=""Cabin Design"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gU0Kk.png"" alt=""Beam structure"">
Info about the design: it is 6 meters in length en 3 meters across. Top beam also at 3meters height. </p>

<p>The first thing I want to try is hewing the beams myself.<br>
Few questions:
- I read somewhere it is best to use fairly fresh cut threes for this, to make the hewing easier. But how long do I need to dry them afterwards before using? If I just seal and use them directly will I risk the whole thing cracking and becoming askew? 
- which woods would be suitable for this? I need to buy the logs, and thought about asking some pine, because it will be cheaper then buying maple logs. But are all pine threes suitable for this? Or do I need to specifically ask for lariks or Douglas? Or is poplar, or something else worth the extra price? </p>

<p>I think that I will first try my hand at the hewing, and then see if I (we) am up to milling the rest by hand also.</p>

<p>Note that I want to only use hand tools, and no power tools. Hewing will be done by axe. Other milling would be done by saw and axe also. This might seem crazy (it probably is), but there are several reasons to work this way. </p>

<p>Any more advance on making this project work would be welcome! I have some woodworking experience, and a number of tools (mostly hand tools). </p>

<p>Thanks for all advice! </p>
","<p>What you're talking about is timber-frame construction, and you're on the right track.</p>

<p><strong>I read somewhere it is best to use fairly fresh cut trees for this, to make the hewing easier.</strong></p>

<p>Yup. Green wood is much easier to cut, especially with hand tools.</p>

<p><strong>But how long do I need to dry them afterwards before using? If I just seal and use them directly will I risk the whole thing cracking and becoming askew?</strong></p>

<p>You don't dry them separately. You assemble while still green, and let them dry naturally. With siding, flooring and roofing in place, these will keep the frame from distorting. Of course, the joints are going to loosen up as the wood shrinks, and the beams will check like crazy, but that is not usually a problem. Consider that, if you were to dry the pieces separately, you'd need to stack and sticker them so that the weight of the pile will keep them from warping as they dry, and even then you could count on some distortion. </p>

<p><strong>which woods would be suitable for this? I need to buy the logs, and thought about asking some pine, because it will be cheaper then buying maple logs.</strong></p>

<p>Particularly for a small building like this, pine is the way to go. You don't need the high strength of hardwoods like oak, and the lighter wood will make assembly easier. And maple is an especially poor choice. Even while green it's harder to form, and in the event of leaks in the roofing, any water buildup will quickly lead to rot.</p>

<p><strong>But are all pine threes suitable for this? Or do I need to specifically ask for lariks or Douglas? Or is poplar, or something else worth the extra price?</strong></p>

<p>For a small project like this, larch is probably best, since you're looking for locally-grown timber, and as far as i know, larch is the most common softwood in Europe. If you can get pine, that would work just as well. I'm pretty sure that Douglas Fir is a non-starter, being extremely hard to find as green logs in your country. Your building is small enough that almost anything will do from a strength standpoint.</p>

","<p>The issue is not HP, but RPM.  As long as the motor spins at the manufactures recommended RPM, and you didn't change the gear or pulley that drives the lower wheel, it will spin at the same RPM as with the smaller motor. But it will cut more efficiently under load. </p>

<p>Nice looking saw, BTW.  I've never heard of Beaver Brand.  Is that a throat height extender, or is that simply the way it's made? </p>

<p>Some things I would check before purchase:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Are the wheels coplanar?  If they aren't, it will be hard to get the blade to track right.  Usually issues of planar-ness (whatever you call that condition) can be fairly easily resolved with shims or even tightening something.   </p></li>
<li><p>Are the tires in good shape? Changing tires is a serious pain in the butt.  It is a straightforward exercise, however, with plenty of YouTube's to get you through it. </p></li>
<li><p>Upper and lower blade guides ok? If they are missing or broken, you can hopefully find replacements, but after market options might be viable. </p></li>
<li><p>Deformation in the neck, usually from leaving a fully tensioned blade on for too long.  This isn't the end of the world, but it will effect blade tensioning, blade length, and even planar-icity :). </p></li>
<li><p>Tensioner spring sprung? They wear out over time.  You can extend spring life with washers, but eventually you bottom out and can't apply enough tension. </p></li>

"What drill bit should be used for cutting steel","205","","<p>I am making beds for my garden and am using treated wood with steel bracket like things. I need to make holes in them and the wood. I am doing 12 of these beds, what bit will hold up and cut through both the wood and steel.</p>
","<p>I thought I might as well convert my Comment above seeing as nobody else posted an Answer specifying the exact bit type.</p>

<p><strong>Bit type</strong><br>
The bit you're looking for is a twist bit which perhaps you already have? </p>

<p>These days they're commonly available in three finishes, bare steel, black oxide and ""titanium-coated"" (more accurately, coated in titanium nitride). </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bcndF.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bcndF.jpg"" alt=""Twist bits/twist drills""></a></p>

<p>Most bare steel bits will be HSS, short for high-speed steel, a hard and durable alloy that is highly resistant to softening at high temperatures. Both of the other types can be HSS under their respective coatings too.</p>

<p>It's still possible to buy carbon-steel twist bits today, especially if they're very cheap. The durability of these bits when boring into steel can be low, especially if heat is allowed to build up during drilling (this can literally cause a bit to go blunt the first time it's used — if the tip goes blue it got too hot and will have 'lost temper', becoming little harder than the steel brackets you're drilling into).</p>

<p><strong>Method</strong><br>
When preparing to drill into the steel a centre-punch must be used first to put a dimple into the metal. This is to to help prevent the tip from wandering, but even so some care must be exercised to keep the bit on the mark before it starts to cut and form its own hole.</p>

<p>Even though HSS is very heat-tolerant you may need to lubricate periodically during drilling (e.g. with 3-in-One or motor oil, fresh or unused) to prevent buildup of excess heat. The steel may drill much more slowly than you're used to but don't press hard to get the bit to pierce it, as always it's best to let the tool do the work at its own pace. </p>

<p>Once the bit has gotten through the steel and enters the wood expect it to suddenly increase its boring speed, so be prepared for this as the drill may jerk which always comes with the risk of a snapped bit. </p>

<p><strong>Personal protection</strong><br>
Wearing eye protection is advisable, and especially if doing the drilling indoors ear protection too (common foam earplugs are fine for this level of noise).</p>

","<p>As requested I'm turning my Comment into an Answer.</p>

<p>These look like classic water stains to me. The end grain of wood is likened to the open ends of a bundle of straws and can absorb moisture like a sponge which is why stains can run so deep.</p>

<p>Note that if the staining runs very deeply indeed say 4"" (10cm) or more, or clearly progressing down through the longitudinal grain (which isn't absorbent) it is from fungal activity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this a temporary condition? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The colour change is usually permanent (as in it won't go away on its own or fade from sunlight exposure). </p>

<p>It is possibly treatable with certain kinds of wood bleach though. If the stains are due to iron in the water good results should be achieved using oxalic acid which is the classic treatment for this type of staining:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ttoB.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ttoB.jpg"" alt=""Oxalic acid for dark water stains""></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does it cause any problems working with it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it's just staining the wood won't be any different that you'd notice. With many woods however if water is in contact with it for a long time (either in one go or through repeated wetting cycles) decay can set in, but staining will often occur a long time before decay starts. </p>

<p>It's hard to tell for sure from the photo but the wood looks sound so this could merely be a cosmetic issue. If not the soft earlywood (the pale parts of the grain) will be softer than normal, noticeably spongy or 'punky'.</p>

","<p>Your best 'chance' is using moisture.  Basically getting the wood 'wet' and straightening it, then letting it dry straight.  Some woods and small bends might work with wetting/moistening the board.  However, steaming the board is likely to be the most successful on the widest ranges of species and quality.  It also is unlikely to be worth the extra effort vs. just buying another board that will meet your needs.</p>

<p>I think I get it now. The doors you speak of do not stop fire dead. It's not about fire protection but more about giving time for people to be able to leave the premises. Fire beats wood. That is a fact. It does however take time. A basic definition from a Quora post:</p>

<p>What can I do to mitigate this? Can I clamp the rear of the fence safely? </p>
","<p>My dad had a crappy old fence on his old table saw.  When accuracy was important we used a straight edge, (usually a board) and clamped it to the table.  It was a major pain to measure, clamp, and then adjust because we moved it tightening down the clamp.</p>

<p>But what I'm getting at is as long as the clamp does not interfere with the path of the wood passed the blade and fence, using a clamp to keep your fence from moving shouldn't be a big deal.  Of course you'll want to make sure that the far end isn't closer to the blade than the back end (or you'll bind the blade!) and you might want a clamp on both ends, just in case by having the far side clamped the near side doesn't start moving (and binding the blade!).</p>

"How to strip veneer","199","","<p>What is the best way to strip veneer off an old table?</p>

<p>I've been advised to use a piece of glass and scrape it off, and I also tried leaving a wet towel on it for a while then trying to rub it off (which works somewhat).</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I've been advised to use a piece of glass and scrape it off, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Glass can make a very effective scraper but not for this type of thing. I think it could pose a very real danger to the user. </p>

<p>When scraping off something that is firmly adhered to a surface it is quite common for the tool to 'stall', come to a sudden halt, because it meets a great-than-average resistance at one spot or along one edge. This happens frequently when scraping wallpaper for example, which is far less strongly adhered than veneer would typically be. So I think you should take it that this isn't a <em>might happen</em> when removing veneer, it is a <em>will happen</em>. </p>

<p>And when it does the piece of glass could shatter in the user's hands, with the evident danger of one or more nasty cuts. And although of really secondary importance it also poses a risk to the surface you're working on.</p>

<p>A steel scraper of one kind or another would be far preferable here (see bottom for specific recommendations). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I also tried leaving a wet towel on it for a while then trying to rub it off (which works somewhat).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a good start but it's only one half of the usual solution which is moisture plus heat. You can use an iron over brown paper or any thin cloth after saturating the surface with water, the iron forces steam through the wooden veneer and swells and weakens the glue layer, allowing the veneer to be peeled away from the substrate.</p>

<p>This is the theory at least. However, as is common with many things in practice it may not work as well as the description makes it sound. </p>

<p>The first assumption here is that ""hide glue"" was used. In traditional veneer work a form of protein glue was often used (not always derived just from hides) and this does respond very well to heat and moisture. But that is by no means the only glue used in veneering.</p>

<p>Since just dampening the surface does appear to have been beneficial I will assume you are dealing with a protein glue. So here's a brief description of the method I would use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a sharp knife to deeply score the veneer. This serves two functions: first, it gives a certain entry to the water vapour in case there is a solid layer of finish still in place (which can be very water-resistant); second, it creates natural fracture lines that will allow the veneer to be more easily levered up in neat sections.</li>
<li>Wet the area to be worked well with a cloth or sponge. A drop or two of dishwashing liquid in the water breaks surface tension and can aid with penetration.</li>
<li>Apply a hot iron — set on Cotton or Linen setting, you want it as hot as possible to force steam into the glue layer. Usually ironing is done over a damp towel or brown paper rather than directly on the surface of the wood (this is as much to protect the iron from getting glue residue burnt onto the sole plate).</li>
<li>After the heat from the iron has had a chance to have an effect (maybe a minute or so) begin scraping, working from an edge of the veneer where possible.</li>
<li>Continue working in small areas until all veneer has been removed.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of types of scraper that you can use for this sort of work, but two good options are a triangular shavehook or a firm putty knife:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uIIm7.jpg"" alt=""Two types of scraper""></p>

<p><strong>Safety note:</strong> wear gloves. This is to protect against the obvious danger of splinters from the fracturing veneer but also to prevent scalds as you are scraping up <em>hot</em> wet wood and glue.</p>

<p>Once all the veneer is off the substrate is exposed but will be covered in a thin film of glue, and likely a few lumps of it as well. This can be dealt with just by scraping dry if desired, a triangular shavehook is very good at tackling scraping of dried glue from a table surface. </p>

<p>If you would prefer to work wet, a nylon scrubbing pad or other pot scourer (a new one!) can be used with hot water to scrub the glue residue from the surface. Change water at least once.</p>

<p>Once every trace of glue has been removed, allow the wood to dry thoroughly before doing anything else (a few hours to overnight). Once the surface is dry you can smooth it off using a <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1744/recommendation-for-manual-planing-and-sanding/1748#1748"">card scraper</a> or by sanding, in preparation for whatever next step you wish to take.</p>

<p>If I'm reading this correctly 3/4"" <em>is</em> your radius, so double that is the diameter of the bit you need to use. I don't think it's any more complicated than that.</p>

<p>To place the centre point in relation to the corner, you can do that just by marking outwards in both directions 3/4"" and using a try square to cross the lines. Alternatively if you want to mark along the 45°, using Pythagoras it'll be 1.06"" (or just a hair under 27mm) from the corner.</p>

","<blockquote>

<p>Yes the should be, but species matters. If the legs are cheap pine for example they won't be nearly as strong as if they were any reasonable pieces of white oak. Just to note that you will need to cut the tenons to fit the mortises very carefully as any play will result in weaker joints*. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does a woodworker calculate load bearing for legs, especially </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's a good question and the answer is they usually don't. This is generally a seat-of-the-pants thing for nearly all furniture work. It's widely acknowledged that a lot of furniture is a little to a lot over-engineered, using material that's thicker than needed and with joints stronger than than strictly necessary. But together they give better assurance that something will hold up well to use and abuse over a long lifespan.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes you need to account for movement. Only on quite small projects can you get away with ignoring it completely (if using solid wood). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If so, how would I adjust for that so I don't get a split?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's nothing in the overall design that needs to be adjusted, but there are a few areas to pay attention to. </p>

<p><strong>Vertical divider</strong><br>
In case it's not obvious you need to orient the grain of this vertically to match the case, so that expansion and contraction occurs back to front and not up and down. </p>

<p>If you oriented the grain on this horizontally at maximum expansion (during the wettest part of the year) the panel would exert enough force that it would probably bow the top and bottom, and if the back panel were fixed in place it could split it or tear it free from the case.</p>

<p><strong>Back panel</strong><br>
I would recommend you make this from plywood or another board material. </p>

<p>If you make it from solid wood the grain <em>must</em> run horizontally and it would be highly advisable to make it up from quarter-sawn wood to keep dimensional changes within reasonable limits.</p>

<p><strong>Leg assembly</strong><br>
This is a little over-engineered by the way. Two leg frames that aren't joined at all would be fine here, but go ahead with it as designed if you want the practice in the joinery. If you would like to simplify it slightly the cross-members can be joined with half laps/halving joints instead of with M&amp;T joints which aren't necessary for strength here.</p>

<p>How you join this to the case is critical. Since the leg assembly is much like the legs and apron on a table, and the grain on the case is as it would be on a tabletop you should basically attach the two together in the same sort of way. See <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2720/will-these-table-legs-support-this-table/2731#2731"">this previous Answer</a> for two good simple methods. </p>

<hr>

<p>*If this does occur you don't necessarily need to re-cut the components however. Instead you could glue using epoxy, which is a very good gap-filling adhesive (most common wood glues are not). Fill the epoxy with fine sanding dust to a thicker consistency if necessary, aim for a viscosity anywhere from around thick honey to that of mayonnaise. Use a slow-setting epoxy to give yourself plenty of time to work. </p>

<p>If you want even further security in addition you could peg the tenons through the face of the joint. Glue the tenons in first, wait for the adhesive to set then drill and peg.</p>

","<p>I'd say that CAD is not necessarily your best option. Don't get me wrong. CAD is a great thing and learning any CAD software will be a very handy thing to have up your sleeve. I highly recommend learning any CAD software (no matter how limited or advanced)</p>

<p>However, there are a few problems:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have not done woodworking much before</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think of CAD software as a helper to create (mostly) any 3D geometry. Unless you have some very advanced CAD software, it will not tell you if that geometry makes any sense.</p>

<p>You can spend hours creating something, which might be hard or impossible to manufacture.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>making a good template that my friend can follow...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What's possible and what not can be hard to tell. It depends on what material (wood) is available and what tools are available to shape or modify it. Maybe your design is valid, but your friend lacks the right router bit to do it. Chances are that he <strong>cannot</strong> follow it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>my small wood phone dock project</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Starting with a small project is a great idea! It can be easy to bite off more than one can chew, but with a small project it's easy to finish it.
And for a small project, you have to ask yourself if CAD isn't overkill.</p>

<p>Here are my suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Design the project with your friend together. Don't sit alone in the basement for 3 months designing something in some CAD program that cannot be manufactured. The important thing is to understand what's possible with wood and what isn't. This way you can understand the important details of your design that make it either hard or easy to make. This depends on what tools and wood are available to your friend, which is why I recommend doing it together with him.</li>
<li>Doing the design with your friend allows him to understand you. An ongoing communication is a lot easier to understand than just throwing a technical drawing at somebody ""I want this done Tuesday!"". Make simple sketches (on paper or any drawing program) to document what you both agree on.</li>
<li>(optional) if you want to get into CAD, create a 3D part from the sketches. This is easier for you now, because you know the end result. You are not learning the CAD program and figuring out the design at the same time.</li>

<ul>
<li>Drill + electric screwdriver: Already have, my husband owns one. </li>
<li>Circular saw (What power? Would 1150W be enough? (<a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Decker-CD602-Circular-SAW/dp/B00074ETOM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>)) </li>

</ul>

<p>I'm sure there are other things I need too. How do I figure out what other tools I will need for a particular project? </p>
","<p>Just to warn you advance, this sort of question is a bit of a rabbit hole. Any one list of tools might suit someone (and that could be you) but run it by 10 other craftsmen and they'll each try to sell you the benefits of their own list which their individual experiences argue are a better starter set.... and I can virtually guarantee that none of them will be exactly the same, which goes to show how individual tool choices can be. </p>

<p>So take any one list as merely a suggestion, no matter who it's from and how much experience they have. It might suit the writer perfectly but an equally experienced other guy or gal might use quite a different set.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does this list look okay? Anything else I need?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK so good news first, three entries on your list are fairly universally useful.</p>

<p>Firstly a drill of some kind is a must-have. A power drill and a driver are obviously useful and few modern lists would not include one or both. In case you're not aware a drill which can be run slowly enough (using light finger pressure on the trigger) can function as a driver, and this is what many use instead of having a separate powered screwdriver.</p>

<p>A Workmate is a good inclusion, many would agree that one or a <em>good</em> equivalent (many poor folding benches out there, and Workmates are not nearly as good as they once were) is a sound first/early purchase for the new DIYer or aspiring woodworker. This sort of bench is not your only option, if you had to you could work on a kitchen table with just a couple of clamps, but they have a lot to recommend them and once you own one you'll continually find new ways to use it. As a book I read recently said in essence, <em>""Get a Workmate early, you won't ever outgrow it.""</em></p>

<p>Now the bad, a circular saw seems like a really odd inclusion in a list of first-buy tools. For me one of these would be so far down the list that it wouldn't even register on radar. Although in the hands of an experienced user they are very capable really they're mainly for dealing with big pieces, cutting them down to rough size (note that, not really intended for finished cuts) to begin work on a project. Many woodworkers use theirs for breaking down sheet good such as plywood or MDF <em>and nothing else</em>. And many woodworkers don't own one and have no intention of ever buying one because everything a circular saw might be used for they'd prefer to do with another power saw or a handsaw.</p>

<p>A decent modern panel saw with hardened general-purpose or multi-function teeth (or arguable better, a traditional ripsaw and a cross-cut saw) along with a jigsaw would IMO be a much better use of your money. What you'd lose in terms of speed cutting down large sheet goods you'd more than gain in versatility. Plus all three together could well cost less than a decent circular saw.</p>

<p>You might be put off by the idea of cutting large stock to size with a handsaw, but it's not really as fatiguing as many people assume. As the common advice states, ""let the saw do the work"". A sharp saw and good technique (not forcing the cut, standing clear of the saw so you're not in your own way, breathing easy as you work) make for a good sawing experience, and usually straighter cuts to boot. Even if you find you do need to take rests after every long cut that's OK, it's not a race :-)</p>

<p><strong>Other tools</strong>  </p>

<p>Now the most glaring omission from your list is that there are no measuring or marking tools, which any kit must have. Can't cut anything to size or length without 'em. At minimum I'd recommend the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tape measure.</li>
<li>12"" steel rule (must be steel as wood, plastic or aluminium won't stand up to the use of a marking knife).</li>
<li>No. 2 pencil.</li>
</ul>

<p>A couple of other tools that will be of direct use in making the item pictured in your Question:</p>

<ul>
<li>A block plane</li>
<li>Bevel gauge.</li>
<li>A sanding block.</li>
<li>A pack of quality sandpaper.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the block plane my main recommendation would be a low-angle one (blade held at 12-15°) with an adjustable mouth. Note that if you get a plane now or plan to get any chisels in the future you will need some stuff for sharpening from day one. Most tools are not sharp enough to use straight from the maker and will anyway require re-sharpening quite soon after you begin using them (within hours or days, depending on the wood you're using and the amount of use to which they're put). Read a bit more on sharpening <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/672/is-there-a-best-way-to-sharpen-an-edged-tool-like-a-chisel"">in this previous Q&amp;A</a>.</p>

<p>You can make your own sanding block very easily but there are numerous inexpensive ones available to buy that work well.</p>

<p>Good sandpaper is quite a bit more expensive than cheap sandpaper but more than pays for itself. The difference in how long the paper lasts can be extraordinary. You might also like to look into Abranet which is an abrasive-impregnated mesh.</p>

<p>Optional but desirable now, definitely useful in the future:</p>

<ul>
<li>Starter set of 3-5 chisels (buy in Aldi or Harbor Freight, cheapest available but useable).</li>
<li>Marking gauge.</li>
<li>Boxcutter, X-acto knife or Stanley knife, to use as a marking knife. Any sharp small blade will do for this initially, so if you happen to have a pocketknife in the house already that'll do.</li>
<li>A <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1134/what-are-the-differences-between-sanding-and-scraping/1159#1159"">card scraper</a> or the standard set of three.</li>
<li>Fine-toothed pull saw (makes extremely good cross-cuts that you may decide do not need to be sanded). Inexpensive ones of these (sub-$20) with hardened teeth can work very well and will give long service.</li>
</ul>

","<p>I think the major danger that riving knives address is binding on the blade from the kerf closing.

<p><sup>Source: <strong>Good Wood Joints</strong>, by Albert Jackson &amp; David Day.</sup></p>

<p>Once the glue has set on those you can then drill vertically through the lap (clamp firmly to a scrap of wood to minimise blowout at the back when the bit exits) and drill a matching hole in the centre of the leg for a dowel, I'd suggest using 3/8"" dowel here. </p>

<p>This dowel will in effect become a round tenon, and the drilled hole through the lap joint is the mortise. So this is a 'cheats' way of doing a mortise-and-tenon joint, one of the strongest joints in woodworking.</p>

<p>Drill the hole in the leg slightly deeper than necessary to give a little room for excess glue to accumulate. If you buy smooth dowel you should prepare it for joint use by grooving it somehow, see <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3841/how-can-i-flute-my-own-dowel-or-create-dowel-with-similar-properties"">this previous Q&amp;A</a>.</p>

"How long does it take to sharpen a saw blade?","195","","<p>To give some context: my cheap, £10 tenon saw that I've used for nearly everything for the last 2 or 3 years is showing signs of becoming dull. As it's the usual hardpoint type, I have read that it can't be re-sharpened, so I have to buy a new one. I am considering whether to buy another of the same kind of non-resharpenable saw, or whether to buy one that can be resharpened.</p>

<p>I understand the trade-off is that the re-sharpenable kind will be made of softer steel and so will need to be sharpened several times in the lifetime of one ""disposable"" saw. For me, one of the deciding factors in whether that trade-off is worth it is how difficult the re-sharpening process is. I have read descriptions of how to do it and it looks difficult but doable to learn to sharpen one saw tooth. But there are a lot of teeth and I haven't seen any mention of how long the whole process takes.</p>

<p>I may have other questions on the subject of saw selection but for now, to prevent this becoming too broad, let's stick to the question of how long the re-sharpening process takes. </p>
","<p>For a saw that has not been abused (ie missing teeth or other non standard use problems) you will only need to  run the file across the teeth several times per  tooth to restore the edge and points.  Going too deep will only cause more problems.  So assuming that it takes, say 5 to 10 seconds to file and examine each tooth, you can do the math base upon the teeth per inch and the length of the blade.  Don't forget to add time to clamp the blade, sip your beverage and admire your handiwork. I have never found the time needed to sharpen a blade to be an obstacle.  I use that time to think about what project I want to do  next and how the shop really needs a deep cleaning (if only I didn't have to sharpen this blade instead).  Good luck!</p>

<p>BTW I have taken several old second hand saws and restored them.  I get more pleasure out of using them than a new, cheap, disposable saw.  (I think I have bonded with them).</p>

"Stair treads do not look smooth after sanding and finishing","195","","<p>I recently bought a house and decided to remove the carpet from the stairs and install hardwood instead. To save money, I decided to buy unfinished stair treads and risers and to finish them myself. This is my first time with woodworking, so please bear with me here.</p>

<p>After researching on the web, I bought sanding paper, oil-based stains and polyurethane, and started working.</p>

<p>My first and perhaps only problem is that despite sanding for a long time with an ROS, the wood just does not seem smooth. The density of the wood seems unequal and I can see small gaps along the grain in some areas. Those areas are smooth to the touch when I run my hand along the grain, but not across the grain. See below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QBiFY.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QBiFY.jpg"" alt=""Linear gaps along the grain.""></a></p>

<p>Giving up on sanding, I decided to apply stain on the surface. The areas with gaps absorb more stain, and it actually creates a good-looking color effect. However, we can clearly see that the darker areas are ""rougher"":</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cu6O7.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cu6O7.jpg"" alt=""Result after stain application""></a></p>

<p>Applying 2 coats of oil-based poly over this does not really fix the problem. It looks like light reflects differently on the darker areas and it doesn't look very good when placed under the light.</p>

<p>Is all of this normal? Is it because of bad wood quality? Did I just not sand enough? </p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Note: the wood used is a smaller piece just for testing purposes prior to finishing the actual stair treads.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>The density of the wood seems unequal and I can see small gaps along the grain in some areas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The wood in your pictures appears to be oak and the texture in the grain is common in that wood. I assume that you began with a course sandpaper 80-100 grit +/- to remove an major dents or impressions in the wood and proceeded to finer grits such as 150 an finally 220. The root cause of the tiny gaps in the wood is due to the cellular structure of the wood.  Annual growth of the tree adds less dense fiber in the spring and denser material later in the year.  That is why the stain is expressed lighter and darker across the board.  More stain is absorbed into the cellular structure in the less dense areas with much less absorption where the grain is tighter.  This is common in oak and the variation in darkness with the stain is one of its appealing features.  If you apply several coats of finish the varnish/poly will bridge the gaps and provide  good finish appearance.  If you take a close look at other installations you will probably find similar conditions.  I suggest you finish a test piece first to satisfy yourself that the overall result is acceptable.</p>

<p>This is a problem I think. The edges of both the inlay and the rebate are end grain, and joints of end grain to end grain are the weakest glue joint. I would highly recommend laying a bed of epoxy underneath the inlay, so that it basically fills the void underneath. Not only will this <em>hugely</em> improve the bond to the inlay it will add strength to that part of the board as well so you get a two-for-one benefit.</p>

"How to properly deburr a chisel","192","","<p>I'm struggling getting my chisels as sharp as I want them to. For example, they ""catch"" on almost all woods and by no means cut any hairs from my arm.</p>

<p>I've bought the plans and built <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKzmN2Qw4k"" rel=""noreferrer"">John Heinz's sharpening jig</a> which took my sharpening to the next level and they are much sharper than before... but still not <em>quite</em> there. </p>

<p>The one part in the sharpening process that I'm struggling with is removing the burr. As I'm attempting to deburr one side, it twists and goes to the other. I flip the chisel and the burr twists to the other side again. I can't seem to completely remove it. Some people lay the chisel flat on the stone and push against the edge. Others pull. Others go sideways. They all claim their method yields great results (I can't seem to get rid of the damned thing).</p>

<p>Is there anything that I'm doing wrong?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>The one part in the sharpening process that I'm struggling with is removing the burr. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most people do when starting out so don't worry you're not alone. </p>

<p>Also even experienced sharpeners will experience some difficulty every now and then because this is not only an issue of technique, sometimes the steel itself can be uncooperative.</p>

<p>I'm a fairly harsh critic of sharpening books and the sections on sharpening in general woodworking books and this is the main area where I think they fall down. They quite consistently fail to serve their readers because few give a realistic idea of how difficult it can be sometimes to get rid of the last of the burr or wire edge — when user experience with razors &amp; knives, chisels and plane irons has a wealth of anecdotal evidence that says it is quite common for it to be difficult.</p>

<p>In short, most books just don't devote enough column inches to this (and a few other issues) which can leave beginners, and even more advanced learners, wallowing when they encounter a problem. I know I'm not the only one who has ""chased a burr"" as it's called for minutes and failed to get it to detach. This can be confusing and disheartening because the books make it sound so easy!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As I'm attempting to deburr one side, it twists and goes to the other. I flip the chisel and the burr twists to the other side again. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, perfectly normal. Some steels hold on to the burr or wire edge more strongly so it can be much more difficult to remove it <em>on a stone</em> than in other cases. But once the burr is small enough you can, and IMO most of us should, switch to a different method to get rid of the last of it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can't seem to completely remove it. Some people lay the chisel flat on the stone and push against the edge. Others pull. Others go sideways. They all claim their method yields great results </p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of those can work. </p>

<p>I've tried them all and had success with all three. Although I have my preference woodworkers I have great respect for use one of the other two and get results at least as good if not better than mine so it's clear they can all work and work well if the user is doing it properly.</p>

<p>Note that some steels have a definite preference for edge-trailing, others edge-leading which is something to look into further and experiment with on your own tools. </p>

<p><strong>So how do I get rid of the damn burr anyway?</strong><br>
Whatever works. </p>

<p>Some older guides* say to run the honed edge sideways through an end-grain block to remove the remaining burr. This basically tears the burr off which sounds a little crude but it can work quite well and I still use this method every now and then for a stubborn burr (as I say, whatever works). But after this I will strop and that refines the edge considerably. </p>

<p>Stropping is a great way to finish off honing (<a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/4722/when-sharpening-how-do-i-assess-what-grit-to-start-on/4735#4735"">or used alone as a honing method</a>) and once the burr is fine enough virtually any type of stropping will remove it without effort. And stropping is good assurance that a very small burr (too small to see with the naked eye) will be removed if present.</p>

<p>I'm going to go into more of the things included in your Question below which don't directly relate to the removing the burr.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sand the backside flat with 110, 220, 400 grit. Change to DMT diamond stone and go at it with 600 (25μ) and 1200 (9μ) grit equivalent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't know how much of the back you were doing but just to have it said, on most tools only a very narrow band near the edge needs to be flattened and then worked smooth through the grits.</p>

<p>In plane irons it can literally be mere millimetres wide (1/32""-1/64"") while with new chisels the flat area will generally end up wider naturally, often being 20-50mm (~1""-2"") without any special effort made.</p>

<p>While it's not a mistake to do most or all of the flat of a chisel (or plane iron if you're <em>really</em> masochistic) in general it's a waste of time because it doesn't do anything to improve the performance of the tool.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do the same thing with the primary bevel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a mistake. If you're planning on creating a secondary bevel anyway you can ignore the primary bevel completely. </p>

<p>The primary could literally be formed on 80-grit paper (you can visualise how rough that would be) and you can still leave it because the honing of the secondary will refine the narrow band of steel at the edge which is all that needs to be refined to create the finished sharp edge.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: the weird shape is due to the photo angle; the actual chisel is perfectly square.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's actually OK if a chisel is slightly out of square. Most freehand sharpeners will creep out of square over time (generally to one side or the other based on which hand is dominant and their overall technique) and it doesn't hamper the usability of the chisel in any meaningful way. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Other people on this site insist that going to 8000 grit is required. Others say that 800 + honing is more than enough. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They're both wrong :-) </p>

<p>Or they're both right. This is partly a matter for each person to decide for themselves — ""How sharp do <em>my</em> chisels need to be?"" — and partly how anal you are about the appearance of the honed surfaces LOL </p>

<p>Two things to bear in mind. The first is that in the West in the past virtually no working woodworkers in cabinet shops or joinery workshops had more than two sharpening stones available to them and the finer one could be classed as a medium at best by today's standards! And yet quite evidently they didn't have an issue with blunt tools.</p>

<p>The second is that the finer the edge created the more it degrades when steel meets wood. The harder the wood the faster the degradation — with many hardwoods within the first 10 or a dozen cuts! So the superb edge created by 8k, 10k and even 30k is usually transient.</p>

<p>There's much more written about both of these final issues if you want to Google further.</p>

<hr>

<p>*Just for completeness I'll mention that very old guides can mention that pros (or ""experienced Mechanics"" as they might be referred to by the writer) often finish off by stroking the edge across the palm of the other hand but as with those guides I wouldn't generally recommend this to the leisure woodworker for a few reasons, the main one obviously being the potential for injury.</p>

A wand would only receive pressure on the long part and not the ends, but it would receive pressure from all around.  Is rift sawn still the strongest cut?  Does it matter?  Money is not an issue.  I care only about strength and durability over time.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I am having a wand made, and I wondered if wood cuts mattered. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically no it shouldn't. Assuming I am imagining the form of the wand correctly, the grain will run across the cross-section in nearly exactly the same way irrespective of the cut of the original piece of wood:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tnqDs.jpg"" alt=""Quarter- v. plain-sawn cross sections""><br>
Grain orientation in the <em>other</em> direction on the other hand might contribute greatly to whether you end up with a stronger or weaker piece. If the wand is straight (somewhat like a drumstick or a conductor's baton) then straight grain that runs the full length will give the strongest result, but if there is what is called grain run-out (second image below) it will be more prone to failure if subjected to sideways forces:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rDuQr.jpg"" alt=""Grain runout""></p>

<p>Note this is only relatively weak, very strong woods like oak and hickory can be very resilient even if the grain is less than ideal (as is the case on many modern axe and hammer handles for example).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I heard rift sawn wood is the best for strength in boards, but they only receive pressure from the surface.</p>

<p>Other things being equal quarter-sawn should be the strongest, and most stable (in addition to having the visual characteristics that it is often valued for). As Matt's answer already covers, some rift-sawn planks will effectively be quarter-sawn wood, but not all. So strength (and stability) of rift-sawn wood can be highly variable.</p>

<p>Alternating clamps top and bottom is a good way to help achieve a flat glue-up, but if you want to be absolutely sure you need to actually clamp the top flat somehow. You can do this with individual clamp pressure at each joint being glued (using just a C-clamp or with a purpose-made clamping accessory) or do it across the entire span using a caul.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could the bow be because of over tightening the pipe clamps?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think so if you alternated clamps. Definitely a possible cause if you hadn't done this though.</p>

<p><strong>Brief note on clamp pressure:</strong> with a joint like this which relies completely on the glue bond for strength you actually do want to clamp <em>hard</em>. The clamp pressure should be sufficient to squeeze out all the excess glue, which in practice means you want to clamp hard enough that you're forced to use scrap blocks to prevent denting of the edges by the clamps. If you've done your edge jointing well this sort of clamping pressure will result in glue joints so thin you can't see them — minimum standard you should aim for is not being able to seem them at arm's length, if you're more discerning they should be completely invisible no matter how closely you look.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What else could have contributed to the bow?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clamping the glue-up flat with further clamps may not have prevented this from occurring however because I suspect acclimation may have been at least partially the cause. </p>

<p><strong>Wood not ready</strong><br>
Regardless of how long the pine sat in your workshop prior to you using it if you planed it down to final thickness in one go (especially if from one side more than another, or one side only) and then used it quickly that could have directly led to it warping unfortunately. </p>

<p>It's a much better strategy if time allows to plane down partially to thickness, putting the wood aside (stickered, and with heavy weights on top) to acclimate again, and then after a few days or longer planing off the last 1/8"" (3mm) or so to get down to final working thickness. This gives the exposed core of a plank, which is generally slightly damper than the wood at the surface, time to get down to equilibrium with the working environment in stages, rather than all in one go.</p>

<p><strong>Not quite square</strong><br>
Another possible cause is an ever-so-slight discrepancy in the squareness of the edges, which after the glue has dried and the clamps are removed makes its presence known. Far less than half a degree is enough for a bow to be generated. So if you're not 100% certain that your edge jointing results in a perfect 90° edge it's a good idea to joint each pair of mating boards in alternate directions, that is, one face in to the fence and the next face out. This way any slight angle difference is cancelled out — see diagram <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NXRsU.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for clarity. The drawing relates to hand-jointed edges but the same principle applies to edges jointed by machine. </p>

","<p>Here are several options that come to mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cut smaller pieces</li>
<li>Get a bandsaw with resaw capacity of at least 9"" (many 14"" or larger bandsaws either come stock with 11-12"" resaw capacity, or can be upgraded with a riser block)</li>
<li>Use a saw with a significantly larger circular blade</li>
<li>Cut as deep as you can on both sides, then finish the job with a hand saw</li>
<li>Use a chainsaw mill (aka Alaska mill)--basically a guide for your chainsaw. It will require a fair amount of cleanup but it will be much less than if you make the cuts freehand</li>
<li>Have someone else with larger or more appropriate equipment cut the pieces for you--either hire a sawmill or make a new friend, perhaps someone in a local woodworking club.</li>
</ol>

<p>As Ashlar semi-jokingly noted in a comment, you could use a handsaw exclusively, but that would not be a fast or easy task, especially if you want to crosscut the pieces as illustrated in the picture.</p>

"Attach fastener into glue joint of two face-glued boards","188","","<p>I'm going to be building a bed for my daughter and my design calls for a larger piece of wood for the legs. I could use a 2x3 or 2x4, but am wondering if I could create the larger piece by gluing two or more smaller boards together as that would be cheaper (and easier to find at the big-box stores). The hiccup comes from the fact that I need to attach a piece of plywood to the legs (likely using pocket screws). I know glue joints are strong (stronger than the wood they are attaching in many cases), but is it a bad idea to screw into the glue joint like that?</p>

<p>In the sketch, the two boards making up the leg would be face glued, with the faces being parallel to the plywood panel.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dHJa1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dHJa1.png"" alt=""Footboard sketch""></a></p>
","<p>If the two boards are fully glued, they will act as a single unit and will not affect the strength of the screw connection, so go ahead.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a glued (mortise &amp; tenon) connection between the posts and plywood beam will perform better than a pocket screw connection.  In a glued connection, the stresses created whenever the bed frame is moved will be transferred between the pieces evenly instead of in concentrated screw locations. Eventually the forces will loosen the connection in a screwed joint and a gap may appear between the plywood and posts unless a mortise/tenon fitting is used.  Once you create such a joint to hide any movement gaps, you might as well glue it up.</p>

"Safe thickness for sliding dovetail in shelf","188","","<p>I am at the last cuts for a shelf which my wife asked for.
The whole thing is made out of cherry.  The shelf top is 7/8 inch thick.</p>

<p>The supporting brackets which are mounted to the wall studs are planned to have a pin running perpendicular to the wall which the shelf (having matching dovetail slots) will slide onto up to the wall.  </p>

<p>The supporting brackets are not as wide as the top shelf, so the sliding dovetails will be stopped at about 2/3 of the width of the shelf.</p>

<p>So my real question, after all the setup information, is what is a safe thickness for the dovetail slots in the shelf?  My gut feeling was about half of the thickness of the total shelf (so 7/16 of an inch or so).</p>

<p>I am sure there is a lot of slack either way but just wanted to make sure, or see if anyone had a good rule of thumb for this sort of thing.</p>

","<p>Considering the low loads and the dimensions you established there should not be any problem with making the dovetails extend 1/2 the depth of the shelf. </p>

<p><strong>A More Technical Discussion:</strong>
My statement above is based solely on my subjective experience, so I tried finding some more factual engineering information for evaluating this type of condition in wood.  If you look at the connection of the shelf and bracket placing a load on the shelf will result in the back of the shelf (against the wall) wanting to tilt up and the front to tilt down The bracket resists this force by holding the shelf down at the back and up in the front. This means that the shelf wants to pull out of the bracket at the back and the dovetail flanges must resist this.  At the front the shelf pushes down on the bracket/dovetail top edge and the dovetail sides do not contribute to the support. In both conditions the strength of the connection is measured by shear strength, which can be loosely considered as the ability of the wood to hold together when faced with adjacent up and down forces. <a href=""http://www.woodbin.com/ref/wood-strength-table/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Woodbin.com</a> provides a table for strength for various wood species.  For cherry the shear resistance is established as 1700 psi (pounds per square inch of stressed surface. In this case the depth of either the shelf or dovetail at the connection location.)  That means that if your shelf is 1"" thick and the dovetail reaches upward halfway, the load transfer between the shelf and brackets can resist 850 lbs in shear for every inch of length of the bracket/shelf joint.  Clearly failure of that joint is not going to be much of a problem in most woodworking projects.</p>

<p>Added Note: The shear strength from the table is for parallel with the grain which would apply to the dovetail. The shelf grain would run along the length of the shelf and perpendicular to the grain at the brackets.  The tables did not give that shear value, but I assume it would be greater still. In addition since the dovetail sides are sloped, even though the shear stress is parallel with the grain, the actual strength of the wood in the joint would be more complicated to calculate.  It is my assumption that it would be greater but I have no engineering proof.</p>

"How to make a heptagonal construction set?","186","","<p>I want to make a construction set with rods and nodes similar to <a href=""http://www.zometool.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Zome</a> or <a href=""http://www.knex.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">K'nex</a> or <a href=""http://www.knex.com/products/tinkertoy/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tinkertoys</a>. Mine will be in entirely in the plane and based on heptagonal (7-fold) symmetry. (In fact, I'd like Tetradecagonal (14-fold) symmetry, but I'll continue my question with 7.)</p>

<p>I imagine the rods will be fairly easy to make - bamboo skewers cut to certain lengths and stained accordingly to length (probably between about 5 and 15 cm).</p>

<p>The nodes will be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptagonal_prism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">heptagonal prisms</a> about 5mm thick and 10mm ""diameter"" with holes to fit the struts drilled into the centres of the (yellow) sides:</p>

<p>I imagine this could be most easily made from a length of wood with heptagonal cross section drilled and then cut up. (Alternatively, the nodes could instead be round and made from dowel or pvc pipe then drilled with 7 holes.)</p>

<p><strong>Question: How to make the heptagonal prism nodes? How to drill into the sides?</strong></p>
","<p>As far as I'm aware, there is no way to construct a ""true"" heptagon using only a straightedge and a compass.  However, there is an approximate way that might work.</p>

<p>To create a heptagon, first draw a circle.  The larger the circle, the more accurate your heptagon will be.  Then, using a dividers, set them to what looks to be the correct length of one of the sides.  Walk the dividers around the circle until you have paced out all seven sides.  Most likely you will land off the mark you started at, which means that your length needs adjusting.  Adjust the dividers longer or shorter as necessary, and repeat the process until you have the circle divided into seven even segments.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XLtji.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XLtji.gif"" alt=""heptagon dividers""></a><br>
(source: <a href=""http://www.emis.de/journals/NNJ/GA-Fig3.3-3.7.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">emis.de</a>)</p>

<p>Then, draw seven lines radiating from the center of the circle to each of the endpoints you stepped out with the dividers.  These will divide your circle into seven even slices.</p>

<p>I imagine that you will want to start out with a long, straight-grained dowel of a diameter that suits your size.  Place this dowel on the circle you just drew, making sure that the dowel is centered on the circle.  You might want to make some sort of clamping jig for this operation.  With the dowel coincident with the center of the circle, mark a line for each of the seven pie pieces you previously drew.</p>

<p>You will now have seven marks on the end of the dowel spaced evenly.  Next, carry these lines along the entire length of the dowel, making sure they are exactly parallel with one another.  At this point, you will have seven parallel lines along the length of the dowel that split it into seven even segments.</p>

<p>Now, take the dowel and place one end against a planing stop (or lightly pinch it between two dogs with your workbench tail vise, see image below).  One of the segments you marked should be facing directly upwards.  Using a hand plane (preferably a jointer plane), begin planing away the facet.  Stop when you get down to your lines.  Repeat for each of the seven sides of the heptagon, and you will be left with a heptagonal dowel.</p>

(source: <a href=""http://www.popularwoodworking.com/projects/3-classic-vises-made-with-pipe-clamps"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Popular Woodworking</a>)</p>

<p>At this point you can cut the dowel into slices to produce your corner pieces for your shapes.</p>

<p>For drilling, make a jig that cradles the slices such that the top face is horizontal (perpendicular to your drill press).  Then it's a simple matter of drilling out for the rods with the drill bit you want and at a depth that works for you.</p>

<p><strong>Of course</strong>, if you don't want to go to the trouble of making a heptagonal dowel (it's a lot of fiddly work), you could just use a regular dowel, slice it up, and mark your seven segments on the end of the slice.  Then, make a drilling jig that holds the dowels, and that has a mark directly on the bottom of the area that holds the dowels.  Then, all you have to do in index your marks to the bottom of the jig and drill your holes, rotating the dowel slice each time.</p>

"Is there a workbench ""type"" reference?","186","","<p>I currently use a cheap plastic and metal workbench that is both old and showing its age.  As a result, I want to build a better bench.  The only problem is that my research is turning up that there are many styles of workbenches that have been used over the years and if I know its name (say Roubo), I can google ""Roubo Workbench"" and get all the info I want and more about that particular design.  However, I have seen lots of different pictures and there does not seem to be many names associated (at least that I can find).</p>

<p>So, is there a reference that shows what various workbench styles are?  If such a reference exists, bonus points if it compares them to help me decide what exactly I want.</p>
","<p>If you read the woodworking forums there are two classic books on the subject of workbench design in English and I think both compare features and usefulness a you're hoping. The first is by Scott Landis, <strong>The Workbench Book</strong>, the second by Christopher Schwarz, <strong>Workbenches: From Design And Theory To Construction And Use</strong>. </p>

<p>People seem divided on which of these is the better, if you're really interested I think you should read both. A local library may have one or the other if you're lucky so you wouldn't have to buy both. It doesn't get mentioned as much (don't know why) but <strong>The Workbench: A Complete Guide to Creating Your Perfect Bench</strong> by Lon Schleining must also be mentioned.</p>

<p>If you go into Amazon and look up any of these three you'll see further related titles in the scrolling list under Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought if you <em>really</em> want to delve into this deeply.</p>

<p>I would caution against doing much further research on this at the moment however*. </p>

<p>Don't you need bench <em>now</em>? So my advice would be to build one now. </p>

<p>Whatever it is, no matter how simple the design or how basic the materials or construction are, it's sure to be miles better than the cheap metal &amp; plastic bench you were using previously. What you build won't be perfect, accept that. But it doesn't have to be for the bench to work, and work well. Just make it heavyish to heavy, give it rock-solid joints to prevent racking, have the top flat and level and everything else is gravy.</p>

<p>There's a dirty little secret about almost all bench types, they all work. This is somewhat obvious if you give it some thought but it's worth emphasising: THEY ALL WORK. </p>

<p>People tend to forget this or ignore it in their quest for the 'perfect' workbench (there isn't one). <em>In some other parts of the world they don't even use workbenches and they manage to get stuff built</em>, it's well worth bearing that in mind when agonising which is better, a face vice or a leg vice! </p>

<p>Here's Chris Schwarz writing on this subject, <a href=""http://www.popularwoodworking.com/woodworking-blogs/chris-schwarz-blog/mistakes-first-time-bench-builders"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Mistakes of First-time Bench-builders</a> on Popular Woodworking. </p>

<hr>

<p>*It's all too easy to fall into the trap of over-analysing bench design, and getting paralysed by all the choices (""paralysis by analysis"" it's called).</p>

<p>Most of us have been there! Pros and amateurs alike, comparing and contrasting design features, weighing the pros and cons of various wood choices, what joints to use (you can waste weeks just on this!), what size the top should be and last but by no means least what height the top should be. Ideal workbench height just as a subject in itself is something there are endless debates about.</p>

<p>If you take any sort of European or American bench design from say the last 300 years and you made it it would do what it's supposed to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Give you a solid base for sawing, chopping, planing etc.</li>
<li>Provide or allow for various workholding solutions (with in-built devices or by using clamps or holdfasts).</li>
<li>Give you a flat assembly surface.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you look at it this way it's easier to see how almost every bench fulfils the brief. And that the various features of one or another don't matter as much in practical terms as one might assume because <em>any</em> decent bench can allow for much the same..... if they didn't then people couldn't have used them or currently use them to produce various kinds of work.</p>

<p>Some people strongly disagree with this. Take the bench type popularised by Frank Klausz and Tage Frid as an example. As vital to their working philosophy and practices as the Continental shouldered bench was it must be realised that <em>not</em> having those same 'vital' design features didn't stop their American contemporaries from doing the same work. So one man's <em>vital</em> is another man's <em>don't need it</em>.</p>

Should I butt the boards up against each other or space them? If I space them, how much?</p>
","<p>Since you are suggesting your area has large humidity swings, if it is humid when you lay the wood down, I wouldn't leave gaps. If you do, you will find there will be large gaps between the boards after they do dry out. Since it is humid, the boards will be at their largest expansion. You will never run the risk of them warping/popping out due expansion. If the wood is extremely wet (like pressure treated wood), it will definitely shrink and never be as broad again, especially after a summer gets hot and dry.</p>

<p>The d20 (twenty sided die) requires many cuts on a very small block of wood. <strong>What is the safest method for creating something like this?</strong></p>

<p>A hand saw seems like it would be too difficult to hold the block down during the cut, but power saws just seem outright dangerous.</p>
","<p>I don't think it's feasible to cut exactly enough for this to work, especially on the more-sided dice with their odd angles. Besides the meticulous precision you need there is also the point of repeatability. The angles of those dice are so odd that building fixtures for them would be very very hard as <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/users/306/treow-wyrhta"">Treow Wyrtha</a> mentioned.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if you found a way to repeatably be very precise, these dice would be awesome and my D&amp;D playing friends would sacrifice a char for one of those :) So the approches I think could work are either a mold, a CNC or better yet, a combination of those two.</p>

<h1>The Mold</h1>

<p>Ask someone with a 3D-printer if they can print you a mold of half the die. You could try molding clay or liquid molding silicone, but i think the results wouldn't be accurate enough. Then start cutting/sanding/filing your die and try to fit it in the mold and repeat the process until it fits perfectly in the mold on either side.</p>

<h1>CNC Routing The Dice</h1>

<p>I know you said you want to do it with scrap wood and that pretty much rules out the CNC option, but in general I think it's a viable way to go when one wants to 
cut intricate shapes repeatably.</p>

<p>Besides needing a CNC machine (which may exceed your budget) there is still a lot of handwork to be done afterwards, once the basic shapes of the dice are milled. </p>

<h2>Routing Halfs On The Table</h2>

<p>I imagine that you could mill halves of the dice to as close as you can get them to perfection. After they are milled you can glue them together and sand/file away the steps the CNC will leave you with.</p>

<h2>Routing Them Out On A Spinning Dowel</h2>

<p>Wihile looking up the feasibility of my CNC idea i found <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCo9cX0pgmI"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this YouTube Video</a> that explains this way better than i ever could with words.</p>

<h1>A Combination Of Those Two</h1>

<p>The methods support each other quite nicely and can be used without each other as well, although, if you already have a CNC, the mold would probably not be that much of a problem, and if you don't... buying a CNC for carving some dice is probably a bit much :)</p>

"Choosing a saw for oak worktop, considering future usefulness","183","","<p>I've got a few cuts to make on some (large) offcuts of 40mm oak worktop. They are all straight, each cut up to 60cm long, from one side of the piece to the other. while this is technically within spec for my jigsaw, there's no way it's up to the job: the top of the cut may look straight but on a board this thick the back wanders all over the place, even if it take it very gently. It would also take forever even with a new blade. </p>

<p>So a shopping trip is in order. I'm a bit short on space, and don't want to spend a fortune on something that will be used rarely at best. I'm considering either:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a sabre (reciprocating) saw, which is compact and likely to be quite useful in the future (e.g. with a coarse tree-trimming blade). It might even replace the tired old jigsaw. </p></li>
<li><p>a circular saw. I haven't needed to use one in 20 years so it's likely to end up sitting in a box for quite some time. I regard it as mainly useful for wood-based  sheet material, and not the thin stuff. That doesn't leave much that I actually do. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>In theory I could replace/upgrade the jigsaw, but it's fine on thin sheet material and in not convinced a new one would be so much better. I'm not adverse to hiring something, if there's a much better way that's bulky or expensive. </p>

<p>In any case I assume I'd set up a guide fence. </p>

<p>So: is one of my ideas much better for the job in question (straight cuts on 40mm oak)? Which is more generally useful in the future? Or have I missed an important consideration? </p>
","<p>Most of these were in the comments on the original question, but I'll organize them:</p>

<ol>
<li>Track Saw - This is what I would consider the ""best"" way to go.  Unfortunately, they start at a few hundred dollars US.  Since you said that you didn't want to spend a lot I would consider this out.</li>
<li>Circular Saw - You can cut a perfectly straight line by using a straightedge with a circular saw.  You'll need to measure the offset between the edge of your saw and the blade, then clamp the straightedge to your workpiece that distance away from your intended cut line.  If you're only making a few cuts this is probably the fastest method.  Circular saws are fairly inexpensive and useful, so I think this would be a good route</li>
<li>Circular saw with homemade track - If you're going to frequently use the circular saw for precision cuts and don't want to buy a track saw you can make a ""track"" for a circular saw.  Simply attach a straight piece of stock to a piece of 1/4"" plywood and trim the plywood to size by running the saw's baseplate against the stock.  This reproduces much of the functionality of a track saw at a much lower price.</li>
<li>Jigsaw (or hand saw), then clean up with a Router - make a rough cut close to your intended line with a jigsaw or handsaw, then clamp a straightedge to your workpiece (similar to #2).  It should be offset by the distance from the edge of your router to the bit.  Then run the base of a router along the straightedge to clean up.  This will require a straight bit at least as long as your workpiece.  4cm is a pretty long bit so I might lean against this option.  You will want to make multiple shallower passes, increasing the bit depth with each.  Also be sure to run the router in the proper direction (from left to right typically.)</li>
<li>Jigsaw (or hand saw), then hand plane - Similar to #4, you can make a rough cut and then plane to your line with a bench plane.  A handplane is a surprisingly useful tool to have around, but it does have a bigger learning curve than the circular saw or router.</li>

<li>The easiest improvement I can think of is to insert a metal sleeve in the opening for the axel. This should eliminate a lot of the wear and tear caused by the bolt axel on the wood in the opening.  I have used copper pipe or electrical conduit inserts with excess.  If you rotate the table a lot, then a more precision fitting would be desirable.  I do not know of a ready made item but I found this ball bearing pivot online ((search for ""ball bearing and axle"")</li>

"Cheap or Expensive sandpaper?","180","","<p>I read on all the different types like aluminum oxide, silicone carbide, etc. And the open coat closed coat. But what about price? Is, say, a pack of 5 sheets (assorted) for $4 not going to last/perform as good as a similar box for $10?</p>

<p>Note: I do sanding on both hardwood and softwood regularly. Thru hand sanding, palm sanding, and belt sanding (depending on the case).</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>But what about price? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You do want to buy the best you can afford, but that is not to say you'll be paying the most. Price alone is not a guide to the quality of anything.</p>

<p>Some people do subscribe to the notion that paying more assures you're getting a better product but there are far too many exceptions to follow it as a firm principle (and just in our realm it's easy to discover it's very much <em>not</em> true when it comes to modern woodworking tools). </p>

<p>But it is broadly the case with abrasives that if it's very cheap you'll be getting something poor and if you pay more you will be getting something better. </p>

<p><strong>Good paper lasts longer</strong><br>
There can be a huge, almost unbelievable, difference in longevity between a really cheap paper and a decent one, with the pricier one possibly lasting ten times longer. I recently found a cheap flint paper, very old-school, and it wears down to bare paper after only a few minutes of use, where you might get an hour or more of similar hand sanding from a quality resin-bonded paper before it's too worn to be of use*. </p>

<p><strong>Not just longevity</strong><br>
In addition to longevity there is another issue of abrasive quality and that is consistency in the size of the grit particles. If you've ever sanded something and afterwards noticed a few very obvious deep scratches that can be down to one or two errant particles of grit that are larger than they should be. This is usually a big problem with cheap papers.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking FEPA papers (with the P in the number) are screened to a higher uniformity than the American grading system, CAMI. But a good CAMI paper will be significantly better than a cheapie that is supposedly the same grit.</p>

<p>Once you get away from the really cheap stuff picking good/better/best gets more complicated. Between different brands of decent paper, as well as different types of paper from one maker, quality can vary in ways you can't predict and price is likely to no longer be any guide as there is more of a premium on one brand name than another (the problem with woodworking tools). If you don't want to buy a bit of everything and test them out for yourself you'll need to get specific recommendations from people who have used what's available to you and compared.</p>

<p>Last thing, it's not just paper-backed abrasives we can pick from any more. There are now abrasive screens or meshes such as Abranet to consider, and a few types of abrasive films are now more commonly available as well.</p>

"Joining two flat legs of stool","180","","<p>I am practicing dovetails and so I have made various stools of differing sizes consisting of three pieces of rectangular wood: one for the seat and two for the legs, being joined with dovetails.  </p>

<p>I want to put a joining piece between the two legs to prevent splaying under heavy load.</p>

<p>I can't find much information on what the proper joint for this would be.  I would rather not go all the way through the legs for something like a pull-through dovetail just because I haven't done it before and don't want to ruin the stool (which is for my dad).  </p>

<p>I was thinking of just a simple T-butt joint but I have been reading that it is very poor for a joint which needs to take any tension.  Does adding some small dado to the accepting end of the butt-joint help increase the tensile strength of the joint in any substantial way?</p>

<p>In terms of my tools... pretty sparse.  I have chisels, hammer, and a dovetail saw; along with copious amounts of sand paper :P</p>

<p>Since I have gotten this far without any metal I am also going to avoid any mechanical fasteners.</p>

","<p>Since your legs are less than an inch thick I am not confident that the dovetail joints will handle the lateral loads that the stool will experience, so the stretcher is a good idea.  To understand what type of joint is needed, consider the way the loads will be applied. Vertical loads from the person sitting on it will be easily carried by the legs and the leg/seat joints are fine.  As weight is added, the legs will want to splay in or out to the outside spread eagle or lean in parallel to one side or the other.  The shallow dado connection you have proposed will certainly prevent the legs splaying inward where the stretcher is compressed, however the joint is little more than a butt joint and will not  resist being pulled apart if the legs splay out or lean. One or both ends of the stretcher will be pulled out of the leg.  This pulling force is what must be resisted.</p>

<p>You can do so using a mortise/tenon joint which extends deeper into the leg thickness (say 5/8"") or by a through tenon with a pin on the exterior.

<p>Another alternative is to screw the stretcher to the leg from the outside using a countersunk screw.  You can plug the screw hole with a wood plug. A cutter bit for your drill is inexpensive and allows you to match your project wood.  When you align the grain, the plug will all but disappear.</p>

"Sculpture: Anchor a wire armature to a natural wood branch","180","","<p>I'm working on a sculpture (of a gibbon swinging on a branch) which will be made of wood and wax with a wire armature, and I'm trying to figure out how to anchor my armature to the branch.</p>

<p>Here's a quick drawing of the intended setup:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/M5WL8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/M5WL8.jpg"" alt=""Diagram of construction""></a></p>

<p>The branch is a natural, hardwood branch, about 3/4"" in diameter and about 10"" long. It's quite strong. One end of the branch will be anchored in a block of wood. Somewhat close to the other end I need to attach a strong wire armature, which needs to be able to hold, say, 8-10 ounces of wax altogether. The tricky bit is the angle: I need that wire to come out from the branch at a 45-or-so-degree angle as shown above, and since it'll have the weight of the wax pulling down on it, it has to be anchored very sturdily in the branch.</p>

<p>My current thought is cutting a channel in the top of the branch from the point where the armature attaches heading toward the anchor, so the wire would poke through the branch, be bent and then run through the channel; fill the channel with epoxy or something, and paint over the top. It's less than perfect because I'd love to preserve the bark... also, the actual cutting of the channel doesn't seem very easy at all to me.</p>

<p>My question, then: Is the wire-in-the-channel idea the best option? If so, how should I go about cutting that channel? Or, is there a better way to do this that I haven't thought of?</p>

<p>Many thanks!</p>
","<p>You can do this possibly the most obvious way: drilling a hole and simply glueing in the end of the wire. This is not much different in principle to fixing the tang of a knife or chisel into its handle using glue and those can be amazingly secure (enough that you may have to break the handle to get the blade out). </p>

<p>There are a few glues you could use here, I'd recommend epoxy. Even the cheapest 5-min epoxy should work fine.</p>

<p>Some things to help ensure a good bond: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Just prior to applying the glue freshly scratch up the surface of the wire, using fine sandpaper or Scotch-Brite, or a metal file.</p></li>
<li><p>Drill the hole very slightly oversize, you don't want the wire to be a very tight fit into its hole (too little room around it for the epoxy).</p></li>
<li><p>Don't skimp on epoxy. Expect to have excess that you'll need to wipe away from where the wire goes into the hole. Dampening the cloth or paper towel with alcohol or acetone will greatly help here.</p></li>
<li><p>Wait much longer than the setting time before putting any strain on the wire. If the epoxy sets in just five minutes I'd wait at least a few hours, but overnight won't do any harm.</p></li>

"What's a reliable measure of wood hardness?","178","","<p>The terms <em>hardwood</em> and <em>softwood</em> are often used, but I struggle to find a reliable definition.</p>

<p>Is the wood's density sufficient as the distinguishing feature?</p>

<p>Is it the only one?</p>

<p>As oil is known to harden a wooden surface, is it possible to create a (in terms of density) hardwood-like surface on a piece of softwood? Is it even possible to get softwood that's harder than (relatively soft) hardwood this way?</p>

<h2>Crucial edit</h2>

<p>When I asked for hardwood and softwood, I had the German terms “Hartholz” and “Weichholz” in mind. It turns out they do not translate one-to-one: In English, according to Wikipedia and ON5MF's answer, the distinction is made by the type of tree from which the wood is harvested. That corresponds to the German terms “Laubholz” (wood from dicot angiosperm trees, = hardwood) and “Nadelholz” (wood from gymnosperm trees, = softwood). The differentiation in “Hartholz” and “Weichholz” differs from that in a way that it takes the wood's “hardness” as the distinguishing feature, and I wondered how exactly this is measured and defined. So, additional question: Is there a similar differentiation in English?</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> How do you measure a wood's hardness?</p>
","<p>Technically hardwood comes from angiosperm trees, softwood comes from gymnosperm trees.</p>

"Pocket hole tearout","176","","<p>I'm working with pocket holes on half inch baltic birch plywood. The particular jig I'm using is the Kreg jig (the one with 2 holes) and I've only used it a couple times before so I know the bit is sharp.</p>

<p>Anything I can do to solve this? </p>
","<p>You have two things happening here. First is loose pocket hole plugs. Second is tear-out of the veneer face of the plywood.</p>

<p><strong>For the problem of loose pocket hole plugs</strong>, you will want to make sure you are drilling straight and not moving side to side as you drill, accidentally widening the hole. For the most part, the jig prevents this, so I'm not really sure that's your problem. In fact, I'm not really sure you have a problem: your work looks similar to lots of other examples of pocket holes I've seen. For example, here's an image from Lee Valley, showing examples of the plugs they sell:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VBopA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VBopA.jpg"" alt=""Pocket hole plugs, courtesy leevalley.com""></a></p>

<p>Their fit is very similar to yours. If the plugs simply do not fit to your satisfaction, you might want to try making your own pocket hole plugs instead of 
using the store bought ones. There are various instructions on how to do this around the Internet. <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Pocket-Hole-Plugs-Cutting-Sled-for-the-Kreg-Jig/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here is an example</a> that uses a specialized table saw sled, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvJbpU3NSwU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here is a simpler one</a> that uses the pocket hole itself as a jig.</p>

<p><strong>For the problem of veneer tear-out</strong>, you'll need to adapt one of the usual techniques for dealing with tear-out to work with pocket holes. The techniques I am aware of are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using blue painter's tape to reinforce the veneer.</li>
<li>Using a sacrificial backer board to support the fibers being cut.</li>
<li>Scoring the veneer along the area to be cut.</li>
</ol>

<p>Option #1, reinforcing with blue painter's tape, would be the easiest thing to try, so I'd probably try it first. This technique works very well to almost completely eliminate tear-out when cutting veneered plywood on a table saw. I imagine it would work pretty well with the pocket holes, too. The only downside is getting sticky painter's tape residue all over the saw blade/drill bit.</p>

<p>Option #2 is to support the fibers with a sacrificial board. Clamp a sacrificial board to the face, so any pressure on the fibers to move up and off the face of the board is counteracted. The sacrificial piece will need to be a known thickness, say, 1/4"" thick, so you can adjust your pocket hole jig accordingly. I.e., instead of adjusting the jig to drill into 1/2"" stock, adjust it for 3/4"" stock. A caveat here: normally the tear-out you're trying to prevent is where the blade/bit is exiting the stock, i.e., on the back, so normally this is a backer board. You're trying to prevent tear-out on the front. But it might be worth trying anyway. I think the drill bit is probably lifting some of the veneer's fibers up and off the board as it cuts, and supporting those fibers would help make the cut cleaner.</p>

<p>Option #3 is to score the veneer where it's going to be cut. I'm thinking this would be the trickiest of my three options. To do it, hold a plug against the location that will eventually be cut away, and trace it with a sharp knife to score the veneer. It would take some experimentation to figure out where the plug should be held, as this isn't something that is entirely clear from the jig setup. But if you can manage to score the odd shape in the correct location, I think this option would work well.</p>

<p>For any of these, I'd want to experiment with my technique on representative scrap before using it in my project. But honestly, that advice is applicable any time you're trying a new technique.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Is laminating the planks enough to counter the tendency to warp that plainsawn lumber </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically yes although there are no guarantees.</p>

<p>'Jointed' slabs are inherently stable, even when one or more of the individual boards are less than ideal, because of the construction. </p>

<p>The long-grain glued faces are immensely strong and individually and together will work to keep the glue-up flat. And a rough rule of thumb is that the more glue joints there are the stronger the piece ends up. But for wide projects the more joints the more difficult the glue-up becomes, so it can be advisable to do it in sub-assemblies and then glueing these together to make up your final width.</p>

<p>For maximum stability be aware of the radial and tangential direction of the grain and try to orient this uniformly for every piece. This is not always possible but it's a good thing to aim for as the more uniform you can make the seasonal expansion and contraction the better.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ijnQK.jpg"" alt=""Grain direction and movement""></p>

<p>The ideal is to orient the tangential grain such that the greatest expected movement is up and down, not side to side. Side note: this is one reason for the traditional preference for quarter-sawn wood, which tends to expand less across its width than plain-sawn or flat-sawn boards.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm concerned because of the poor quality of dimensional lumber.</p>

<p>Stock selection is often overlooked today but it's perhaps more important now than ever, especially with dimensional lumber which can be of poor uniformity, and is outright poor quality at times.</p>

<p>The best course would be to select your two-bys for straight grain and being free from knots and defects over a number of visits but again this is not always possible, given individual circumstances and sources of supply.</p>

"How to fix a 2x4 table that is too heavy for its own good?","174","","<p>I made a table by gluing 2x4's together on the long side (4"" side). This resulted in a table of abnormal weight. Now the table is sagging in the middle. </p>

<p>Overall table dimensions are 31""X50"".</p>

<p>Can I fix this table by flipping it over and attaching the legs on bottom to make the bottom the new top - thus letting gravity do the work?</p>

","<p>It looks like the long dimension is perpendicular to the direction of the boards and having a laminated edge along the long span does not help. The problem is that you essentially have a beam spanning between the legs on the edge shown in the photo that has a no coherent wood fibers running the full length. Instead they're broken every 1 1/2"".  The glue helps but as you have experienced, it is inadequate. You could probably get by adding a single 2x4 board along the exposed face of the end boards.  Ideally it should be keyed in like a breadboard end. It should have a mortise and tenon connection or a wood spline keyed into the exposed 2x4 ends and the new edge board and be glued only in the center.  You can fasten it with screws further out on the slotted connection and apply wood plugs to hide the screws.
Another option is to create a concealed support under the table. </p>

"Cloth covered flexible ring or a bag clamp in a dust collector?","173","","<p>I recently acquired a dust collector, and it came with two ways of mounting the chip collection bag, but didn't explain why I would want to use one over the other in the assembly instructions.</p>

<p>The two mounting options I have are a cloth covered flexible ring or a big metal bag clamp that resembles a giant hose clamp.</p>

<p>The flexible ring is supposed to have the top 6"" of bag folded over it, and sits inside an internal groove in the dust collector and is held in by spring force and friction.</p>

<p>The bag clamp goes around the outside of the dust collector, with the bag in between the outer diameter and the bag clamp.</p>

  <p>The 50-767 offers both a cloth-covered ring and a metal clamp
  as options for attaching the collection bag.</p>
  
  <p>What is the difference between these two options? Does one provide a
  better seal? Is it a tradeoff of convenience vs. seal? Why would you
  choose one over the other?</p>

<p>And they said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s just a personal preference.  You get a good seal w/either.  Our tech dept can be reached at 866-999-1499 if you have further questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it doesn't seem to matter. </p>

<p>Now, if you look at the manual, the last step for the ring option is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""3"">
  <li>Tug slightly on the bag to eliminate any slack and to make sure that the bag is secure and will not detach during collection. </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>This does seem to imply that there is at least enough of a risk of the user attaching the bag incorrectly with this method to mention it in the manual. This seems to be user error, though, not attachment failure. It also seems to be a minor risk, based on the customer service reply and the fact that nobody really seems to have a strong opinion either way (lack of answers posted to this question is some example evidence here).</p>

<p>I hypothesize (this is just my personal opinion), that the reason both methods were provided is that both are good, and it is cheaper and easier for Delta to provide both methods and let the user choose than it is for them to potentially drive away customers that have a preference one way or the other (plus, empowering the user to make a decision, even a small one, is a nice way to improve the product image). I can certainly imagine that some folks may e.g. trust the clamp over the ring, and others may value the convenience of the ring - and regardless of whether or not either of these preferences is based in truth, by providing both, Delta doesn't have to deal with a debate.</p>

<p>(Or it may be an even simpler reason: Maybe in a design meeting they got into a heated debate about which one to use, until one sane hero stepped up and said ""let's just use both; next discussion item please, I don't have all day"".)</p>

If you are after a perfect finish, then yes, it is hard to get right.</p>

<p>If you are after something good enough (As I am), then it is really easy. You sand it back smooth (I use 180 grit) then start with light coats. You let it dry, sand it again and repeat. After 4-5 you should start to feel and see the smoothness. A few more coats and you have a high gloss finish.</p>

<p>On a nice sunny day, you can get 2-3 coats an hour so it takes no time all all. The real trick is to use light coats.  </p>

<p>Should I attach it from below, screwing into the bottom of the workbench, allowing the threaded screw and rods to be visible if you look under the bench, and also screw the rear face into the front of the bench?  This would make the tops of the vise faces a couple inches below the top of the workbench.  Would I then add wooden jaw liners that are taller than the vise faces to end up with a clamping area that is flush with the bench top?</p>

<p>Or, should I attach it by drilling into the front face of the bench top to make holes for the screw and other two rods, and ignoring the bottom mounting holes, to get the vise faces flush with the top to begin with?  It seems like a drawback here would be that if I need to plane the bench top flat in the future, I would end up with a vise now mounted slightly above the top of the bench.</p>
","<p>It's perfectly ok to have the vise mounted lower than the benchtop for exactly the reason of flattening the benchtop later. Also, it is common to drill or cut dog holes into the benchtop in-line with a vise so you can use bench dogs (pegs) to increase your clamping capacity far beyond the typical 4-8"" of an inexpensive vise.

<p>I received it today and, after I'd broken down and disposed of all the packaging, I noticed what looks like curvature in the mirrored surface of its platen, sort of like a dent in shiny car paint. Sure enough, I could feel some ""waviness"" when I ran my hand over it, and a second check with a level confirmed that one quadrant of the surface has a small hill that rises up to maybe 1/32"" - 1/16"" higher than the rest. The remainder is very flat.</p>

<p>Will this cause any difficulty in achieving good results? Or is there anything I'm not aware of about how a planer works that implies that this might not cause problems? On this model, the platen appears to be made of sheet steel that attaches to a cast aluminum base beneath it, so maybe the sheet steel has enough give that it will flatten against the pressure of the outfeed roller on the material? When I press down on the platen, it does give slightly and appears to flatten out onto the surface of the base beneath it (the flat section of the platen doesn't have any give to it, but this ""bubble"" does). Maybe the material will do the same?</p>

<p>I bought it brand new from a factory-authorized online retailer, so exchanging it is certainly an option (I've already emailed them), but it will be a pain. I can try it out and use the factory warranty if needed, or ask for a replacement base, but the platen and base are sold as a complete unit and do not appear to be user-serviceable so I doubt the latter is a viable option.</p>

"Is the ""paper test"" actually relevant to sharpening chisels and planes?","170","","<p>It is pretty common to see references to the ""paper test"" for checking for sharpness of an edge -- the idea that you should be able to lightly rest the blade against the edge of a piece of paper and it should ""bite"" by itself and easily slice through the sheet with hardly any pressure. For example, out of the box a disposable safety razor blade will easily pass this test.</p>

<p>Now, I'm a beginner at woodworking and I've been trying to learn to sharpen tools -- I bought some inexpensive Dewalt chisels a long time ago and more recently a Mora whittling knife to practice sharpening with. (I've got a Stanley No 4 plane arriving soon from eBay, as well.) After a decent amount of practice (using DMT interrupted diamond stones up to Extra Fine or 3M microfinishing film on plate glass to 15u, stropped on chromium oxide on leather in both cases afterward), I'm able to get them to pass a lot of other common sharpness tests:</p>

<ol>
<li>Shaving hair cleanly (everything from coarse leg hair to very fine knuckle hair)</li>
<li>Edge catches on the surface of your thumbnail without sliding</li>
<li>No light reflects off the edge itself, no visible burr, no chips or nicks under a loupe</li>
<li>Visibly reflective/polished looking bevel surfaces near the edge</li>
<li>Edge feeling very sharp to touch with the pad of the thumb, and I cannot feel a burr on either side</li>
<li>Edge feeling extremely smooth (like glass) when drawing the tip of your fingernail along the blade</li>
<li>And most importantly, <strong>when cutting wood they leave a nice smooth surface</strong>, especially when cutting with the grain.</li>
</ol>

<p>Despite that, one thing I can <em>never</em> seem to do reliably is make them pass the ""paper test."" Usually I get intermittent results -- sometimes the paper buckles, sometimes it cuts ""alright"", but most often it cuts a short ways but then stops or jams. It's definitely not as impressive as I've seen proper razor blades do.</p>

<p>Normally I would just say the only thing that matters is how they cut wood -- but as a beginner I don't really know whether I'm experiencing more resistance than I should, or what the shavings should really look like when you try to shave end grain, and so on. In the absence of using ""properly sharp"" tools myself I really don't have a feel for what I should expect from a tactile perspective or an ""end result"" perspective.</p>

<p>So, my questions are: </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Should I actually expect to be able to sharpen decent quality bench chisels, plane blades, whittling knives, etc. to the point they can pass the ""paper test"" when using the normal bevel angles?</strong> Or is this futile just because of the bevel angles and thicknesses of the tools involved, compared to razors which are comparatively thinner and with more acute bevel angles? For a while I was sure the dewalt chisels just had crappy steel or poor heat treatment, but, honestly, the Mora which should have decent steel/treatment has similar problems.</li>
<li><strong>Even if I could, is it a useful indicator for the tasks hand planes, bench chisels, whittling knives, etc perform?</strong> Am I missing out on a ""final level of sharpness"" or is an effortless paper-cutting edge on these tools just going to be demolished after cutting through a few inches of actual wood, even with good blade material?</li>
</ol>

<p>It would be tremendously helpful to know whether I'm getting myself frustrated over something that is either impossible or unimportant.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: After actually actually POLISHING the bevel of this chisel on the chromium oxide-on-leather -- say like 50x eight inch long passes on the bevel and 5-10x on the flat (instead of just a very light stropping), the results have improved <em>dramatically</em>. I'm able to take very thin shavings off of end grain and it looks pretty smooth. Fresh off honing it will pop some leg hair although it's not 100% -- I'm wondering if my arm hair is just too fine? -- and it also does significantly better on the paper test, although not perfectly.</p>

<p>No. As I think I mention in a previous Answer many edges can slice paper while still not being as sharp as you'd really like for some woodworking tasks<sup>1</sup>. </p>

<p>Lots of the 'substitute tests' (anything that doesn't involve slicing wood) can fall short, although once you get to shaving sharp — which is far above the level of edge that will slice many types of paper — you are getting to the point where you know the edge is going to be sharp enough to do anything you need it to do.</p>

<p>You're quite right, this is what's most important and the only thing you really need to focus on.</p>

<p>Razors and razor blades have a very small included angle while that of woodworking tools is generally larger (can be over double). The lower the included angle the better the cutting potential or slicing ability of an edge, but this comes at a cost of course and that is that the edge is thinner and therefore weaker.</p>

<p>To put this firmly in a woodworking context this is why you can get away with a 15° bevel on a paring chisel which is used for controlled paring, powered by hand pressure only, but you'd never put one on a mortise chisel which has to be forcefully driven into wood with a hammer or mallet and may have to withstand some levering as well. </p>

<p><sup>1</sup> In addition to other reservations about the test paper isn't as uniform as one might think. Similar-looking papers don't have to actually be that similar, so the paper someone is using when doing a very impressive slicing demonstration in a YouTube video might appear to be similar to what you were using but actually be quite different. Furthermore some papers have a grain direction of sorts and will most definitely slice more cleanly in one direction than the other where you're cutting more fibres as opposed to parting them with the edge.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Typical honing time should be a few minutes at maximum. The only time the average woodworker should need to work on an edge for longer than about three minutes is when first sharpening or if some folding or chipping has occurred during use and it needs to be repaired. If you don't leave it too long you can hone or strop an edge in under 30 seconds. </p>

<p>You could do this with two strips of wood if you do it right but it would be easier to allow for future movement of the tabletop<sup>1</sup> by using a few smaller blocks<sup>2</sup>. Attach each one to the underside of the tabletop with glue and nails or screws toenailed or skewed in from the sides. Once the glue has set it will provide most of the holding strength here so the actual mechanical fasteners aren't that critical.

<p>After the glue has fully dried (a few hours is usually sufficient but wait overnight at least just to be on the safe side) you can simply screw your CPU holder into those using shorter screws that only go into the wooden blocks and not into the tabletop at all. Pre-drilling pilot holes in the blocks is a must, see <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2787/what-size-pilot-hole-should-i-drill-for-for-a-specific-size-of-screw/2790#2790"">What size pilot hole should I drill for for a specific size of screw?</a> for a guide to the size of hole needed and a few other tips.</p>

<p>In theory yes. In a thick enough coating (numerous full-strength coats) with no voids or pinholes, a varnish like this is essentially waterproof.

","<p>This looks to be the shroud the helps direct woodchips out of the exhaust port.</p>

<p>My guess is that it either something got caught on it while you fed it through or something hit it from kickback when you were planing.</p>

<p>If you're precise enough with a hammer, you should be able to remove the shroud from the planer and beat it back into straightness.  Use a metal vise (or really any semi-robust piece of metal) as an anvil to hit against.</p>

<p>If you don't trust yourself to do this, you might consider taking it to a machinist.  They should be able to straighten it out no problem.  Otherwise, if you know your make and model, you should be able to contact the manufacturer for a replacement part.  Be prepared to pay quite a bit for the part, though.</p>

"How do I remove a watermark?","168","","<p>I have a lot of wood furniture in my home. Unfortunately, they have watermarks (rings) on them from sweating cups/glasses. It is very unattractive to me and my guests. </p>

<p>Is there a way to remove it?</p>
","<p>The only entirely foolproof way I know to remove deep, long-set water marks is to sand to bare wood, restain (if your piece was stained) and refinish.  However, fresh, less deep stains may be more easily remedied, as I've found with some quick internet research.</p>

<p>Doing a quick google search has found the following home remedies.  <strong>I have not tested any of these</strong>, so take it as hearsay.  What a lot of them have in common is <em>oil</em> and <em>abrasion</em>, or a combination thereof, so there may be something there.</p>

<li>Gently rub some non-gel toothpaste on the wood with a soft cloth. Then wipe it off with a damp cloth and let it dry before applying furniture polish. For even stronger cleaning power, mix equal parts white toothpaste and baking soda. Rub the paste parallel to the wood grain, wipe it off, and then polish with lemon oil.

<li>Empty your clothes iron of all the water inside, then bring it into the room with the affected piece of furniture. Plug in the iron, then lay a cotton napkin, towel, or T-shirt over the stain. With the iron set on low, apply it briefly to the fabric before lifting the cloth to see if the ring has diminished. Repeat until (we hope) the white stain has disappeared. Alternatively, you can try using a hair dryer to achieve the same effect. Move the dryer back and forth over the area for about 10 minutes until the moisture evaporates.

<p>Most sites I have read suggest applying a furniture polish or wax after the water stain is removed, which I think is a good idea.</p>

<p>Planing the face will be easy using the guide blocks, but how do I make it square with the edge given that its only 1.5 inch high over the jointer without getting my hand too close to the blades? My understanding is that I have to push the face (after planing it) against the fence in order to get a 90 degree angle between the face and edge.</p>

<p>The other tools that I have at my disposal are hand tools and a cheap bandsaw. I have only a jack plane (stanley #5) which I am still learning how to level stock with.</p>
","<p>Sounds like you're a good candidate for investing in a set of push blocks. An example is below.</p>

<p>These don't necessarily need to be bought, but the store-bought ones usually have a grippy rubber bottom which helps when pushing stock.</p>

<p>Homemade push blocks don't need to be anything fancy, either:</p>

<p><img src=""https://www.woodworkersworkshop.com/graphics16/woodworkingtips-push-block.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">
(source: woodworkersworkshop.com)</p>

<p>To get a set of square faces, first joint one face, using the push blocks to keep the board flat on the bed. Next, rotate the piece ninety degrees so that your newly-flat face is riding the fence. Then, keep pressure with the push blocks such that the inner corner of the board is kept down and the face is right on the fence. If done right, you should have two perpendicular faces.</p>

<p>After this, you can make another face parallel to the first one by running it through the table saw. Then the top face is made parallel with a planer. It is possible to do this all with a jointer, but it is more error-prone.</p>

"Protecting wood from powder post beetles","167","","<p>I have some rough sawn maple that I'll be storing for a while, I've read that as long as there's no bark on it, it's safe from new infestations of powder post beetles; is this true?  Is it better to treat with borate and will this affect the finish of the wood?</p>
","<p>I have not found any reference for the bark comment but depending where it is stored and even if you haven't had problems in the past you <strong>cannot assume</strong> you are safe from infestation. I personally have not had any issues with Powerpost beetles but the prevention thereof is fairly generic as far as infestations go. <strong>Note</strong>: there are several dozens of varieties and they have different needs as far as what woods they like and what level of moisture they feel comfortable to lay eggs.</p>

<p>Assuming that there is not passive infestation in the wood (more on that later) the deterrent for the beetle is that it needs to have nowhere to lay the eggs. Wood that has been sanded and finished is usually enough to keep them away. You however will be storing this wood to allow it to dry.  </p>

<h1>Prevention</h1>

<p>However an infestation could already be present and could be several years before you are even aware of it. Advice would be to kiln dry the wood or use a non-toxic borate. This would be important in your case since your wood has not been yet treated. </p>

<p>There are pesticide fumigation strategies that I will not suggest or condone especially if you plan on making furniture or something that will be in contact with the body. </p>

"Will a steel guide bushing harm a drill bit?","167","","<p>I want to build a jig to speed up production of a furniture item.  The jig will hold a piece steady while the user hand-drills a hole in a certain spot.  I want to use a steel bushing to guide the drill bit so that the hole is straight.  The bushing will be 3/4"" long with a 1/4"" ID, for guiding a 1/4"" bit.  My question is, will this be damaging to the bit?  I'm thinking that the cutting is done with the point, which never touches the bushing, and the flutes that do touch it just collect the waste, so it would be okay.  What do you say?</p>
","<p>This is fine and commonly done in industry. The ""sides"" of the drill bit, more precisely the <em>margin</em> of the <em>flute land</em> is not designed to cut, but rather to clear chips from the sides of the hole and prevent the bit from binding in the hole. The margin is ground at an angle very close to tangential (and often not ground at all).</p>

<p>Drill bushings are a standard tool and die component:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8vdsC.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8vdsC.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>They are generally made from hardened steel, to withstand repeated use without excessive wear. They are often pressed into a tool plate or jig at the desired hole position.</p>

<p>If your application only called for a small number of uses, regular steel (e.g. 1018 cold-rolled steel) might serve just fine. But if it's for production use, a purchased item will likely be better and more economical than what you can produce yourself.</p>

<p>Note that a drill bushing for a 1/4"" drill may not be precisely 0.250"" internal diameter. In this case, perhaps 0.252"" is more appropriate. A bushing hole with insufficient clearance will cause excessive drill margin wear. A purchased item will have thought all that through for you.</p>

<p>There are other considerations when using drill bushings, like where the chips go and so on. Here's one resource with some discussion on that. Many others are easily found on search now that you have the right technical term :)</p>

"How can I copy the cut of a curved piece of wood?","165","","<p>My wife picked up what I expect was a beautiful garden bench at one time in it's life from a garage sale. It has metal rails on the side with and a metal inlay in the back surrounded by a wood frame, and wood slats for the bench portion of it. I suspect in it's previous life, this is how it might have looked.</p>

<p>Problem is at sometime in it's life the previous owner spray painted it a sickly grey, the entire thing, metal, wood, all of it. It's pretty horrible. I can sandblast the paint off of the metal and give it a good paint job, but for the wood I'm pretty sure sandblasting would be a bad idea -- In fact based on the fact that it was painted, I probably just want to replace the wood. I can rip wood and do various fancy cuts in straight lines for the bench seat, but unfortunately, the top of the back rest is curved. What is the best way to duplicate the curve of the existing piece I have?</p>
","<p>Trace the outline of the old piece onto a new piece of wood.  First use a Jigsaw (or bandsaw if you have access to one) to get close to the line.  Then clamp the two pieces together with the original on the bottom and use a router with a bearing-guided flush-trim bit to exactly copy the original.  (Note that you'll want to use 3+ clamps so you can reposition them when you get to that area with the router.)</p>

<p>Optional: The roundover on the top of the original (in this photo, at least) would make running a bearing against it a little more difficult, so you may want to make a template out of 1/4"" hardboard instead.  To make a template trace and jigsaw as above, but do final shaping with coarse sandpaper glued to a flexible piece of material.  The template will provide a better surface for the router bit's bearing to ride on than the roundover of the original.</p>

<p>And if the design had those boards tightly fitted together, or especially if glued-up into single panels, the expansion and contraction could literally break the planters apart.</p>

"Number of flutes on a router bit","164","","<p>What is the benefit of a single flute, double flute or even triple? The more flutes the better the cut or just the opposite maybe?</p>
","<p>Rule of thumb: the more flutes the better the finish but the slower the feed rate. </p>

<p>Single-flutes bits I don't believe are that common, I think they were most seen on narrow straight cutters where there was limited space for multiple carbide inserts. </p>

<p>Double-flute bits are the most common. The great majority of common router bits have two flutes.</p>

<p>More flutes than this in general will give a better cut because the distance around the circumference from cutting edge to cutting edge is reduced. This also spreads the wear more so in theory at least the cutter should stay sharper proportionally longer. Because there is more carbide bonded to the bit they can be substantially more expensive and as mentioned in the rule of thumb they require a slower feed rate. </p>

<p>On older HSS profiling bits more flutes were common, some had six or more. Obviously this was partly to spread the wear since HSS is fairly tough but much less resistant to wear than tungsten carbide, but it was also because they were intended for lower RPMs.</p>

","<p>I think the answer to this question comes in several parts. I've turned several kinds of wood and have done some amount of wood burning in my younger days. I can't directly speak about pyrography in particular (fun as it sounds) but I am familiar with 'torching' or 'scorching' for certain effect.</p>

<p>I enjoy turning and carving in poplar, cherry and other clear, hard woods. I tend to stay away from curly maple and the like as it is very hard on my hands (personal preference).</p>

<p>Cherry will char, but the difference (especially in the darker varieties/specimens) will be more muted between the char and the natural color. Imagine the difference between and earthen red and dark brown. I've found cherry doesn't produce as dark of an char when heat is applied. It more likely turns to ash, before black.</p>

<p>I have found the lighter the color of wood, the more contrast and visibility you can get between the charred areas and the natural, un-charred areas.</p>

<p>I would try poplar first, then maybe move on to some ash and or soft maple. And as always, I'd keep a rag in a pitcher of water nearby to help control the spread of both heat and burn.</p>

","<p>There are several considerations you must address before executing this project.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Your tapered edge frame is too shallow.  If you look at most wood bedframes, the side boards are usually around 6"" deep.  Your profile appears to be 1 1/2"" deep and approximately 3"" wide with a tapered profile.  This is not adequate to carry the load of the mattress and people it  must support.  Looking at photos of the DWR designs I strongly suspect that there is an embedded metal frame supporting the bed frame.  There is a link to a website called the Sagulator under the ""Design"" tag wiki for this site that provides a tool for evaluating the strength of various woods and profiles. </li>
<li>Your mattress should rest directly upon the 1x4 slats which means that your tapered edge pieces are either too high or extend beyond the edge of the mattress.  This could create a hard edge for people to climb over resulting in bumped knees etc..</li>
<li>Gluing the end grain to the side of the edge boards is the weakest possible joint.  Consider creating a rabbet on the inside top corner of the edges to receive slats.  If you cut the rabbet to the depth of the slats, you will create a continuous flat surface for the mattress to rest on. Make the rabbet at least 1"" wide to provide adequate gluing surface.</li>
<li>The relative thinness of your frame and the use of screws instead of continuous gluing will allow your frame to rack out of square more easily making moving the frame more difficult. Make the entire platform as rigid as possible.</li>
<li>If you do not use a box spring to support the mattress, I would be concerned about the 1x4's supporting the mattress.  The wider the mattress is the more there will be a tendency to sag across the width of the bed frame.</li>
<li>I would strongly recommend avoiding softwoods and less dense hardwoods such as poplar for the structural members of this design.</li>
<li>Bear in mind that you can make the framework much thicker and still show a thinner edge profile using a design such as you show, but with a much deeper frame set in from the edge approximately 1'-0"".</li>

"What are the considerations for different guide materials in a sled jig?","163","","<p>I'm slowly gathering accessories for my table saw.  Most of the sled plans I've seen have wooden rails to slide in the table grooves.  But I've also seen some metal rails and I wonder if they wouldn't be more precise.  They aren't cheap so I wouldn't get a bunch, just a pair to move from jig to jig.  </p>

<p>Given the different materials what would make me choose one over the other? What would I need to consider when choosing my rail material for my sled(s)?</p>
","<p>In my opinion, the biggest advantage of cutting your own guides is that you fine-tune them to your table saw's miter tracks. The miter tracks have manufacturing tolerances, and are probably not exactly 3/4 inches. Worse, each miter track is probably a little different in width.</p>

<p>When cutting your own guides you can sneak up on the width for each track to have zero play while moving smoothly in the track. This should give you a guide rail that is the perfect width throughout its length, providing full support to avoid side-to-side movement for the entire cut.</p>

<p>The main disadvantage of wood that it will change dimensions with changes in humidity. Choosing a type of wood that has minimal variation with humidity changes (such as cherry) as well as aligning the growth rings to run perpendicular to the face of the table should minimize the problem. Plywood would be more stable, and some people use various plastics (HDPE springs to mind). I have had great luck with Baltic birch plywood for my guides.</p>

<p>Metal guides are much harder to fine tune, both if they are too narrow and when they are too wide. In addition, you are combining manufacturing tolerances on both the miter tracks as well as the metal guides. To counter that, most commercial guides have little plastic cams or small screws that you can rotate until the fit is perfect. But this only gives you so many contact points, and I would be concerned about their long term durability (since there is a small contact area rubbing against the miter slots).</p>

<p>Finally, the plan to move the rails from jig to jig will probably not work in the long run. Using small wood screws to hold the jig to the rail won't hold to many assembly-disassembly cycles. Using machine screws with nuts would probably be better in that regard, but I would still be concerned with re-alignment issues after reassembly.</p>

<p>I have never worked with wood before, so I have the minimum of tools for this project such as a drill, hand saw, and a speed square. </p>

<p>What would be a simple way to join the three pieces of wood at the top of the frame using only these tools. I would prefer to bolt them together. </p>
","<p>Apologies for the crummy illustration, I'm a graphics doofus :), and for not providing full instructions for the basic joints I'm mentioning (Google!)</p>

<p>I would start by making the ""A"" at each end with a half-lap joint (at the parallelogram where the legs cross - Google ""half-lap joint"".) You can screw them together with four screws inside the corners of the p'gram, or clamp and glue together.  Then cut a through mortise (another thing you can Google) through the middle of the lap joint you made in the first step (shown as the little rectangle in the parallelogram.)  You can do this with, at minimum, your drill and a good sharp chisel.  Once you've cut the mortise, fashion a tenon (Google it!) at the end of the cross bar piece that fits snugly into it. Use your saw for this, cut close to the line, then clean up with your (new) chisel. Test fit, add glue, and assemble.  I think this would give a nice solid joint.  </p>

<p>Agree with @Matt, go with larger wood, like 2x3.  I would like to note since you're a beginner that glue is stronger and more permanent than screws, and probably safer here because the screws could loosen over time, especially in something with movement like a swing, and pose something of a hazard (swing fall apart/down.)</p>

"How to assemble gear system for adjustable table?","162","","<p>I've designed a table with an adjustable shelf. I feel as if I've researched the names and techniques for what kind of gear system to implement, but I need the experience of someone with knowledge of the subject to help me finalize my decisions. </p>

<p>Here is my design:

<p>My questions pertain to the gear and crank system. </p>

<p>1 -The shaft in the design is 56"" long. The shelf will hold approximately 30 pounds of equipment. What thickness should the shaft be?</p>

<p>2 - For mounting the shaft, I'm currently looking at these: 
Hub City FB260URX1/2 Flange Block Mounted Bearing - *can't post more that 2 links yet...</p>

<p>I'm just looking for verification that this is appropraite for my needs.</p>

<p>3 - Based on my research, the gear system is called a Rack and Pinion, but I'm having trouble figuring out what specifically the size and type of gear I should buy. Can someone provide a reference of something that would work for this set up?</p>

<p>4- Lastly, I need advice on how to mount and secure the crank and gears to the shaft. Will some sort of locking collar work? Or do I need something else? I am currently looking at these: Climax Metal 1C-100 Steel One-Piece Clamping Collar - *can't post more that 2 links yet.</p>

<p>That's it for now. I'll edit if clarification is needed. </p>
","<p>I am by far not experienced with this. So I have little to say. I am sure you have gears on either side so lets start there. </p>

<p>1) I would say for the shaft maybe a good 1-1/2 in to 2 in would be a good thickness if it is a stronger wood. That would last very long. I would even consider thicker for pine. All it would take is to much weight and the grain can give anyplace in the shaft. Unless your using metal.</p>

<p>2) Any bearing the shaft fits into would work fine. Make it flush with the wood and have pressure so it does not fall out. You can also just place the shaft directly in the wood. I would make the hole in the wood ever so slightly bigger and use oil as a lubricant. Of coarse that would things a little harder but possible.</p>

<p>3) Something I can give a fairly good answer to. It is call rack and pinion, I am sure. The basic rule I have with gears is small gears will give more torque. Like on a drill, making it easier to rise the shelf but slower. A big gear will be faster, but harder to lift. I recommend smaller Maybe 10 teeth will work for you. I have a website you can use <a href=""http://geargenerator.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://geargenerator.com</a>. You can download the gear selected and print it. It is fairly accurate in size. So if you have a band saw you will be able to make a gear. cut the gear out (not perfect) and glue it to a piece of wood. Once dried use a drill bit and cut in between the teeth at bottom edge to make things easier. Then if you have a band saw you can cut it out. There is a gear without buying a gear. But this simple website does not help with the rack. But you can cut it out as well. As long as the teeth can line up and move you are set.</p>

<p>4) oh man... I will try my best. You can make a locking collar pretty easily. again a band saw may be best. I will be adding a rough picture of what I am thinking below. But use a bearing in the wood* and slide the shaft through for the handle to attach a locking collar. And do the same on the other side. It can not move at the point but can be loosen to move. The shaft should then reach over to the gear. I consider gluing the gear when it is on the shaft. Also put a bearing in the wood* on the other side, having the shaft sticking out the side. Locking collar there and on the inside. That should really work good.
* Cut a hole from the inside and do not cut all the way through. Just so the bearing is flush to the wood. But have a hole cut bigger than the inner-diameter so that the shaft goes through the wood easy, but the bearing does not fall out. and have a locking collar on the inside against the bearing so it also has no problems falling out of place, but not so it is harder to turn.</p>

","<p><strong>By hand</strong><br>
You could do this using a gouge (a type of chisel with a curved cutting edge) but it would require that its edge be very sharp indeed* to get an acceptable surface inside the scoops. In addition to getting the gouge sharp enough initially this will require frequent upkeep of the edge during the job, as often as every few minutes depending on the hardness of the wood and how well it is cutting. </p>

<p><strong>Router</strong><br>
Freehand routing with a round-nose bit might achieve this but it would require unerring attention on the part of the operator O_O </p>

<p>I've used M&amp;T just about everywhere else, but that's going to be a little difficult with the angles. I'm suspect that a butt join would separate at the top over time (though I could be wrong). Someone suggested dowels. </p>

<p>Suggestions? </p>
","<p>As usual, I received a lot of great advice in the comments. However, this is SE (in James Earl Jones' voice), so this needs an answer.</p>

<p>(drum roll)</p>

<p>I went with dowels, as can be seen in the pictures below.</p>

<p>Instead of futzing about with making a jig, etc., I clamped the braces in place, and drilled through them into the stretchers. After drilling each hole, I inserted a 4-6"" piece of dowel - enough so that I had about 1"" protruding on each side of the joint, then drilled the next hole, insert a dowel, next hole. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yOQAa.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yOQAa.jpg"" alt=""Upper joint with protruding dowel""></a></p>

<p>The net effect is that, though the holes may not be perfectly straight or centered, the joints will still line up. (Mark adjoining faces so that you don't wind up putting the not-exactly-identical pieces in the wrong position or orientation.)</p>

<p>I cut the dowels from a 1/2"" rod from Big Box (team Orange). It's not <em>perfect</em>, but it held well enough that I had to disassemble the entire thing, and get creative with gripping tools, to get it apart to apply glue. And, having moved this thing around several times since then, I don't really see the benefit in buying ""dowel joiners"" instead of a dowel rod, and cutting it on the miter saw. (Though some dowels have flutes for glue passage, which may hold better over time.)</p>

<p>(TL;DR: Put the board where it needs to go, drill through it into the adjacent board, and tap the dowel into place with your mallet. Yes, Mallet. Hammers have their place, but this isn't it.)</p>

<p>I like pictures, so:</p>

<p>Clamped and roped while gluing the dowels:
(I didn't have enough clamps, or any 8' long, so I got creative with some rope <em>:)</em> that I found in the garage.)</p>

"Killing Borer in Wooden Coasters","160","","<p>Sorry if this question already has an answer somewhere, I couldn't find it online or within this community.</p>

<p>As my first foray into woodworking, I'm making relatively simple wooden coasters from red gum. The red gum has had borer in it previously, which actually lends itself quite nicely to adding interesting patterns in the coasters.</p>

<p>However, the obvious problem is that whether I want to keep these coasters, or sell them for a few bucks, I need to make sure any borer which may still be inside is dead.</p>

<p>I'd like a preferably quick way to make sure the borer inside is dead, and was wondering if there was such a method out there? The coasters are about 1cm thick, and approx 7.5cm wide.</p>

<p>I was thinking of just submerging them in water for eight hours, but I know some insects and larvae can survive for days, weeks, even months if they're hibernating, with little to no air, and couldn't find information on if borer fall within this category.</p>

<p>If there is no ""quick"" method, methods which take some time will also then be acceptable as an answer.</p>

<p>In case it's pertinent, I live in Australia. So far, the coasters have just been cut to size, but have not yet been sanded or oiled (saving those steps for after I deal with any borer).</p>

<p><em>EDIT:</em> Accepted the answer from Chris as it (and the method in the comments for that answer) worked just fine for me. Essentially, stuck the coasters in our electric oven for a few hours, which kept the temperature around 65-70 degrees celcius over that time (measured by oven thermometer). Seems to have worked, with no discoloration of the wood, and the small cracks in the wood did not get any bigger. Note that the wood was already mostly dry - something else <em>may</em> have happened for green wood, but regardless, didn't in my case.</p>
","<p>Best method for killing boring beetles is to use heat. Warming the wood to a set temperature for a designated length of time will eradicate the beetles and their larvae.</p>

<p>Beetle type determines the length of time and duration of applied heat.</p>

<li>Powderpost beetles 54.4 degrees Celsius/130 degrees Fahrenheit for 2-4 hours in a kiln</li>
<li>Deathwatch beetles 56 degrees Celsius/133 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>Kiln drying the wood works really well, but if you do not have access to a kiln then you could use a microwave.</p>

<p>Personally I have been successful with using the microwave to dry out wood rounds and buttons. 30 seconds at a time works best for me, then I can check the wood temperature and monitor for cracking/checking. </p>

","<p>This has been answered elsewhere on the Internet, though there seem to be a few different stories running around.</p>

<p>The one I currently believe is that nominal 1"" is actually 1"" <em>unsurfaced</em> -- but what you buy as construction lumber is typically s4s (surfaced 4 sides). That means some wood has been planed away. To make that predictable, the convention was established that 1/8"" could be removed from each side of a 1"" thickness. </p>

<p>This is the part you should probably change. If you make the bottoms from something much stouter it will self-support. You could go up to 6mm hardboard, which is significantly stiffer than 3mm, but something like 12mm particleboard/chipboard or plywood would be the superior choice. 12mm and even 18mm board is regularly used in better-quality kitchens for drawers, some of which will be filled with heavy pots and pans. If they can take that they can support the kind of stuff most people store under a bed!</p>

<p>This is also a viable technique. These crossbeams are referred to as muntins and they were the traditional means to support the centres of wide drawers not too long ago.</p>

<p>You would normally do this anyway with drawer bottoms. But with thinner material like 3mm hardboard in a wide drawer it probably won't prevent the bottoms blowing out (as in the picture you posted) if the drawer has anything weighty stored inside it.</p>

<p>Note that if the bottom is 3mm then a 3mm router bit should be used to form the housing grooves. A 4mm groove in the box of the drawer will make the bottom a very sloppy fit and provide no real support to it. If on the other hand the drawer bottom is a tight sliding fit* the groove will add significant support to the bottom, although it needs to be glued in place for this to work fully.</p>

<p>The main difference in the types of tools are the bevels and grinds on the tool as well as the metal type and hardening as that determines how well the tools will hold an edge and how/how often they will be need to be sharpened (I assume you have some knowledge of this is you have done carving before?). In addition the metal quality is important due to the heat generated from the rpm of the wood as it passes over the metal.</p>

"Is there such a thing as a woodworking chisel with a high-speed steel tip?","156","","<p>I do metalworking in addition to woodworking (as a hobbyist in both cases).</p>

<p>As I was sharpening my chisels, I was thinking I would like it if the edges held up a bit longer. Reflecting on that a bit more I wondered if I could braze a tip of high-speed steel (HSS) onto one of my chisels and whether that would hold its edge longer.</p>

<p>Then, of course, it occurred to me unlikely that I was the first person to think of this and wondered if such a thing existed and if not, why not.</p>

<p>Would something like this work and is it something one can find commercially?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Is there such a thing as a woodworking chisel with a high-speed steel tip?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think so, but you won't easily find any. If I'm remembering correctly these were offered in the past by a few makers in the early or mid-20th century. A few years ago a British company offered bench chisels with <em>replaceable</em> HSS tips, rather than having an HSS piece welded to a common steel body. </p>

<p>There are all-HSS turning chisels of course but they're not easily adaptable to use as bench chisels, and tend to be very expensive too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wondered if I could braze a tip of high-speed steel (HSS) onto one of my chisels and whether that would hold its edge longer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You sure could and yes, it would hold its edge far longer than most bench chisels*. But you might not want them because of the difficulty in sharpening HSS. </p>

<p>This is both in sharpening them period (HSS is very tough and hard to abrade) and much more critically for a chisel, getting them <em>really</em> sharp. </p>

<p>Many users report that they find it hard or impossible to get an edge as good on HSS as on more prosaic steels and this is a critical factor arguing against the material for bench chisels IMO because chisels have to be sharper than plane irons in order to work as well as they should. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As I was sharpening my chisels, I was thinking I would like it if the edges held up a bit longer. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lots of people would too :-) The obvious thought is to buy better chisels, but there are some other options that are worth exploring that will save $$ or $$$:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strop the edge regularly (so you have to do proper honing less often). </li>
<li>Improve the heat treat on your current chisels so that they're harder than they came from the factory.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I've written wrote about in a couple of previous Answers (including <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3670/bench-grinder-tool-sharpener-or-sharpening-stone/3701#3701"">this one</a>), stropping can stretch the interval between re-sharpenings from hours to days, weeks to months, depending on the quality of your chisels, the woods you're working with and the amount you use them.</p>

<p>Redoing the heat treatment on a chisel sounds like something you need specialist equipment and loads of experience to do but actually just one torch and a cup of oil or water is all you need at minimum. And you won't even have to remove the handles in most cases, although this can be used as an opportunity to replace the (often <em>meh</em>) factory handles with something you made yourself so that length, diameter, shape, finish and/or colour are all exactly as you prefer. </p>

<p>*Couldn't say how they'd compare to some of the high-end chisels made from modern exotic alloys which far outstrip the edge-retention of most common chisels. </p>

","<p>Generally how I do it is after ripping the wood, line them all back up.  then flip every other board over the long way.  If the board wants to cup, flipping every other board reduces how much it can cup, because each one will want to 'bend' in the opposite direction. </p>

"Single coat of coloured Danish oil?","153","","<p>I am using an oak effect Danish oil and have applied it to a couple of test pieces of pine, one with 3 coats with 30 mins between coats and one with a single coat, and left overnight.</p>

<p>The single coat looks lighter and better to me. All advice I read says to apply 3-4 coats, or until the wood stops absorbing. Would it be okay to leave as a single coat?</p>
","<p>This is tricky as a coloured version of a finish is doing two jobs at the same time, providing colour wood and adding protection. </p>

<p>For many finishes three coats is considered the minimum number to provide good protection. But when it comes to colouring the wood you should of course stop when you've gotten the colour you want. Normally that's not a problem as you then add protection on top of the colouring agent (often dye or stain) in the form of a clear finish.</p>

<p>Now how tough the surface of wood needs to be varies a great deal. Many things don't need finish at all, others do need something or they'll get stained or marked from use (scratches, dings, staining from water and other liquids).</p>

<p>So depending on what the application here is you can safely stop after just the one coat, but if the item needs more than minimal protection it would be best to apply further finish. The two leading options are a regular version of ""Danish oil"" or a varnish. </p>

<p>Either of the above will slightly alter the colour of the wood but it shouldn't be enough to be a problem. </p>

<p>Update 2: The size of the table is somehow dictated by the supporting frame which I grabbed from PrincessAuto here in Canada for $50. It can take up to 100lb. The table is foldable so the space does not become an issue and the table is designed (not shown here) to be able to remove the existing top and replace it with a different one with different functionality. I have no idea how big will the pieces of wood be for my probects but as I mentioned above I will mostly need this for cutting slots and making joits needed for all sort of custom storage units that I will need in different places in my house.

","<p>If it were me, I would run the fence along the longer dimension, as that will give your workpiece the most support both on infeed and outfeed when using the fence. I would also probably in that case shift the router insert forward towards the 'front' of the table, closer to your body so you don't have to lean so far, as well as to allow the most amount of travel for the fence.</p>

<p>Is there a reason that you have the left portion of the table sectioned off?</p>

<p>What do you plan to use the router table for? Running longer linear stock against the fence lends itself to the longer orientation I mention above, but if you plan to do a lot of flush trimming and roundover work without the fence, you will want to be able to have work space on all sides of the bit.</p>

"Lacquer dries very slowly","152","","<p>I have made a small jewelry box from steamed black walnut for my significant other. My original idea was to sand it down to 400 grit and finish with just oil (which I did, with two coats of IKEA ""Skydd"" mineral oil), but I liked the high gloss so much I decided to give a try to lacquer... and things went downhill from there.</p>

<p>The first thin coat of lacquer was absorved almost entirely by the end grain. Also, the lacquer was taking days get dry enough to touch (an alkyd resin-based lacquer premixed with naphtha as solvent, supposed to dry fully in 24 hours). At this point, I sort of panicked and applied 4 more <em>generous</em> coats using a brush in quick succession, barely waiting 48 hours between coats.</p>

<p>Now it's been a full week since the last coat was applied and the lacquer is still rubbery to touch, nowhere near hard enough for sanding. I only have a week or so left before the event the box was made for and given the progress so far, I doubt it will fully dry (but then it's my first time with lacquer, so I don't know).</p>

<p>Any ideas how can I save this project? I'm OK with removing the lacquer with paint thinner, but I'm not sure if that will damage the wood. Also, where did I go wrong with the finishing?</p>
","<p>My guess is that the oil is acting as thinner that prevents the lacquer from catalyzing.  </p>

<p>Shellac can be used as an intermediate layer between oil and lacquer (be sure to use dewaxed shellac)</p>

"Need a new router collet , or bit?","151","","<p>I use my router in the router planer. It has been through a lot of use and I use 2 different bits for planing. Both are 1/2 straight bits. Recently they will start to fall out if I went to fast, even if it wasn't working hard. But does necessarily mean the collet is shot because these were cheap bits off of ebay (did not want to use good bits for the job). By cheap I mean about $2. I was careful to make sure they did not explode in my face. Could the shanks be smaller than 1/4 like it clams. </p>

<p>Is it worth investing in a more expensive bit. Or thinking the other way is it the collect? I would not think it would wear but I may be wrong I guess. If it is and I can not find a new one, could I use a piece of paper around the shank of the bit to help get a better grasp? I really do not know what is happening. And I am tightening the bit as good as I can go, maybe a little to much. So anything would help right now, thanks.</p>
","<p>While you say the bits were cheap and you think they're to blame<sup>1</sup> there's a good chance your collet is shot also, because once bits become loose under speed they will tend to wear the collet too as well as their own shaft. Once the collet is worn you get an effect call <em>runout</em> where the bit can deflect from the rotational axis. Runout causes vibration and chatter, and of course at worst the bit can work free during use.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xtJdy.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xtJdy.jpg"" alt=""Router runout""></a></p>

<p><sup>Source: <strong>The New Router Handbook</strong> by Patrick Spielman.</sup></p>

<p>But there is a chance your collet hasn't worn excessively and just needs to be cleaned well so that it can tighten properly. Sticky wood dust and resin can build up between the fingers of the collet (even inside the hole) and it needs to be cleaned away using an appropriate solvent and small brushes. </p>

<p><strong>Prevention</strong><br>
Prevention is not to be taken literally here since some wear is inevitable, but to lessen wear in future it's important to follow good practice when installing a bit<sup>2</sup>. Not sure if it's the main thing but it's important never to tighten the collet nut with a bit fully inserted or ""bottomed out"", always back it up slightly.</p>

<p>The bottom edge of the cutter head on the bit (or the bearing if it has one there) should never press against the rim of the collet, but there's also this which isn't as obvious:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1SBUv.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1SBUv.jpg"" alt=""Router bit installation depth""></a></p>

<p><sup>Source: Wonkee Donkey Tools.</sup></p>

<p>As a quick visual reference for installing bits to their proper depth in the collet it's worth marking their shafts with a sharpie after you've determined the ideal position, the line will instantly tell you <em>that's in far enough</em> and not to mount the bit any deeper. This line will probably need to be renewed periodically as cleaning resin from the bit will eventually wear it away.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup>Cheap bits are a potential problem here because reportedly their shafts can be undersize (by a very tiny amount, but it's enough) which in addition to allowing for play in the bit when spun up can also stress the collet if it's tightened down enough to grip firmly — overtightening collets can lead to premature failure.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Your router's manual probably has all the basics laid out in the introductory pages and it would be worth going over them again to commit them to memory, then doing some practice drills until good installation practice is second nature. Can't be too safe. </p>

Use a bench chisel that is one ""size"" below your mortising chisel.  For example, a 1/4 inch if you are doing a 3/8 inch mortise.  Guide the chisel with the thumb and forefinger of your non-dominant hand as you work it into the chips.  Then, still lightly pinching the chisel, rest your non-dominant forefinger on the board and use it as fulcrum as you lever the waste out of the hole.

","<p>There are a couple paths that may work. First, this is tough problem so there isn't perfect answer. </p>

<p>First thing to try, is simply reapplying the stain to area that doesn't match. The surface will still have marks from sanding across the grain but the difference may not catch the eye as much.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, then:
Second, scrape (or sand) in the area where the mismatch is and reapply the stain. The problem here may be seam or border between the freshly stained area and the older stain.</p>

<p>Third (nuclear option): Once done with option two (scrape and stain the small area), remove the finish from the whole piece with finish remover/paint stripper and stain again. The process of removing all the finish will blur the line between the old and new areas and the fresh (third-pass) stain will look continuous and even.</p>

<p>Other options: A slightly more opaque mixture of stain and pigment will hide the marks, but you must feel comfortable with mixing stain and colors. 
An easy dodge on this count is to merely add in some raw umber or lamp black to darken the stain, but your mileage may vary. </p>

<p>Thin coat of a darker stain over area in question and a bit further down the vertical board can also be very effective. The danger is adding too much and having strange dark blobs. Perfect is the enemy of the good with this approach.</p>

<p>If the variation is slight, adding pigment to wax (applied over the stain) will also work but obviously this is a less permanent solution.  </p>

<p>Part of the issue at hand is from the marks that the sand paper left. So the more work you put into making the marks on the vertical boards uniform the easier matching the finish will be. Looks nice; good luck</p>

"What is a good starter traditional hand-tool set","148","","<p>I am starting to get more serious about woodworking and am embarking on a project for my church (A readers' stand with six sides and a rotating top with 3 book holders). I go to a Greek Orthodox church where a traditional aesthetic is important so the project should conform to some traditional standards of finery; although it doesn't have to be ornate by any means.</p>

<p>Up to this point I have only done more rustic projects for my own home using a lot of pallet wood (changing table, crib, shelves, coffee table, etc...). I've gotten away with using a crappy chop saw, a circular saw, a kreg jig and a drill for construction. As you might guess perfect joints and such were not part of the aesthetic. This sort of stuff isn't quite appropriate for a sacred space though.</p>

<p>So I am thinking that I should set myself up with a good traditional hand-tool set (no power) and follow some older traditional American techniques for construction. Does anyone have a recommendation for what basic tools I need and where to get them and also maybe a book? </p>

<p>I'm planning on working with alligator juniper (very dense softwood), oak (dead wood from forest) and ponderosa pine, all from the AZ high country. I'm want to be able to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>cut planks from 6"" - 18"" rounds that are square (3/4"" to 2"" I should think)</li>
<li>square rough lumber stock from yard</li>
<li>make good through mortise and tenon joints for 90 deg</li>
<li>make whatever basic joint works for 45, 30 and 60 deg</li>
<li>plane variable thickness and warped planks</li>
</ul>

<p>No carving or curves.</p>

<p>I know it'll take longer and be a lot of BST, but that's kind-of the point. I'm hoping I can get a good set of tools to get myself started for less than $1k.</p>
","<p>Expense will vary a lot with sources of supply - while there are good new hand tools available, they are often expensive - if you have any flea markets that tend to old tools (or a vendor that does) they are often cheaper for similar quality - but that is a well that's deeper in some geographic regions than others.</p>

<p>You'll need a frame saw - that's often best built by you, and covers the ""bandsaw-ish"" jobs of making lumber from logs, resawing lumber, etc. without getting into the absurdity of a very hard to source blade (frame saw uses bandsaw blade stock that's easy to come by)</p>

<p>You might also want a froe &amp;/or a set of splitting wedges/gluts for pre-processing your large rounds before the sawing starts.</p>

<p>A mitre box &amp; backsaw help with angles. A shooting board can again be built by you and used with a plane that need not be a ""shooting board plane"" (but the cheeks should be square to the sole) to make things spiffy. </p>

<p>Jack, smoother, and block planes for a typical start. A roughing plane may also be useful when starting from split or very rough-sawm lumber.</p>

"How do I shave off a few millimeters from a board?","147","","<p>When I purchase wood from the local carpenter a lot of boards are 1-2mm off which results in gaps in my furniture which I usually just fill with silicon. I don't have a sanding machine with a length equal to the board (say 1.5m at max). My local carpenter insists that errors in the millimeter range are unavoidable.</p>

<p>Is it even possible to do this accurately with handheld tools?</p>
","<p>By hand I'm afraid there's no easy way to remove excess material from the edges of chipboard (particleboard for those in the US). In general the idea is to saw it to the exact size you need because it's so difficult to alter afterwards. </p>

<p><strong>Planing</strong><br>
You can plane the edges of chipboard with one or more types of hand plane, but the glue in chipboard is extremely hard and very abrasive to cutting edges so with most plane irons you have to stop frequently to resharpen, making the process very slow and difficult to rely on even to shave off a small amount every now and then. And 2mm is not a small amount when it comes to chipboard, even with the thinner stuff. </p>

<p><strong>Belt sander</strong><br>
A hand-held belt sander with a coarse belt fitted would be a much better way to remove this much from the edges, particularly with the 30mm, although I realise this may not be an option for you for any number of reasons. In addition to the (possibly high) cost of the sander and the (possibly high) ongoing cost of replacement belts the large amounts of dust produced could be a big issue for you*. </p>

<p><strong>Power saws</strong><br>
It's not a standard use but it is theoretically possible to nibble away material using a circular saw (and for thinner material a jigsaw) running the baseplate along a straightedge set up an appropriate distance from the edge. I wouldn't want to recommend this though unless you already have one so can easily test it out at no cost.</p>

<p><strong>Surform</strong><br>
I'm not sure how widely available Surform-like tools are in other markets but I've read they can be used for gross material removal from chipboard edges. How accurate you can be with one I don't know but I presume a lot of that is down to the skill of the user. Despite how crude the tool looks it could be used with finesse, just like with a conventional rasp. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My local carpenter insists that errors in the millimeter range are unavoidable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it's important to state that they may be unavoidable <em>for him</em>, but that far greater accuracy than this is possible. </p>

<p>Sub-millimetre accuracy is perfectly feasible using good power tools set up and used correctly, with accurate initial marking up as needed. Commercial cabinetry could easily have accuracies in the 0.2mm range to you an idea of the level of accuracy possible, although I believe +/-0.5mm might be fairly typical.  </p>

<p>Now that said, I'd prefer better but accuracy of 1mm either way might be acceptable to me for chipboard furniture depending on the application. 2mm would not, especially if short!</p>

<hr>

<p>*Even with dust extraction some to a lot of dust can still be released (depends on model and the power of the vacuum attached). The dust from chipboard needs to be considered hazardous and breathing protection should be considered a must.</p>

"Wide breadboard tenon length?","147","","<p>I'm getting ready to attach breadboard ends to my table top. The top and ends are cut from 9.5"" x 1.5"" red oak. Purely for aesthetic reasons, the breadboards will also be 9.5"" wide (or deep, rather).</p>

<p>I've thought about either M&amp;T, or a continuous tenon with a single long mortise in the ends, with dowels through the bottom (draw bore with elongated slots in the tongue / tenon / whatever you want to call it in this case.)</p>

<p>Is this a reasonable approach for a 9.5"" piece that's basically hanging off in the ether? Is there any advantage to doing individual tenons on each board rather than a single long one

<p>If so, what dimensions should I target for the tenon length? Assuming it's 1/2"" thick - 1/3rd of the board thickness - is 2"" deep enough? </p>

<p>I don't think there's anything wrong with beefy breadboard ends if it's the desired look. It is not a technical necessity that they be this big however. If larger breadboard ends are on the plans, then, generally speaking, they should be accompanied by larger tenons.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple tenons vs a single one</strong></p>

<p>I'm using the image below as a visual reference -- only to improve clarity, not to prescribe a particular construction. As far as going for 
 <em>option 1: ""multiple tenons + one continuous tongue""</em> versus <em>option 2: ""one long tenon""</em>, multiple tenons will offer additional strength to your end piece -- between each tenon (i.e. the material outside the volume defined by the blue transparent outline in the illustration's end piece), there will be solid wood linking the underside of the breadboard end, to the topside.  It allows the end piece to keep its shape under pressure.</p>

<p>Multiple tenons also require less material to be removed from the mortise, which is generally the more difficult piece to create (at least, with handtools).</p>

<p>That said, even with multiple tenons, you should keep a tongue (the haunch) that goes the entire width of your panel (as if you had a single tenon for the first 3/4"" of the tenons depth). It it will help prevent cupping for parts of the panel between tenons (if they are far apart). To a lesser degree, it will also prevent light (or liquids) from passing through if your joinery is not completely flush.</p>

<p>(image from woodcraft <a href=""https://www.woodcraft.com/blog_entries/breadboard-ends"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Breadboard Ends</a> article)</p>

<p>If you imagine, for a second, that your breadboard end piece is a hardcover book where pages have been removed, and has been folded closed over the tenon(s), you want to prevent it from bending or splitting open. In other words, you want to keep points <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> close to one another in the side-view sketch below. Leaving a gap between tenons (as opposed to a single long tenon helps with that.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1blO7.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1blO7.png"" alt=""side view of joint""></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is a 2"" tenon deep enough?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A 2"" tenon, if I understand the plan, would leave 7.5"" of the width of the endpiece (just under 80% of the weight) unsupported. Intuitively, I'd say longer tenons are required. </p>

<p>There's a rule that tenons in breadboard ends should be 2/3 the length of the width of the breadboard end (minus 1/16in or so at the bottom to account for glue space). Sometimes though, these rules of thumb only work at smaller scales, and don't take into account other factors.</p>

<p>Quoting woodmagazine: <em>The breadboard ends are usually 2"" to 3"" wide, but you can make them wider or narrower for larger or smaller panels, if you wish. In either case, make the mortise depth about two-thirds the width of the end piece.</em>
 -- <a href=""https://www.woodmagazine.com/woodworking-tips/techniques/joinery/breadboard"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.woodmagazine.com/woodworking-tips/techniques/joinery/breadboard</a></p>

<p>I've personally achieved good solid results with a 2.5in tenon in a 5in wide endpiece (in 1.25in thick pine) which is a 50-50 ratio instead of 2/3. I personally consider a construction ""solid"" if it allows an adult (after dinner) to lean or sit on the edge of the table.</p>

<p>One danger you run into when doing a shorter tenon (for 2"") is for your breadboard end to ""bend down"" or wiggle as you apply weight or lift. This is especially true if the fit between the tenons and female endpiece offers some slack. If the pieces are really tight-fitted, then shorter tenons (than the rule of thumb) might suffice.</p>

<p>One thing to consider, which could allow a less deep tenon, is the total amount of overhang you will have (distance between table edge and the closest supporting element). If your aprons/trestle/support allows for the largest BB-end overhang, then you might want to reconsider beefy tenons. Similarly, if you added aprons, and they offered some support to your bb ends, then you could get away with smaller tenons, because the weight would be partly transferred to the support.</p>

<p>Becksvoort mentions overhang at the very end of the finewoodworking article <a href=""https://www.finewoodworking.com/media/TabletopsFlat.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Keeping Tabletops Flat</a>:</p>

<p><em>For overhangs of 14 in. or less, I tend to
avoid breadboard ends because the cross
brace at the top of the leg is close enough
to keep the table flat. But they are a good
option for overhangs of 18 in. or more.</em></p>

<p>That's got more to do with preventing warp than a falling breadboard end, but it a signal that overhang does matter. And that may convince you one way or another to drop the BB altogether.</p>

<p>I suspect digging a 6.25"" mortise (2/3 of 9.5) may be pushing some limits, tool-wise. If you do go the breadboard end route, and settle on tenon/mortise dimensions that are, in the end, not to your satisfaction, you can always correct the situation with (longer) floating tenons, the addition of a brace under the table, or trim down your breadboard end in width (e.g. 7.5"" instead of 9.5"")</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>there's no ""center.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your assumption is correct. The glue will prevent expansion, and expansion will occur on both sides of the glue. The geometric center of your board is at the junction of your two middle boards. Regardless of if they are edge jointed with glue or not, you can still form a central tenon which is composed half of one board, and half the other.</p>

<p>Becksvoort uses a 4in band of glue on the center tenon. This, presumably, will imply 2in on each side of the geometric centerline.</p>

"Fixture and jig, what's the difference","146","","<p>I hear the term ""fixture"" and ""jig"" all the time, but I don't know the difference. Can anyone explain?</p>
","<p>The difference can be arbitrary. Or to put it another way the terms <em>might</em> be considered interchangeable. </p>

<p>I don't use the term fixture although I've seen it in print often enough. Jig is one I use a lot and I'd judge it to be much more commonly used by others too, although the type of thing they're used to describe could differ slightly from person to person.</p>

<p>A jig generally refers to a tool or setup, or ""appliance"" to use an older word, that holds a workpiece in a given way to allow you to work on it more easily. An ideal example is a sharpening jig/honing jig. But particularly with larger shop-built items (e.g. something to facilitate the cutting of tapers on the table saw, or to tilt the workpiece in a pillar drill to make angled holes) you could easily describe such a thing as a fixture. And for something like a bench hook I'm not sure that either word is really right since it can be used in multiple ways, some of which aren't about holding the work, i.e. it can be used just to provide a sacrificial surface to chop on. More on bench hooks <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1321/whats-a-bench-hook/1327#1327"">in this previous Answer</a>.</p>

","<p>How far to take a cleaning is always up to the individual. As with old tools you can basically clean something up a little bit all the way to a full restoration and it's completely up to you how far you take it. </p>

<p>The minimalist approach often seeks to ""preserve patina"" – note that the majority of patina is actually built-up dirt and rust on old things! (not that this is an argument in favour of removing it, just an FYI) – and at the other extreme you can make the thing look new or nearly so, and there are various levels in between.</p>

<p>First step is the same regardless and that is getting the dirt off, although with some cleaning procedures (many of the traditional ones) the cleaning solution also does some 'restoration' of the finish. I think it's better to separate the steps in most cases so you clean, then assess how it looks and proceed from there. </p>

<p>I'd break it down like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>dust</li>
<li>clean</li>
<li>restore (<em>if</em> desired)</li>
</ul>

<p>So here, first thing to do is dust them off with a soft brush or duster. Sometimes it's quite amazing how much difference that alone makes! A 1-2"" (25-50mm) paintbrush with natural or synthetic bristles makes an excellent dusting brush.</p>

<p>Basic first step in cleaning is to use warm soapy water<sup>1</sup> but a slightly better result is often obtained if you use a mixture of soapy water and one or more solvents. One of the best cleaning solutions I've discovered through reading is also one of the simplest, hot soapy water with a little turpentine or mineral spirits (UK: white spirit) added. The water alone will do a decent job but the turps/spirits adds a little extra cleaning power.</p>

<p>Gentle use of one of these is often useful:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/D6vqj.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/D6vqj.jpg"" alt=""Scouring sponge""></a></p>

<p>Use the sponge side for most of it, flip over and use the nylon scourer side for stubborn dirt and if you want to give the thing a deeper clean.</p>

<p>Although these boxes look stout as a general point the cloth or sponge used in cleaning wooden items should be <em>damp not wet</em>. Even with that you might want to have a dry sponge or cloth in the other hand to dry the surface off as you go. How much dirt gets transferred to the dry sponge/cloth also tells you how much grunge is still present.</p>

<p>When you're done cleaning stop for a few hours to overnight before doing anything further. Once the wood is dry you're in a better position to assess the condition and the look of the piece, and anyway most restoration processes require the surface to be dry.</p>

<p>If you're not happy to stop at this point the old advice was often to wait for a day and then apply a little paste wax and this is still a good option generally today and might be the best call here specifically. In addition to adding a bit of shine wax helps the wood not to look so 'dry' <sup>2</sup> and that is often just enough restoration of looks for old items to look cared for, without having to add any new finish.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> If you want to retain the traces of paper labels on the box closest to camera in the first image you might want to stop there. Any cleaning with water might do some damage to the paper or start to dissolve the glue/paste used to adhere it to the surface.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Be aware that the wax doesn't actually make the wood wet or help it not to dry out further, the furniture-polish industry's idea of ""feeding"" wood is complete bunkum. Wood doesn't just dry out, even bare wood takes on moisture as easily as it loses it, this is why wood expands and contracts through the seasons.</p>

"Panel Glue up Question","146","","<p>I apologize for this elementary question, but I'm just getting started with woodworking. I'm working on my first panel glue up - made of 1x6 walnut. I'm wondering how ""square"" the edges of the planks have to be in order to get a seamless joint. I'm asking because I bought the wood rough sawn and bought a nice track saw to straight-line the edges. I don't have a jointer so I was hoping by buying a nice track saw that I could get joint ready edges off the saw. What I'm seeing is that saw must be riding ever so slightly crooked in the track because when I check the edges of the planks with a combination square, there is a very tiny sliver of light I can see on one side of the edge. It's really a sliver as I have to shine a light behind it to see it. The edge is consistent throughout the length of the board. Is this sort of thing normal and considered to be within the tolerance of a nice track saw? Will planks that are just ever so slightly out of square pull together with clamps? </p>

<p>Since I've never done this before, I'm not sure if I'm being too much of a perfectionist or if there really is cause for concern.</p>

<p>I think this might be happening because the weight of the saw wants to ""fall off the edge"" on the side of the saw making the cut. I might be able to resolve this by figuring out how to get a more stable base to work from as I was trying to use the garage floor which isn't the easiest to work from. </p>

<p>Thank you for any insight and/or suggestions. </p>
","<p>In general, panel glue-up requires accurate square faces on the boards being glued. However, not all is lost.</p>

<p>One possibility is that your combination square is not perfectly square. To try and verify this, cut several thin strips of wood using your saw. When pressed together (in the same orientation as they were cut, see below for why) any deviation from flatness should be more apparent. If the strips form a flat surface then perhaps your combination square is at fault and not the saw.</p>

<p>If the saw is indeed not cutting perfectly square, you still have some options:</p>

<p>One option is to tune your track saw to get perfectly square cuts. Perhaps your theory is correct and the way you hold and move the saw causes the saw to cut out of square. Perhaps your technique is okay and the saw's 90 degree stop is not perfectly accurate. Either way you can try and adjust the bevel angle of the saw. Perform the alignment by doing test cuts, not by aligning the blade to the sole of the saw.</p>

<p>Another option is to keep the saw cutting as-is, and simply flip the boards as you glue the panel. In this scenario, if your cuts are 89 degrees instead of 90, flipping every other board will give you an angle of 91 degrees, resulting in a perfectly flat mating surface. To make sure you are flipping correctly, mark the top (or bottom) part of the wood you are cutting, so that you will be able to later place the boards for the glue-up correctly.</p>

<p>Here is a greatly exaggerated illustration of the problem you seem to be facing:

  <p>Would the table need to be reinforced underneath with hidden brackets? </p>

<p>Not at all, the interlocking box joint is very strong (lots of surface area for the glue) and the table will be naturally stiff.</p>

<p>You could try using <a href=""http://www.woodbin.com/calcs/sagulator/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Sagulator</a> to calculate this, but it won't be easy since this isn't any material that it includes (because of the way the boards are oriented). Let's just say <em>a lot</em>.</p>

<p>This design orients the boards edge-up, which is using the wood at its maximum strength as regards resistance to sagging. Couple that with them being glued together what you're making here is in effect a laminated beam, so its strength is immense. I bet a heavy person could stand right in the centre and it wouldn't bow enough to notice.</p>

<p>There is a weight issue that you might not have thought of and that's the weight of the table itself. Obviously you like the chunky style but do be aware scaled up to table size this makes for a great mass of solid wood and it'll weight quite a bit and may be difficult to move around even just made from 2x material. Made from hardwood it would be a two-man or three-man job in a lot of cases!</p>

<p>In case it's not obvious you could do a very similar cutout using a common dovetail bit. Perhaps not as comfortable but would likely work nearly as well.</p>

<p>Do be aware a cut like this will work better in solid wood than in plywood. Even using excellent all-hardwood ply the router bit will naturally cut the long-grain plies differently to the cross-grain plies so the inside surface may feel rougher than you'd really like. And there may be a tendency for the surface ply to delaminate from the board with extended use.</p>

<p>Also related to the cross-ply structure, to get a good surface on the edge you may want to clamp on a sacrificial board, or, route and then saw to final width to remove the chipped-out edge.</p>

"How do I prepare a scraper for use?","139","","<p>In <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/1138/20"">this answer</a> LeeG talks about that a scraper needs to be burnished and sharpened.</p>

<p>How does one do that?</p>
","<p>This will deal with sharpening a flat scraper.  Curved scrapers follow the same principle, but I don't personally have any experience with them.</p>

<p>First, you need to flatten the edge.  I sandwich the scraper between two pieces of wood in my vise with perhaps 1/2"" of the edge standing proud.  Use a mill bastard file that is 2-3"" longer than your scraper, and holding it flat against the edge of the scraper, file down the scraper so it is flat along the edge, with no burrs.  It is important that the edge be flat, so make some sort of jig to hold the file flat.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hE3pb.jpg"" alt=""File holding Jig""></p>

<p>If you want the sharpest, longest lasting edge, you can use a stone (water or oil) to further polish the edge.  Remove the scraper from the vise, and using a block of wood to hold it vertical, polish the edge to about 5000 grit.</p>

<p>Once the edge is flat, you need to remove the burr and polish the edges with a stone.  You can polish the entire edge of the scraper, or use the ""ruler trick"", placing a steel ruler along the length of the stone, and using it to only allow the flat edge of the scraper to be touched by the stone.  Either way, work both sides until there is no burr.</p>

<p>To finalize, you need to draw out an edge and ""turn the hook"".  Veritas makes a <a href=""http://www.leevalley.com/us/wood/page.aspx?c=&amp;p=32633&amp;cat=1,310,41070&amp;ap=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jig that will do both</a> or you can do it with a burnisher.  A burnisher is a smooth, hard piece of steel, usually, but not always, round.  First draw out the edge by laying the scraper on its side on the bench with about 1/2"" standing proud.  Put a drop of machine oil on the burnisher, and stroke it across the scraper several times until a burr begins to form.  You don't need to press hard - about as hard as when putting butter on bread.</p>

<p>Once an edge has been formed, put the scraper back in the vise, and holding the burnisher at about a 5 degree angle, take a few strokes to roll the edge over.  The scraper should now be ready for use.  Once it gets dull, you can repeat the ""draw and turn hook"" steps several times before needing to flatten the scraper again.</p>

"Scroll or Band saw?","139","","<p>I know what they do, cutting the wood and can be used for fancy cutting and stuff. But I do not know which one to get for starters. Which would get the most use out of? Do I <em>need</em> to get both? What are the big differences for each.</p>
","<p>Obviously both of these saws can cut curves but past that they have little in common. For general cutting of wood no question you'd get more from a bandsaw. </p>

<p><strong>Bandsaw</strong><br>
The bandsaw is, in the opinion of quite a few owners, the single most useful power saw to own. It's a good contender for the only power saw to own if you had to pick just one. </p>

<p>It may not be the ideal starter saw (power saw) but I don't know what I'd vote for instead. Certainly not the table saw, even if only because it's the most dangerous power tool. </p>

<p><strong>Scroll saw</strong><br>
A scroll saw is basically good for scrollwork, it excels at it because it's a specialist tool but it's of little use for anything else. All the joint-forming cuts that can be done on a scroll saw are better cut using something else for the required accuracy and smoothness.</p>

<p>If you only need to cut intricate curves periodically it is hard to justify the cost of a scroll saw (both monetary and the cost in space it takes up). Although there are some inexpensive models available buying a coping saw and a fret saw, along with packs of blades for both, should cost less and they are perfectly capable of doing the same work, just much more slowly obviously. And in addition they can do a few tasks that you couldn't do on the scroll saw so they're more versatile. </p>

<hr>

<p>The diameter of the cuts achievable with each saw are not generally comparable. With a scroll saw you can do small, intricate in-and-out curves, as fine as anything required in woodwork. A bandsaw can generally only do relatively large-diameter curves, the width of the blade determining the radius of cut:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AbIL1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AbIL1.jpg"" alt=""How bandsaw blade affects cut radius""></a></p>

<p>Note that the narrower the blade fitted to a bandsaw the less useful it is for general-purpose cutting because that blade is one specialised for curves. And the wider the blade fitted the better the bandsaw becomes for doing straight cuts (very wide blades being particularly good for deep resawing work).</p>

Given the aquarium is a salt water one what sort of lacquer would be best to chemically resist salt water spillages? I intend to also spray the finish on and am looking to achieve a nice finish, what's the best process to accomplish this? Thanks</p>
","<p>You want a film finish for this and you have a few options here. The main two are varnish and lacquer, the others being epoxy and a pour-on finish as intended for bar tops. </p>

<p>Epoxy I think you'll want to discount first on the basis of cost, many times it'll work out to be the most expensive option by a considerable margin.</p>

<p>I think varnish is likely your best choice here since it's inexpensive, commonly available everywhere and can be applied equally easily to the legs as well as the top. Pour-on finishes are great but they can't be applied in that way to the legs, leading to a mismatch of look and surface finish on different elements of the stand which can be jarring*.</p>

<p>In terms of which varnish to use oil-based polyurethane varnish would be best for this if it's to take the weight of a water tank. Polys are more than waterproof enough if you build up a sufficient coat thickness, otherwise they'd never be used on commercial tabletops. Spar varnish is waterproof but it's made to be flexible to resist any amount of water <em>and direct sunlight</em>, which can lead to movements that would crack something less flexible. But that flexibility also translates into spar more easily taking impressions when subjected to pressure and how much does the tank weigh? In a thinnish coating you'd often not notice the difference but once built up into a proper coating, as you're going to want to use here to waterproof the top, a spar varnish will be noticeably softer than polyurethane.</p>

<p>In addition there's an aesthetic issue, spar varnishes are significantly yellower than regular indoor varnishes because of the increased oil content (this is what gives them their flexibility). Ash being a fairly light wood will take on a ghastly yellow tone that many find distinctly unattractive..... on the other hand your mileage on this may vary so ignore if appropriate :-)</p>

<p>There are numerous advantages going with varnish over lacquer, the first is the much simpler application. You can wipe varnish on and as touched on in a few previous Answers converting a varnish into wiping varnish is a simple matter of diluting it slightly and wiping it on with a rag (or brushing it on and partly wiping away the excess) and this application process makes getting a good result with varnish far easier, making it nearly foolproof. Additionally you won't need to buy any spray equipment and a solvent-rated respirator to protect you from the spray and fumes. And last but not least you don't need to figure out how to dilute the finish enough that it will spray well in your equipment, then learn all the other things that contribute to a good spray finish, and only then do one or more test boards since you <em>never</em> test out a new finishing regimen directly on the workpiece. </p>

<p>*On the other hand if this doesn't bother you then pour-on for the top and a waterbased poly for the rest might be worth considering. </p>

"How long after cutting wood can I wait to glue?","137","","<p>I am building a dining room table and it has taken me several months to cut all the pieces.

  <p>Will the glue have any problems sticking to the edges that have been jointed/cut several months ago?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Joint failures from wood movement can and do happen if older surfaces are glued. </p>

<p>As you're doing a panel glue-up where the glue presumably will have to do all the work (long-grain butt joints) it's critical that you ensure your edges are ready to accept glue for maximum joint strength. </p>

<p>Glue surfaces should be freshly worked as much as possible, <em>within the hour if possible</em>. </p>

<p>While this sounds nearly impossible for the home woodworker older worked surfaces can be made glue-ready, or 'reactivated', with just a little light sanding according to studies done at the Forest Products Laboratory. A couple of passes with med/fine abrasive should usually be sufficient. </p>

<p>Where appropriate, scraping or a very light shaving taken off with a suitable plane can accomplish the same thing.</p>

"Is the off gassing from plywood harmful when used in a cooking device?","137","","<p>I'm planning to make a solar oven <a href=""http://www.williamgbecker.com/MakeSolarOven.html"" rel=""nofollow"">like this one</a>. The linked article mentions </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the odor suggested volatiles being cooked out of the plywood and maybe the paint</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I'm wondering if I should avoid using plywood due to the health concerns (from formaldehyde and whatever else) and glue up some wide boards in its place, which would be more work.</p>

<p>I've looked up some other articles like <a href=""http://www.weemakechange.co.nz/2014/12/formaldehyde-off-gas-from-plywood.html#.V8C_88fvTOg"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> and <a href=""https://www.proreferral.com/experts/question/do-i-need-to-worry-about-off-gassing-plywood"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> on the environmental health effects of plywood, but I can't find anything specific to using it in a cooking device. </p>
","<p>I think you'd only be able to get a reliable science-based answer on this from someone like an industrial chemist, and it would have to be specifically tailored to individual types of plywood due to the range of adhesives used.</p>

<p>That said however we can make some educated guesses about how safe this might be in real-world terms. The first thing is, if you're in the US, 
<em>you are probably surrounded by board materials on a daily basis</em> because of the building practices used there. This means your 'background levels' of any VOCs from plywood and other board materials would already be high, this is a fact of modern life and not something to be overly scared about and it puts into context what must amount to a tiny increase in exposure from occasional use of a solar oven. </p>

<p>In addition to this, similar cooking devices (including hot boxes, for passive cooking) have been made from plywood for many decades. In that time I'm sure someone would have noticed if there were a noticeable risk and the word would start to go around, and we know this is the kind of thing that would spread like wildfire and never go away — whether well-founded or not<sup>1</sup>. </p>

<p>Now don't take this as a guarantee of any kind, but <em>I'd</em> say this is likely safe enough that it should fall below your worry threshold. </p>

<p>If you are still concerned though, for security run the oven a few times before you use it to heat food. It's probably a good idea WRT the paint if nothing else. The coat of paint will benefit from going through a number of heating cycles, forcing it to release more volatiles as well as greatly speeding up the curing process compared to leaving it at room temperature. You can gauge the success of this by smell<sup>2</sup>. </p>

<hr>

<p>[1] Two similar examples I can think of off the top of my head are MSG being responsible for ""Chinese food syndrome"" and cellphones being a fire risk at filling stations.</p>

<p>[2] Two samples of paint applied on the same day where one was heat-cured and the other was just left at room temperature will be in very different states on day three or four. The former should have nearly no odour while the second will still have that characteristic odour of fresh paint (indicating that VOCs are still being released). </p>

"Sander in lieu of grindstone?","137","","<p>Odd thought just went by: </p>

<p>There are sandpaper-based sharpening systems (""scary sharp"" and it's cousins), generally using fine wet/dry sandpaper on a flat surface like plate glass.</p>

<p>There are motorized versions of this, typically spinning a disk of sandpaper mounted on a similar flat plate. And I know narrow-belt sanders are sometimes used by knife makers.</p>

<p>It just occurred to me to wonder whether an appropriately mounted/jigged sander I already have on hand -- belt or disk -- could be (ab)used for this purpose.</p>

<p>So: Outside of the usual problems of holding the blade reliably at appropriate angle and not overheating and the like, can anyone suggest reasons this wouldn't work? I suspect buying or building  a proper slow-speed  grindstone would be sufficiently better to justify its cost, but I could see this possibly being useful on a worksite....</p>
","<p>For flat blades (chisel, plane) you're going to struggle getting to a fine finish. Most sand-paper sharpening systems have you placing the paper on glass or granite, so as to have a dead-flat reference plate. The metal plate inside a belt-sander is not likely to be flat enough for sharpening. The flexible pad in a random-orbit sander will certainly not be flat or rigid enough to give you a flat edge.</p>

<p>That said, a belt sander is great for rough-shaping or re-shaping a blade, say if you need to get past a big nick in the edge. It is only effective for the roughest work though, after which you'll need another more precise sharpening method.</p>

<p>Turning tools and knife blades have their own set of rules and requirements, which I am not qualified to answer.</p>

"What finish can I apply to mixed end-grain/cross-grain bowl that's sanded to 7000?","136","","<p>I'm new to woodturning. I've made a small bowl from layered woods. I don't know what these woods are as they're reclaimed, but it's a red-coloured wood sandwiching some pale wood. I think the red-ish wood is a hardwood and the paler wood is a softwood looking at the grain density.</p>

<p>I've turned the small bowl/pot and sanded up from 240/600/1000/1500/3000/5000/7000 papers. The result is the bowl is glass-like in texture and looks very nice.</p>

<p>The problem is, I applied some wax aerosol furniture polish hoping to seal the surface of the wood, but the end grain expanded, absorbing it and the finish was spoiled. I had to re-sand it to restore it.</p>

<p>Are there any finishing oils or waxes I can use that won't cause the grain to swell on very finely sanded work?</p>
","<p>I hate to say this given all the trouble you've gone to already but it's rarely a good call to sand wood up to ultra-fine grits*.</p>

<p>If you're looking to get a gloss on wood you can get it much more efficiently by going to a finish of some sort (including simply waxing directly onto the bare wood, although I'm not a fan of this myself).</p>

<p>In addition to giving you the surface gloss that you want, faster and with less effort, a finish adds protection to the wood which can obviously be very desirable for anything that won't just sit in a glass case and never be touched. Wax will resist minor handling and help ease dusting but it doesn't provide much more protection than this in the long term which is why I'm not a fan of it used by itself.</p>

<p>A short while ago there was a flurry of interest on one or two of the woodworking forums in a very finely sanded and buffed/burnished finish on wood with no actual finish applied, the gloss purely down to the super-smooth surface of the wood. I suppose it's something that everyone with access to fine sanding and/or buffing materials thinks to try at some point. In my case at least it became evident very quickly that for most hardwoods <em>moisture or grease on the fingertips was enough to make the surface go matt</em>! That certainly convinced me that finish was the way to go most of the time.</p>

<hr>

<p>*Exceptions would be very dense, naturally oily or resinous woods. The kind of woods that don't float in water. But I must mention that most of these are from the tropics and many are now restricted because of rarity and in an attempt to curb illegal logging.</p>

"Designing and Building a Through-Leg Table","135","","<p>A popular, modern style of table has the legs going through the table top, so that the end grain of the leg is exposed. Of course, the problem with this design immediately becomes the expansion and contraction of the table top, which would push and pull against the legs. An example of this style is the <a href=""https://www.crateandbarrel.com/big-sur-natural-dining-tables/f6529"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Big Sur"" dining table at Crate and Barrel</a>. I've found one other discussion of the style on the web, and people were convinced manufacturers were using cleverly disguised plywood. I have seen the Big Sur table in person, and I can tell you with complete certainty that the tabletop is solid wood. </p>

<p>Looking under the table, there are kerfs approximately 5 inches apart, which I assume are to allow for expansion. The bottom of the tabletop is reinforced with metal brackets screwed into place. I assume this is to strengthen the tabletop due to the weakness introduced by the kerfs. The kerfs do not go all the way through the tabletop, so I assume expansion would still be a problem. Additionally, there is a 1/8"" gap between the table top and the legs, which I assume is there to allow for additional expansion, but would probably also harbor food crumbs.</p>

<p>I have never heard of kerfing the bottom of a tabletop before. Is this a thing? Am I interpreting the design correctly? My wife and I, who rarely agree on anything, both like the aesthetics of the table. I've talked about custom building one but I'm having second thoughts. Is the table stable or is it just a bad design?</p>
","<p>Make the top from carefully selected quartersawn stock in a species known for low movement and you can go ahead with a table like this and not worry greatly about expansion and contraction.</p>

<p>There's a fairly simple (and much cheaper!) alternative and that is to have the short rails float or be an easy sliding fit in the mortises on the legs. The top would still be attached to these rails in a conventional manner but it leaves the front and rear leg assemblies free to move in and out as needed through the seasons.</p>

<p>Probably either would be fine. </p>

<p>As it sits currently all you'd need to do to make a firm connection would be to glue and fix the joint. You could even fix it with nails but I'll discount those :-)</p>

<p><strong>Screws</strong><br>
One screw is probably sufficient given the nature of the installation, but use two side by side if you feel the extra strength is needed. </p>

<p>You need to drill clearance and pilot holes first of course. Then after lightly sanding the mating surfaces to ensure a good glue bond, glue the joint and drive the screw/screws in. </p>

<p>No need for clamps as the screws will supply the clamping force.</p>

<p>If you want to make the glue joint a little more secure you could <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/840/gluing-end-grain/851#851"">size</a> the end grain surface prior to applying the main bonding glue. </p>

<p>Plug the clearance holes with face-grain plugs if you want the fixings to be hidden, but I don't think this is a must-do since the drilled holes will be hard to see given their position.</p>

<p><strong>Dowel</strong><br>
As an alternative to screwing you could use one fat dowel or two narrower ones, again driven in from below into drilled holes. Leave the dowel slightly over-long and it will plug its own hole, simply saw off the excess and pare any remainder with a very sharp chisel until completely flush. </p>

<p>Most of us really have no control over dust in the air ultimately, even if you build a finishing enclosure/tent in your workspace there will always be some*.</p>

<p>Working in a normal room as most of us do you can dust the room carefully, vacuum and then leave for some hours for airborne dust to settle but you'll disturb a bit of it walking into the room, and additionally you can carry some dust in on your body and clothing. This is why in addition to clean rooms professional finishers may also wear a special garment that covers them completely (often including the head) and not their normal clothing which can be loaded with dust.</p>

<p>*Although a tent does go a long way towards reducing the risk nearly to nothing. But then wiping your varnish on practically eliminates the problem anyway, without having the hassle or taking up any valuable floor space.</p>

<p>No guarantee but I think it could be stable enough if you use thick ply (3/4"" / 19mm or better) and if the joints are made very neatly for a good fit. Ideally I'd want to see a brace lower down on the legs but I assume that won't be possible with the bike trainer in the way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, what tools would I need to cut the holes an shape the interlocking parts that sticks up from the legs.</p>

<p>This is the bad news, that you're asking the question probably indicates you don't already own suitable tools for the job and are practised enough in using them. For furniture like this to be firm and stable the slots need to be cut quite accurately, if too tight the pieces simply won't go together. But too loose and it'll wobble.</p>

<p>There are numerous ways of cutting the ply for something like this, and many guides out there will assume a table saw is available! You could do this entirely using hand tools (panel saw, drill and files or sandpaper) but it would be much easier with a jigsaw and a power drill. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you're unfamiliar with modern plywood most common stuff (and some supposedly better than this) is not very well made, and there can be numerous voids inside and possibly irregular interior plies. These don't necessarily affect strength in any noticeable way, but it can make the exposed edges uglier than you'd prefer. </p>

<p>If you look closely at the first image you posted there's a black line near the bottom of the front-right corner, that's a void. Some boards can have many of these unfortunately and you may want to fill them to improve looks. This is not at all hard to do but it's an additional step that many step-by-step guides don't mention.</p>

","<p>First off the bad news, that's almost certain to crack on you as it dries out. You might get lucky in which case you dodged a bullet, but the wood already has natural defects radiating from the centre and it is from there that many natural cracks arise.</p>

<p>To help lessen the risk of cracking the first thing you should do when you get it home is coat the flats with something to slow moisture loss. And the best thing you could use for this is melted wax. Doesn't matter how you get it on there, just apply it in a thick layer to both sides (one side at a time will keep the mess to a minimum). I wouldn't use a brush for this because it might be impossible to clean the wax residue from the brush, so improvise something else — a wad of paper towel held in tongs will work perfectly.</p>

It depends on many factors, the species being one of the major ones, but there is a lot of variation possible even with one type of tree.

"Cutting dressed pine to make it narrower","130","","<p>Is there any issue with cutting along the edge as shown in the image in order to change the dimensions to 110 x 19 x 2400? What will the edge look like? Different to if I cut the long edge (2400mm)?</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>What will the edge look like? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It'll look like a sawn face usually looks, based on the wood type (the original cut of the board as well as the species) and the type of saw used. </p>

<p>The second point is more involved than it might at first appear. As this is a rip cut a rip saw will make a <em>much</em> cleaner cut than a crosscut or other saw doing the same cut, but the TPI of the saw is a big factor in either case. Additionally, traditional European saws<sup>1</sup> tend to leave a rougher surface than Japanese-style saws made for the same purpose (due to completely different tooth geometry). </p>

<p>So to answer the question again in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>If done using a European-style rip saw, it'll look sawn and require a fair amount of cleanup.</li>
<li>If done using a Japanese-style rip saw it'll still look sawn but generally a lot smoother, requiring far less cleanup.</li>
</ul>

<p>A further question from the Comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I cut along this edge what will I have to do to make the surface look the same as the current surface and is it possible without a mill or some other expensive machinery?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can do this by sawing and then sanding (working through the grits from coarse to fine). Although I wouldn't recommend this approach<sup>2</sup> it will get you to where you need to be if it's the only option open to you. If you go this way I would recommend quickly making up an edge-sander<sup>3</sup> which will not only help you sand square to the face of the board it will also help keep the sanded edge straight.</p>

<p>However, do be aware that doing the initial saw cut is probably more challenging than you realise ...it's quite difficult even for a pro to do very straight 2m+ saw cuts, even if using a rip saw and not a modern general-purpose panel saw. </p>

<p>And before you start sawing make sure to do your initial marking up/layout with care, on both faces and both ends of the board, ideally using a marking gauge.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> Modern 'hardpoint' saws (saws with impulse-hardened teeth) can have modified geometry that is not like those of the textbook teeth in Western woodworking, some with features inspired by Asian saws.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> I would either do it entirely by planing (using more than one plane by preference, although all the work can in theory be done with a single no. 4) or, saw the bulk of the unneeded portion off and then flatten and smooth the edge with a plane. </p>

"Exterior glue for tapered plugs","128","","<p>[Updated - see pictures below]</p>

<p>I treat joinery in the UK for rot by drilling 10mm holes, injecting fungicide gel, and hammering home a tapered cross-grain oak plug to seal the hole. I've been using exterior-grade PVA smeared on the inside of the hole to fix the plug. After hammering home, I immediately plane the plug flat, while the joint should still be open. After 24 hours, I apply a conventional exterior paint finish.</p>

<p>Revisiting a property I treated 6 years ago, I see that about 25% of the oak plugs have moved enough to crack the paint finish. Not one plug has come loose, but some have moved enough to crack the paint, and that is unsightly, and will let in water. I'd like to fix the plugs more reliably to avoid this. The glue has to work in the UK, which can be hot, wet or freezing.</p>

<p>I asked Loctite if they could recommend anything. They said they weren't sure anything they had would be better than PVA. I need an easy-to-use glue, since I insert thousands of these plugs, often working at height outdoors on old buildings. It's hard to experiment, since all the plugs look great for a long time after the painting. I'd prefer to have just one visit for glue-and-plane-flat, without having to wait for the glue to cure.</p>

<p>What glue can I use? Or what better plugging process can I use?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> two days later, following great suggestions from answer and comments:</p>

<p>Here is a close-up picture of paint cracking at oak plugs in 2016. These are oak plugs hammered into an oak frame and glued with with pva in 2010. The frame was made about 1939. Actually what species of oak was used for plugs or frame is not known. The paint is Dulux weathershield Exterior high gloss over Dulux weathershield undercoat (I think this was just after the shift from old-style high-VOC paint to low-VOC paint, and before the takeover by AzkoNobel, but I may be mistaken).</p>

<p>Looking closely, I can't see any evidence there that the plugs have moved out of the holes. It is, as others have suggested, paint cracking at the boundary between the woods, despite the fact that the grain is aligned and the woods are vaguely the same. So my plea for better glue is not useful.</p>

<p>I found it hard to take photos of plugs that haven't cracked because they're so hard to see! Here's just one:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wYXIA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wYXIA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I have a suspicion that the reason that did not crack is there may be a smear of epoxy over it. That plug is oak in softwood. The softwood had major rot, and I filled a big hole nearby with <a href=""https://www.repair-care.co.uk/products"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Repair Care Dry Fix and Dry Flex"">Repair Care Dry Fix and Dry Flex</a> 4-pack epoxy. That sticks very strongly to wood and flexes with it, and a smear might well stop the cracking.</p>

<p>@bowlturner suggested that different woods might be to blame. I did start off long ago trying to match plug wood to frame wood, despite having to custom-make all the plugs. But I gave up because the softwood plugs tended to break up as they were hammered in. They need to be pretty strong to stand up to the insertion process, especially halfway up a building in a gale. It may well be true that oak in softwood tends to crack paint more than oak in oak. But oak in oak does crack too.</p>

<p>@Graphus suggests filler. The only filler I have found that does not crack with time (and I hope that means decades) is the Repair Care 4-pack system. That would probably work, but the setting time is such that the fungicide gel will probably leak out before I can get the hole filled. I would have to plug the hole and leave a gap at the surface to fill - I will think about that.</p>

<p>Much thanks to everyone for the ideas! Keep them coming if anyone has anything more. Meanwhile, I will tick the answer from Graphus because it contains much wisdom.</p>
","<p>I don't think there's anything you can do to completely prevent this on the wood front. </p>

<p>I'm tempted to recommend something like Cascamite or Aerolite as alternative adhesives, but I'm not at all certain these extremely strong and reliable glues would prevent the problem entirely. I don't believe it's about the glue, I suspect it's to do with a minor difference in movement in the wooden members and the plugs, the shallowness of the plug making it more prone to swelling and shrinkage than the surrounding thicker wood. </p>

<p>If this is the case thicker plugs might help resolve the issue, assuming it would be possible to create them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'd prefer to have just one visit for glue-and-plane-flat, without having to wait for the glue to cure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm only theorising here but I think you should leave room for the possibility that this could be partly to blame and that you'd get better results using the glue you're currently using if you waited for it to set before planing flush.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or what better plugging process can I use?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously filler is an option since you're painting but this is still a tricky one as some people report great results with certain fillers (e.g. epoxy wood compounds or Swedish putty) while others say no matter what they used the filling can eventually show itself. I've read this in the context of exterior woodworking, doors and such, as well as on interior applications in MDF.</p>

<p>Perhaps the paint itself is the thing to look at? A six-year service life before cracking defects show up seems short to me, but realistically that's close to the ~10 years you can expect from most exterior coatings. There are certainly higher-performance paints or 'coating systems' but they do tend to cost a bit more, read: they cost an arm and a leg!</p>

  <p>So, how do I finish to get a perfect flat surface, and no ""steps"" where the paint begins and starts?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Build up a sufficient number of layers of finish that they go over the paint thickly enough, so that once you wet-sand to flatten off the surface you don't 'break through' the clear coating and begin to remove any paint. </p>

<p>This would typically require at least three full-strength coats but you'll need to experiment to establish how many you need to apply over the painting you've done. As the Comment above from keshlam has already indicated, painting as thinly as possible would be a very good starting point. The flatter you can make the painted decorations the fewer coats of clear finish you'll need to apply, if there is some raised texture in the brushstrokes in the paint it may require something like 5-7 coats.</p>

<p>One thing to do some research on, I believe that as thin a layer of finish as needed to get the right colour or surface finish is the goal for most luthiers.

"My drill bit is randomly forcing itself forward","127","","<p>As I am drilling in wood my drill bit tends to grab the wood and launch forward. Never had this happen before. I go in a back and forth motion and am not forcing or nothing. Why is it doing this and how can I prevent it? It creates many chips in the wood.</p>
","<p>Because you're working with a softwood like pine there's one very simple explanation here.</p>

<p>The majority of hardwoods are quite uniform in density and drill fairly predictably as a result, but almost all softwoods have soft earlywood (the pale part of the grain) and <em>much</em> harder latewood (the darker stripes). </p>

<p>This means the material is alternately hard, soft, hard, soft so it's not hard to visualise how, depending on the grain orientation, a drill bit can be working more slowly and then suddenly jump forward when it reaches a softer patch of earlywood. This can be very disconcerting and the loss of control in the drill will often lead to rougher holes than you'd like. This is one reason of many I generally drill all holes in softwood by hand, using twist bits or brad-and-spur bits in a hand drill (eggbeater type) and for larger holes a swing brace. I enjoy using vintage hand tools anyway, but the greater control offered by drilling at speeds makes it much easier to deal with this sort of thing.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When gluing any joint, I was told that there should be some squeeze out to ensure that adequate glue was used. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually yes, but not always with M&amp;T joints. </p>

<p>Squeeze-out is vital for a panel glue-up as an indicator that enough glue was spread on the joints, but with a M&amp;T you can get a good glue joint with zero excess coming out of the joint if you leave a little headspace for excess glue to collect in. So it's common advice now to form your mortises slightly deeper than the length of your tenons. </p>

<p>In theory yes, but in practice if it needed to it would probably pop those glue joints. </p>

<p>One tip that can help with this potential worry is to pre-finish the panels. This is generally a good idea anyway as during the driest months the unfinished edges of a panel can peek out if finishing was doing after assembly (see first image in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2813/should-i-finish-before-during-or-after-assembly/2815#2815"">this previous Answer</a>).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Is there a more correct way to set down a hand plane? What is the best way to store a hand plane?</p>
","<p>""Lay your plane on it's side son.""</p>

<p>This is the long-standing advice. It is old, nobody knows how old, but many (most?) now don't do this, some to deliberately buck Old Timer advice (which can often seem folksy and overly cautious*) but some because they've thought through the problem and come to a definite conclusion not to.</p>

<p>The evidence is in and it appears that you don't need to set a hand plane down on its side and I think the majority no longer do this. But it's still worth looking into it a little and see whether it might be good advice, as it apparently once was.</p>

<p><strong>Why you should</strong><br>
The usual explanation given for why you should do this is to prevent damage to the cutter, and at first glance this does seem to make sense. But then you think about it a bit and realise that the edge of this cutter is (repeatedly, and at speed!) going to be asked to run over wood much like you were about to place it down on and you're not worried about it being damaged by that. So it sort of doesn't make sense. </p>

<p>But then you think about it just a little further — a benchtop is not the same as the wood you are working. Its surface is older, maybe scarred from use (look at old benches and their tops are often in horrible shape, even in really good workshops producing quality stuff) and all those imperfections might hold untold horrors when it comes to abrasive particles from many possible sources. I wouldn't want to risk the finely honed edge of a plane iron on that, much less risk picking up some grit on the sole of the plane (lubricated as they were with oil or grease) which could be transferred to the workpiece.</p>

<p><strong>Why you shouldn't</strong><br>
One reason given for why we shouldn't do this now is that the old advice comes from an era when planes were made from wood with an iron very firmly held by a wedge, and so they retained lateral adjustment much better than metal bench planes with the usual mechanism. So, the thinking goes, any of the standard Bailey-style metal planes may lose lateral adjustment if laid on their side. </p>

<p>I find this superficial thinking and unsatisfying because of course many generations of users of metal planes <em>were</em> following the old advice by rote and dutifully laying their planes on their side and obviously weren't experiencing problems with lateral adjustment being thrown off. We can know this with some certainty because if it had been occurring regularly we'd have heard about the risk through the anecdotal sources and it would be immortalised in print in at least some of the books, and yet both are silent on this possibility. Well, until now and the easy spread of oddball ideas through the Internet!</p>

<p>Another reason given is that a plane laid on its side exposes the sole with the iron projecting slightly and this poses a danger to knuckles etc. accidentally bumped into or passing by the plane as you reach for something. This is much more convincing. I've nearly cut myself in just this way so it's not merely a theoretical danger.</p>

<p><strong>The bottom line for a lot of us</strong><br>
More than a few current woodworking gurus using hand planes, with both wood and metal bodies, don't lay their planes on their sides and haven't done for many decades <em>and have never had an iron's edge become damaged as a result</em>. </p>

<p>Since most of us will be using our planes far, far less then they will and in a similar working environment (clean, or at least cleanish, indoor workshops) it's a fairly safe bet that you can safely follow suit.</p>

<p><strong>But....</strong><br>
However, if you work on building sites and the surface you lay your plane down on might be contaminated with who-knows-what dust, metal particles and random specs of grit from many possible sources then it only makes sense to be more cautious and lay your planes on their sides. </p>

<p>Working at home you can follow the old advice and lay your planes on their sides if you want to, regardless of your reasoning, but I would caution to lay them down the the sole facing away from the side(s) of the bench you commonly stand at. Or lay it in your tool tray if you have one.</p>

"Tungsten Carbide grades","121","","<p>A lot of different tools from saw blades to router bits use different carbide ""C"" grades. I read and there are types like C2, C3, K10. What is the difference between all these? A description on each would be great if there is a difference. </p>
","<p>Regarding C1, C2, ... C6 carbide grades, higher numbers mean harder, but at the same time more brittle. C1 carbide cuts softer metals like aluminum and C6 carbide cuts hardest metals like steel.</p>

<p>What is important for woodworking is that the carbide grade doesn't make much difference when cutting wood, if any. I tend to prefer lower carbide grades, because if I drop a router bit or a saw blade accidentally, it is more likely to survive the impact, because the cutters are less brittle.</p>

"Working with Wenge or Purpleheart","121","","<p>I'm looking into creating a jewelry box for a ring and I am trying to decide on which wood to use. I am stuck between either using Wenge or Purpleheart, I have heard that Wenge can cause an allergic reaction akin to poison ivy but I haven't heard anything about Purpleheart. I am also wondering which wood would be easier to work with and which will finish better, I am trying to achieve a very dark finish. Any pro's and con's of working with each wood? </p>

<p>(I am a beginner and really only have a jigsaw and hand tools for working with the wood.)</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I have heard that Wenge can cause an allergic reaction akin to poison ivy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure what you read or where, but you wouldn't expect this upon first exposure. This kind of reaction would be for people with either a built up sensitivity to wenge or with an existing sensitivity. It's little to worry about unless you fall into either of these two camps.</p>

<p>You do want to take precautions about the wenge dust however. Breathing protection is considered a must, and given it is a known irritant I would urge you to be paranoid about it and wear at least a good dust mask <em>every time</em> you work the wood, even if it's just for a couple of minutes. This would be most particularly when using power tools and when sanding. Worth carefully cleaning up the dust afterwards too (while still wearing the dust mask).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am also wondering which wood would be easier to work with </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well purpleheart is significantly harder than wenge, and many people find it difficult to work with as a result<sup>1</sup> but it depends on how you intend to work it and the sharpness of your edges how much difficulty you can expect.</p>

<p>If you're used to working with harder woods you should have few surprises. </p>

<p>If you're used to working in pine however their hardness might come as a bit of a shock! They'll also be much more splintery than you're used to. Sharp edges are a must and expect jobs to take longer. You may even find you need to stop more frequently to hone edges due to their blunting effect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and which will finish better</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's really up to you more than anything. They're both hard, dense hardwoods so inherently will finish well. </p>

<p>I suppose the real issue in either case is whether the open grain structure is something undesirable for the piece in question, but that's easily tackled with grain filler so warnings about this making finishing difficulty are basically an irrelevance IMO — grain fill, problem solved.</p>

<p>Regardless of grain filling there are users of both wenge and purpleheart who are more than happy with the way they look after they've finished them and if they can do it it's likely you can too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am trying to achieve a very dark finish</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that's all you require then there's no real need to use either of these woods<sup>2</sup>. A dark colour, all the way to black, can be achieved on any wood with staining and/or the use of a coloured overcoat. </p>

<p>You could make the job a lot easier for yourself by using something softer and simply colouring it dark. Hard maple/sugar maple seems like a good candidate, as would black walnut, but you could even start with poplar if it's not too soft for you.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> FWIW I've seen the opinion expressed that ""it's not a beginner wood"") </p>

<p><sup>2</sup> If you want to push yourself and have a bit of a challenge then by all means use either wenge or purpleheart for this, but if that's not one of the things you're looking for here then save yourself some hassle and pick something softer.</p>

"How can I design a large speaker cabinet to come together square and true when my panels aren't flat and my boards aren't straight?","120","","<p>This question differs from similar questions about wood warping because I'm not asking how to straighten a warped board nor how to fix an existing design that warped.  Rather I'm asking how do you design at the outset for a large enclosure to come together square and true even if the boards and panels you have available are not straight or flat.  I'm also wanting to know if there is an order of assembly that will maximize accuracy or minimize how much correcting force is needed.  For instance, one strategy might be to lay the largest side flat and build up on it.  An alternate strategy might be to start with a section of the innermost bracing that I <em>can</em> make square and true (using the best pieces I have) and build out from that seed.</p>

<p>This is for a large speaker enclosure approximately 2' wide, 3' deep, and 5' tall, but I think the question could apply to any piece of similar size and construction.  The materials I have are 7/16"" OSB panels and 2"" x 3"" douglas fir studs.</p>

<p>(A more usual choice for speaker enclosures would be 3/4"" MDF for panels and bracing, but if I can build it with OSB it will save a lot on material cost.  Moreover the size of the speakers is such that you can't get enough stiffness by just using thicker panels; either panel material will still need bracing every 8"" or so.  Rest assured I am still using MDF for the actual panel the speaker drivers bolt to, but due to the type of speaker design these MDF panels will be internal walls, not external.  (These internal MDF panels form the ""inner box"" I was talking about that I can make most accurate in size/shape.))</p>

<p>I'm planning to rip some of the 2x3's to make 1.5""x1.25"" battens.  I know that if I take two panels that do not lay flat, and join them at 90 degrees with a batten, the joined edge will be straight assuming the panels were cut straight.  I also know that a 2x3 that is warped over a long length is ""less"" warped if cut into short sections.  So perhaps breaking the battens into sections is a good idea?  However in any case, when building from the skin to the inside, I think there is still the possibility that panels fixed in 2 dimensions will have warping in the 3rd unfixed dimension?  (E.g. they might bow in or balloon out even though the edges meet.)</p>

<p>The way I've most seen recommended online is build a skeleton or matrix and attach panels to it.  In this method, keeping the 2x3's in long sections would ease construction and assembly, but I'd be worried about getting to the end and discovering an irreconcilable difference in shape between the skeleton and the skin.  Not to mention differences in expansion, and resonance in the long boards.</p>

<p>I also thought about making a large number of ""pre-fab"" pieces to use to assemble the enclosure like Lego bricks.  These would be C-shaped and rectangle-shaped biscuit joined studs with OSB triangles nailed and glued on top of the corners.  I am not sure, however, whether these would take too long to construct, and also worry about building them to a designed size and finding out the actual size needed is different during assembly.</p>

<p>So, to recap:  how do I make a straight object out of wood that is not straight?  Should I start assembly with the longest edges / largest panels or smaller parts first?  Is it better to break the design up into an assemblage of short pieces joined together, or to frame it with some of the straightest studs to make a basis for the shape?</p>
","<p>In my view this is a question of ""Do I control my materials or do they control me"". Your concern that your warped pieces may not meet well is valid. Every project should begin with a plan for what you intend to achieve and then constructed accordingly.  Your idea in the fourth paragraph is a good strategy.  Begin by assembling the framework for your boxes and then cut and fit the skin to apply to it and meet the edges accordingly.  If the sheeting is a bit warped it should be possible to flatten it when securing it firmly to the batten frame.  If the sheathing is too warped then discard it and use sheets that will fit correctly.  Trying to use materials that are not flat enough to maintain the planes of the exterior surfaces is asking for headaches and future problems.</p>

"Leaving counterbore holes unfinished on exterior projects","120","","<p>I hope this is clear. So part of an outdoor project I'm working on has a thing like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AlETz.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AlETz.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Those are all 2x4's.</li>
<li>The vertical piece on the left is joined with pocket holes, not shown, not relevant.</li>
<li>The blue/gray areas are 3/8"" diameter counterbore holes, about 1.75"" depth.</li>
<li>The red things are epoxy coated deck screws.</li>
<li>All faces including the ends are finished.</li>
<li>The very bottom piece is pressure-treated fir, finished with exterior grade primer + latex paint.</li>
<li>The other two pieces (the vertical and the piece with the holes) are untreated fir, finished with oil-based stain + exterior grade spar urethane.</li>
<li>The holes face up; water could theoretically sit in them.</li>
<li>All the pieces shown in the diagram are flush and you're looking at the wide faces of the 2x4's; there's no secret depth component to that drawing aside from the holes being drilled on the centerline of the wood.</li>
</ul>

<p>My problem is this: I did drill the counterbore holes before finishing, but I didn't really get any urethane down into the holes. I put the whole thing together, then it rained, then it occurred to me that rain can get into the counterbore holes, where it comes into contact with raw wood. I observed that the water beaded up just fine on the finished surfaces, but soaked into the wood in the holes.</p>

<p>Now, my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do I really need to seal up these holes? As in, do I really <em>need</em> to? Of course we don't want water soaking into the wood but given the relative size of the hole, and the fact that it doesn't rain <em>constantly</em> (i.e. there's time to dry, except in the winter if snow piles on), will I truly regret not finishing the holes?</p></li>
<li><p>For hole B, it's pretty easy to do regardless. I could fill it with putty, sanding the finish off the top a bit for the putty to bind, then refinish that area. So regardless of question #1 I'll probably still do hole B.</p></li>
<li><p>For hole A, this is actually the one I'm more concerned about. There doesn't appear to be a gap between the vertical piece and the horizontal but I wouldn't trust it to be water tight. The problem is I <em>really don't want to disassemble that corner to fill in the hole</em>, so: Could it still be a problem? Is there another way to seal that up?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The way I figure is, even if water gets in there, it's such a small surface area that it will eventually even out through the surrounding wood and ultimately dry back out through the hole.</p>

<p>For deep counterbore holes on exterior projects exposed to rain, is the effect of not finishing the inside of the hole negligible in the long run? If not, what will happen? What can I expect to see in a few years?</p>
","<p>You might wait until its pretty dry, and use some exterior caulk. You can fill hold B, and seal around the bottom of the stud on top of hole A.</p>

<p>Not sure what this is for, but yes, over time moisture will be able to wick into the end grain through the holes.</p>

<p>No it probably won't be drastic, or even noticeable for awhile.</p>

<p>The absence of that board might not be the sole contributing factor. The choice of plywood will also play a large role in this.

<p>A lesser point would be if these were hand-me-downs or constructed just for you. If the former, where they were stored would be important. </p>

","<p>A router is overkill for doing a very slight roundover like this, although it will do the job well and very repeatably of course once you've dialled in the setting on the router or the router table. </p>

<p>As already described well in the Answer from @rob, you can do this sort of thing very well with a hand plane*, followed by light sanding with finer paper (whatever your finishing grit is). But not everyone has a hand plane or wants to get one so it's important to mention that you can do this simply by sanding alone. </p>

<p>This is one of the few times I'd recommend sanding as a viable shaping technique, but here it's appropriate since it's such an easy thing to do and it gives such good results. On an edge like this perhaps two passes with 80 or 100 grit paper (using a soft block or with the paper backed just by your fingers) followed by a couple of passes with 150 or 180 paper will give you very even, consistent results just about any time you need it. </p>

<p>No setup involved, just a few moments' work and after a quick dust off you're ready to apply finish.</p>

<p>*Doesn't have to be a block plane, they're just handy because they can be used one-handed with the work held by the other hand. Mind your knuckles doing this on narrow stock!</p>

"How to neaten holes in plywood with hand tools?","119","","<p>I'm making window apertures in 12mm plywood (it's birch-faced) for a doll's house.  I'd like the window and door holes to be neat.   I could use a router for this and then chisel the corners square, but I'd prefer a less noisy approach (I mostly only have time to work on this in the evenings and don't want to wake my kids up).</p>

<p>The edges of the plywood I've carefully squared with a No. 5 plane, and that has worked well, but of course that's not practical for small holes as the plane won't fit.</p>

<p>Would a rasp (then filing or sanding) do the job?   Or would it tear out the birch facing?   If yes for the rasp, what type would be a good choice (I don't own any, else I could have tried it out instead of asking).</p>
","<p>A rasp probably won't give you the smooth edge you're seeking, even a fine hand-stitched one (very expensive) or one of the superior machine-stitched rasps (usually much cheaper but not always) that work as well. Rasps are superb tools and capable of surprisingly accurate work but they're for faster removal, not for the finest finish. </p>

<p>If you want to do this using a similar tool one or more files would be a better choice. This is a gross oversimplification but a double-cut file will cut faster but leave a coarser surface and a single-cut file will leave a smoother surface.</p>

<p>If you don't currently own any files I can highly recommend them for working wood. For now though you can do without — simply glue some abrasive paper to strips of wood (paint stirring sticks are very popular for this if you have a source) and use them as you would use a file*. </p>

<p>In addition to being super-cheap these 'sandpaper files' have an advantage over real files in that they can be used on both the push and pull strokes (the teeth on files only cut properly on the push stroke) <em>but note that working the edge of plywood you'll mostly want to confine yourself to push strokes only</em>, stroking downwards or away from the surface. If you stroke backwards you risk lifting flakes of the face veneer which can be impossible to neaten up properly. You can stroke sideways as well, but the exact orientation of the grain in the veneer relative to the cut edge will dictate how well this works.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is a common tip for working plywood and it applies here as well, it's very helpful to strongly knife your marked lines beforehand. If the knife cut is deep it can completely sever the fibres of the face veneer virtually eliminating tearout if you're careful.</p>

<hr>

<p>*As an alternative to this you could use emery boards of course which are much the same thing, but you're limited to a fairly small size and to some extent the range of grits available.</p>

"How to repair a chip when one piece is already partially finished?","118","","<p>A small chip came off the surface of my piece when I was removing it from the rough stock. (I foolishly removed the piece, which I had just finished CNC'ing, from its rough stock by pressing it, rather than carefully cutting the tabs away - never again!)</p>

  <p>What should I have done to get the chip to match the piece? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best fix hands-down for something like this is to glue the chip back into place. Assuming the chip can be located of course. </p>

<p>It is important however to strive not to get glue onto the surface of the chip as you're glueing it back in, as it leads to the classic problem associated with glue-contaminated wood when it comes time to finish.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was thinking of rubbing the chip's top surface briefly with mineral oil before the gluing, but I was worried that might weaken the bond.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You were right to be worried, <em>any</em> oil contamination of glueing surfaces severely compromises the bond.</p>

<hr>

<p>Where using the original chip is not possible (the chip can't be found or it has been damaged so it won't neatly slot into place any longer) glueing in a piece of the same species would be next best, striving to get a good grain match to the wood in that location. Where the divot in the wood is an irregular shape it can be difficult to get a good edge on a patch so often it's advisable to create a patch with a regular shape (a diamond with the long dimension pointing along the grain is often recommended) and then chiselling out wood to match that. In this case you'd just use a triangle.</p>

<p>If you must use a filler probably the best filler is one made from sanding dust and glue. Now this tip is very common and often in the next breath the person recommending it will say it gives a good colour match*, but generally it does <em>not</em> make a good colour match to the surrounding wood (almost invariably it's darker) and it doesn't stain or finish well (almost invariably ending up lighter). However this can work much better than it normally does: if hide glue is used. </p>

<p>*Some people recommending the wood dust + glue tick may be using hide glue and are just unaware that it makes such a big difference in the outcome, compared to using regular PVA-type wood glues, epoxy or superglue, so they don't know to specify that that is the adhesive they're using.</p>

  <p>When is [spalting] good for the wood and when isn't it good?</p>

<p>Spalting can provide a lovely patterning to wood that would otherwise be more plain.  Please see the image below for an example of spalted maple.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fz8vCm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fz8vCm.jpg"" alt=""spalted maple""></a><br>
<sup>(<a href=""http://www.craftsy.com/blog/2014/11/working-with-spalted-wood/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>)</sup></p>

<p>Maple is usually otherwise fairly plain-looking (assuming it's not figured maple), and the spalting provides a bit of interest in an otherwise plain-grained wood.</p>

<hr>

<p>The problem with spalting is that it's a fungal attack on the wood fibers.  It's fine when the fungus only has superficially attacked the wood and has really only added coloration.  However, if left too long, the fungus can break down the wood fibers, making the wood spongy, punky, and rotten.  If you're expecting the wood to last, rot is of course a bad thing.  Also, punky wood is much harder to work since it has a tendency to crumble.</p>

<p>If you were working on a project where you expected consistent, even grain, having spalting in a piece of wood would be detrimental.  For example, if you wanted clear maple and it had a streak of spalting, that would not be good.</p>

","<p>A suggestion of perhaps the wrong tool but a good result nonetheless. A milling machine uses end mills for removing material both from the sides and bottom of a work piece. It is a very bad idea to use an end mill in a drill press to remove material from the sides of a work piece, but not as bad to use an end mill in a drill press to remove material from the bottom. The ""bad"" part is due to side loads on the drill press, which isn't a factor when using only the end of the mill.</p>

"Table Saw Bevel Maths?","114","","<p>I'm looking to make Triangular &amp; Hexagonal shelves, but I'm getting confused by some of the maths involved for the bevels. To make a hexagon I need a 120 degree angle, but I need 2 pieces to make that angle, so I do: 120/2 = 60 degrees each. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7zhv.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7zhv.png"" alt=""Hexagon""></a>
So I would think that I can set my bevel gauge to 60 degrees on my table saw (Hypothetically, I'm aware that my bevel doesn't go that far and that I can use a jig to hold the workpeice vertically to do the complement of 30 degrees, effectively making it 60 degrees)</p>

<p>I'm having similar issues for the equilateral triangle shelves. I've seen people cut their straight stock at a 30 degree bevel and wind up with angles that don't look right, such as:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8rhwC.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8rhwC.png"" alt=""Triangular Shelf""></a></p>

<p>Here, you see that the shelf is not assembled at the edges, and is instead on the face. This doesn't look right to me, and seems to imply that the person didn't know how to cut the angles properly. I've seen proper bevels cut and they look really nice, even at non 90 degree bevels, such as this one from Foureyes:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/knz0c.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/knz0c.png"" alt=""Foureyes Bevel""></a></p>

<p>How can I resolve these issues? What bevel should I cut my straight stock on, so that I can make these shapes?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 0: In general, if I want to cut a 30 degree angle in Cartesian space, do I set my bevel gauge to 30 degrees?</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1: Stranger yet, I've seen the hexagons be cut at a 30 degree bevel by this video (<a href=""https://youtu.be/_sQzIbgQjig?t=38"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://youtu.be/_sQzIbgQjig?t=38</a>), and my intuition tels me that a transformation function is used to convert between Cartesian space and table saw bevel space. He needed a 60 degree angle in Cartesian space so he took the compliment of 60 degrees and obtained an angle of 30 degrees, and this is what he set his table saw to. Is this thinking correct?</strong></p>
","<p>Does it help to think about it backwards (and tongue in cheek)?</p>

<p>Use your equilateral triangular shelf as a starting point. Pretend Ms. Plato, a retired carpenter down the street has gifted you with the perfect wooden equilateral triangle of boards like your photo (rather than lines with no width). Unlike the picture, Ms Plato's joints are so precise and perfectly finished that you can't detect where the boards came together. She may have used a piano-black, high gloss finish (<a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/756/how-do-i-achieve-a-piano-black-high-gloss-finish-on-wood"">How do I achieve a &quot;piano black&quot; high gloss finish on wood?</a>) or not.</p>

<p>Those boards in the finished triangle actually form <em>two</em> triangles, with a larger triangle formed by the junctions of the outer faces of the boards used, and a smaller ""concentric"" inner triangle where the inner faces meet. </p>

<p>Now, you've been allowed to choose a medium quality crosscut saw: Japanese or ""European"" being your choice. Here's where it gets dirty. You're going to saw apart that ideal triangle. The only rules are a) that you need to use a Moxon vise constructed from a YouTube video and b) you have to start sawing in a straight line at each vertex on the inner triangle. For example, when you start sawing at inner vertex B (with your labeling preference) you can point that Dozuki in any direction you like to make the cut. (You're not allowed to have a ""hook"" after the cut :)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NlXxy.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NlXxy.jpg"" alt=""A perfect triangle with cut options""></a></p>

<p>Notice that after making a cut from each vertex and sweeping up the sawdust that you have three pieces of wood. The angles on the end of those boards are probably all different. Maybe Steve Ramsey would call it ""funkily"" different. The only thing that appears to be true upon measuring is that the angles of adjoining faces add up to 60 degrees, and that happens for each of the three junctions you have. </p>

<p>You and I would probably like the 30-degreeers best, but not everyone would share our aesthetic. If people think the way we do and were building that triangle, they'd probably setup a table saw to cut those 30 degree angles, using all the real-life techniques that woodworkers have in their apron to creep up on the cut, do it accurately and consistently, adjust to minor mistakes etc. But some may prefer the triangle of your photo.</p>

<p>I agree with the ""try it"" gang (see how close you can get to the desired angle, use the 30 + 60 = 90 approach, do a good job dimensioning the boards you'll use, etc.) There are various tools you could use to determine if the angle you cut (afterwards) is what you wanted.</p>

<p>I also suspect for polygons of increasing numbers of faces, mistakes in the degree of the cut for each face would compound more, and maybe a person would say do all but the last face, then evaluate what you had to see what was truly needed for the last face, rather than just cut the ideal.</p>

"Finishing a wooden piece by oiling instead of varnish/paint/lacquer","113","","<p>I have just been making my first guitar over the last few days from scratch and I have just gotten to the point of needing a finish for it. It is a solid body slide guitar. I was wondering if anyone had experience in oiling a whole guitar body instead of varnish. Pros and cons. Any advice? How long between oiling the next time? Any good oils for this?</p>
","<p>I have an old guitar (electric) that had a battered finish. I stripped it completely and used linseed oil to refinish it. I don't think it changed the tone in any noticeable way, and its been fine ever since. That was about 40 years ago. 
Some caveats though:</p>

<p>1) Oil will never give you a really high gloss finish. If that's what you want, use something else. If you want it to look ""natural"" though, oil is great.</p>

<p>2) It should really be regularly maintained, certainly for the first few months. Oil it and oil it again. Keep going till it stops absorbing any more. As I remember it, the rule was every day for a week, every week for a month, every month for a year.</p>

<p>3) Oil finish hardens inside the wood, not on the surface. For flutes it's great. For acoustic guitars, probably not. As far as I know this has never been the method chosen for finishing soundboards. The traditional finish there would be shellac which seals the surface rather than soaks in, and adds as little weight as possible. </p>

<p>4) As others have pointed out, oil offers little protection from scratches. However it often still looks ok, and the finish can very easily be touched up. The finish will never chip or peel off, because it actually becomes part of the wood.</p>

"How to achieve a nice wooden like pattern with a white wash look?","113","","<p>I have some old furniture that I recovered a while ago. It had some missing parts (holes, etc) that I filled with white repair product. I than painted it solid white. </p>

<p>I now want to change it. I would want to give it an old wooden like look. A bit like white wash. How can I achieve this look?</p>
","<p>I'm not certain what look you're after exactly without a pic as guidance but I'll suggest a couple of alternatives. <strong>Note:</strong> in both of the suggested approaches below the filled areas will become visible. </p>

<p>The first approach is to create a look similar to <em>liming</em> and you actually have a good start with the white paint you've already applied. You sand (or otherwise abrade, e.g. using Scotch-Brite or steel wool) until it exposes wood, with the white paint naturally left in the grain and recesses. Here are two examples of the effect:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/I5LAj.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/I5LAj.jpg"" alt=""Limed wood examples""></a></p>

<p>If you're after a more uniform look than this will provide I'm afraid you're in for a lot more work. The first job would be to completely strip the furniture back to bare wood using chemical striper, heat gun + scraper or by sanding (I don't recommend the last method unless it's your only option). </p>

<p>After you're down to bare wood you would then brush on dilute paint, or apply the paint normally and then wipe away the excess with a cloth to leave a thin film. This can give slightly different effects depending on how thin the paint is, the colour of the wood etc. but here are two examples of how it can look:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zRuLD.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zRuLD.jpg"" alt=""Whitewash examples""></a></p>

<p><strong>Protective coating</strong><br>
With either method above it is advisable to apply a surface coating to help protect the furniture: the exposed wood in the first case and the thin, easily-damaged paint in the second case. Normal varnish is quite yellowish and will impart a slight amber tone to the white. If you don't mind the pieces becoming a sort of cream/ivory colour then go with a couple of thin wiped-on coats of regular oil-based polyurethane or other varnish. </p>

<p>To keep the colour as white as possible you need a 'water-white' finish, which in practice means either a waterbased varnish or lacquer. Waterbased poly is probably your simplest and cheapest option here.</p>

<p>Some people apply wax to the surface on this type of thing but it's really a very poor protective layer and I would only recommend it for a light-use item.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/SHdgO57.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>Is that ok or must I stick the router bit as far down the chuck shaft as possible?</p>
","<p>A router bit shaft flexes more than you might think, especially one like you show with a big heavy body and relatively large diameter. Because they spin at high speed, that head carries a very large amount of energy <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_energy"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_energy</a> (note the energy increases with the <em>square</em> of the angular velocity (RPM roughly, probably radians per second in that formula).</p>

<p>The net of it is you don't want that thing working its way out or breaking off because it could do some serious damage if it hit you. Very much like a bullet I would expect.</p>

<p>So best to keep the extended length as short as possible and definitely not cheat the collet by not having the shaft going all the way through it. In a pinch, I'd run at lower speed when the bit is not fully inserted (bottomed and then pulled out 1/16"" or so to accommodate shaft lengthening with heat).</p>

<p>I would recommend replacing the top with something thinner so your tool doesn't encourage bad habits. This sort of thing is easy to forget over time and you don't want it biting you one day when you're not thinking about it.</p>

<p>Also note that collets wear over time. Especially in this case you'll need to make sure it's fitting closely to both the shaft and the spindle taper. In particular, you'll want to ensure the collet has not become ""bell-mouthed"", and that the entire internal collet surface is bearing on the shaft, to maximize the friction that keeps it in place and support the shaft over the entire length of the collet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem is, I don't like the way the cleat looks. I think it looks sloppy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. I think the ideal ways to mount something like this invisibly are to hide the mounting cleats/battens within the overall design, or to use mounts that hide within the vertical parts of the case.</p>

<p>For the latter option there are a few alternatives, but possibly the simplest are keyhole hangers. They are unfortunately not a perfect solution because if you don't get your screws aligned dead on the thing won't hang at all, so you need to be very careful when drilling <em>and driving</em> your screws/hanger bolts because you may have just the one shot to get it right.</p>

<p>Because of this I think keyhole hangers aren't as useful as they seem initially for things that require more than one hanging point.</p>

<p>So back to cleats/battens, they'd look <em>much</em> better if they fit the bookcase perfectly, so no gaps at the sides advertising that it's a cleat and not part of the piece itself, and if the screws weren't on display. So in addition to cutting a new cleat to match the case counterbore your holes and plug 'em!</p>

It gets heavy use and I'm tired of buying a new plastic one every year or so. The last one I got was from Costco and supposedly super heavy-duty. Cost was around $100 US, but it hasn't quite lasted a full two years. </p>

<p>The dimensions needed are approximately 50""x60"", no more than ¾"" think.</p>

<p>What would be good to use to construct it? I'm assuming wood will last much longer, but suspect using solid lumber might be too heavy, although I've read good things about bamboo and it's fairly light (even if not actually wood). That leaves plywood, possibly hardwood-veneered if it would make it last longer (or be advantageous in some other way beside looking nice).</p>

<p>Since appearance isn't high priority, perhaps putting some type of commercial flooring on top be worth the extra trouble? If not, what would be the pros and cons of various finishes? Being able to refinish it easily would be a plus.</p>
","<p>Plywood seems like a good solution here until you look at the material in detail. With modern plywood in particular, in addition to generally not being as well-made as plywood used to be (more voids, junkier wood in the core layers) over the years the surface ply has gotten incrementally thinner, to the point where on some plywood it's now like a sheet of paper.... and about as durable! </p>

<p>Even very good quality cabinet plywood (note: not all ""cabinet grade"" plywood is good) has a fairly thin surface ply of the 'show wood' and wouldn't be made to have the necessary durability. What is made to be durable enough is flooring, where regardless of what's used underneath the wood or bamboo laminate surface is <em>significantly</em> thicker than that on plywood.</p>

<p>So for a high-wear surface if the choice were between plywood and flooring I know which one I'd go with. Since you can't just use the flooring by itself it would need to be mounted on a board material (plywood or OSB) which will make for a very thick 'mat'! I don't know how high the ply is on your carpet but it would need to be in the range of 70s shag carpet for the resulting thickness not to be some issue :-)</p>

<p>Whatever wood/bamboo solution you go with the ideal finish is the same thing you'd use on a floor. A quality floor-grade varnish should give you the same durability you'd have if the carpet weren't there and you were rolling the chair directly on a wood floor.</p>

<p><strong>What about the chair?</strong><br>
There are two things interacting here and you shouldn't look at just one of them. I think you should also examine the castors/casters on your chair. </p>

<p>Castor wheels are made in various materials and harder ones are very wearing of floor surfaces. Modern laminate flooring (which has a very thin resin-reinforced paper surface) wears quickly when hard castors are used, but much better if softer ones are fitted. Regardless of what mat you come up with if the chair's castors are hard it would be worth changing them to a softer type.</p>

<p>The handle doesn't have to be round<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether the handle is turned or hand-shaped it has to eventually be two pieces so that it can be glued around the shaft. Generally you want to start with a single piece of wood, although it's not mandatory it gives you nearly contiguous grain. The handle can be fully shaped and then carefully split, or roughed into a blank, sawn in two and then the two pieces temporarily joined together<sup>2</sup> before shaping is completed. Obviously the second method can be used if two separate pieces are used for whatever reason.</p>

<p><strong>Fix the existing handle</strong><br>
Because the break looks old, and is anyway on something that sees regular hand contact it's not as straightforward as dribbling a little glue into the crack and clamping it closed — for a start because only fresh wood surfaces glue reliably. But add in any contamination from oils from the hands plus shed skin cells, or really any sort of dirt, and those will prevent any adhesive from getting a solid purchase on the wood. </p>

<p>There's an additional possible complication, cracks like this sometimes aren't fully closable. Through a combination of factors the wood may have shrunk to the point that the inside diameter is now too small to close on the shaft of the handle. </p>

<p>So for this reason stabilising the crack by filling it may be the best route. I haven't done this myself on the sweep handle of a brace but a friend did such a repair recently so I've seen one in the flesh and it worked perfectly. It is early days yet (especially given the multi-generation lifespan of such a tool) but some months on it is holding up nicely.</p>

<p>First step in either case is to clean the interior surfaces of the crack starting with gentle scraping of any obvious gunk, using a dental pick maybe, followed by thorough solvent cleaning. I'd start with mineral spirits (UK: white spirit) and then use either denatured alcohol (UK: meths) or acetone. You can scrub with any stiff-bristled brush but one of the best tools for this sort of thing is a toothbrush because the nylon bristles are particularly stiff. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> you can gauge how effective your cleaning has been by placing a drop of water anywhere along the split. If the water soaks straight into the wood you're good to go. If it beads up and soaks in slowly further cleaning would be advisable.</p>

<p>Now mix up some epoxy with sanding dust to a consistency somewhat like mayo, spread it over the crack (overfill slightly) and leave it to harden<sup>3</sup>. Then file, scrape or sand the fill flush with the wood. Follow this by scraping or sanding both handles as much as you care to and finally apply your finish of choice. </p>

<p>Obviously there's a chance the epoxy will stick the wood to the shaft but don't worry about that. My friend managed to carefully work some wax into the gap without getting it on the crack in the wood, but there's no need to go to the trouble. For a start on an old brace the metal is probably pretty filthy to begin with, making a good bond highly unlikely ^_^ But if by chance it does stick firmly enough that the handle won't spin heating the metal using a heat gun or hairdryer is sufficient to cause epoxy's grip to weaken.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How did they put the handle there in the first place?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wondered the same thing and it's something that has perplexed many a brace owner! The answer is very simple once you know it — the wooden handle was slid into place before the brace was fully bent to shape. From what I've read generally the first bend (near the chuck) was done first, the handle slid into position and then the top bends done. </p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup>You could go with hexagonal or octagonal if you wanted to try those out. Either cross-section could be further refined to round if you find you don't like how the polygonal handle feels in use.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Traditionally this was often done using a 'paper joint' which works just as well today as it always has, but these days superglue and tape is an option, see <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2752/how-do-i-temporarily-attach-two-pieces-of-wood-together-for-machining/2757#2757"">How do I temporarily attach two pieces of wood together for machining?</a></p>

<p><sup>3</sup>It is best to wait for it to fully cure before proceeding. Even with 5-minute epoxy I wait 2-3 hours minimum even in the summer, but try to forget about it so it's at least half a day before I get back to it. With 1-hour epoxy I would wait at least six hours for it to set, overnight preferably. In case you don't know epoxy hardens via a chemical reaction and like all reactions it is temperature-sensitive, so in colder weather you need to wait longer than when it's warm.</p>

"Should I use solid color wood stain or paint for my project?","106","","<p>I know questions based on opinion are not too welcomed here and I'm trying to avoid making this look like one.</p>

<p>My situation is this:</p>

<p>I'm building a piece of outdoor patio furniture. For part of that furniture, I want a solid cream color, while the rest of the piece will just use a regular dark wood stain. I also want to keep the solid cream color from chipping and needing to be reapplied every couple of years. I want the piece to be low-maintenance since it is a gift. Because of that last part, I wanted to avoid paint, so I looked into solid-color wood stain.</p>

<p>My concern is this: as it ages, will the cream color become less and less opaque? If it does I am especially concerned about using this solid wood stain because it doesn't seem to be something you can just reapply and I don't want the wood grain to show through. </p>
","<p>Outdoor finishes have a hard job.  They have to withstand weather (rain, snow, etc.), hot and cold temperatures, and the relentless beating of UV radiation from the sun.  People often have unrealistic expectations for outdoor finishes.</p>

<p>Well to be honest I really do not have any other question as of now. But anything that you have to recommend to me with this new planer, since it is my first one. Thanks!</p>
","<ol>
<li><strong>Sharpening the Blade</strong>  I have a similar table top planer (Delta).  The blades are reversible so I use them for a year or until I otherwise notice significant degradation in the surface smoothness.  Flipping the blades takes less than a half hour.  I have been reluctant to sharpen them and find $30 in new blades every couple years is reasonable in my case so I can't offer more insight into this. </li>
<li><strong>The Belt.</strong>  There is no standard size for the belt, it will vary per manufacturer and model.  Your manual should include an exploded parts view that should identify the belt. (or go online).</li>
<li><strong>Greasing the gears.</strong>  I assume you are referring to the leveling gears.  There is no maintenance schedule I am aware of.  Inspect them now and then check annually to verify they are still working well and have sufficient lubricant.</li>
<li><strong>Grain Direction.</strong>  There is no real safety issue with grain direction.  Rather, if the board runs through backwards or sideways there is increased risk  that the cutting edge will raise grain that travels deeper into the board, causing ""tear-out"" in which chips of wood are lifted off of the surface leaving gouges.  If you run the board through in a cross grain direction the blade is more likely to pull out longer wood fibers causing similar surface imperfections.  Running the board with the grain is best, but if you can't, you can reduce the risk of tear-out by making very shallow passes removing very little material in each run.</li>

","<p>Firewood stacks pretty well, so there shouldn't really be any load acting sideways on the upright supports, even with a much wider (longer?) rack. Additionally, you're only making it taller by about 5 inches (~10%), so it's not a huge change in that direction. A lot of people stack firewood without any supports at all.</p>

<p>Putting some numbers into the <a href=""http://www.woodbin.com/calcs/sagulator/"" rel=""noreferrer"">sagulator</a>, for an 8' Doug Fir 2x4 on edge, with supports at each end, it spits out a borderline sag of 1/4"" for 1000 lb, or an acceptable sag of 0.18"" for 750 lb. You have 2, so that bottom shelf should support roughly 1500 lb without any middle ""feet"". Put a single foot in the middle, and it should support 6000 lb or so, and 2 or more feet should put it over 10000 lb. </p>

<p>Looking <a href=""http://www.lifirewood.com/firewood-facts.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">online</a>, a cord of wood (4'x4'x8') weighs about 4000 lb.

<p>For the uprights, if you plan to loosely stack the firewood, no changes should be needed. If you really want to cram as much wood in as you can (i.e., using the uprights to hold wood which would otherwise fall), you may want to add some diagonal braces to each upright to provide some additional lateral stability.

<ul>
<li>veneer is worn through somewhere in the middle: carve out the defect and inlay a nice design (or you could put in an ugly football patch like they do with the faces of cheap plywood)</li>
<li>edges are chipped on a tabletop: trim back the edge of the table then re-veneer and/or refinish the edges</li>
<li>trim back the veneer to remove the defects (and on adjacent or corresponding parts for consistency), then add a new strip of veneer or edge detail</li>
<li>corners are chipped (e.g., around the sides of a leg or sides of the piece itself):
<ul>
<li>chamfer the corners then veneer and/or finish the newly-exposed surface</li>
<li>trim back the veneer to remove the defects (and on adjacent or corresponding parts for consistency), then add a new strip of veneer or edge detail</li>
<li>add ""corner protectors"" over the corners, hiding the defects</li>
</ul></li>

<p>It will be next to impossible to perfectly match the grain and insert or butt up a separate piece of veneer alongside the original, so you'll probably want to go with a complementing color or pattern if doing an inlay or trimming back and reveneering the edges.</p>

<p>Keep in mind if the piece is valuable, these patch jobs will only decrease its value in the eyes of anyone seeking an authentic antique. But if the piece does not have any antique value, you may be able to use these types of repairs to add some new and interesting design elements.</p>

","<p>Unfortunately it does take quite a bit of solvent to properly clean all spray equipment.

<p>This 'wasted' solvent is one of the under-advertised costs of spraying generally.</p>

<p>All of the solvent used for cleaning doesn't have to go to waste however. If you're spraying paints in particular, the dirtied solvent should be retained, and after some days or longer most or all of the pigment will have settled out of suspension into a dirty layer at the bottom of the jar:</p>

<p>The apparently clean spirit on top can be decanted to a fresh container. This can sometimes be done effectively by just pouring it away, but a large syringe or turkey baster may be preferred to do the job more cleanly.</p>

<p>The spirit layer above the settled gunk may look perfectly clean but there will be some dissolved binder/carrier from the paint in solution so it's slightly contaminated and should never be returned to the original container. </p>

<p>The slightly dirty solvent can still be re-used a number of times, but there comes a point when the contamination becomes too great and it should then be safely disposed of (otherwise it will leave a sticky residue behind on anything it is used to clean, as it is in effect very very dilute varnish by this point).</p>

","<p>It's certainly possible to damage squares and/or levels by clamping. So if you're looking for a yes or no answer, it would have to be yes.</p>

<p>However I can think of plenty of situations where I would clamp either of these and do so in a way that does not degrade their accuracy. I would say the risks are these:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Clamping directly (without a pad of some sort) risks scratching, denting (much worse) or otherwise deforming the surface. This sort of damage can change the angle of a carpenters square and similar thin metal squares. It also could damage the scale causing you to mis-read it. I would follow Graphus's advice above and always either use a pad or use clamps with padded (e.g. rubber) jaws.</p></li>
<li><p>If the surface you're clamping to isn't straight, you can bend a square and definitely an aluminum level. This can also happen by clamping over an edge (like the pad is half on and half off the board or bench. I would avoid clamping an aluminum level to anything that isn't perfectly straight and liable to stay that way. Even then I would clamp it lightly; enough to keep it from moving but no tighter. Definitely use pads here or rubber jaws.</p></li>
<li><p>I would be very leery of clamping any of <em>my</em> machinist squares, except to something that was known flat and smooth to within .001"", like a 1-2-3 block. A small divot would be all it took to bend a rigid blade like that. Also be careful there is nothing under it like chips; wipe both sides with your hand immediately before clamping. Don't even think of skipping use of a brass or aluminum pad under the clamp (with my machinist squares anyway :).</p></li>
<li><p>Same goes for a combination square if it's a good one (PEC, Starrett). If it's a Johnson from Home Depot I wouldn't be so careful :)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In short, my advice is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Know the risks</p></li>
<li><p>Clamp these when it speeds your work, taking care to avoid damage.</p></li>

","<p>A small router like that is not optimal for use in a planing sled.  Small universal motors like that can overheat and be permanently damaged.

<p>The bigger problem, though, is that you will have wood movement issues.  The top will get bigger and smaller seasonally (in the front-to-back direction) while the board you're joining to it will not.  This is because the grain in the top is running perpendicular to the other board.</p>

"With a pneumatic nailer what is more important the quality of the nailer or the nails?","100","","<p>I needed/wanted a small pneumatic nailer for assembling small wood construction. I purchased an inexpensive nailer and nails at the local discount store, and found the nails often jammed.  Within a few attempts the nailer became unusable from damage caused by nails jamming.</p>

<p>I went to DIY box store and bought a quality (<em>I did some research first</em>) nailer and quality nails. This works fine, and I am very happy with the results. But I wonder if I I really need to buy the expensive nailer and the expensive nails.  </p>

<p>Was it the nailer or the nails that caused the issue?  Could I reliably use inexpensive nails in an expensive nailer, or can I reliably use expensive nails in an inexpensive nailer?  Do both the nailer and the nails need to be quality? </p>
","<p><strong>Quality Related to Jamming</strong></p>

<p>The best answer to this question would be to run an experiment and report the jam rates for different grades of nail guns, with different grades of nails.</p>

<p>However, since most users most likely won't have a number of differing quality nail guns at their disposal, I can tell you the experience I've had with my mid-range quality <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000H399PC"">Hitachi 18 gauge brad nailer</a>. Maybe others can chip in if they've got a high quality nailer, or a lower quality nailer and we can make a complete answer.</p>

<p>I generally buy the cheapest nails I can find at the big box store, and I've <strong>never</strong> had my mid-range quality nailer jam on me. I mainly use Porter Cable and Hitachi nails of varying lengths, from 3/4"" to 2"".</p>

<p>From an engineer's perspective, I'd expect the nail gun itself to play the biggest factor against jamming. Variables would include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consistency of feed and fastener placement in the magazine. If the nailer places the next fastener in a different spot under the drive head each time, you're more likely to have a jam. A higher quality nail gun should have better consistency.</li>
<li>Component tolerances. All the moving parts in the nail gun should be designed and manufactured to slide smoothly without interference. A cheaper quality gun may have machining defects or a looser fit between components, which could lead to a jam.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the fasteners, the most important aspect would be uniformity. If the nail gun is designed for a certain size of fastener, and the low quality nails are outside of that design spec, you'll experience more jams.</p>

<p><strong>Quality with Respect to Other Factors</strong></p>

<p>Jam free operation isn't the only factor that is affected by quality. Others include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consistent depth setting. This may be affected slightly by the glue used to collate the fasteners, but the biggest factor will be nailer quality.</li>
<li>Mar-free operation. Nicer nail guns will have a shoe over their safety mechanism to keep it from marking or scratching the work piece.</li>
<li>Ergonomics and reduced user fatigue. Higher quality tools will be engineered to shave off extra weight and make it easier for the user to work with.</li>

<p>Not if you glue them together properly, no. Properly here means well-jointed faces on both pieces (flat and smooth), ample glue, heavy clamp pressure. Also highly advisable to work the wood just prior to the glue-up as fresh surfaces glue much better than old surfaces.</p>

<p>It's actually standard practice to make up beefier material from thinner stock when the thicker stuff is unobtainable, and as mentioned in a few previous Answers when you do this what you end up with tends to be stronger and more stable than if you'd used a single piece (not that it matters for table legs of course).</p>

<p>If the wood is flat-sawn, with curving grain visible on the board ends, it's a good idea to glue two pieces together so that the curves oppose. So either bark side in or out in both cases. If the wood is rift-sawn or quarter-sawn, with vertical or nearly vertical grain on the ends, then it doesn't matter.</p>

"Does engineered bamboo require considerations for expansion and contraction?","96","","<p>I'm thinking of making a desk with a top made from engineered bamboo, and I'm wondering whether I need to follow expansion rules (e.g., breadboard ends) when building the tabletop.  I'm unfamiliar with bamboo's tendency to expand based on environmental factors.</p>
","<p><strong>Bamboo in general</strong></p>

<p>Bamboo, like any woody material, does respond to changes in humidity and its dimensions do change as a result. This expansion and contraction, like with wood, takes place primary across the grain. </p>

<p><strong>""Engineered bamboo""</strong></p>

<p>This could be one of a number of things. </p>

<p>If the bamboo product is just a simple glue-up (like a ""butcher block"" countertop material on a smaller scale) then the grain orientation in each strand is important. If the bamboo is arranged face-up some expansion will occur; if so, best to treat as though it was wood and attach it accordingly. If on the other hand it's arranged edge-up you could probably safely ignore it; there will be some movement but it will be very small, small enough that at table sizes it is negligible. </p>

<p>If, however, the bamboo product is a layered material with strips running one way on the surface and cross-strands of bamboo underneath at 90° then it's like plywood, and just as with plywood you can safely ignore dimensional changes due to changes in moisture level. It might also have a bamboo surface, almost a veneer, with a composite layer as a core, and there too movement is not an issue.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Breadboard ends aren't a requirement to deal with seasonal wood movement. They just need to be made/implemented correctly to allow for it. </p>

<p>These days breadboards are generally done just for appearances, but the practical purpose of breadboards was to help ensure tabletops stayed flat (didn't cup). This was much more of a problem historically because boards were generally much wider than today, at the extreme entire tabletops could be a single board. These can be more prone to bowing than the glued-up panels used almost invariably today.</p>

<p>Two big tips can help here: <em>don't</em> clean your brushes between painting sessions, or use rollers. Actually I'd recommend rollers anyway but I'll get to that in a second.</p>

<p><strong>Keeping a brush from drying out overnight</strong><br>
You can usually get away with not cleaning a brush between sessions (esp. when using oil-based finishes) if you just wrap it up tightly after you're done. It can also help a lot to first dip the brush into the appropriate solvent so that paint isn't going up into dry bristles.</p>

<p>The usual recommendation is to wrap in foil, but I wrap in plastic food wrap first, which provides a more airtight seal, then wrap foil around that. Keeping a brush going from session to session should be absolutely no problem this way, and with luck you can even leave a brush two days or a little longer.</p>

<p>I've left brushes three or four days wrapped in this way to test it out and the finish was beginning to set but the brushes were still usable after a quick rinse. So that can be pushing it, if there's a chance you might be interrupted and a gap of one or two days might extend to the following weekend it's best to go a different route.</p>

<p><strong>Keeping a brush from drying out for much longer</strong><br>
You can keep a brush wet reliably from weekend to weekend, or longer, if you suspend it in a jar of the appropriate solvent. The solvent should just cover the tips of the bristles, doesn't need to be deep enough to soak their entire length.</p>

<p>There are commercial holders available that will allow a brush to be suspended in this way but the usual DIY solution is to drill a hole in the handle (usually just above the edge of the ferrule) through which you can thread a stout wire (e.g. a clipped-off length of wire hanger) which goes across the mouth of the jar of solvent, somewhat like as shown in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3258/i-polyed-my-paintbrush-then-procrastination-left-me-in-a-predicament/3262#3262"">this previous Answer</a>.</p>

<p>You figure some kind of wrapping to keep in the vapour so the solvent doesn't evaporate (foil can again be pressed into service for this, pardon the pun) and you can then leave the brush for ages, confident it won't go hard on you. There is still some evaporation but it's minimal and you can top up periodically if need be.</p>

<p>In theory you can do this indefinitely. Some writers of guides that recommend this tip say they've never cleaned out a brush in 10 years of use. But that's a long time to keep the spirits in the jar topped up in my book!</p>

<p>But in general I wouldn't recommend brushes if you have big flat areas to cover. Spraying is the best way if you have the equipment or don't mind renting it, but I'd go with rollers myself nearly always.</p>

<p><strong>Rollers</strong><br>
Rollers are the unsung hero of interior painting. They're used a lot for walls of course but their much greater speed and efficiency there doesn't get translated to other projects, we still tend to think <em>brush</em> when we want to paint stuff.</p>

<p>Now brushes can work well, especially a good brush in the hands of someone who knows what they're doing can create a great finish. But most of us are not that guy. A roller can achieve a finish nearly as good, or equally good, <em>in far less time</em> with almost no effort or experience. And they're easier to clean thoroughly. Rollers FTW!</p>

<p>Rollers can also be kept wet between sessions much as suggested above if need be.</p>

<p>I think as long as the job doesn't require peak strength this kind of cheap ply really isn't that bad. Yes it's a noticeable step down from how typical plywood used to be not that long ago (depends on how good your memory is!) but once painted who can tell? Some of it's even nice enough to have a clear finish put on it to show off the surface veneer.</p>

<p>The crappy void-filled interior is a non-issue visually in either case because we nearly always edge band or do something so the natural edge doesn't show.</p>

"Why is there a progressive reduction in oil for finish/maintenance? Is it necessary?","95","","<p>For oil finishes, such as tung or linseed, it's common to see advice where you apply multiple coats early on, then fewer and fewer coats progressively.  For example, a common adage is: ""Once a day for a week, once a week for a month, once a month for a year, and once a year for life.""</p>

<p>I understand why you would want to do multiple coats early on (as a finish) and a few coats over the long run (for maintenance).  But what is the purpose of the intermediate phases, i.e., in the example above the once a week/once a month phases?  If it's simply to continue the finish, couldn't you just compact those into the finishing process (e.g., roughly once a day for three weeks), then swap to the maintenance phase?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>If it's simply to continue the finish, couldn't you just compact those into the finishing process (e.g., roughly once a day for three weeks), then swap to the maintenance phase?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's possible this may work for some*, but not in my experience. The main practical issue is that as you build up the oil in the surface wood fibres with the initial coats the wood becomes successively less and less absorbent, and by a certain stage (which will be variable with wood type and minor differences in technique) this can lead to multiple later coats applied closer together more easily building up to a gummy surface. And any amount of soft surface film is to be strenuously avoided when doing an oil finish.</p>

<p>*No two workshops are exactly the same and two people working in Phoenix and Tampa respectively would not have anything close to the same experience during even the first week!</p>

<p>And I wouldn't suggest you go as far as 20 coats anyway. Something that is not clearly stated in almost any guide is that past a certain point you gain nothing with further applications of oil, which is something either implied or directly stated by many old-timers giving advice on finishing ...the type of person most likely to trot out the old adage you quoted :-) You do definitely gain something by applying more than the 2-4 coats that are not uncommon today, but past about six or eight I defy anyone to see any difference whatsoever (on most woods) if they are applying the oil in the correct manner.</p>

<p>Here's why: after the initial buildup within the wood oil finishing is nearly entirely about <em>burnishing of the surface</em>, not ""building up the finish"" in the sense that most people would understand it (particularly if they're more familiar with varnish or an oil/vanish product like ""Danish oil""). </p>

","<p>I would try applying blue painter's tape to the plywood before I routed out the inner circle. Then route the inner circle, which will also cut away the tape. Then when you paint the interior, the painter's tape will be perfectly masking the top, so you don't have to worry about slop. When the paint is dry, remove the painter's tape.</p>

<p>The downside to this is, tape residue will get on the CNC bit. I'm not sure how hard this would be to clean. If the path can be set up so it routes the outer part of the circle first and moves towards the inner part, that might make it clean off most of the residue as it routes the rest of the circle. But maybe not. Still, it would be a handy process if it worked, so I'd probably at least give this a try.</p>

"Proper bit selection for plunge router?","93","","<p>I have a router with fixed and plunge bases, and a handful of bits. I have not yet used the plunge base, but I will need shallow plunged cuts for my next project. Can I use a bit I already have, or do I need to buy a new bit?</p>

<p>Specifically, I have <a href=""http://www.rockler.com/undersized-plywood-router-bit-set"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this set</a> from Rockler. I am considering the smallest bit for this task.

<p>I know that you cannot plunge a bit unless it will cut across the bottom. I don't see many bits that are advertised as specifically made for plunging, although many others do appear to have a bladed surface on the bottom.</p>

<p>These bits don't have sharp blades all the way in, but the shape looks like they would still remove material from the center, then flatten the bottom as I move. Are these OK to plunge? Is there any risk of danger or damage in attempting a plunge with an incorrect bit?</p>

<p>I have found a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDenJHzgXCw"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">video</a> using a drill to remove the center material prior to plunging in with a ""standard straight bit"". Clearly it works in the video, but I'm wondering as well if there are limitations or specific safety issues that I should be aware of before attempting it myself.</p>
","<p>I think these bits would work exactly as you're describing. If you're plunging to a shallow depth and then moving across the work piece, the center that wasn't removed in the initial plunge gets removed by the cutters as you move the router.</p>

<p>The only problem I've had with bits that don't remove the center has happened when I was trying to make a deep-ish plunge without moving the router bit. Then the center hits the bit and prevents you from finishing the plunge cut. But these bits don't look like they'd have that problem, though it's hard to tell from the angle of the picture.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I'd recommend trying it out on a scrap to see whether they work. From the description of the cut you are planning, I think you'll be fine, but testing on a scrap is always the best way to know for sure.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am not aware of any bits that are designed for plunging per se, but normally when I make a plunge cut with a straight bit, the exact bit I choose depends on which surface I am more interested in having come out clean. If I want the bottom of the cut to be the cleanest part, I would use a spiral upcut bit. The flutes on these bits are cut in a continuous spiral around the bit shaft, which helps evacuate chips as they are cut. Spiral upcut bits leave a clean surface on the bottom of the cut, at the expense of having a small bit of raggedness on the top surface of the cut. </p>

<p>If I care more about the surface being cut into more than the surface at the bottom of the cut, I will just use a regular straight bit. </p>

<p>There are also spiral downcut bits, which are similar to spiral upcut bits, but have the flutes running in the opposite direction. These leave a very clean cut on the surface being cut into, but require a slower feed rate than spiral upcut bits, and are better suited for more shallow cuts. As for myself, I've never had a problem with the edge cut by a straight bit, so I've never bothered to buy one. And for completeness, I'll say there are also bits that combine spiral upcut and downcut flutes into one bit, but as far as I'm aware, these are usually quite a bit more expensive, and are mostly used for CNC operations that benefit from having a single bit that is good at everything.</p>

"Is 55W enough for a sander?","92","","<p>I have been looking at buying a Black &amp; Decker Mouse sander which is 55W.<br>
Will it be enough for general use such as sanding wood edges?</p>
","<p>It depends on what you're doing. Those mouse detail sanders are for getting into corners and doing light-duty work. I would not call it a ""general use"" sander unless you have a lot of time to kill and enjoy having your hand go numb.</p>

<p>For sanding edges, it may not be much more efficient than hand sanding. If you are sanding a small end table, it will take a while but you can do it with a mouse sander. If you need to remove a lot of material, you would be better off with a belt sander or an aggressive orbital or random orbit sander, and if you need to sand a large tabletop and progress through finer and finer grits for a nice finish, you should consider a random orbit sander with a dust port that you can connect to a shop vacuum.</p>

<p>Note that there are many other features which have direct practical implications when it comes to sanders, such as dust removal, stroke length, ergonomics, and size of pad or belt. I've never even considered the wattage when purchasing of a handheld sander.</p>

"Milling previously felled logs","92","","<p>There is an old growth forest near where I live. For sake of argument lets move past the most absolute certainty that I cannot remove anything from the premises. Likely to help the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Some of the logs there, that were cut to make paths, are rather large (greater than 3 feet in diameter). I have lived near the area for almost a decade and some of the larger ones barely show any signs of decay short of some moss.</p>

<p>Sure If I can put my foot through it - too rotten. Too many holes - Current or previous infestation. What should I be looking for <strong>on site</strong> to assess if felled wood might still be viable for processing? </p>
","<p>Part of it depends on what you are planning to do with it.  using it to make fine furniture, the limit is much earlier than if you are going to use it for more artistic pursuits such as turning bowls or making panels from the spalted wood for beautiful accents.</p>

<p>For me, how I go about it is I have my chain saw handy (I'm often making firewood when doing this so nothing really goes to waste).  I'll start at one end or the other and cut firewood sized pieces off the log.  Looking for good solid wood through the center.  I'll do this for logs that started to rot from the center up (or down) as well.</p>

<p>Sometimes I'll find I've cut off a piece that will make cool bowl blanks, and that will be what is is saved for.  Once I get to a place the wood looks 'solid' enough to bother using a mill, I'll mark off about 8.5' and cut the log again.  with any luck it will look similar to the other end.  At which point I'll try another 8.5' etc.  Of course while marking the 'log' length you need to look for places large branches broke off and might be rotting into the center of the log, these can possibly ruin 2-3 feet of the log in the center.</p>

<p>I've done this the most with oak, and you can have soft squishy rotted wood an inch or two thick and the center can still be wonderfully firm.  </p>

<p>One thing to look for before even cutting into it is how the log is lying on the land and the conditions it is lying in.  Marshy land can ruin a log for anything but bowl blanks in a long hot summer.  Dryer uplands one can last quite a bit longer and still produce some colorful boards.  if the tree is 'spanning' a distance, (not touching the ground between to small lumps or a slight curve etc) then it can be good for a very long time, they tend to crack all the way to the center after a while though so they also have a limited time for wood working too, though stay good for firewood!  </p>

<p>Depending on your time line from when you get to check the wood to when you want to process it, one test that can show you a lot, (even on 'green' trees) is to cut off a firewood sized chunk and let it dry on the driveway or in your shop.  stuff that looks good and solid might look quite a bit different after drying out for a week.  I've had to learn that one the hard way.</p>

<p>A unit with no shelf at the bottom would be nice because it would allow the desk surface to be unobstructed. You could put some strip lighting (like under-cabinet kitchen counter lighting) under the first shelf, which would provide good lighting without consuming desk surface. Depending on the height, you might need to place a ""shade"" strip in front of the lighting to prevent glare into the eyes of someone seated at the desk.</p>

<p>Sturdy bent sheet metal might also serve as a clamp, and would be low-profile. All the screw holes would be in the shelving unit. Some rubber padding would prevent marring the underside of the desk top, perhaps something like an old inner-tube.</p>

<p>I want to start building a wooden ""shelf"" of sorts, the problem is that I have literally no experience. So I have been looking at a bunch of youtube tutorials and asking my stepdad for some help (lately he's too busy) and doing some research.</p>

<p>The design is actually really simple: There are two arching side supports with 3 ""shelves"" in the middle. 450mm tall, base radius of 300mm</p>

<p>Secondly; I was thinking of using pine, but in my research found out that it is a very soft wood, would this be okay provided it would only carry small light objects (Keys, pens, rubiks cubes, Nicolas Cage bobble head)? What would be a better alternative taking into account that I want to use a light (colour wise, not weight) wood?</p>

<p>And lastly; What sealer do I use? I saw that there really isn't one correct answer for this. What I want is a clear, dry curing layer to protect the wood and keeps its colour. So an acrylic lacquer maybe?</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>what I was wondering was if I could use wood glue and dowels to secure everything together? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Normally that would be fine but there's a potential problem with the design of this piece because the wood meets in a corner.</p>

<p>Due to the width of some components you have to take wood movement into account if this is made from solid wood as you intend and not from a board material like plywood or MDF. </p>

<p><strong>Wood movement generally</strong><br>
Solid wood absorbs and loses water through the seasons as humidity goes up and down and as its internal moisture level changes it expands and contracts across its width. If the expansion of one piece doesn't match that of the piece it is attached to it's a problem. </p>

<p>You must allow the wood to move or stress builds up and it can cause warping or cracks, either along the glue joints or in the wood itself.</p>

<p><strong>Wood movement here</strong><br>
When two pieces are joined at 90° usually they each expand and contract in the same direction (a classic example being a shelf and the side of the case in a standard bookcase). But here, because of the corner design the grain in the shelves is in the correct orientation with one side panel but at right angles to it on the other.</p>

<p>Because of this you can glue and dowel the shelves to the left panel in your image, but the shelves need to be allowed to move relative to the right panel so some other fixing method needs to be utilised there (and the shelf can't be glue on that side, except in towards the corner).</p>

<p><strong>How you can ignore it</strong><br>
Or you could make your shelving unit from plywood instead and simplify things for yourself. Then you can glue and dowel the whole thing together without worrying about movement.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It's not <em>very</em> soft. It is soft, but usually not intolerably so. I should mention there are many different subspecies of pine and some are actually reasonably hard in comparison to the usual stuff you'd buy in a big-box or similar. But even the softest kind is still perfectly usable for something like this, and in fact could be used for a kitchen table that will see regular use (as many such projects posted online show).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is as much a matter of personal preference as anything. If you're happy with the cost and application method of an ""acrylic lacquer"" (I use quotes here because that can be a range of things) then go with it, it'll likely give you exactly what you're looking for.</p>

<p>Note however that you can't stop pine from changing colour due to exposure to light and oxygen. If the finish you use has UV blockers included in the formula those can delay colour changes in wood but the protection is not permanent. Eventually any area of the pine not shielded from light by the items placed on the shelves will darken a little bit and go slightly more yellow, which are the standard colour changes for pine.</p>

"Wooden covering of a well","90","","<p>I have no experience in woodworking, and only have a rudimentary equipment, but my well needs a new covering, and it would be nice to have some advice.</p>

<li>height of the brick side of the well: 1 m</li>
<li>width of the brick side of the well: 30cm</li>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p>How could I join wooden slats together to build a circular covering? </p>

<ul>
<li>It should be safe and stable.</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess it would be a good idea to add some mechanism to prevent the covering slipping away, but this shouldn't be too difficult, and can be done independently.</p>

<ul>
<li>The slats shouldn't fit together too firmly, in order to let the well breath a bit - so no gluing.</li>
</ul>

<p>I appreciate any advice!</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Here is a photo to have a better idea (though this well is larger, so the technique is not necessarily the same I guess):</p>

<p><img src=""https://etc.usf.edu/clippix/pix/black-cannonballs-stacked-on-a-wooden-covering-of-a-well_medium.jpg"" alt=""wooden covering of a well""></p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>How could I join wooden slats together to build a circular covering? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Numerous ways this can be done, including simple butt joints (the straight sides of the boards glued together), pocket screws (with glue or without), screwing or nailing separate boards to boards running at 90° underneath or on top. Last but not least, as in the photo you included, separate boards joined somehow to a framework underneath — much like you'd build the top of an oval farmhouse table.</p>

<p>All of these are more difficult to do properly than you might expect without the right selection of tools or experience in using them. </p>

<p>So instead I'd suggest you buy a quality piece of exterior plywood (e.g. marine-grade). This will make the job infinitely easier and faster for a novice to complete, the cutting to size might even be done for free where you buy the plywood. 12mm plywood would probably be strong enough but 18mm ply is not much more expensive usually and obviously stronger and heavier.</p>

<p>If you would prefer to use solid wood and would like to build something that will last well exposed to weather you should choose softwood that has been treated with preservative (deck boards would be an excellent choice) or a wood that is naturally resistant to rot, which would usually be relatively expensive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I guess it would be a good idea to add some mechanism to prevent the covering slipping away, but this shouldn't be too difficult, and can be done independently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Small blocks of wood glued, nailed or screwed near the edge underneath would be enough for it to 'register' against the inside edge of the hole, while still allowing it to be lifted off and placed into position with ease. Only three blocks would be enough for a good registered fit.</p>

<p>Remember the cover doesn't have to be circular just because the well is, it can be square if you want to save time and effort. If the projecting corners being sharp are a safety concern they can be rounded slightly but there's no reason the cover <em>has</em> to match the shape of the well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The slats shouldn't fit together too firmly, in order to let the well breath a bit - so no gluing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think you need to worry about this as the fit of the cover to the top of the brick wall won't even be close to airtight. But if necessary you could drill holes in the board to provide ventilation.</p>

","<p>If you're thinking of placing them side-by-side on that platform, I'd use the 2x4s and six leveling feet. There is twice the load at the middle that there is at each end, half the washer weight (including significant water weight when running) and half the dryer weight. Even if it took the load initially, there is vibration and potentially moisture at work and sooner or later you're likely to get visible sagging. If you add the extra pair of leveling feet in the middle, it will stay right where you set it indefinitely. You can use the money you save on the wood to pay for the feet :)</p>

<p>Also, make sure the feet are attached firmly to the 2x4, perhaps with a tee-nut on the top and a fender washer on the bottom, so they don't wallow-out their hole with the side-to-side vibration forces. You'll want to keep them screwed in as far as possible within your leveling constraints, to minimize the bending moment on the threaded shafts and the stress it places on the hole it's in.</p>

<p>Thank you for any help!</p>
","<p>I'm not an expert in wood species, so maybe someone who knows more can weigh in more authoritatively, but I'd be inclined to use a species like Maple for this purpose. I think you'll find that's what the holds in your picture are made from.</p>

<p>Douglas Fir is strong in the sense that it can bear high compressive axial (in line with the grain) loads. It probably does well with axial tension as well. This makes it good for a lot of purposes in construction, which is what the studs at Home Depot are generally used for.</p>

<p>Where it is less fabulous is in tension in the radial direction (sideways to the grain, roughly speaking). So it would have more of a tendency to fail by splitting than something like maple.</p>

<p>Also note that any screws used for affixing the holds should <em>not</em> be of the countersunk variety. You can see in the holds you've pictured that the screw holes are <em>counterbored</em>, meaning the force of the screw head is directed parallel to the screw body (straight in, loosely speaking) rather than at 45 degrees in each direction, which would work to split the wood. So you would use pan head wood screws or perhaps preferably socket head or button-head socket cap screws to attach the holds.</p>
