"Replacing whiteness with transparency in CS6","495312","","<p>I want to replace the whiteness in pixels with transparency in the same way as described in <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/8509/replace-image-gradient-in-image-with-alpha"">this question</a> - i.e. for lighter pixels to be made proportionally as transparent. All solutions found via google are based on magic wand or other methods that do not work for my needs.  I'm sure there used to be a way to do this in earlier version of photoshop (a simple functions to replace a colour with transparency), but I can't it in CS6.  'Replace Colour' has no alpha options.  Grateful for any pointers.</p>
","<p>One method is to use the original image/layer as its own layer mask. You'd create a duplicate of the layer, desaturate and invert it, pasting the greyscale result into the original layers layermask.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update: Here are some step by step instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Start with your flattened image:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/R51xa.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Add a <strong>Saturation/Hue</strong> adjustment layer and turn down the Saturation until the image has no color. If you don't have any gradient in your original image, you can just use a <strong>Threshold</strong> adjustment layer instead, which will result in 100% black or 100% white results.</p>

<p>(Technically you could skip step, as we'll be pasting it into a layer mask which will convert it to greyscale anyway. This will give you a good visual reference though to tweak the black/white balance)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cb8W5.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Add an <strong>Invert</strong> adjustment layer, then a <strong>Curves</strong> adjustment layer. Tweak the Curves until everything you'd like to be solid/opaque is white, and everything you want fully transparent is black. You may have to tweak this a few times to get the amounts right.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LeGeq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to select the entire image and <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to copy the combined greyscale result. Create a layer mask on your original layer. Now <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd> in the layer mask icon to enter direct edit mode. Now paste the black and white image you just copied into there.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iARQ4.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now click back on your original layer to exit the layer mask direct edit and hide all your adjustment layers. </p>

<p>There you have it! If you find your finished result isn't fully opaque (solid) in the areas you like it, you can either tweak the curves and do it again (you'll need more white in those areas), or just duplicate the result/layer a few times until it becomes less transparent (example below).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hYng9.png"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<p>This also works on black backgrounds, just don't use the Invert layer filter.</p>

"How to create vector graphics In Photoshop?","397442","","<p>I know people prefer using CorelDraw or Adobe Illustrator, but <strong>I want to know if there is a technique I can follow to use Adobe Photoshop to make vector Images</strong>.</p>
","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> <strong>Photoshop can not create true vector images.</strong> This is a very common misconception. </p>

<p>Think of it like a car. -- Can you go 4-wheeling with a Toyota Prius? Sure you <em>can</em>! Is it going to do all the things a Jeep Wrangler can do? Heck no. There's a <em>reason</em> you <em>need</em> to use a 4-wheel drive vehicle to go 4-wheeling, just as there's a <em>reason</em> you <em>need</em> to use a vector application to create vector files.</p>

<hr>

<p>Regardless of how you create a file and save it, Photoshop <strong>always</strong> saves both vector and <em>raster</em> information. This is unlike any true vector application. </p>

<p>You <strong>can't</strong> create vector <strong>files</strong> with Photoshop. You can only create raster files with vector containers/edges. This means you may have a vector square and its edges will remain sharp and crisp, however if that square has a gradient fill. That gradient fill is <em>raster entirely</em> and it will suffer upon some scaling.</p>

<p>Applications such as Illustrator, Corel, Xara, actually can contain only 100% resolution independent vector data. It's not a matter of ""people preferring"" to use a vector application. It's <strong>required</strong> if you want a true vector format in the end.</p>

<p>This is not to say that the vector <strong>tools</strong> within Photoshop are overall inferior, they are not. Yes you <em>can</em> draw with the vector tools in Photoshop and create vector content. But in order to get the real benefit of that vector content in Photoshop, you have to use Photoshop for all future alterations. When you enlarge or transform a vector container <em>within</em> Photoshop, Photoshop interpolates the interior raster data to suit the transformation. That interpolation <strong>does not</strong> happen outside of Photoshop. So, after exporting/saving you can scale something like a Photoshop EPS, the vector edges will scale and remain crisp because they are vector, but the interpolation of the raster data does <strong>not</strong> happen outside of Photoshop. So ""broken pixels"" are <em>entirely</em> possible with a Photoshop EPS even though you used vector tools. This issue arises when you <em>save</em> the file or <em>export</em> it. In all vector-capable formats - PDF, EPS, PSD - Photoshop creates a raster file with embedded vector data. Photoshop does <em>not</em> create a vector file. This is <strong>entirely unlike</strong> actual vector-based applications. </p>

<p>For production purposes, this difference may be largely unimportant if you are already working at a high ppi in Photoshop. But a user should be aware that simply using Photoshop's vector tools and saving as an EPS/PDF <strong>does not create vector files</strong> using <em>any</em> currently available version of Photoshop (CC2017 is the most recent).</p>

<p>I realize some users <em>desperately</em> want Photoshop to create vector files because that means they don't need to learn a new application to generate a new file format. However, there's <strong>no way</strong> around it. If you want actual vector files, you <strong>must</strong> use an actual vector application. Photoshop is and always has been a <em>raster</em> application, hence ""photo"" in its name.</p>

"What resolution should a large format artwork for print be?","348703","","<p>For wall sized graphics and large banners (e.g 3m x 5m), what is an acceptable PPI for print.</p>

<p>As i understand it 300 PPI is the typical for 'small' artworks (esp. for clean text resolution), however for small artworks the audience usually engages at a much closer distance. Therefore in the interests of keeping a bitmap file down to a resonable size can you get away with a much reduced PPI for a large format/banner print?</p>
","<p>In general you should use vector graphics in the artwork wherever practical, and deliver final artwork to the printer in PDF or other vector format. Your finished print will then be limited only by the output resolution of the print device.</p>

<p>This is particularly important with text and line art — visible rasterization in the finished print will be very obvious and look amateurish.</p>

<p>While a PDF can contain photographic images, they will have a fixed resolution, and while 300 ppi is a good rule of thumb for publications and small posters viewed at close range, there's no way you'll achieve anything close to that at the dimensions you're talking about. Certainly you should aim for as high as possible, but I don't think there's a hard-and-fast lower limit. I've certainly ended up with around 75ppi in photographic elements of 2m high event banners, which looked fine at relative distance. I never felt the need to do any interpolated upscaling of the raster images.</p>

<p>So, again in general, your workflow would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>produce raster elements in Photoshop and output as TIFF files</li>
<li>create complex vector elements like logos or illustration in Illustrator and output as EPS or PDF files</li>
<li>compose the final artwork in InDesign, linking in the raster and vector files, adding text and simple vector elements like colour blocks.</li>
<li>output the composite PDF from InDesign, ensuring that raster elements are output at their native resolution, i.e. not downsampled to a particular output resolution.</li>

","<p>Choice of the best compression method depends on your image content. If you're trying to save image with a lots of colors and smooth transitions between them, your choice would rather be JPEG. Otherwise, if you've got some lineart, text, image with a couple of colors you should try PNG instead.</p>

<p>Specific compression scheme, parameters, color reduction etc. depend on the specific case. There are some images you can safely save with JPEG compression ""slider"" set to 30 or 40 without making artifacts apparent. Some other require settings 80 or more. Your eye should be the judge.</p>

<p>When we speak about JPEG compression, don't hesitate to try to use e.g. ""Progressive"" option or to set ""Blur"" to non zero value (subtle blur can mask severe compression artifacts).</p>

<p>In the case of PNG, you should try to reduce ammount of used colors as much as possible (use PNG-8 for that). When some ""smoothing"" is required try different dithering algorithms.</p>

"Photoshop a low-res image to make it appear higher-res","232858","","<p>I want to enlarge an image to a bigger size. This will cause pixelation. So I want to apply some treatment to it in Photoshop that will suppress some of this pixelation. Of course I cannot generate new pixel information, only smoothen it etc. so that the pixelation is not so much apparent in full views and prints. Example, one effect popular with photographers is to copy the image into a second layer, set its blending mode to overlay or soft light etc., then apply a blur to it. This somewhat smoothens the image. But it also changes its appearance into a glowy kind of look (which is the aim, usually). I want a treatment that will fake the appearance of a higher-res smooth image without too many side-effects.</p>

<p>Any tricks of this kind that anyone knows of?</p>
","<p>In general, enlarge the image using Bicubic interpolation (sometimes, depending on the image, ""Bicubic Smoother"" works better, but usually straight Bicubic is more satisfactory), then either use Smart Sharpen to bring back the edge contrast, or copy the layer, set the blend mode of the copy to Overlay, and run <code>Filter &gt; Other &gt; High Pass</code>.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can get a better result if you increase the size by a smaller amount, apply a sharpen (not too much!), then increase it some more, apply another sharpen, etc., until you reach the size you want. This takes patience and a lot of trial and error to make it work for any give image, so I don't recommend it except in extreme cases, but once in a while it will allow you to push enlargement beyond where you can go without that intermediate sharpen.</p>

<p>My experience is that the best approach varies according to the image, the amount of upsizing and the result you're looking for. There is a limit to how far you can scale any image before the result becomes too fuzzy to be useful, and the definition of what is useful depends entirely on your application. For graphic design work it is almost never worthwhile to upsize an image more than about 10%.</p>

"Point vs Pixel: What is the difference?","214124","","<p>What is the difference between points and pixels?</p>
","<p>A pixel is a single square 'picture element' (hence pix-el), i.e. a single dot in your image. A 10x10 image is made up of a set of pixels in a grid 10 wide by 10 high, totaling 100 pixels.</p>

<p>The 'point' (pt) on the other hand is a unit of length, commonly used to measure the height of a font, but technically capable of measuring any length. In applications, 1pt is equal to exactly 1/72th of an inch; in traditional print <em>technically</em> 72pt is 0.996264 inches, although I think you'll be forgiven for rounding it up!</p>

<p>How many pixels = 1pt depends on the resolution of your image. If your image is 72ppi (pixels per inch), then one point will equal exactly one pixel.</p>

<p>If anyone can change the background to white for me than that would be great!</p>
","<p>Yes, this can be possible, although Inkscape may not be the optimal tool for it.

<p>Without seeing the actual picture, though, it's hard to say just what could be done with it and how.  Still, just to show what <em>is</em> possible, here's a picture I once cleaned up for Wikipedia using GIMP:</p>

<p>&nbsp; <a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:House_mouse.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/House_mouse.jpg"" alt=""House_mouse.jpg""></a>

<p>The original is on the left, the edited version on the right.  Of course, neither version has particularly high resolution, but the result still worked fine for its intended use, which was as a tiny 30 &times; 20 px thumbnail in a boilerplate notice.  (Since then, I've seen that same mouse show up in some surprising places, which just goes to show that there's <em>always</em> demand for simple public domain clip art, even of lab mice.)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> OK, after looking at the <a href=""http://yfrog.com/oerj1lzhj"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">original image</a>, it seems to me that this is mostly a white balance issue.  Assuming that the wall behind the subject is actually supposed to be gray, we can easily fix the issue using the GIMP <a href=""http://luca.dealfaro.org/Whitebalance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">white balance plugin</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use the Color Picker Tool to select the color of the wall as the foreground color.  (Since we have a nice flat expanse of wall to select from, I suggets using ""Sample average"" and a fairly large radius for best results.)</p></li>
<li><p>Use the white balance tool (<em>Filters &rarr; Colors &rarr; White balance</em>) in ""Make foreground gray"" mode.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(You can also do this just by playing with the sliders in <em>Colors &rarr; Color Balance...</em>, but the plugin makes it a <em>lot</em> easier.)</p>

<p>These steps will correct the color cast, but the resulting image is still kind of dark and grayish.  So the next step is to brighten it using the <em>Colors &rarr; Levels...</em> (or <em>Curves...</em>, which is more versatile but also more complex) tool.  This will take some trial and error to get the best results, but basically you first set the black and white points so that the histogram just fits between them, and then adjust the midpoint slider (or a control point in the middle, if using curves) to get a nice contrast.  This is what I got after playing with curves a bit:</p>

<p>&nbsp; <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QnqM7.jpg"" alt=""Image after white balance correction and curves adjustment""></p>

<p>If the result still looks too ""bland"" or gray, you might also want to push up the color saturation a little (using <em>Colors &rarr; Hue-Saturation...</em>).  Be careful, though, it's easy to overdo it. </p>

<p>Ps. You'll notice that the wall in the background still loks gray, not white.  If you really wanted it to be <em>white</em>, you'd basically have to cut out the subject and replace the background, which is a lot more laborious than simple color balance adjustment.  (If you just try to push up the brightness until the background becomes white, you'll notice that the highlights on the subject also burn out completely.)  If a light gray background is not sufficient for you, it might actually be easier to take a new set of pictures with better lighting.</p>

","<p>Typically a logo is designed in a <em>vector</em> program such as Illustrator, so it can be scaled to meet the various needs required by the customer. For instance, a logo will typically end up on:<br></p>

<ul>
<li>Business cards </li>
<li>Letterhead / envelopes</li>
<li>T-shirts</li>
<li>Web headers / web pages</li>

<p>Since you're theoretically going to be designing in a format that can be scaled without loss (vector) the size you work with should be something you're comfortable with (remember if you put too much detail into your logo it's going to be lost when it's scaled down to fit on a business card). <br>
<br>
If vector won't work for you (e.g., don't own Illustrator / don't want to learn another program / strictly prohibited by your religion) you should try and figure out where the logo is going to be used. If it's only going to be on a web site I'd try and figure out the largest iteration of the logo and work at that size. If it's going to be printed you should figure out where it's going to be printed (business card, t-shirt, mint tin, sticker, etc.) and again work at the largest physical size (i.e., x inches by y inches) at a minimum of 300 ppi. </p>

<p>I'm not sure how to turn off hyphenation for this paragraph, or is it bad practice to leave it on?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o86Lm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>As Lauren says, you can simply uncheck Hyphenation in the Paragraph panel or in the Hyphenation section of your Paragraph Style, but don't be too quick to throw away the hyphens. No hyphenation also tends to leave you in trouble when you have widows and orphans to deal with.</p>

<p>Some things worth considering:</p>

<p><strong>Language:</strong> Hyphenation requires the language of the text to be identified correctly. You're using an English version of InDesign, but the default International English dictionary will NOT hyphenate your language correctly. You change this under Advanced Character Formats in the Style dialogs. (TIP: You can prevent a word from ever hyphenating by setting it to ""[No Language]"".)</p>

<p><strong>Line width:</strong> Whether you can avoid hyphenation and still maintain even text color depends on the width of your measure (how long the line is) and the typeface. A narrow column of justified text (less than, say, 15 to 17 times the point size, depending on the typeface) will not set evenly without hyphenation except through very hard work and a lot of luck. You need to average 60 or more characters per line for justified text, more if you turn off hyphenation (and even then, you'll run into problems here and there).</p>

<p><strong>Fine Tuning:</strong> Justification, by default, varies only the spaces between words, a hangover from the days of metal type when there wasn't much choice. InDesign gives you <em>much</em> more flexibility. You can successfully justify text without uneven color and with minimal or no hyphenation by using your ultra-modern software to emulate what the traditional scribes did by hand: vary the space between individual characters and the widths of the characters themselves. Gutenberg used no word spaces at all. He justified his text by varying character widths, as he had learned from studying the work of scribes.</p>

<p>InDesign can vary the spaces between words, the spaces between letters and the width of the characters themselves. Robert Bringhurst's classic ""Elements of Typographic Style"" is set justified, with the character spacing allowed to vary 3% either way and the glyphs to scale 2% wider or narrower.</p>

<p>Here's an example, in the Justification section of the Paragraph Style dialog or Paragraph panel:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zq55H.png"" alt=""Justification dialog""></p>

<p>These are body copy settings from a book I'm currently designing. The text is 13/16  Garamond Premier Pro, on a 29 pica (roughly 122 mm) line, justified, with minimal hyphenation. It currently runs about one hyphen every couple of pages, with no hand tweaking at all.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lPnvW.png"" alt=""justification sample""></p>

<p>If I have the option of exporting different image formats (tiff, jpeg, jpeg2000, bmp, png, etc) which one would be preferred to produce high quality prints?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>It depends a lot on where you print, what printer will be used for the
  task and what you need to do with the files.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>You might want to stay away from anything JPG</strong> because of the compression, that's a start. It can work for huge formats but they are used more as a last option; for example, if you cannot upload a banner of 300mb for printing, you might be ""forced"" to use a JPG at 15mb!</p>

<p><strong>PNG can be good but they are in RGB color mode</strong>; this is not desirable if you print on offset or anything that requires CMYK color mode. You could use it but either the printer will refuse your files and ask you to convert them yourself to CMYK color mode OR the printer will convert it for you and you'll have no control on the final result. Sometimes it gives OK results, sometimes it horrible; you might want to have 100% control on your colors. They can work fine on some digital printing machines that handle RGB well though.</p>

<p><strong>TIFF are a good safe choice</strong> for pretty much any kind of printing and color mode but these files are very heavy. That's still the one I find the best in your list and highly compatible with almost any software that can open pictures. Your question is about pictures but TIFF allows transparency and can be useful for this.</p>

<p><strong>There's EPS</strong> that is also a safe option for printing but not the best to use on your own personal printer. They can be very convenient in publishing used with some software that can manage huge files and you can increase the performance of your software because of the encapsulated preview that comes with EPS and its small file size. But for everyday image printing or if you need to share the files, I still think TIFF are the safest choice. Personally I still use EPS because it's quick to save these files and they're reliable. You will hear a lot of designers say it's a ""legacy"" format but you should use what works best for your needs; if you go on the Adobe forum, you will also see tons of designers saying it's ""legacy"" to use CMYK mode... so...!</p>

<p><strong>You could use PSD</strong> but then you might have issues with compatibility if you need to share your files.</p>

<p><strong>Finally, there's PDF that can be used</strong>; they're long to save in Photoshop though but they are highly compatible and offer some freedom for compression.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Here's a screenshot to show you the difference in size between all formats, all uncompressed at 300ppi and 15""x 9"" size:</strong></p>

<p>You can easily see what could be the right choice for a catalog that contains a lot of high resolution images or if you need to backup a thousand images at top quality or share a few images online, for example.</p>

<p>If you import your images in another software such as Illustrator, InDesign or QuarkXpress than you can work with any file format you want; but you should prioritize PDF as your print-ready file for the whole layout.</p>

"What font types are good for a technical document?","161070","","<p>What are some good fonts to use for a highly technical document? Is there any specific type that should be used/avoided?</p>
","<p>Technical documents will have a deeply nested, hierarchical structure, and also make use of footnotes, different types of emphasis, cross-referencing, pull outs and side bars of one sort of another and captions.  The main distinguishing feature of technical documents tends to be complex structure.</p>

<p>For headings, you can use any reasonably legible font; this could be serif or sans-serif.  It should have a <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=complementary%20font%20pairs"" rel=""noreferrer"">complementary</a> style to your body text, but the headings should provide an obvious visual structure to the document.</p>

<p>A decent serif or sans-serif typeface is fine for the body text if you have a lot of prose.  If you have a lot of illustrations with labels or captions, pull-outs or tables you might want to use a sans-serif font for the body text and a serif font for headings.  Footnotes will be smaller than the body text, so don't use a font for the body that is too small.</p>

<p>For emphasis, the italic or oblique version of the font should have a noticeably different texture to the body text.</p>

<p>For tables, captions and pull outs you should use a sans-serif font in most cases.  If you use a serif font for the body text make sure the texture of the sans-serif font complements but does contrast significantly from the text type.</p>

<p>If you intend to have code listings or other monospaced items in the document then you will have a third typeface for the monospaced text.  This should visually complement any sans-serif typefaces.  Don't use Courier for this as it is relatively wide; other monospace fonts such as Lucida Console will give you more monospaced characters in the same width for the same point size or general legibility.  Also, Courier doesn't really go with anything and the version that ships with most O/S platforms is very light and not terribly legible for reading large code listings.</p>

<p>If you have the option of buying in the fonts then you can pick any combination that looks appropriate; many resources on the web have helpful suggestions for this.</p>

<p>If you are stuck with fonts supplied by your operating system vendor then the story is slightly different.  Although I briefly worked as a typesetter about 20 years ago most of the technical documentation work I do these days is functional specifications and I am typically constrained by the software available in the client's standard desktop build.</p>

<p><strong>Some options are:</strong></p>

<p>Palatino is quite a pleasant typeface for text if you are writing large bodies of prose.  It got done to death in the DTP era as it came bundled with most Postscript printers, but that is a bit of a dying memory so it can stand on its own merits.  It will go with any of the Sans-serif fonts (Arial, Tahoma, Trebuchet, Calibri etc) that ship with Windows.  MacOS and most Linux distros also come with a decent rendition of Palatino from Adobe or URW.  </p>

<p>The Lucida family is designed for this type of work, and has serif, sans-serif and monospace fonts.  It has a pleasant, contemporary look and works well.  Another big plus is that most O/S platforms come with Lucida fonts.  The Lucida family was also designed to render well on low-res output devices such as screens or early laser printers, so it is a good choice in a font intended for PDF output.</p>

<p>Stand-bys Times and Arial (or Helvetica) work OK, although I find that Times italic tends not to stand out very well on laser printed documents.  The document will look like something done with MS Word, but the typefaces are serviceable.  The main reason to avoid these fonts is personal taste or a desire to avoid looking like amateur word processing (which may be more important than you think if you need the document to be taken seriously.)</p>

<p>Traditional old-style or transitional types (e.g. Garamonds, Bembo, Baskerville) look quite nice and are legible in text, but have a low x-height so they need to be set in larger sizes.   Mixing these inline with a sans-serif typeface with a bigger x-height can look strange.  ITC Garamond (Used extensively by Apple in the 1980s and 1990s) is a re-imagining of Garamond with a larger x-height, so doesn't suffer from this problem.</p>

<p>Moderns such as CM or Century Schoolbook got done to death in the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries, so they tend to come with a lot of cultural baggage.  I find moderns make a document look like something from the Victorian era or the 1920s or 30s.  While they are quite practical and legible, I must beg to differ with DEK about their appropriateness for technical documents.</p>

<p>Take the usual hints about care when mixing humanist and geometric typefaces.  Note that highly geometric sans-serifs like Avant-Garde Gothic or Futura aren't really suitable for text type for a technical document.  Although they may be OK for headings, if you have a lot of captions, labels or otner sans-serif artifacts in the document they will clash with AGG or Futura if not set in the same typeface.  This is a strike against using these fonts for anything but major headings such as chapter titles.  Similar issues apply when using any sans-serif font with a highly distinctive look.</p>

<p>From memory, I have had good results with text type set in Times, Helvetica, Charter, Palatino, Frutiger, ITC Berkeley Old Style, Calibri, Tahoma and one or two others in various technical documents I have been involved in writing.  </p>

<p><strong>Some combinations I have used are:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Times text and Arial headings, captions and labels with Lucida
Typewriter listings (dictated by corporate standards)</p></li>
<li><p>Palatino text and Helvetica headings, captions and labels (Adobe
fonts, designed to be rendered to PDF without having to embed fonts
so I stuck with the 35 standard PostScript fonts).  The document was
produced with Framemaker.</p></li>
<li><p>Palatino text and Tahoma headings with Lucida Console listings.  In
hindsight, the bold on Tahoma that comes with Windows is too heavy.</p></li>
<li><p>Cambria headings and Calibri text - defaults with Word 2010, and look
OK together.  Shrink down the heading styles from the default sizes - the 
bold is quite heavy and it looks too strong against the body text.  Also, 
the default style inserts quite a bit of leading in the text styles.</p></li>
<li><p>Charter, CMSans, - document produced with LaTeX.  This used the basic
'Charter' style that comes with LaTeX, modified a bit by hacking
about the includes.</p></li>
<li><p>ITC Berkeley Old Style/Helvetica.  Headings and text done with BOS
and captions and some other bits done with Helvetica.  I like
Berkeley Oldstyle as a font (try setting the word 'Quidditch' in it) and it works
for both display and text type.  The ITC version (predictably enough, I suppose)
has a fairly large x-height, so it works with sans-serif fonts.</p></li>
<li><p>Lucida - comes with pretty much every major OS platform, is highly legible, and is
designed to render well on low-res output devices such as laser
printers.  There is a whole family of serif, sans-serif and
monospaced fonts available.  They render well on screen, look nice in
print and have good ergonomics for technical documents.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Actually, this reminds me of a story.  At the university where I did my bachelor's degree they had a course that (amongst other things) teaches LaTeX and the joys of structured documents.  My friend was a tutor for that paper at one point. One of the students complained about LaTeX thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>But if I use LaTeX all my documents look like they were done in TeX</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To which my friend replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Could be worse.  Could look like they were done in Word.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The student saw the point.</p>

<p>A corollary to that is that one of the lecturers actually did some stats on this at one point and found a correlation between grades for assignments and using LaTeX.  He swears that using LaTeX for an assignment is worth about half a grade on average.  Whether this was due to the structured documentation effect and auto look-and-feel features of TeX or just because the smarter students tended to used it wasn't made clear, although I think he may have attempted to correct for the average grades of the student.</p>

<p>When I switch to 8 Bit/Channel it works now - I have all standard formats as option - JPEG, PNG, etc. But the problem now is that my image doesn't look good with 8 Bit color. Is it possible to do something to save it without losing the original picture?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong> </p>

<p>I have 32 bit JPEG photos on my computer + most icons I work with are 32 bit PNG images. Why doesn't Photoshop allow 32 bit JPEG ? What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3</strong> </p>

<p>Is 8 bit/channel actually 32 bit color?</p>
","<p>Any time a format isn't available in the Save As dialog, it means that format is invalid for the document in the state it's in. There's no such thing (as Lese and cwedge point out), as a 32-bit (or 16-bit) jpeg, nor a duotone, Lab or 1-bit bitmap jpeg.</p>

<p>Photoshop versions prior to CS5 would simply not show jpeg as an available option for 16-bit images, which drove enough people slightly crazy that the Photoshop team incorporated an automatic conversion into CS5.</p>

<p>A valid jpeg is an 8-bit image in RGB or CMYK.</p>

<p>To answer your three updates, you are not going to get the same quality from 8 bits/channel as from 32 bits/channel, but jpeg is 8 bits/channel so you don't have a choice if you need jpeg output. By working carefully in Photoshop, you can achieve the best compromise for a particular purpose.</p>

<p>Bit depth is specified differently depending on context. For an image, ""8 bit"" means 8 bits <em>per channel</em>. A CMYK jpeg has 8 bits x 4 channels -- 32 bits per pixel -- but is still referred to as ""8 bit"". A ""16 bit tiff"" is an tiff with 16 bits per channel. </p>

<p>Displays are specified in bits <em>per pixel</em>, so a ""24 bit display"" allows 8 bits per RGB channel. The newest monitors are 30 bit -- 10 bits per RGB channel -- but require special support from both the OS and the GPU.</p>

"How do I apply anti-aliasing to the edges of a layer?","148104","","<p>How do I apply anti-aliasing to the edges of a layer?</p>

<p>I have a layer that has rough edges. I want to apply anti-aliasing to it so it blends well against the background. What is the best way to do that in CS5?</p>
","<p>Blurring will not give you a true anti-aliasing effect, and in some cases the blur will look even worse than the aliasing. If you want to do a really good job, keep reading…</p>

<p><strong>Part 1: Create an Anti-Aliased Selection</strong></p>

<p>Use <em>one</em> of the following methods. The first is hardest but gives you more control and can produce a much better result.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pen Tool – Select the Pen Tool and begin creating a path around the perimeter of the aliased shape. I will not explain how to use the Pen Tool. Check out the second option if you don't know how. Otherwise, draw the path, then go to the Paths panel, right-click on the path you created and choose ‘Make Selection...’ In the pop-up that appears, make sure that feathering is set to 0 and the Anti-Aliased checkbox is checked. Then click OK. A quicker way to make this selection if you are sure anti-aliasing is checked, is to Ctrl-Left-Click the path in the Paths panel. </p></li>
<li><p>Magnetic Lasso Tool – Switch to the Magnetic Lasso Tool by holding the Lasso Tool button until all variants of the tool appear, and then select the Magnetic Lasso Tool. In the options bar, make sure Anti-alias is turned on and set the Radius, Contrast, and Frequency to 30px, 1%, and 100 respectively (play with different values if those don’t work for you). This tool works in a quirky way, you have to click the tool near the edge of the shape you are tracing, but don’t hold the mouse button down. Just move the mouse to trace the shape with the cursor as best you can, and then click on the beginning anchor-point to close the selection loop. </p></li>
<li><p>Refine the Edge - This is the least accurate method, but can still produce a semi-decent anti-aliased selection quickly. Go to the Layers panel and Ctrl-Left-Click (Command-Left Click on Mac OS X) on the icon of the layer to be selected. This will create an aliased selection around your shape. Then choose Select > Refine Edge... via the main menu. In the Refine Edge dialog box, set Contrast to 40% and Smooth to 50 and set everything else to 0. You can also play with the Smooth and Contrast settings if those ones don't work for you.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Part 2: Contract, Invert, and Trim</strong></p>

<p>Now that you have an anti-aliased selection in the same shape as the path, go to Select > Modify > Contract… via the main menu and enter 1 px in the dialog that comes up. Press OK in the dialog, and then click Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows or Cmd+Shift+I on Mac to invert the selection. Now press the Delete button on your keyboard to trim the aliased edge.</p>

<p>This should produce a true, anti-aliased outline of your object. It will be one pixel thinner than before, but in many cases that will be just fine.</p>

","<p>Doesn't look like there is a way to permanently alter an object's rotate point.  You can use the Rotate tool or Free Transform to change it temporarily, but it resets to the center of the object once you change to a different tool.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thanks to <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/a/17829/3327"">Supamike in this question about this problem in Photoshop</a> there's what looks like a simpler solution that also works in Illustrator <strong><em>for point text</em></strong> (it screws up if you have area text that spans more than one line, so you need to use point text then manually put line breaks in and re-order the lines of text, else the first line is at the bottom and the last is at the top).</p>

<p>Type or copy your text into the top box on <a href=""http://www.arabic-keyboard.org/photoshop-arabic/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.arabic-keyboard.org/photoshop-arabic/</a>, then copy and paste the <strong>output text in the bottom box</strong> into Illustrator, and it seems to keep the joins correctly applied and the text appears the correct way round.</p>

<p>If it just pastes boxes, make sure a font that supports Arabic characters is selected, e.g. one of the web safe standard fonts - Verdana, Times, Georgia, Arial...</p>

<p>Note that illustrator still treats it like it's left-to-right text, so while it looks correct, editing it will feel strange if you normally type in Arabic. So, if you need to edit the Arabic text, I'd recommend doing the edits in a separate word processor, then copy into the above site, then copy into Illustrator. </p>

<p>You'll also need to set it to right-align. Basically, it seems to forcibly replace the characters with their appropriate joined ligatures. The software doesn't treat it as Arabic text, but the characters you are pasting are the correct joined forms of the characters.  </p>

<p>The one (non-software) example I have found (<a href=""http://visual.ly/house-democrats-health-plan-flow-chart"">http://visual.ly/house-democrats-health-plan-flow-chart</a>) suffers (perhaps deliberately to demonstrate complexity) from a lot of the same problems as the above...</p>

<p>Are there any examples out there of aesthetically pleasing software architecture diagrams, or at least infographics which show complex process flows which would be useful inspiration?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qDAID.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>I can't think of any especially good software architecture diagrams that haven't had the data they show heavily simplified and cut down, but we can find some relevant stuff by first breaking down what a software architecture diagram is. </p>

<p>Then, we'll look at some examples of designs that deal with similar challenges.</p>

<hr>

<p>It's a type of flow chart / process diagram with a focus on categories of element / node. That in turn is a type of node-link network diagram, with added directionality: essentially, nodes, which can have categories, and connections, which can have direction. </p>

<p>Anything based on node links can turn into a messy 'hairball' when the complexity of what it's trying to represent increases. If nothing suggested below based on node links works - if the thing in question is just too complex - here's <a href=""http://eagereyes.org/techniques/graphs-hairball"">an article by a respected data visualisation academic on some alternatives to the ""node-link"" concept as a base for network maps</a> that data visualisation researchers have come up with. If you can figure out how to adapt some of these into something user-friendly and directional, you could be on to a winner. But that's the <em>really hard</em> way to go, only try that if you have to.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>So, complex flow diagrams</strong> and network diagrams with an emphasis on direction/flow and categories of node/element. First basic principles: </p>

<ul>
<li>Keep every node/element simple </li>
<li>Make the differences between types of element clear and simple with a clear hierarchy between them</li>
<li>Make the flow and connectivity as much of a background element as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>Think of the <a href=""http://www.studiodino.com/info/news41.htm"">signal-to-noise</a> ratio (sometimes called the data-ink ratio in the context of information graphics): the connections are visual guides, not data, so make them as subtle as possible without making them less easy to follow. Also think of <a href=""http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=l0QPECGQySYC&amp;pg=PA96#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"">figure-ground</a>: the data should be the thing that is attended to in the foreground, the visual cues showing flow and category should be the background that people are aware of but not distracted by.</p>

<p>First example, a <a href=""http://inspirationlab.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/so-you-need-a-typeface/"">typography decision flowchart poster</a> (I'm sure some people will disagree with the content...). Using only black and white, it makes a complex diagram usable with a clear hierarchy between elements:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aaQNy.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CW9kC.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>It's very clear what each element is, using clear-but-subtle hightlighting and variation that adds minimal noise. The whole is complex but each part is clear. </p>

<p>Possible improvements - there's no overall direction, with it going from the middle out - the lines could have directional information without adding noise by being very small subtle dotted chevrons (like >>>>>) instead of dots, so you could start anywhere and see where to go next without those direction cues distracting.</p>

<p>Here's another similar example where the flow is moving through a hierarchy (most general > most specific). It turns a lot of categories into two types of node: products, and types, and the size of the node tells you the specificity of the type. (the circle outlines and connecting lines could be much much more subtle, but they seem to have been weighted to complement the type and give everything except the central pint glass a more even texture). The circle size also doubles as an indication of position and flow - you go from larger to smaller circles, so they don't need any other complexity-adding visual cues like arrowheads.</p>

<p>A lot of the work done by <a href=""http://popchartlab.com/"">PopChartLab</a> is relevant. They specialise in big posters showing lots of interconnected things, and they sometimes write up their process. Here's their <a href=""http://www.fastcodesign.com/1668928/the-only-chart-you-need-to-mix-a-proper-cocktail"">writeup of a project where they really struggled with the amount of things they wanted to show</a>. I personally don't much like the end result (they worked hard to tame the hairball, but the end result is still a hairball), but reading what they tried and what worked and what didn't could help.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jE1Kn.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><a href=""http://popchartlab.com/collections/prints/products/the-insanely-great-history-of-apple"">Here's an example</a> that makes neat use of placement on the page to show categories and order in flow. It doesn't need the blaring garish colour scheme (which is a reference to the subject matter, Apple's old rainbow coloured logo). Using the page x and y axis like this means it can save the connecting lines for other types of information.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qjg9F.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Finally, as I mentioned at the start, software architecture diagrams are an example of network maps, which are a type of map. So, you can get ideas from regular (cartographic) maps, which also have a similar problem of lots of categories of dense, complex information which often has connections and direction - constantly trying to stop your many signals turning into noise.</p>

<p><a href=""http://store.axismaps.co.uk/"">Axis Maps produce amazing typographic maps</a> that have some of the best signal-noise ratios of any information graphics I've seen, by simply using their labels as the things the labels label - then colour and a few subtle twists of typograohy and spacing to indicate category. </p>

<p>If you don't mind some extreme typography, this could probably be used to tame a flow chart that was getting out of control. Looks like painstaking work, but the results are awesome.</p>

","<p>There is no direct way to move <em>all the paths</em> of an Illustrator file to editable paths in Photoshop witha few easy commands. The best you can do is one path at a time.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can copy from Illustrator, then Paste in Photoshop as a shape layer. But you'll have to do that for each and every path of your Illustrator file, then reposition all the paths in Photoshop.</p></li>
<li><p>You can export your Illustrator file to a PSD to retain layers. But this will not retain editable vector paths.</p></li>
<li><p>You can ""Place"" the Illustrator file in Photoshop, but (as you pointed out) you place as a smart object which does not allow object-level editing within Photoshop.</p></li>

"How to change colour of all elements of a group, at once, in Illustrator","129838","","<p>I have a group of objects of the same colour, consisting of compound paths, regular paths and groups of these. How to change the colour of all objects at once? When I tried to use colour picker or change it through color palette the colour remained the same but the graphics was rendered with a very tiny outline of the new colour, which I guess is not printable. Usually I had to change the colour of all objects individually.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br>
I'm sorry if I was not too precise. I mean to apply new colour / swatch to all member objects of the group at once, not to change properties of a commonly shared swatch.  </p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong><br>
I received very useful answers, however my goal was to pick a colour from another object, serving as a source. When I tried to select all objects, for example with <kbd>ctrl-a</kbd>, and then use a eyedropper to pick up a desired colour, <strong>it didn't work for some objects</strong> in some groups. Please have a look at my answer where several methods are listed.</p>
","<p>The problem of not being able to colour all objects after 'traditional' 'select all' operation appears when the group has it's own appearance attribute (in appearance panel). It is because a group had applied a fill attribute to it, which was receiving all colour changes when whole group was selected, and this fill attribute was placed in Appearance pane <strong>BELOW</strong> the group contents. You can see in in the example below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BAQ8S.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">  </p>

<p>There are several ways of colouring all the objects at once:</p>

<ol>
<li>[Also suggested by @Lollero in the comment to his answer] Use the <strong>Direct Selection Tool</strong> (the white arrow) to select all the member objects and change the colour. If there is something below your group, double click it to enter the Isolation Mode and then do the selection. Works for groups with fill attribute above contents only if all objects are selected,</li>
<li>Using appearance attributes. In case of my group I could see the fill colour in the <strong>Appearance Panel</strong> and I could change the fill colour, but it didn't change the colour of the sub-objects. I realised that there were three ""layers/attributes"" in this panel in the following order: <em>1. Stroke, 2. Contents, 3. Fill</em>. What did help was to <strong>move <em>Fill</em> attribute above contents ""layer/attribute""</strong>. The other object I didn't have problems with didn't have those <em>Stroke</em> and <em>Fill</em> attributes (what was reflected in an empty circle next to it's name in Layers panel. My 'troublemaker' had this circle filled).</li>
<li>Avoiding appearance attributes. What also helped was to remove the abovementioned appearance atrributes by pressing <strong>Clear Appearance</strong> button at the bottom of Appearance Panel, and <strong>then pick a colour from the source object while holding Shift key</strong>, or apply new colour or swatch directly. Picking colour with Eyedropper without holding shift will add appearance attributes to the group and move the Fill below contents.</li>
<li>There is also @Scott's mentioned powerful technique of using ""<strong>Recolor Artwork</strong>"" function. Please see Scott's answer.</li>

"Is a Photoshop EPS file a vector format?","125681","","<p>If I save my file from Photoshop as a <code>Photoshop EPS</code> is that going to be okay as a vector across the board (ie will it be resizeable in whatever it's opened in)? I know if you open a <code>.psd</code> in Photoshop and resize the image, it holds it's quality, so that's fine, but when people need an EPS file because they might want to print it on the side of a building one day (or whatever) is a Photoshop EPS going to be okay? Or is there something else I need to be doing? </p>

<p>All my designs are always vectors within Photoshop, so text/shapes/designs done with the pen tool - I just need to know that they'll still be a vector for people who don't have Photoshop and can't open it in there to resize it.</p>
","<p>To a degree.....</p>

<p>With the exception of Live Type, Photoshop creates vector containers with raster fills. What this means is the edges of shape layers will remain crisp and clear when resized because the shape/vector layer edge is saved as a vector and it is recalculated when resized.</p>

<p>However, what is inside the shape layer is not vector. For example, if you create a shape/vector layer and then apply a pattern overlay, an inner glow, and a drop shadow, all those layer styles are not vector and will not scale infinitely. Layer styles are always raster and are bound by raster limitations.</p>

<p>Live type is vector and will remain vector and scalable when used in a Photoshop file and saved as an EPS. However, at times live type can be converted to outlines in eps files to maintain appearance. When converted to outlines, the type loses it's hinting properties and although it is vector, it may not look ideal at smaller sizes. Type is generally not a problem for anything above 12-14 points though.</p>

<p>As DA01 pointed out, eps is merely a file wrapper. Simply saving as an eps does not mean something is vector. EPS can contain 100% raster content or 100% vector content or a mix of the two. When using Photoshop, you <strong>always</strong> get a mix of the two if you have type and/or shape/vector layers. It is <strong>not possible</strong> to create a <strong>true</strong> vector file with any version Photoshop regardless of what you do.</p>

","<p>This is an excellent question, which has a rather unsatisfactory answer.</p>

<p>I know that more DPI means more quality image and thats why I want to use high DPI, but recently I read somewhere that for web banners we should use 72DPI. I just want to know if it is mandatory and does it affect negatively in any aspect?</p>
","<p>PPI (Pixels Per Inch) settings are not used in web images. Images on the web, retina displays or otherwise, are displayed by their pixel dimensions (width and height) not any PPI/DPI setting. In fact, many web images such as png, gif, jpg may not even store a ppi setting in their internal data and rely on width and height settings.</p>

<p>A 100 pixel x 100 pixel image displays as that on the web regardless of any PPI/DPI setting.</p>

<p>This is why images for retina displays are saved at 2x size, rather than an increased ppi setting. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density"">pixel density</a> of retina displays is higher however, they still display image at whatever the screen states is the width and height of an image not based on any PPI setting.</p>

<p>In reality, a monitor using a pixel density of 72ppi hasn't been seen since the early to mid 1980s. 72ppi hasn't been accurate for nearly 30 years. In fact, it was never accurate for Windows systems since Windows uses a default of 96ppi for pixel density.</p>

<p>Don't believe me? Try it for yourself. Create two images in Photoshop both 100 pixels by 100 pixels. Make one image 72ppi and the other 300ppi. Save them both for web.. are they any different in a web browser? Nope. They are both 100px by 100px images still.</p>

<p>DPI (Dots Per Inch) settings are only applicable when printing an image. DPI has no bearing on images destined for screen. DPI refers to the amount of ink dots/spots the press will place within an inch. Since no display on Earth uses ink, DPI is an incorrect term to use for anything related to display screens. </p>

<p>Be aware some mobile manufactures chose to use the term DPIx or xDPI which is sometimes shortened to simply DPI. This is <strong>not</strong> the traditional form of the acronym and the manufacturer has simply muddied the waters a great deal. If you see DPI in relation to mobile screen resolutions, they are speaking about <em>effective PPI</em> and not <em>really</em> referencing Dots Per Inch. A more appropriate acronym would have been xPPI or PPIx because mobile screens, like all displays, use pixels and not ink.</p>

<p><strong>It doesn't make any difference what ppi setting you use for web images. It's the (pixel) width and (pixel) height of an image which are important.</strong></p>

<p>When working with multiple images it's important to remain consistent. You will want all your images to be set at the same ppi to avoid resizing and scaling of aspects should you move pieces between images. Whether you choose to use 72, 96, 200 or 145.8 ppi doesn't matter, but all the images should be set the same.</p>

","<p>There are two forms of text objects.. Point text ( click and start typing) and Paragraph text (click-drag a box, then start typing).</p>

<p>Paragraph text contains a bounding box which can be resized.</p>

<p>Point text has no bounding box, therefore the bounding box can not be resized since it doesn't exist.</p>

<p><strong>If you have point text, but want a bounding box, highlight the text layer in the Layers Panel and choose Type > Convert to Paragraph Text from the menu</strong>. </p>

<p>This will create a bounding box around the text by converting the Point Text to Paragraph text.</p>

<p>To alter a bounding box size, insert the type I-beam cursor in the text so its blinking, then hover your cursor over an edge of the bounding box. The cursor will change to an arrow indicator letting you know you can click-drag to resize the bounding box.</p>

<p>You can also convert Paragraph text to Point Text the same way. The Type menu will display a ""Covert to Point Text"" item if you have a paragraph text layer highlighted in the Layers Panel.</p>

<p>Naturally, both sides of the print need to coincide exactly. However, after several attempts, it seems it's not working as expected: my printer seems to impose extra margins which mess up the alignment (which makes the printed area of the front side no longer coincide with the printed area of the back side). I already tried adding 1-2mm extra on all sides to allow some fluctuation, but this turns out to be insufficient. The difference seems to be always in the same direction, but strangely, moving the images around doesn't seem to change much -- as if the printer automatically corrects this.</p>

"How to change the file size of images without losing photo quality using Photoshop?","116707","","<p>I have a set of images of up to 20mb each, and I want to reduce the file size without losing quality. </p>

<p>How can I do it?</p>
","<p>Reducing the size is possible if your 20mb images are in an uncompressed format (RAW, BMP etc.). If you need to maintain the quality, you will need to use a so-called lossless compressor such as TIFF with LZW, PNG etc. JPEG will remove information and therefor also quality.</p>

<p>If you mean reducing the pixel size of an image it will always remove information, hence also remove quality. So this is not possible. You can apply techniques such as sharpening convolution to make it <em>appear</em> as if it is the same quality, but technically it will not be.</p>

<p>In either case you can create a batch script in Photoshop to do this for you. There are plenty of resources and tutorials on the net for this, so I won't write a new one. But have a look at for example this one:<br />

","<p>You don't specify if you're doing work for display (RGB) or for print (CMYK). That green, with its 100% saturation, would probably cause you problems when printing.</p>

<p>Illustrator is trying to help you. It's trying to keep you from using colors that cannot properly display or print. This is what color management does. The color that you are trying to select is outside the gamut of the color model that your CS6 applications all are now set to use. This was likely changed when you upgraded.</p>

<p>In the color picker screen, there are some controls that you probably never paid any attention to, which I have labeled in the attached image: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gn0FK.png"" alt=""Color picker""></p>

<ol>
<li>The little warning symbol to the left of the OK button appears when the color you're specifying is out of gamut.</li>
<li>The box showing what Illustrator suggests converting the color to, to stay within the color model. </li>
<li>A little box icon, which I think is supposed to represent a color model or something.</li>
<li>Another box, which on my CS5 shows the color that is specified in the picker, not the corrected one. Not sure why yours shows the corrected color; maybe CS6 is just EVEN MORE STRONGLY suggesting that you correct the color.</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to get Illustrator to accept the out-of-gamut color, click 3 or 4 (at least on CS5 I can click 4). You could possibly have an issue with that color displaying consistently across different displays. Since I don't know what you're designing, I can't say how good of an idea that might be. </p>

<p>Or, you can change your color profile. In Illustrator, it's under Edit > Color Settings. You'll probably need to read up on the arcana of color management to determine what is best for you.</p>

"How to add a DOUBLE outline to a text or a shape in Adobe Illustrator ?","112737","","<p>I am creating a logo and I would like to put a double outline on it, do you know any clever way to do it ?</p>
","<p><em>Edit: There was a better way to do Quick &amp; Dirty #1.  I have revised the answer with the improvement.  This is now my preferred method.</em></p>

<p>Like many Illustrator things, there are multiple ways to do this.</p>

<p><strong>The Quick &amp; Dirty Ways</strong></p>

<p>Use these methods if the outline object is at the bottom of your layer stack and transparency doesn't matter.</p>

<p><em>Quick &amp; Dirty #1</em> <strong>(Recommended)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Select your object and on the <code>Appearance</code> palette select the Menu and <code>Add new stroke</code></li>
<li>Select the new stroke on the <code>Appearance</code> palette and go to menu <code>Effect</code> &rArr; <code>Path</code> &rArr; <code>Offset Path</code> and offset it by a point or 2.</li>
<li>(Optional) If you want to reuse this style, open the <code>Graphic Styles</code> Palette and select the Menu and choose <code>New Graphic Style...</code></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Quick &amp; Dirty #2</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Copy &amp; Paste duplicates of your object above each other until you have 3 identical objects.</li>
<li>Make the lowest-layered object have a thick stroke.</li>
<li>Make the middle-layered object have a less-thick stroke in a different color.</li>
<li>Make the the top-layered object have the thinnest stroke.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you really need transparency, you can select your objects and <code>Outline Stroke</code> to form filled shapes.  Then subtract &amp; combine your shapes as appropriate to quickly create an outlined solid-fill shape object.</p>

<p><em>The ""Brush"" Way</em></p>

<p>This method is very flexible but takes more time to set up.  <strike>This is definitely the method you want to use if you will be using this border style in multiple places.</strike></p>

<ol>
<li>Make a <code>Art Brush</code>

<ol>
<li>Create multiple parallel lines (I find it easiest to start with horizontal lines)</li>
<li>Select your lines</li>
<li>Open your Brushes palette (F5).</li>
<li>Click the menu and select <code>New Brush...</code></li>
<li>Choose New Art Brush</li>
<li>Make sure the direction guide arrow is going the correct direction for your lines.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Apply your new <code>Brush</code> to the object that you want outlined

<ol>
<li>Select your object.</li>
<li>Click on your newly created brush on the <code>Brushes</code> palette.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Creating your own brush is simple and powerful for basic shapes like lines or easy curves.  If your object has many corners you will need to edit your brush to include the correct way to form corners.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> Afterthought.  If you're making a complex shape that needs outlines, you're going to need to create a <code>Pattern Brush</code> to accommodate corners, you can't do this with an <code>Art Brush</code>.  To create a <code>Pattern Brush</code>, you need to create each of your corner &amp; side situations and then create pattern swatches.  You then use the pattern swatches to create your <code>Pattern Brush</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's the easiest way I know of to make your pattern brush:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make tiles for each of the required tiles (Outer Corner, Inner Corner, Start, Side, End).<br>
Keep in mind that the tiles need to align with each other on shapes so it may help to create squares and build your tiles in the squares.  In the below image, I made my bounding squares blue so you can see them.  When I use them to create swatches in the next step I will remove the stroke from the squares.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oyK1O.png"" alt=""Example tiles for pattern brush""></p></li>
<li><p>Drag each of your tiles up to your <code>Swatches</code> palette to make pattern swatches.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SAl0H.png"" alt=""Pattern swatches in my palette""></p></li>
<li><p>Make a new pattern brush and assign your swatches to each of the appropriate tiles.<br>
You may need to adjust your scaling if you made your pattern at a much larger size than its intended use case.<br>
(Note also that the end-tile indicator is misleading.  The End tile should be pointed the same direction as your start tile, as if they were the same object.  The dialog seems to indicate that it should be faced the opposite direction but this is incorrect.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6ErBe.png"" alt=""Pattern brush options""></p></li>
<li><p>Apply your pattern to shapes to test it out.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VaB01.png"" alt=""Pattern brush applied to shapes""></p></li>
<li><p>When you apply it to a font, you may need to clean up the anchors a bit where they are too close together (depending on the scale of your pattern).  For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Here's a B from Font to Outlines with no cleanup (using my example brush stroke):</li>
</ul>

"What kind of black should I use when designing for CMYK print?","109625","","<p>My question is what kind of black should I use when printing. At the moment I use this black (split into CMYK):</p>

<pre><code>C:0%
M:0%
Y:0%
K:100%
</code></pre>

<p>It looks fine in InDesign or Illustrator but if I save a PDF file (for printing purposes) the ""color"" black appears more like a dark grey <strong>on screen</strong>.</p>

<p>My question is, if I send this file to print, the color black, <strong>on paper</strong>, will be black or something like dark grey?</p>
","<p>It's one of the Big Things You Must Know about printing that Black (0,0,0,100) is <em>not</em> black; it is a dark gray. I mean really important, as in ""If you don't know this, you're going to get in expensive trouble sooner or later."" The reason it's gray, rather than black, is that the ink is partially absorbed by the paper and is in any case a very thin coating, so some of the white shows through.</p>

<p>To get actual black on press, you must create what is called a ""built black"" or ""rich black."" This is usually something like 60/60/40/100, or 40/30/30/100 as Matt mentioned. You can make a warmer black by using less cyan and more yellow, or a cooler black with more cyan and less yellow. That's a subtlety you want to get some practice with if you ever need to use it, because it can be tricky.</p>

<p>In InDesign and Illustrator there is a preference setting called ""Appearance of Black"" which can be set to display blacks ""as black"" or ""accurately."" For print work, you should <em>always</em> set these to display and print blacks accurately so you don't make an embarrassing error.</p>

<p>The main thing to remember with rich blacks is that your mix should always add up to less than 300% coverage (or whatever your printer specifies as their maximum ink coverage for the particular paper your job will be printed on). Too much ink results in ""bronzing"" -- a bronze sheen created by a layer of ink that can't be absorbed by the substrate, so it just sits on top. It's also almost impossible to dry completely, so you'll add time to the job. </p>

<p>This is why you must <em>never</em> use the [Registration] swatch in a layout. [Registration] is 100% <em>everything</em>: CMYK plus any spot color plates. Registration marks are the only place [Registration] swatch is used, but they are in the slug, not in your artwork. Your layout program does this for you automatically when you export to PDF and select the option to include registration marks.</p>

<p>Here's an instance where this subject can get very important: if you have a photograph with a black background and you place it on a 0/0/0/100 background, thinking they will merge invisibly, you are actually placing RGB black (which <em>is</em> a rich black when converted to CMYK -- check it out in Photoshop) on top of dark gray.

","<h2>Illustrator</h2>

<ul>
<li>Make certain you <strong>open</strong> any new document in CMYK color mode. Yes <strong>open</strong> in CMYK, don't <em>switch</em> to CMYK if you opened an RGB document by mistake. Many things in Illustrator are dependent upon the document color mode. The Swatches, symbols, graphic styles, brushes, are all built to match the Document Color Mode. Switching color modes mid-stream does not change these items. Only opening a document in the proper color mode generates library items in the proper color mode. If you have work in an RGB document and need to print it, Copy/Paste to a CMYK document and then adjust coloring as needed. Do not simply change the Document Color Mode.</li>
<li>Turn on Overprint Preview in the view menu (if it isn't already on).</li>
<li>Ensure Document Raster Effects setting (Effect Menu) is set to 300ppi</li>
<li>Ensure all linked or embedded raster images are in CMYK format at 300ppi (as well as other Photoshop requirements)</li>
<li>Ensure all blacks are accurate. Whether using rich black or greyscale black, ensure objects are correct. And for heaven's sake <em>change the preferences</em> to always display and always output blacks <strong>accurately</strong>. I dislike Adobe's default settings. They are a recipe for error where print production is concerned in my opinion.</li>
<li>Ensure you have proper bleeds for any full-artboard projects.</li>
<li>If using spot colors and transparency, stop. Don't. If you need transparency, then convert all spots to CMYK otherwise don't use transparency (other than clipping and opacity masks).</li>
<li>For Illustrator-only projects it can, at times, be beneficial to simply rasterize entire artboards and save as a CMYK .tiff. This depends greatly on the artwork. However with really complex vector illustrations it can ensure printing is correct. Obviously when doing this you loose any spot color so it's only an option when working with CMYK.</li>
<li>While not required, using Global swatches for CMYK colors can be <strong>very</strong> helpful. You can double-click a Global swatch and change its color build to change all colors in the artwork. This only works with Global Swatches.</li>
<li>Use the Flattener Preview to verify the artwork will flatten as expected. You may need to expand appearances or flatten pieces of art on some occasions. I just recently had to rasterize a masthead to assit a print provider in outputting it properly.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Photoshop</h2>

<ul>
<li>In general, Photoshop merely requires you to ensure the document is the proper resolution and the color profile is correct. If you've calibrated your system properly there's traditionally little more to worry about for straight CMYK projects.</li>
<li>If using filters or items which require RGB mode, then work in RGB and convert to CMYK as the final step before outputting the image. This step is dependent upon proper color settings.</li>
<li>For 6 or 8 color, or any spot color project there can be other concerns depending upon inter-application workflows. For example, if you are using Spot colors in Photoshop and also using those same spot colors in Illustrator or Indesign, you'll want spot color channels in Photoshop. This is so upon output all spots are on the correct plates. I won't go into the creation of spot channels in Photoshop since, that in itself, is an entire topic.</li>
<li>If taking a Spot channel Photoshop document to Illustrator, you need to use the DCS2 format when saving so Illustrator can properly read the spot channels. If going to Indesign from Photoshop, you can use .psd, .eps, .pdf, or .dcs2.</li>
<li>There are other things which may need addressed - color correction of photos is a big one, especially photos containing people. However I feel that too is a topic unto itself. There are tricks, for example, people should generally have 3% more yellow in their skin tone than they do magenta. This prevents a ""rosy"" appearance for people.</li>
<li>ensure you have proper bleeds for images.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Indesign</h2>

<p>(Some of this relates to QuarkXpress as well)</p>

<ul>
<li>Again ensure the preferences are set to always display and output blacks <strong>accurately</strong></li>
<li>Placed raster images should be 100% and not rotated within Indesign. If you need to rotate an image or scale it, then note the degree of alteration, go back to Photoshop and apply those alterations and reimport the image. For optimum output all placed raster images should not be scaled or rotated. In all fairness, this is one of those items that has some wiggle room. A minor adjustment probably won't cause any real issues. However large scaling and rotations of placed raster images can effect the output of those raster images.</li>
<li>Turn on Overprint Preview in the view menu.</li>
<li>Ensure you have proper bleeds for pages.</li>
<li>Always a good idea to run Preflight before exporting to PDFx. This will show any missing fonts or RGB images or other issues.</li>
<li>Do not use rich black for small ""body copy"" text. If body text is black, just use 100% K. (this would hold true for Illustrator as well if you are using that as a layout application with smaller text.)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>In general</h2>

<ul>
<li>Accurate color profiling of any system is imperative. If you accurately profile your system then you will traditionally see on screen what is going to be output.</li>
<li>Ask what your printer prefers for rich black. Every printer is different. They will have their own mix fo rich black. Use that mix for black when needed. Side note: if you accurately color profile your system and the app color management is set up properly, you'll get rich blacks in many areas. These can be okay to use if you don't know your printer's mix. The printer can convert but maintain numbers if they know what they are doing. if they don't know what they are doing, any rich black is better than none.</li>
<li>Get color proofs where possible, especially for large jobs or those 6 and 8 color jobs you asked about. Printers have moved into the ""internet"" age as well and will often want to simply supply online PDF proofs. These are okay to check for drop offs. However, <strong>you can't color-proof a PDF</strong>. Ask for a color proof or Chromakey if you feel color is imperative. They can be FedEx'ed overnight (yeah they cost a bit). They are well worth it for some jobs.</li>
<li>Develop a good report with all print providers where possible. So many issues can be corrected by a simple phone call or email before a job is run. If the print provider knows you, he's more willing to stop and check than simply run the job and then re-bill when he has to rerun it.</li>
<li>The mark of a good printer is not how well things go when there are no problems. The mark of a good printer is how things are handled when there is an issue.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>I'm sure I've missed a thing or two but this is a general outline.</p>

<hr>

<p>With respect to ""test prints"" there's really little you can do for many files. Unless you've got a very high end printer and you are creating files for digital presses, nothing you do in an office/home office is going to come close to a commercial platemaker and press.</p>

<p>I run prints through a simple monochrome laser printer (postscript level 3) to ensure alignment of objects if needed. Or to physically see text sizes rather than merely estimating based on the screen. Printing a page here or there can also assist in checking balance and readability from a distance. That's about as far as I go for ""test"" printing.</p>

<p>Each project is unique. It's difficult to give blanket guidelines for any ""CMYK"" printing. </p>

<p>If creating a booklet, brochure, or something which will involve die cutting and/or bindery I will make a miniature mockup in order to verify folds are correct and page placement is correct. Just bank sheets of paper folded and cut to match a scale model of the final piece. I then scribble on the pages of the mock up to indicate page direction and order.</p>

"How can I add perspective to something using Illustrator?","105976","","<p>I was trying to recreate this kind of image in Adobe Illustrator. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/i1g8Y.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I had tried perspective grid tools in Illustrator as well as blend options, but couldn't get the proper result.  How can I create this using the perspective tool?</p>
","<p>As <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/a/20305/408"">Scott already mentioned</a>, you want to draw this flat first. Drawing in perspective is much more difficult, and why put yourself through it if you don't have to?</p>

<p>I created this first:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5g9qE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I then grouped these shapes together and made copies of it (in order to create one long horizontal shape).</p>

<p>Now I know you mentioned you've worked with the perspective tool before, but try the following:</p>

<p>Go to <code>View -&gt; Perspective Grid</code>. This should bring up a perspective grid like so:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9nAlq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now select your shape and go to <code>Object -&gt; Perspective -&gt; Attach to Active Plane</code> and then use the <code>Perspective Selection Tool</code> <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> and drag your shape around. You should see it conform to the current plane. Now simple adjust to taste.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IFNrO.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>There you go! You can always hide/show the grid again by pressing <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd></p>

<p>The perspective tool may seem pretty complex and scary at first, but once you get used to it is incredibly useful. Make sure you do some more research about it to get the most out of it, because it really is the best way to build shapes with perspective.</p>

"What are the more respected sans serif fonts that come standard on most computers?","104564","","<p>I've been tasked with making a powerpoint theme for the company I work for and one of the requirements is that it uses a font that comes standard with most computers. What are some of the built-in sans serif fonts that graphic designers respect and use more frequently?</p>
","<p>Of the original ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web"">web-safe</a>"" (that is, as close to universal as you'll get on the Web) sans-serifs (Arial, Impact, Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, Verdana), <strong>Verdana</strong> tends to get the most love. It's well-designed and is designed to be readable on the screen. It was designed by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Carter"">Matthew Carter</a>, a respected typeface designer, and the design itself is pretty original, so it doesn't get panned for its existence and history as much as <a href=""http://www.ms-studio.com/articles.html"">Arial does</a>. Also, MoMA <a href=""http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2011/01/24/digital-fonts-23-new-faces-in-moma-s-collection"">added it to its design collection</a>, calling it (and the others in the collection) ""a milestone in the history of typography"". A <a href=""http://www.lens101.com/july-2010/125041-scientists-claim-verdana-best-typeface.html"">scientific study</a> (funded by Microsoft, so take with a grain of salt) touted Verdana's readability, particularly at small sizes. It was one of the first fonts that was designed with readability on the screen particularly in mind, so it has a large x-height (good for seeing the lowercase letters) and is well-hinted. These advantages will become <a href=""http://www.nngroup.com/articles/serif-vs-sans-serif-fonts-hd-screens/"">less relevant as pixel density increases</a>, but they're good things to look for in a screen font for now.</p>

<p>Arial is almost universally panned by designers (see above link), Impact isn't practical outside of headlines, and even though <strong>Tahoma</strong> is more or less Verdana's skinny brother, it doesn't tend to draw as much praise. I've personally never minded <strong>Trebuchet</strong> as a choice, but it doesn't seem to be as common.</p>

<p>If you're using Office 2007 or later, the <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/cleartype.aspx"">ClearType</a> collection comes into play. Three sans-serifs are available: <strong>Calibri</strong>, <strong>Candara</strong>, and <strong>Corbel</strong>. Everything I've read about and them adds to my personal opinion - they're good fonts to use. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibri"">Wikipedia</a> told me that ""<a href=""http://www.tdc.org/news/2005Results/index.html"">Calibri won the TDC2 2005 award from the Type Directors Club under the Type System category.</a>""</p>

<p>If you have the right version of Publisher (ours was 2003), there are some extra fonts available. I'm not as knowledgeable about this, but I know that Publisher was the reason we ended up with <strong>Franklin Gothic</strong> on our PCs, and that is an excellent choice of a sans-serif.</p>

<p>I'll add a disclaimer - as John notes, you can embed fonts. If a font is not embedded, you're always at the mercy of someone else's system, and no font has 100% saturation everywhere.</p>

"How do I create a billboard that is larger than Indesign CS5's maximum document size?","102799","","<p>I am making a billboard with this dimensions : 2.19m x 6.09m
However, indesign's maximum document size is 5486.4 mm (5.48m)</p>

<p>How do I increase this document size or is the another way to handle this problem?</p>
","<p>You should be talking to your billboard company or at least working from the information on their website. That's the short and critically important answer. The rest is based on my own experience here in the US, but should apply equally to your area.</p>

<p>Billboards are <em>never</em> created at full scale in the authoring application, in my experience. For example, one size I am regularly asked for is a standard 14 foot tall x 48 foot wide (6 m x 16 m, roughly) ""bulletin."" These days, I work from an InDesign document that is 27 inches by 72 inches (1.8 m x .7 m, very roughly). That is 1/8th scale, which is a little large but is still quite easy to work with in InDesign. It means that my effective image resolution for images needs to be around 80 ppi or better to be sure of getting 10 ppi output, and I don't need to worry about the text or other vector data. (That ""10 ppi"" is not a typo. It's quite high resolution for a billboard of that size, which is viewed from a <em>minimum</em> distance of 50 m. The billboard company spec in this case is 9 ppi.)</p>

<p>Billboards are commonly done in Photoshop -- that's how I used to do them prior to CS5 -- but always small scale at high resolution. 1/48th scale, even 1/96th scale, at 300 ppi is not uncommon. Companies and products vary. The billboard company I mentioned suggests 1/33th scale at 300 ppi for one of their products, to meet that target resolution of 9 ppi.</p>

<p>The final resolution on the vinyl is typically between 8 and 25 dots per inch, depending on the size and intended viewing distance, so there is no reason at all to work at full scale and 300 ppi, even if you could. You would end up with an enormous file that would be mostly wasted, and might not even be usable by the RIP (""Raster Image Processor"" -- the software that processes your file for printing).</p>

<p>The provider will scale your PDF to the final size. Ask them what they need. When you do, have them send you their PDF .joboptions file and the color profile for their digital printing equipment. That way, the colors you see in InDesign will match what actually goes up on the billboard.</p>

<p>Don't feel like you are going to look naive or foolish by asking. The first time I sent artwork to one national billboard company, I got an immediate phone call back. They were excited and astonished because it was the <em>first time</em> they had <em>ever</em> received artwork from an outside designer that they didn't have to fix or send back for correction. This company is all over the US and has been in business for decades. All I did was research their requirements on their website and follow a template that they supplied. That, apparently, was enough to make me a hero.</p>

<p>So you won't seem foolish if you ask. You'll be a hero. Trust me.</p>

<p>Fonts can make a difference, however.

"Is there a way to copy guides from one Photoshop document to another?","97126","","<p>I'm using Photoshop CS5. I have a PSD file. We'll say it's 600x400. I have guides set up at, let's say, 100 pixels over and 27 pixels down, which I am using to position a layer correctly.</p>

"Gimp - Using an image as the transparency layer of another image","94888","","<p>I have two images (For the sake of simplicity, Image1 and Image2). I want to use Image2 as a transparency for Image1.</p>

<p>How can I do that? Assume I've done little more with Gimp than play with some filters.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>OK, so I assume you have two images: a normal image that you want to add transparency to, and a grayscale image that you want to use as its alpha (transparency) channel, something like these:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qabMm.jpg"" alt=""Base image without transparency"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sR374.png"" alt=""Alpha mask for image""><br>
<sup>(Base image based on <a href=""http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1292959"" rel=""noreferrer"">this photo by John Fielding</a>, used under the <a href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/"" rel=""noreferrer"">CC-By-SA 2.0 license</a>; alpha mask created by me using the GIMP's Sphere Designer tool.)</sup></p>

<p>There are several ways to do this; let me describe a few of them.</p>

<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Open both images in the GIMP.
Select the grayscale image and copy it to the clipboard (<em>Edit &rarr; Copy</em> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>).
On the base image, select <em>Layer &rarr; Mask &rarr; Add Layer Mask...</em> (also available by right-clicking the layer in the Layers dialog).  It doesn't matter what you choose as the mask, since we'll be replacing it shortly.</p>

<p>The layer mask you just added should be selected for editing; if not, select it with <em>Layer &rarr; Mask &rarr; Edit Layer Mask</em> (or just click the mask in the Layers dialog).  Paste the grayscale image in (<em>Edit &rarr; Paste</em> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>) and anchor the resulting floating selection into the mask (<em>Layers &rarr; Anchor Layer</em> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd>, or click the Anchor icon in the Layers dialog).</p>

<p>Optionally, turn the layer mask into an actual alpha channel using <em>Layer &rarr; Mask &rarr; Apply Layer Mask</em> (but simply exporting the image as PNG will do that for you).</p>

<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Open the images as layers (<em>File &rarr; Open as Layers...</em>) or just paste one as a new layer into the other.  With the grayscale image layer visible, open the Channels dialog, right-click one of the Red/Green/Blue channels (they should all be identical) and select <em>Channel to Selection</em>.  Invert the selection with <em>Select &rarr; Invert</em> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>.</p>

<p>Select the base image layer in the Layers dialog.  Add an alpha channel for it with <em>Layers &rarr; Transparency &rarr; Add Alpha Channel</em> if it doesn't have one already, and then cut the selection away from the layer (<em>Select &rarr; Cut</em> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>).</p>

<p><strong>Method 3:</strong> As method 2, but after <em>Channel to Selection</em>, don't invert the selection, but simply use <em>Layer &rarr; Mask &rarr; Add Layer Mask...</em> on the base image layer and choose ""Selection"" from the dialog.  Then optionally apply the mask as in method 1.</p>

<p>In any case, whichever method you used, the result should look like this (actual transparent PNG on left, with checkered background on right):  </p>

"How to select more layers with GIMP?","94110","","<p>In Adobe Photoshop I am able to select multiple layers at once with Shift+Click.</p>

<p>How can I do that in GIMP?</p>
","<p>It's not possible. The only thing you can do is link layers together or merge them. How to link layers <a href=""http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/gimptutorials/a/link-layers.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">information here</a>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JFxDV.png"" alt=""Link layers""></p>

<hr/>

<p>Instead, there are several alternative methods of handling multiple layers, each appropriate to a different task. You can chain layers to move or transform them, shift-click objects on different layers in the canvas to align them, or create a new layer based on all visible layers.</p>

<p>Instructions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Chaining Layers:</strong></p>
  
  <p>1) Make sure the Layers dialog box is open. If it is not, click on the Windows menu and select ""Dockable Dialogs"" > ""Layers."" You can
  also hold down the ""Ctrl"" key and press ""L.""</p>
  
  <p>2) Hover your mouse between the Layer Visibility icon, which looks like an eye, and the layer thumbnail. A raised box will appear.
  Click this box to activate the chain.</p>
  
  <p>3) Repeat this process on all of the other layers you wish to chain together. Once these layers are chained, you can move or apply
  transformation effects to all of them simultaneously.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Selecting for Alignment</strong></p>
  
  <p>4) Make sure the Toolbox is open. If it is not, click on the Windows menu and select ""Toolbox."" You can also hold down the ""Ctrl""
  key and press ""B.""</p>
  
  <p>5) Click on the Alignment Tool in the Toolbox. It looks like an empty rectangle with arrows pointing away from all sides of it.</p>
  
  <p>6) Press and hold the ""Shift"" key while clicking on the layers in the canvas. Or click somewhere off the layers and drag a selection
  rectangle around them. Once you have selected these layers, you can
  choose an alignment method.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Merging Visible Layers</strong></p>
  
  <p>7) Make sure the Layers dialog box is open. If it is not, click on the Windows menu and select ""Dockable Dialogs"" > ""Layers."" You can
  also hold down the ""Ctrl"" key and press ""L.""</p>
  
  <p>8) Click on the Visibility icon on any layer you do not want to include in your new layer. This will render that layer invisible.</p>
  
  <p>9) Click on the Layers menu and select ""New from Visible.""</p>
  
  <p>10) Select the option that best describes how you want the layers to be merged from the dialog box that appears, and click ""Merge."" This
  will merge all of the visible layers into a new layer but will not
  affect your original layers.</p>

"Photoshop: Select item and crop it directly","93821","","<p>I'd like to know if this is possible with Photoshop CS4 :</p>

<ol>
<li>Select an item with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> (on windows).</li>
<li>Crop it directly, without selecting the item manually.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is possible?</p>
","<p>In order to crop to a specific layer there are three different methods that I would use:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Duplicate the desired layer to a new file by Right Clicking on the layer in the Layers Panel, selecting <code>Duplicate Layer</code>, changing the document to <code>New</code>. Once you go into the new document you can select <code>Image &gt; Trim</code>, and select <code>Based on Transparent Pixels</code> (keep everything checked for <code>Trim Away</code>. (you can do this in the same file as well, but it does require you to hide all other layers, which can be exhaustive.)</p></li>
<li><p>Another solution is to do the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd> trick on the layer, specifically on the thumbnail of that layer. Then just go to <code>Image &gt; Crop</code>. This is the quickest way to do it, but you have to make sure layers behind the object are hidden. If you set your Crop Tool to a keyboard shortcut then it's really just a quick Click and Keyboard Shortcut and you're done.</p></li>
<li><p>The last possibility is a special trick I use for any items that are all the same size. For example if I have a mobile device screen that I want to save as an image without the environment displayed around it. You can make a rectangle shape overlaid on top of the screen and quickly do the same <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click on the layer thumbnail</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> afterwards. The rectangle shape layer ends up being a tool but doesn't contribute to the visuals themselves, so make sure that layer has 0% transparency or is just simply hidden at the time of the cropping.</p></li>

","<p>First of all, you need to understand that Photoshop is a raster based tool, so you can't get the same smoothness you get in vector based tools like illustrator or flash. But you can create a smart object to achieve that smoothness in your vector shape. The advantage of using smart objects is that you can resize them (make them bigger, they may lose some quality but are still manageable).</p>

"How can I stop or disable anti-aliasing / feathering in Photoshop?","92597","","<p>I've never really found a solution to an issue that's been plaguing me since I first experienced it in Photoshop CS, and now, five versions later, it's still bugging me!</p>

<p>What is it?
Well, seemingly randomly, Photoshop decides that when I use the solid fill bucket, or the pencil tool to ""paint"" something within a marquee selection, it will either ""feather"" whatever I'm doing to the pixels outside of the marquee, or ""anti-alias"" the inside border pixels of the marquee.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I actually want this to occur, but it doesn't regardless of what I do (and I end up using the eraser tool with a low opacity to recreate it)
and then sometimes, when I really don't want it to occur, it does.</p>

<p>Here's an example screenshot of what I'm talking about:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tq0OT.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>See how it's randomly added pixels outside of the select?
(The selection was drawn with the poly marquee tool, with feather set to ""0"" - the green colour was added with the pencil tool, with <code>normal</code> mode and opacity set to <code>100</code>, and size set to <code>70px</code>).</p>

<p>This MUST be a setting somewhere that I've totally missed, and it's driving me barmey!</p>

<p><strong>Please could you advise me on how to disable anti-aliasing in Photoshop?</strong></p>
","<p>Firsly feathering and anti-aliasing have different meanings, though for small a feathering radius the results are similar. ""Feathering"" effectively means fading the selection boundary out slowly, and is slightly different to ""anti-aliasing"" which means using intermediate values to smooth out jagged edges. </p>

<p>You need to turn anti-aliasing off in addition to setting the feather to zero to get what you want, which is a sharp rigid boundary. There should be a checkbox in the tool palette, next to the feather radius box:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZzTq8.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>(screen shot is from a very old version of Photoshop!)</p>

<p>It's worth noting the black and white ""marching ants"" selection border only ever shows the 50% threshold of the selection, and is therefor just a guide. If you save the selection to an alpha channel you can see the selection opacities of every pixel, and thus see your actual selection.</p>

<p>Now when I select the object(s) and hit command, the resize box/bars don't come up.  I'm sure there's just a setting that I'm overlooking, but I can't find it. </p>

<p>Can anyone help me, please?  <strong>The resize handles aren't showing up when I select an object and hit the command key.</strong></p>

<p>This is the second time that this has happened to me now, and the first time, it got corrected somehow on its own.  (Or I unwittingly did it, ofc.)  Thanks in advance.</p>

","<p>Long story short, <code>.eps</code> is the slow cousin of <code>.pdf</code>. Use <code>.pdf</code>.</p>

<p>Since you said that <code>""it always comes with a full white background""</code>, I'm assuming that you tried viewing the <code>.pdf</code> in acrobat ( or any other preview thingie you might have used ), which showed you a white background. I'd say that pretty much every <code>.pdf</code> capable viewing application has a default setting that shows a white background for convenience.</p>

<p>You can just try opening the <code>.pdf</code> in some editing application like Illustrator or Indesign or Photoshop to make sure, or In Acrobat settings <code>Cmd+K</code> > Page display > Transparency grid, you can turn on the view that shows you the transparency grid that is much like the one Photoshop has.</p>

"What is the difference between CMYK and RGB? Are there other color spaces I should know?","86983","","<p>I'm a photographer, who dabbles in graphic design from time to time as well. What are the differences between the various color spaces?</p>
","<p><strong>RGB is a <em>additive, projected light</em> color system.</strong> All colors begin with black ""darkness"", to which different color ""lights"" are added to produce visible colors. RGB ""maxes"" at white, which is the equivalent of having all ""lights"" on at full brightness (red, green, blue).</p>

<p><strong>CMYK is a <em>subtractive, reflected light</em> color system.</strong> All colors start with white ""paper"", to which different color ""inks"" are added to absorb (subtract) light that is reflected. In theory, CMY are all you need to create black (applying all 3 colors at 100%). Alas, that usually results in a muddy, brownish black, so the addition of K (black) is added to the printing process. It also makes it easier to print black text (since you don't have to register 3 separate colors). </p>

<p>Most screens (computer, phone, media player, television, ect) are RGB (e-ink screens being an exception), the pixels have little subpixels that just show red, green or blue. </p>

<p>Most printers print in CMYK color (though some photo printers will print with expanded colors beyond those 4).</p>

<p>So if you're ever doing something for a screen, use RGB, if you doing something for print, use CMYK.</p>

<p>Update: Please keep in mind, that you can't display the exact same colors in RGB and CMYK. </p>

"Photoshop: how to reduce the size of a PNG for web use","86331","","<p>I have a PNG file that is 2042 x 1250 and is 6.1 MB. When I open with Photoshop and do <em>""Save As > PNG 24""</em> and choose the compressed file size of the two options (the other being no compression) I still get an image that is on the order of a few MB, which, since it is going to be a web asset, I would like to be in the KB and not the MB's. How do I go about intelligently compressing this image to a ballpark range of a few thousand KB?</p>
","<p><strong>The geeky details (you did not ask for)</strong></p>

<p>Some image formats, such as JPG, support <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lossy Compression</a>. When a Lossy Compressed image is saved and then rendered back, the image is not 100% exactly as you designed it but just ""close"" to it, sort of a sketch. Some of the original detail is <em>lost</em>. Since there is no expectation of accuracy, the Lossy Compressed images have the luxury of storing little information about the original design, resulting in small files. They even allow you to specify how accurate the result should be: the less accurate the result needs to be, the smaller the file is.</p>

<p>On the other hand the PNG format, by design, supports <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_compression"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lossless Compression</a>. This means that after the image is saved in a file, when it is rendered back all the pixels are rendered exactly as you designed them without <em>losing</em> any detail. This is great, but unfortunately it means that it has to store a lot of information to render the image perfectly, resulting on big files.</p>

<p>The PNG does its intelligent thing to optimize the information it needs before saving it into a file but you cannot specify, like you do with JPGs, how compressed or accurate you want the file to be. The result is as is and you have no control on how big the file will be.</p>

<p><strong>Some suggestions</strong></p>

<p>Having said that, there are a few things you could do to try to get a smaller file.</p>

<ul>
<li>Big areas of flat colours compress better than complex patterned areas. See if you can simplify your image.</li>
<li>Do you have a lot of negative space around the image? Try to trim it down to a minimum.</li>
<li>Are you using transparency? If not, consider saving the image as a JPG instead. </li>
<li>If you can't save it as a JPG for any reason, but aren't using transparency, then untick ""transparency"" from the saving options. This will shave a bit of bites from your final result.</li>
<li>Consider cutting the image in parts and composing it in the final HTML, like some sort of puzzle. You could save the parts that require transparency as PNGs and the other parts as highly compressed JPGs. The total result should be less heavy.</li>
<li>Use a PNG compressing tool (e.g. <a href=""https://tinypng.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://tinypng.com/</a>). Mind you, these tools use a lossy algorithm. They try to simplify your image in order to be able to save it as a smaller file. They do reduce the size of your file dramatically but the end result might loose too much detail. You can always try them and judge the result depending on the application.</li>
</ul>

"Footnote/Endnote references before or after punctuation? (comma, full stop/period, semi-colon...)","85306","","<p>Simple question: what's the convention (or, if there's disagreement, guiding principles) for where to place reference, footnote and endnote numbers that apply to a clause leading up to a punctuation mark such as a comma or full stop/period?</p>

<p>E.g. in this example, should it be like [1] and [2], or like [a] and [b]?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet<sup>[1]</sup>, consectetur adipisicing elit,<sup>[a]</sup> sed do
  eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua<sup>[2]</sup>. Ut enim ad
  minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut
  aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.<sup>[b]</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before the punctuation looks seriously ugly, but after can make there seem to be a disconnect between the reference and what it refers to.</p>
","<p>This seems to be refreshingly clear and simple. The note reference characters go after the punctuation mark, like [a] and [b] above, unless it's a spacing punctuation mark like a dash. Seems to be pretty universally agreed.</p>

<p>Here's what the esteemed <a href=""http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chicago Manual Of Style</a> (<em>subscription required, so, second-hand quote, from 14th ed. 1993, Clause 15.8, p. 494)</em> says about the matter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The superior numerals used for note reference numbers in the text
  should follow any punctuation marks except the dash, which they
  precede. The numbers should also be placed outside closing
  parentheses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I can tell, the only disagreement with this convention is the optional preference by some to add kerning rules that pull the reference note back to overhang over low-hanging punctuation marks (commas and full stops/periods), presumably to reduce the 'disconnect' I mentioned in my question. Looks great, pain to do. </p>

<hr>

<p>Common sense note: take care to avoid there being a space between the punctuation mark and reference. This also means: take care that the note reference doesn't break over new lines separately to the preceding content. For example, do...</p>

<pre><code>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,[a] consectetur adipisicing 
elit,[b] sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore 
aliqua[c] - fugiat nulla pariatur.
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,[a] consectetur adipisicing elit,
[b] sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore aliqua
[c] - fugiat nulla pariatur.

How can I make the background truly transparent, so it is just smoke on a transparent background? Colour Range selection is useless in this scenario, because smoke needs different levels of transparency throughout, and not just a clear cut selection. Thanks</p>
","<p>You don't see the transparency effect if there's nothing below the layer because there's nothing there for Photoshop to calculate (all these blend modes involve calculations based on the values of the corresponding pixels on each layer), so it just shows you the image.</p>

<p>In this particular case (as Farray pointed out while I was writing this!), you can pull an easy trick on Photoshop and make yourself a smoke-filled image with all the transparency intact. It's easy because you already have gray smoke on black, just like a channel.</p>

<p>Here's what you start with: I've taken a ""smoke on black"" image (Layer 1) and applied it in Screen mode over an arbitrary background (Layer 0).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q4Khp.png"" alt=""Smoke on a background""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vWjGZ.png"" alt=""Selection""></p>

<p>What you've just done is load a selection based on the grayscale values in the channel you chose. Just like a mask, white is fully selected (opaque) and black is fully unselected (transparent), with the gray shades between.</p>

<p>Step 3. Create a new, blank layer, set your foreground color to white, and fill the selection. Hide all the other layers.</p>

  <p>I mostly did this to start with a fresh workspace so that I could begin again with my own methods. Also, in this particular instance, a clipping path isn't necessary because both the image and the texture are black and white, so the blending modes we're going to use will not leave any noisy artefacts on the background.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Change the <code>Blend Mode</code> on the texture image layer to <code>Darker Color</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This will go a little of the way towards achieving the effect, but it's too weak at the moment.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Now, this is giving us a little bit of the effect we want, we just want <em>more</em>. Instead of warping this wonderful texture or cut pasting bits that are more favourable, let's <strong>duplicate</strong> the texture image layer. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just duplicating it will merely highlight existing details more, so move the newly duplicated layer around a little bit to find a place where it helps to enhance the effect even more.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>With a little bit of trial and error, by running through the blend modes quickly, I arrived at the conclusion that applying the <code>Blend Mode</code> called <code>Vivid Light</code> helped to enhance this particular effect.
<br><br>
Here is the result after the first four steps:
<br>

<br><br>
Looking at it next to the target image it looks very similar:
<br><br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/keRAw.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
<br><br>
But, if you click on and look at the larger version of the result after the first four steps, you'll see that the effects aren't amazing. In particular the perfectly straight edges and sharp details are somewhat counter-productive for the target effect. The next three steps will help to polish the effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Double click on the layer in the <code>Layers</code> panel to bring up the layer styles. Apply an <code>Outer Bevel</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can move the outer bevel around in the layer styles options to arrive at a satisfactory result.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Next create a <code>Curves</code> layer by clicking on the middle icon in the layers panel and choosing it from the list.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tweak the curves to enhance the details that you like already, mostly by trial and error. Play around with the curves to get to know them, then bend them until you're pleased with the result. You can always come back and tweak them again, so don't spend too long, this isn't an exact effect.  </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Finally, apply a slight blur using <code>Save for Web &amp; Devices...</code> when saving to soften some of the sharp details.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>After all of these steps, you can go back and repeat some of them if you're not yet satisfied with the effect. You could duplicate the texture again and apply different blend modes, or any number of other effects. Either way, this should help you to get to know blending modes a bit more as well as touching on other tools.</p>

<p>This is a feature in Illustrator 15.x (CS5) to assist in the creation of sharp web/screen images. The pixel grid assumes the smallest measurement is 1 pixel so as little anti-aliasing as possible is used. This allows strokes or fills to be sharp and crisp when output for screen devices. However, it also means you can not draw a stroke smaller than 1pt (1px) and some paths or fills may move slightly to align to the pixel grid.</p>

","<p>Noise and dither usually yield quite good results. There's a couple of things that may make “banding” more apparent:</p>

<ul>
<li>“start” and “stop” colors</li>
<li>gradient size (banding becomes more apparent when “start” and
“stop” points are getting farther from each other—gradient have to be “projected” on more samples with the constant number of available brightness values),</li>
<li>miscallibrated/poor quality monitor (have you tried to view your gradients on different monitors?),</li>
<li>reduced “per-channel” color resolution in system settings (seems unlikely nowadays since most systems use 32 bps settings, but still a possibility),</li>
<li>“wild” video card gamma settings (e.g. in “video card control panel” or gamme loader like Adobe Gamma Loader),</li>
<li>too “agressive” monitor profile (again view-on-other-monitors test should provide some hints about it),</li>
<li>reduced bit depth of an image.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also it would be useful to know what your target device is. There's a difference how much you can “spread” your gradient whether you're targeting print (what kind of print also matters e.g.: screens like AM, pseudo-stochastic, stochastic) computer monitors or mobile devices displays. It also makes difference then wether you use raster graphics or vector graphics.</p>

"Exporting to PDF in Illustrator: Reduce file size in document with multiple occurrences of the same raster graphic","76399","","<p>I have a multi-page PDF created with 7 Artboards in Adobe Illustrator CS6.
The problem is the PDF file created is too large (40MB). </p>

<p>The pages (artboards) have the same exact high-res raster graphic as a background, but with different vector graphics on top of them. I'm sure the PDF file size could be smaller if Illustrator didn't include that raster 7 times, but only ONCE and referenced it.</p>

<p>Can this be accomplished somehow? Forcing Illustrator to not write the same raster data to file 7 times, but only once...</p>

<p>P.S. I'd like to keep it one single PDF file for easy distribution. Exporting an SVG + PNG folder wouldn't be a satisfactory solution, but if there's no other way, let me know.</p>
","<p>Presumably you are just pasting the graphic into the document. There are a few alternate methods to reduce the filesize:</p>

<h2>Option 1: Use File → Place...</h2>

<p>Instead of pasting the raster image into your document, use <strong>File</strong> → <strong><em>Place...</em></strong>. This will create linked files in your document:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dsPHF.png"" alt=""Illustrator screenshot""></p>

<p>It's important to note that your .ai file will no longer be self-contained. If you delete, move, or rename the source image, Illustrator will not be able to find it. <em>This will <strong>not</strong> matter for the exported PDF.</em></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LTplK.png"" alt=""Illustrator error""></p>

<h2>Option 2: Use Symbols</h2>

<p>Instead of placing the images, you could use <strong>Symbols</strong>. Just create a Symbol of the raster artwork, then drag it into the document as many times as needed:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fov7N.png"" alt=""Illustrator screenshot of symbols""></p>

<h2>Option 3: Print the PDF</h2>

<p>If you have Adobe Acrobat (or some other sufficient PDF printer), you can print the PDF.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ne3Ha.png"" alt=""print dialog""></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>File</strong> → <strong><em>Print...</em></strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Adobe PDF</strong> as the Printer</li>
<li><strong><em>Print</em></strong></li>
</ol>

<p>This is the most efficient method and is okay for proofing. If the file is just being passed around to be viewed on a screen, this is usually fine. However, <strong>do not use this type of file for printing</strong>. All sorts of compression and nasty things happen when you print as a PDF.</p>

<h2>The Results</h2>

<p>Using my <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mars_/9966719103/in/pool-publicdomain"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2.78 MB example file</a>, here are the results of the methods I just outlined:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copy and pasting: 46.1 MB</li>
<li>Placing: 7.84 MB</li>
<li>Symbol: 18.6 MB</li>
<li>PDF Print: 139 KB</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: These are all using the Illustrator Default PDF saving options. You could get better results by selecting another preset or modifying the settings yourself.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fo3OZ.png"" alt=""Save as PDF dialog""></p>

<p>For example, the copy and pasting method saved with the [Smallest File Size] preset output for me as 150 KB which is comparable to the PDF print method.</p>

<li>File → Place: Low PDF file size, but the source .ai will not be self containing.</li>
<li>Symbols: Source .ai file will be self containing, but PDF file size will not be as low</li>
<li>Print as PDF (or use Smallest File Size preset): PDF file size will be extremely small, but the resulting file is not sufficient for print</li>

","<p>There is more information that is required before you question can be answered accurately.  However, you may not fully understand the difference between the Type objects that Illustrator creates.</p>

<p>It can also have the text continued in other areas.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/k5rtn.png"" alt=""Type in an Area (continued)""></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type on a Path</strong><br>
This is the type that follows a path.  It can be created by clicking the Type tool on an existing path.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wDTGH.png"" alt=""Type on a Path (original)""></p>

<p>This type cannot be simply resized, as it will impact the font.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y4vXF.png"" alt=""Type on a Path (resized)""></p>

<p>However, if you select an anchor on the path and move just that anchor, you can re-flow the text and even continue it on another path.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oN0Me.png"" alt=""Type on a Path (moved anchor)""></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type on an Anchor</strong><br>
This type is created by just clicking at a blank spot on your canvas and typing away.  It is only registered to 1 base anchor.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JIygf.png"" alt=""Type on an Anchor (original)""></p>

<p>Type on an Anchor cannot be re-flowed and any transformation operations will distort the text.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eZKin.png"" alt=""Type on an Anchor (resized)""></p></li>
</ol>

<p>It is important to note that if you select multiple ""Type in Area"" objects, a resize transform will resize the bounding boxes and re-flow the text inside.  However, if you select a Type in Area object <em>and</em> a ""Type on Path"" or ""Type on Anchor"" object, the transformation will be applied to the text and not just the bounding box.  </p>

<p>Hopefully that gives you the ammo to resize your text areas appropriately...</p>

<li><p><strong>If not, how do I delete the background in CS6?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
","<p>Adobe changed the <kbd>Delete/Backspace</kbd> key functionality in Photoshop CS6 when you press the <kbd>Delete/Backspace</kbd> key on a <strong>locked <em>Background</em> layer.</strong></p>

<p>Since pressing the <kbd>Delete/Backspace</kbd> key on a locked <em>background</em> layer merely filled the selection with the background color, Adobe changed the functionality to provide <strong>more options</strong> when hitting the key. By bringing up the <code>Fill</code> dialog you can now <em>choose</em> which color is used to fill the selection rather than the app automatically using the background color. If you still want it to fill with the set background color, simply choose that from the top drop down menu in the dialog box and hit OK.</p>

<p>If you want the <kbd>Delete/Backspace</kbd> key to delete to a transparent area, you need to first <strong>unlock</strong> the <em>background</em> layer.</p>

<p>Even with Illustrator, a direct conversion to an ""equivalent PSD"" (and I'm not entirely sure what you mean by that) is not a straightforward task. In essence, you would be building a PSD from scratch by importing the elements from Illustrator. You can't just copy and paste a text object from Ai to Ps, for example. Vector objects can be pasted in as Smart Objects (which will retain their appearance), or as shapes (which generally won't).</p>

<p>You may be able to use the imported .ai (Smart Object) as a template to build a matching PSD on top of it, but because the feature sets and possible effects are so different between the two programs you may find there are some things that are very difficult to reproduce.</p>

<p>From the question, I'm assuming that you need to end up with a fully editable Photoshop file. In that case, even if you have Illustrator available, there are almost certain to be one or several elements in the original that you would have to recreate in Photoshop, but using Photoshop's tools.</p>

"Difference between kerning vs letter spacing?","75092","","<p>What is the difference between kerning vs. letter spacing? </p>
","<p>Any font has built-in spacing determined by the ""side bearing"" of each character. In metal type, the side bearing is the physical right or left edge of the individual piece of type that determines its spacing from the characters on either side. Digital fonts mimic this in the basic design process.</p>

<p>""<strong>To kern</strong>"" means to adjust the spacing between <em>a pair</em> of letters, numerals, punctuation, etc.  (properly ""glyphs"") so that their spacing looks correct. The letters AV, for example, have to overlap in any usual typeface, otherwise at least one them ends up looking lost and bewildered. Their kerning is tightened to snug them up to one another. An italic <em>f</em> will collide with a following question or quote mark in some fonts, so the kerning must be opened up from the default spacing. </p>

<p>An ancient scribe could kern effortlessly with pen and ink, and if you read old manuscripts you'll see lots of places where a letter intrudes into the space of the one next to it. With metal type, it wasn't so easy. Kerning required cutting away some of the metal base, or table, of the character. The amount of time, skill and work involved is left as an exercise for readers whose minds are in need of a little boggling. The shapes of the letters in metal type intended for long passages of text such as books, or especially newspapers, were designed to minimize the amount of kerning that would be necessary.</p>

<p>Kerning tables built into a digital font assign preset kerning values to specific letter pairs, according to the designer's best estimate of how they should look. There can be a dozen or so pairs (or none!) in a cheapo font, thousands in a high-end one. No matter how thoroughly and well a kerning table is built, though, there will still be situations where some awkward combination requires that the kerning be loosened or tightened from the preset values of the glyphs.</p>

<p><strong>Letter spacing</strong> (often ""tracking"" in software applications) adjusts the spacing between all the glyphs in a piece of text. This can help to make a page look a little more open and inviting, for example, especially with a similarly open leading. Very large type, such as a big headline, almost always benefits from tightening the tracking. Tiny type, such as in captions or footnotes, is made more readable by opening the letter spacing a bit, especially if the paper is absorbent and will allow the ink to spread a little.</p>

<p>A final note: Use caution with both kerning and tracking. Tracking is very often wildly overdone, kerning is seldom done enough.</p>

"How to convert text paths to editable text in an .eps file downloaded from Shutterstock?","75060","","<p>I am an experienced PHP programmer, but very new to Illustrator.

","<p>The text has been outlined (converted to paths). Once text has been outlined, it cannot be un-outlined. </p>

<p>This is typically done so that a font file does not have to be embedded. Ideally the designer should have kept a copy of the original text object locked and hidden, but I'm guessing that is not the case.</p>

"Master page display on top in InDesign?","74980","","<p>I read <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/q/1655/5489"">this question</a> regarding Fireworks layers, where it said that master pages have to be applied underneath other layers.</p>

<p>Is this true for InDesign as well? If not, how does one put the Master Page content on top?</p>

<p>I was playing out a scenario that <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/q/9307/5489"">another user presented</a> where you'd have one piece of text and different backgrounds.</p>
","<p>Master pages in Indesign are always seen as on the bottom of the object stack. However, you can use layers in Indesign as well. This somewhat breaks the object stack logic. Layers in Indesign allow you to stack any object, master page or otherwise.</p>

<p>For example....</p>

<ul>
<li>new document</li>
<li>add a new layer via the Layers Panel</li>
<li>Move edit the Master Page</li>
<li>highlight Layer 1 in the Layers panel and draw a filled rectangle.</li>
<li>Highlight Layer 2 in the Layers Panel and draw another filled rectangle.</li>
<li>Switch to the document page</li>
<li>highlight Layer 1 in the Layers Panel and draw yet another filled rectangle</li>
</ul>

<p>You'll end up with stacking similar to this....</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7EUjd.jpg"" alt=""stacking""></p>

<p>The magenta rectangle is on Layer 2 on my Master Page. The yellow rectangle is on layer 1 on the master page. The cyan rectangle is on layer 1 on my document page.</p>

<p>So, while master pages are always seen as the bottom of the object stack, layers take precedence and will allow you to stack things above a document page if you place objects on higher layers.</p>

<p>In your scenario, you could place the text on the master page on Layer 2, and then place backgrounds on Layer 1 in the document pages.</p>

<p>An important note is that you can apply master pages to other master pages. It's possible to have Master Page B which has Master Page A applied to it. This can assist in keeping any design fluent while maintaining common items.</p>

"How to export Illustrator layers as individual images?","69708","","<p>I have an Illustrator file that contains patterns. I'd like to export each pattern as an individual image to use in this new program that I'm trying called Sketch. Is there a batch processing script that exports layers as PNG or SVG?

<p>Would font size 5 for Calibri in Microsoft Word still readable when printed out?</p>

<p>PS: I know I could do a test print on my own printer. Unfortunately, it blew up just a while ago and I have no convenient access to a printer at this point of time.</p>
","<p>It depends on what DPI you use for the print. With a high resolution, ie. high DPI, you can print very small sizes.</p>

<p>Human eyes cannot read much details beyond 300 DPI so for readability there is little point of using higher DPIs than that. Higher resolutions above 300 DPI are typically used for technical reasons such to overcome ink-bleeding (or if I may, for marketing gimmick in consumer printers).</p>

<p>If you still want to print very small letters a very high resolution is needed. It won't be readable to most people, but it's possible to do.</p>

<p>Just for the sake of process:</p>

<p>1 point of a font is defined as 1/72 of an inch. If you want to print a font in 5 points that will obviosuly be 5/72 of an inch. So to not have those raster-points merge all together you will need a resolution twice that size as a minimum, meaning 144 DPI.</p>

<p>Will it be readable? In the real-world probably not, ref. ink-bleeding. So here you need to double the resolution again and you end up at ~300 DPI. If your font is more than basic simple sans-serif you will again run into problems with ink and rendition of the details of the font so again you need to double the DPI to about 600 DPI. You can see where this is going.</p>

<h2>The classical proportion</h2>

<p>The classical (oldie) porportion for desktops is <strong>4:3</strong> for example.</p>

<ul>
<li>1024x768</li>
<li>1280x960</li>
<li>1600x1200</li>
</ul>

<p>Some pads use this same proportion for example the ipad uses:</p>

<ul>
<li>2048x1536</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Vertical orientatnion</strong></p>

<p>This takes us that this pads used in vertical orientation gives us a 3:4 proportion which would be inverting the values.</p>

<ul>
<li>768x1024 for example</li>
</ul>

<h2>The widescreen</h2>

<p>The main proportion is 16:9</p>

<ul>
<li>1920x1080</li>
<li>1366x768</li>
<li>1280x720</li>
</ul>

<p>You have the same case if you want a vertical orientation 9:16</p>

<h2>Variations</h2>

<p>There are a lot of variations in proportions and resolutions. You can take a look of them on this image from the wikipedia (the circles show the proportion):</p>

","<p>I don't know why Photoshop has never had a ""rounded rectangle"" selection tool. Seems like it ought to, doesn't it? But it doesn't. So, to answer your questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>""Smooth"" is designed to even out rough edges. It doesn't do effective job of rounding corners because that's not what it's for.</p></li>
<li><p>To create a selection with rounded corners, you have to start with a path and turn it into a selection: Use the rounded rectangle Shape tool in ""Path"" mode (it's the middle icon, the one with the pen, between the Shape Layer and Fill Pixels icons) to create a path with the rounding you want, then press <kbd>Ctl</kbd> - <kbd>Enter</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> - <kbd>Return</kbd> (Mac OS) to turn the path into a selection.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To mask a layer, just move the selection to where you want it then click the Layer Mask icon at the bottom of the Layers panel. That will create a layer mask based on your selection.</p>

"Weird grey boxes on PDF export and (huge) quality difference in Apple Preview and Adobe Acrobat","63692","","<p>I've exported tens (if not hundreds) of PDFs with InDesign and I've never experienced this problem. It's pretty weird... The problem is that grey boxes appear around some objects. Next to that, the image quality is very good in Apple Preview, but it's pretty bad in Adobe Acrobat X and Adobe Reader 11.</p>

<p>What happens:</p>

<ul>
<li>All objects with an outer glow get a grey box around them (these include external images but also squares created in InDesign)</li>
<li>Some images with a transparent background get a grey box around them (not all, seems random). Happens to PNG, AI, PDF.</li>
<li>Image quality is very good in Preview, but bad in Adobe Acrobat X (grained edges). This happens to images, not to text (vector I suppose?)</li>
</ul>

<p>PDF details:</p>

<ul>
<li>All images are embedded</li>
<li>All placed items are high quality</li>
</ul>

<p>I've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exporting in the standard High Quality settings; both problems occur</li>
<li>Exporting in press quality; both problems occur</li>
<li>Exporting as Acrobat 4 (PDF 1.3). This solves the grey box problem, but the quality problem remains. I've read somewhere that PDF 1.3 flattens? Maybe this can explain the grey boxes? Using this option is not really preferable since I would like to use hyperlinks in the document and PDF 1.3 doesn't support that.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm using</p>

<ul>
<li>InDesign CS6 v8.0</li>
<li>Mac OSX 10.8.5</li>
<li>Apple Preview 6.0.1 (765.6)</li>
<li>Adobe Acrobat X (10.1.1)</li>
<li>Adobe Reader 11.0.0</li>
</ul>

<p>The final document is a professional portfolio which will be send via e-mail so I don't necessarily need 300dpi quality, but chances are people will view them on big monitors so I was thinking at least 200dpi.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I've added a screenshot of an object with a transparent background where you can see the grey box around it. This is zoomed in at 300%.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/axSYK.png"" alt=""Screenshot of an object with a transparent background where you can clearly see the grey box""></p>
","<p>A possible solution would be to export your document as a hi-res, high-quality *.jpg, place that in a new InDesign file an then export as a *.pdf. This way, everything is flattened and any artifact will not show up anymore. I'm not sure it will help your quality issues, though.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Incorporating some important info from Scott's comment: Most pdf viewers are full of rendering bugs. Apple's Preview and Adobe Acrobat itself are notorious for displaying artefacts like these, especially in *.pdfs that are optimised for print. Using transparency, shadows, glows and/or blending modes in your file makes these problems more likely to show up.</p>

<p>If you want to create a high-fidelity preview, send a *.jpg or a *.jpg placed into a *.pdf. Those will show properly, without you having a lot of explainin' to do to your client.</p>

However, when I instead paste the image to Paint.net, the transparent background is preserved. So I decided I would just paste into Paint.net then into Photo shop, but that STILL doesn't work. When I paste an image with a transparent background to Photoshop from Paint.net, it's background is replaced with a white one. I can't even magic wand away to white or black, because it makes the image look weird after removing it.</p>

","<p>That happens with Transparent .GIF and Transparent .PNG files.</p>

<p>What you need to do is actually save the .PNG file to your computer somewhere by right-clicking and choosing 'Save As' and then open it in Photoshop instead. Doing it this way will generally preserve the transparency.</p>

<p>I've never found an explanation as to why it works this way but if you copy and paste an image with transparency from a website Photoshop fills in the transparent section with black. Again, saving the file and then opening it will generally work to preserve it.</p>

"Professionals: Would you choose GIMP over Photoshop and/or Inkscape over Illustrator?","62854","","<p>I know Adobe's solutions are more advanced, but, as professionals, do you think you would survive (against competition) using GIMP and/or Inkscape instead of Photoshop and/or Illustrator for your actual work?  Would it be worth it or would it actually complicate your work?</p>

<p>I am specially interested to see if there is anyone that actually made the switch to the open source solutions and know why you did it.</p>
","<p>I am not a graphic designer but I do some small graphics work occasionally and <strong>I use GIMP and Inkscape</strong>.</p>

<p>GIMP and Inkscape are both very nice and quite powerful - but if you compare GIMP to photoshop its obvious GIMP is not on the same level (I've never user Illustrator so I can't compare it with Inkscape)</p>

<p>Photoshop has more features, produces better results, has more plugins and virtually all graphic designers know how to use it - it's also very expensive.</p>

<p>For the same amount of work you will have better results in Photoshop - that means that if you use GIMP you will either produce lower quality work or need more time.</p>

<p>So that all boils down to how much money quality and your time worth - if you only do simple work GIMP can do well or you are an hobbyist and your time is essentially free than you can't compete with GIMP's price - but if you need a powerful tool and your time is expensive (and if you have any success as a professional graphic designer than your time should be expensive) GIMP doesn't look so free anymore.</p>

<p>And that is without taking into account you might someday need some plugin that is only available for photoshop, need to exchange PSD files with other designers or hire employees and have to train them to use GIMP.</p>

<p>If my main job was graphic design I would definitely get Photoshop as soon as I can (maybe do a few small projects with GIMP so I can afford it).</p>

<li>The first tab is <strong>General</strong> which includes an input box for Family Name. The 2nd tab is <strong>OpenType</strong> which allows you direct access to the nameTable so you can edit all of that info including style names.</li>
<li>Once you edit the info, simply type Command(⌘) G or choose <strong>File... -> Generate Font</strong>. Ensure it's exporting as .otf and save to desired location</li>

","<p>The first thing to say, is that I want to be honest and I'm affiliate to the software I present bellow (I'm the software designer/programmer of this font identification engine) and I'm really proud about it :)</p>

<p>It's not an online service but a software application that runs on your Mac or Windows PC:
<strong><a href=""http://www.findmyfont.com"">http://www.findmyfont.com</a></strong></p>

<p>It takes as input a Text image and identifies the font of any letters you select, by examining both your local fonts (installed or stored in a folder) and also querying the Find my Font online font database (currently about 125.000 fonts).</p>

<p><strong>The reason I decided to post a message here, is that Find my Font has many advantages over the traditional WhatTheFont and WhatFontIs services, especially considering Google Web Fonts matching.</strong>
Nothing is actually free on free services, everything has it's price when it comes to performance or final results.</p>

<p><strong>WhatTheFont</strong> identifies only the fonts they sell (and most of the time they can't even accurately identify their own fonts). There is no reason ever to add Google Web Fonts on their database. In fact I think they wish that Google Fonts never existed.</p>

<p><strong>WhatFontIs</strong> has a lot of free &amp; commercial fonts in their database, but it's not their primary concern to add &amp; update free fonts, as their main income comes from affiliation sales of commercial fonts from MyFonts.com (the owner of WhatTheFont service), fonts.com and other commercial font resellers. More than this, it will not tell you that the free font they identified belong to Google Fonts.</p>

<p><strong>FindMyFont</strong> is not a ""free service"". You can download the 30-days-trial but if you really like it you have to buy the Pro edition (once). 
What you get in exchange for this (non-free service) is that we have no affiliation ties, so we can focus to offer you the best service:</p>

<p>a) The current online database of Find my Font contains all Google Fonts published until now. They are stored in a special group and the App always let you know that the font you identified belong to Google Fonts.</p>

<p>b) The same thing applies to other free/fremium/commercial fonts sources as our online database contains the complete collection of Dafont.com, OPTI Fonts, etc. as well as more than 300 commercial foundries.</p>

<p>c) If you want to find a Google Web Font which is a good substitute of a commercial font, there is no reason to create any images: Find my Font has a special function to select a font of your computer, type the letters you want and find all similar fonts (including Google Fonts).</p>

<p>d) If you want to focus your results only on Google Fonts, you can download the whole Google Fonts set on your computer, let Find my Font know where these fonts are, and find an equivalent / similar font within seconds (the local font identification speed is about 5 million fonts / minute).</p>

<p>More than that, the matching algorithm of Find my Font is superior in many ways to WhatTheFont and WhatFontIs: You can use images with text as small as 20 pixels high, it accurately matches both the font-family and the weight, it can match samples artificially italicized / emboldened / expanded / condensed and many more.</p>

<p>I declared off-course that all above info comes from a person affiliate to (and very proud of) the software presented here. 
Too good to be true?
You can always try it yourself by downloading the 30-days-free trial:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/download/download-free-edition"">http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/download/download-free-edition</a></p>

<p>You will love it!</p>

<p>Regards</p>

<p>Fivos</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> (31/3/2015) Satisfying the customer requests we received, the new Find my Font version 3.3.02 now supports the following options for Online Font Matching: ""All"", ""Freemium"", ""Commercial"" and ""Google Web Fonts"".
Google Fonts will still appear in results if you select ""All"" or ""Freemium"", but if you select ""Google Web Fonts"" the matching results will contain exclusively Google Fonts + a matching percent for each one of them.
<strong>This makes it even easier to choose the closest Google font to your image sample or to any font you have on your computer.</strong></p>

But I have some white pixels around the loader which are really annoying when displayed on a dark background. You can see it here, in a frame I extracted from the gif:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5TU5b.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>How can I prevent those white pixels and maintain the transparent background?</p>
","<p>The way transparency works with <strong>8-bit gifs/pngs</strong> is that <strong>a pixel is either fully transparent or fully opaque</strong>.</p>

<p>On the corners of a circle where the circle blends transparently to the background, there are usually pixels that are semi-transparent to smoothen the transition. This smooth transition can not fully be reproduced with 8-bit gifs/pngs.</p>

<p>One way of <em>faking</em> this is to select a background <strong>matte</strong> for all those semi-transparent pixels. This means those pixels that are not fully transparent get their color calculated as if they were on top of the matte color. </p>

<p>The white pixels in your circle gif happend like this, because they gif was made to be used against white background. The semi-transparent pixels of the original circle got rastered against the white matte color, resulting in almost white but fully opaque pixels around the corners.</p>

<p>The way to remedy this <strong>if you have the original, fully transparent circle</strong> is to <code>save for web &amp; devices</code> and select a matte color that suits your background. That way, potentially semi-transparent pixels will get merged to fully opaque pixels against the matte color, and viewed on you website with similar background color, it will <em>appear</em> fully smooth. Note that a) graphics with small ranges of semi-transparent areas (in pixels) work best, and b) this requires that the background the gif is shown against is some of what in a consistent color that you pick for your matte.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/njX2P.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In this image:</p>

<ul>
<li>The top left is the original round graphic with anti aliased, i.e. smoothed, corners. </li>
<li>The same result you get with png-24, as seen in the top right - but this does not work for animation. </li>
<li>The bottom left view shows you how the semi-transparent pixels of the graphic get transposed onto the selected red matte color. Also note how those pixels, that are completely transparent, remain completely transparent. Whereas only those pixels that have a bit of transparency in them get ""underlayed"" with the matte color, and the fully opaque pixels remain completely unaffected by the transparency settings (however, they are affected from selections on dithering type and colors).</li>
<li>The bottom right resembles the kind of exporting options that were used for your example image. With a white matte selected, the same pixels that show red in the bottom left image, will show white in the bottom right image. This is perfectly acceptable if you show it against white background. With other, darker, backgrounds, the white pixels show because the use the wrong matte color to create fully opaque pixels for any pixels not fully transparent.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the both gifs exported with red and white matte in this image, against different background. This shows how the red matte nicely blends with a red background, but also how disturbing the white matte shows against a black background.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7AGeQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<hr>

<p>If you are in the unfortunate situation, that you do not have the original file with full anti-aliased alphas (i.e. you only have the 8-bit gif), it is troublesome to reverse this matte rastering - pixel by pixel you have to remove the matte color from the semi-transparent pixels and then re-export them with more appropriate settings.</p>

<p>Or is there something else you prefer to use?</p>
","<p>Nice question!</p>

<p>In theory, any of those (plus others you haven't mentioned, like the open source alternatives Gimp and Inkscape) let you design a business card. If you are particularly proficient with one of them, you might want to consider going for that one to save time. While the three Adobe products have some similarities of use, they all require some learning time. If you have the time, I'd definitely recommend you pick one (spoilers: It's Illustrator). </p>

<p><strong>InDesign</strong>'s specific purpose is laying out printed materials. That's its strength, you can see it as a way of joining Photoshop and Illustrator elements into a new 'thing'. However, where it shines is with multiple pages (tools like text wrap are extremely powerful). Good thing is: It packages fonts and images all in one file, but file size will generally also tend to be bigger, so in your case it might be a bit of an overkill. Yes, you could use InDesign, but you will be missing drawing features. </p>

<p><strong>Photoshop</strong> is best for creating and editing photos or raster images. Its main 'power' comes with its image manipulation possibilities. It is not made for printing. Think of it more as a way to edit pictures you want to then add into printing materials. So, you could use Photoshop, but then you'd have issues preparing the files for the printer.</p>

<p><strong>Illustrator</strong> is used for illustrations, logos, and scalable graphics in general. It's also widely used in printing, but not for multipage documents like InDesign, as it has no support for master pages and it doesn't let you automate page numbers. Illustrator's drawing capabilities are closer to Photoshop, but 'better' for non-raster illustrations. You can do anything you can in Photoshop - illustration-wise - and you will be able to get everything ready for production in no time. </p>

<p>So, in short, I'd say most cards get designed in <strong>Illustrator</strong>. As <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/a/27595/2857"">Confused</a> mentions, all printers will be happy with Illustrator files, there are plenty of examples you can follow and the result will just be, overall, better. </p>

"Best image size for responsive css background image","57504","","<p>I am looking for a particular px size (WxH) image that would be the best dimensions to use if you wanted to call a single image that could be called as the background image for a mobile device using either portrait or landscape.</p>

<p>Anyone have any thoughts on the best way to display a background image under these circumstances?</p>
","<p>If you want to use a single image for all mobile devices and
   displayed at its max resolution, then you will have to use a huge
   image to accommodate the largest device in the market. I believe it
   is the iPad with the retina displays which has 2048 x 1536 pixels.</p>

<p>Having said that, I don't think this is a very good approach</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hard to maintain</strong>: The ""biggest screen in the market"" dimensions can change overnight by the launch of new devices, so your goal of having the one image that fits all will have to be accompanied by constant research trying to find out if a new device has been launched that has a bigger screen than what you accounted for. The very fact that you are asking this question here suggest how difficult it is to find out which is the biggest screen in the market. </li>
<li><strong>Unnecessary downloads</strong>: You will be forcing the visitors with small screens to download a huge image, wasting their download quota unnecessarily and risking that their browsers might not display a very nice version of your image when they shrink it.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think a better approach is to use media queries and supply different images based on the maximum width of the device (or the maximum with of the browser, here opinions differ). Basically, you would supply a smaller image for smaller devices, a larger one for medium devices and a huge one for awesome screens. You can set this stops wherever you want.</p>

Alternatively you could take a screen shot and open it in photoshop. Another way is to open developer tools and look at the sites stylesheet, in chrome you could right click the background and hit inspect element then look for where the background colour is being specified...</p>

","<p>A few years ago if you had asked this question then the answer would have been a resounding yes! However we've been redefining design styles and ideas lately so it's now a little more complex.</p>

<p>Yellow can work on a black background, but it's as much about fonts and where the colour is used that affect the overall look of the site. Make sure you're using fonts that are easily legible and you only use yellow for highlighting, as you have done. Also try not to use pure white either but opt for a gentler light grey such as #ebebeb.</p>

<p>Bold colours such as yellow with a dark background are commonly seen with the current trend of <a href=""http://dribbble.com/shots/945811-Dark-UI-Kit"" rel=""noreferrer"">flat design</a>, however these are always a muted or softer version of the colour, and normally not a primary version of it. The background is also primarily a rich black (#252525 or similar) not true black (#000000). This makes it much easier to view whilst keeping the original idea for a colour scheme. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.tedmontgomery.com/tutorial/clrctgBL.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">This site</a> gives you an idea of what colours look like on a background it's very useful to work out what hurts your eyes and what doesn't. </p>

<p>What sort of principle should I use to choose a color?</p>
","<p>Any colour works with black and white.</p>

<p>Any colour you pick will be effectively an accent colour. This gives you free reign to <strong>pick what ever colour will be most effective for the communication of your design intent</strong>.</p>

<p>Red is often used with a black and white palette since it is both a bold, powerful colour with a huge number of associated connotations. this makes it very flexible for communicating a number of different things at once dependant on context. Read up on the answers for <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/q/2/79"">this question</a> for further information.</p>

<p>Just as important as <em>what colour</em>, is understanding how to powerfully use colour, especially in a black and white design. A 'black and white + accent colour' design will find its strength in restaint, it is essentially a minimalist colour palette, and will lose effect if colour is applied too liberally. Careful placement of colour can be used to link elements together, or highlight constrasting elements (or ideas, i.e love and war with red)</p>

"GIMP: Trying to move selected text layer but moves background layer","54861","","<p>I have a background overlay on which I have three text layers on top. 
Now I want to move these text layers around on the overlay, but I can't get it to work.</p>

<p>As soon as I click inside the text layer I can see that the background layer is catching the click, and if I drag I see that it's the background layer that is moved and not the intended text layer... </p>

<p>I find it very annoying, and I can't seem to figure out what I do wrong. The thing is that it seems to work sometimes, for one <strong>Click -> Drag -> Drop</strong>, but as soon as I try and move it again it just moves the background.</p>

<p>I have the <em>Move Tool</em> selected and the move is set to <em>Move: Layer</em>, just to be clear.</p>
","<p>Are you sure you're clicking on the actual letters in the text?  When selecting a layer to move, GIMP will pick the uppermost layer which is non-transparent<sup>1</sup> at the point you clicked, ignoring any transparent layers that might be on top of it.</p>

<p>What this means is that, using the ""Pick a layer or guide"" mode of the move tool, you can only drag a layer around by its opaque parts.  Since a text layer is typically mostly transparent, with only narrow opaque lines making up the text, this can sometimes make them tricky to move.</p>

<p>The general solution (besides practicing finer mouse control) is to select ""Move the active layer"" in the move tool options (or just hold down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key when clicking), which will cause it to move the currently selected layer no matter where you click.  Then select the layer you want from the Layers dialog and move it around as you like.</p>

<p>You can do this by: 1) selecting the move tool, and 2) in the menu bar, navigating to Windows &rarr; Dockable Dialogs &rarr; Tool Options. In the dialog box that appears, select ""Move the active layer"".</p>

<p><sup>1) I did a few tests, and it looks like the layer needs to be at least 25% opaque at the clicked point to be draggable.  Anything less is treated as transparent.</sup></p>

"Is it possible to modify a rounded rectangle's radius in Photoshop?","54637","","<p>As the title implies, I have drawn a rounded rectangle with a larger radius in Photoshop.  Now I want to reduce its radius. Is this possible without deleting it?</p>
","<p>AFAIK, there is no convenient way of changing corner radius in Photoshop after you've begun drawing a shape. This is one area where Fireworks is pretty nice, as you can simply click on the diamonds at each corner to change the radius.</p>

<p>However, one work around is to use an outer stroke. If the stroke is the same color as the shape, then it will create the illusion of rounded corners. The stroke thickness will be the corner radius, and you can change that at any time.</p>

<p>It's probably also possible to use Photoshop scripting to transform and convert the corners of a vector shape (as opposed to a rasterized shape). But that requires you to have some JavaScript knowledge and to figure out the formula for transforming the corner anchors. But if you were so inclined, you could probably create an action that let you select a shape, type in a new corner radius, and automatically do the transformations for you.</p>

This is also the <a href=""http://standardbusinesscardsize.net/standard-business-card-size/"">standard business card size</a> in many situations as it is highly pocketable.</p>

<h2>Personal notes</h2>

<p>For <strong>international</strong>, common use, I'd suggest the <strong>ID-1 size</strong> as the size is familiar to many, it is highly pocketable and isn't as culture-oriented. And it is more widely used than the A8, I think.</p>

<p>Actually, even for <strong>one-country</strong> use I'd first suggest the ID-1 to my clients (tell them it is the credit card size), since the size is easier to get a grip on (for them). The client could get a credit card from his/her wallet and imagine the business card layout on it and <em>feel</em> the size in their hands.</p>

<p><strong>But</strong> some may have personal biases towards the (non-standard) <strong>national size</strong>, so I would offer it as an alternative. Some may have previous business cards (or someone else's) and would want the same dimensions. For the designer, the ID-1 size is helpful in this occasion too, because when you first ask what sized business card they want &mdash; and the client answers <em>""Business card size, duh!!!""</em> &mdash; you could ask: <em>""Is it the same size or bigger/smaller than your credit card?""</em> And the answer, with the help of the business card dimensions table, probably solves the actual size. (Been there, done that.)</p>

<p>Also it should be noted that the <strong>business card culture in East-Asia</strong> has more weight than in a regular Western country (see, e.g., <a href=""http://ezinearticles.com/?The-Etiquette-of-Business-Cards-in-Japan,-China-and-the-United-States&amp;id=1370134"">an article on Ezine</a>). In <strong>China</strong>, business card etiquette has seemingly complex traditions and in <strong>Japan</strong> business cards are highly respected. If your client is about to do business in either, I'd suggest designing the cards according to China's/Japan's most common size, or doing a separate run for Asian usage. (Note that China's and Japan's common business card sizes differ from each other.)</p>

<p>It's also recommended to consider unique variations, as using slightly different sizes in business cards can make yours stand out from others. If one happened to pick up multiple cards at a trade show, all of them will stack together nicely. The random one that is a different size from the rest will stand out, and probably get noticed easier.</p>

<p>Well first I found out that if opened in Photoshop, the whole file is converted/merged/rasterized into a single layer. So I opened it in Illustrator. In illustrator there is a layer for each letter in the text and they are compound paths (I learned the term half an hour ago). I could not find any way to change the text even when I have a layer with an alphabet selected and the type tool selected.

<p>Is there a text layer at all? Is there a way to modify the text while keeping the style the same? Or if its not a text layer, did they hand draw the text with the pen or pencil tool? If they actually used a font, do you recognize it what font this is? And what effects have been applied? Sorry for the slew of questions.</p>
","<p><strong>The text in your file has been converted to outlines.</strong> This allows you to work with the art without the font. Unfortunately, it also means you can't edit the text.</p>

<p>How can I achieve that in InDesign (while keeping automated page numbering) or during the export process?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Or is that how PDFs should be laid out, and is there something he should be doing to my PDF before sending the print job?</p>
","<p>Honestly, this is the <strong>print provider's job</strong>. There's no reason a designer should be doing pagination for press. That being said, I realize that some print providers are lazy or at times, honestly don't know how to paginate native files, or aren't using a PDF workflow yet (unbelievably) and don't know how to paginate a PDF. There are software packages specifically for prepress to paginate/trap/etc various file formats. In my experience, no quality print provider will <strong><em>ever</em></strong> ask for a file paginated in a specific manner. </p>

<p>Most commonly PDFs should be exported as single page PDFs (not spreads) so the printer can paginate however they need to.</p>

<p>The easiest way to repaginate, without altering your original INDD file, or purchasing imposition plugins/software, is to export as single page PDF. Create a new Indesign document, and import the single PDF pages and paginate to the printer spreads. Then export as PDF in spreads.</p>

<p>My present solution is to have the raster image as a background layer, and in a new layer above it I use the pen to follow the lines as close as possible. 
Later I tweak these lines to fit the raster image better. That has worked fine for simple drawings. However for some of my extremely complex drawings, this is very tedious to do.</p>

<p>Is there any tool or filter of some sort that is capable of recognizing the lines in line drawings and creating vector paths from them?</p>
","<p>In inkscape, you count on sort of Potrace(an excelent tracer, free) embedded there. Just go to top Path menu, vectorize.

But you need to play a lot with the settings till you find the right ones for you. It worked for me for producing game line-art from rasters (in a very similar style to comics drawings)</p>

"Font-face loaded on Windows look really bad. Which fonts are you using that render better?","51148","","<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: <em>The problem was that I did not have ""Cleartype"" turned on in my settings on Vista.  This question may not have much meaning if you have Cleartype is installed/enabled on Windows OS.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>A new typography wind has arrived on the web, with font-face property of CSS3 be able to load fonts other than the OS/system set. My Mac render many perfectly while my Windows machine doesn't. Which set of fonts should I use that will render better on Windows?</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4112125/font-face-alias-issues-on-pc"">This is similar to a question on Stack Overflow.</a></p>

<p>And here an example of a website that looks bad rendered on PC with Myriad Pro: <a href=""http://css-tricks.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://css-tricks.com/</a></p>

<p>NOTE: I am not talking about the difference in antialiasing between browser versions (like between IE9 and IE6).</p>

<p>I am expecting as answer by your tests, a list of fonts plus the size (please use px) which they look well, or at least in a way that they can be used for short text or small titles.</p>

<p>For example, at the moment ""League Gothic, 30px"" looks like the following:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8FjpW.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>This should be a comment (hence making this CW), but I think there are some misunderstandings and wrong assumptions in the question. Since you obviously want this question to be answered (you've offered a bounty after all), here's my two cents.</p>

<p>From your screenshot it seems to me that you have set your Windows to render fonts regularly (as opposed to subpixel rendering) and probably your browser doesn't do any antialiasing (it might, but then it is gone with JPG compression). </p>

<p><em>The following examples dealing with windows are from XP Pro SP 3, so it is quite safe to assume the situation is</em> <strong><em>at least</em></strong> <em>in the same level in Vista &amp; 7.</em></p>

<p>Windows has (in XP) options to use ClearType or to not. Without ClearType the fonts render as in your screenshot. This is a heavily zoomed in image from Windows' dialog without CT:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UbeJH.png"" alt=""evidence 1""></p>

<p>You see it is a binary operation: pixel is black or transparent. Now with some modern browsers even without CT, they do some anti-aliasing. This is from css-tricks.com with Windows XP &amp; Chrome 8 and CT is OFF (as it was in the previous picture):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZqtfH.png"" alt=""evidence 2""></p>

<p>See what has happened? Probably you did already, as you stated in your question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: I am not talking about the antialiasing difference that there is between new browsers and old ones (like between IE9 and IE6).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, the <strong>ClearType</strong>!</p>

<p>Here is the exact same text from the Windows dialog, this time with CT:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tPe8x.png"" alt=""evidence 3""></p>

<p>If you're interested on what this is based on, see the Wikipedia article on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">subpixel rendering</a>. And does turning the ClearType on affect the browser rendering? Same ""other"" text with Windows XP &amp; Chrome 8 and ClearType is ON:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UKTjk.png"" alt=""evidence 4""></p>

<p>It does! And while we're at it, I might add that (at least) IE 8 uses ClearType rendering even if it is disabled in Windows-level.</p>

<hr>

<p>Comparing antialiased and ClearTyped text in 100 % isn't as radical as comparing ClearTyped text to non-antialiased. It is noticeably bolder, though:</p>

<p>aa: <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wktYW.png"" alt=""evidence 5""> CT: <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NIlWe.png"" alt=""evidence 6""></p>

<p>To see what that looks like <em>without</em> antialiasing, just look at <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/akZDI.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">littlemad's screenshot</a>. </p>

<p>And for comparison here's the same ""other"" in OS X's default rendering: <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jyRaF.png"" alt=""evidence 7""> <em>even more</em> bolder than ClearType.</p>

<hr>

<p>To answer your question: <strong>any font</strong>. If your operating system renders the font differently it might be <strong>because you've set your operating system to render fonts so</strong>. OR it might be that your browser isn't capable of antialiasing or ClearType.</p>

<p>Another question would be that why some fonts render correctly and some don't &mdash; if this even is the case (but I don't see any problems on the site you've mentioned on Windows). Or are you asking for fonts that would look adequate without any rendering whatsoever?</p>

<hr>

<p>And here's also answer to frequently asked question: <strong>""Yes, I know all that &mdash; why does ClearType look different than OS X's rendering?!""</strong></p>

<p>Because they are different. Subpixel rendering isn't a light thing to implement. ClearType is Microsoft's registered trademark and it is protected with <strong>10</strong> patents (+ 1 pending; see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearType#Patents"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia</a>). They just <em>can't</em> be the same.</p>

Any pieces of software or websites you suggest should be available for free, please. </p>
","<p>You can do this with <a href=""http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GIFsicle</a>, using the following options:</p>

<pre><code>gifsicle -U --disposal=previous --transparent=""<i>#ffffff</i>"" -O2 <i>anim.gif</i> &gt; <i>anim_trans.gif</i></code></pre>

<p>where <em><code>anim.gif</code></em> and <em><code>anim_trans.gif</code></em> are the source and destination file names, and <em><code>#ffffff</code></em> is the hex code of the color you want to make transparent (here, pure white).</p>

<p>(The important options here are <code>-U</code> / <code>--unoptimize</code> and <code>--disposal=previous</code>, which together convert the animation into ""flipbook mode"", where each frame is fully erased before drawing the next one.  This allows extra transparency to be added to the frames without letting the earlier frames show through the transparent parts.  The <code>-O2</code> option is not strictly necessary, but it's likely to shrink the file size of the resulting animation by optimizing the frames to avoid needlessly re-drawing static parts of the animation.)</p>

<p>For a demostration, here's an <a href=""//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:GLO1_Homo_sapiens_small_fast.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">animation of the human glyoxalase I  (GLO1) enzyme</a> from Wikimedia Commons (left), and the same animation with transparency added using the method shown above (right):</p>

<p>One detail worth noting is that, if the GIFsicle command doesn't seem to have any effect, you should check that the background color is really correct.  For example, for the animation shown above, the actual background color turned out to be <code>#fdfffc</code> (i.e. <em>very</em> slightly yellow-greenish white) rather than <code>#ffffff</code> (pure white).  You can't actually tell the difference by eye (or, at least, I can't do that on this screen), but it's enough to make GIFsicle consider the two colors different.</p>

<p>Also note that GIF files only support 1-bit transparency, which means that the edges of the transparent regions will not be anti-aliased.  This is OK as long as the background you're showing the animation on isn't too far from the original background color, but if it is, you may find that there will be some <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/15549/how-can-i-remove-white-pixels-around-circles-when-exporting-this-to-gif"">ugly color fringing</a> around the edges of the animation.

<p>I'm sure people here do form design; what do you find to be the best way? I'm thinking about ease of doing in the first place, ease of aligning lines to each other and to margins, ease of editing later, ease of Acrobat making it fillable, and perhaps semantic considerations?</p>

","<p>I always use tabs with an underline leader.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AzbTA.jpg"" alt=""tabs""></p>

<p>The method of creating lines, then anchoring them in text makes for sloppy editing later. And using repeated underscores doesn't allow for proper alignment.</p>

<p>If I want anything containing more rules than these two methods I move to tables and applying specific rules to table cells to define areas. </p>

<p>In short, I <strong>never</strong> draw any lines.</p>

<p>The advantage to these methods for me, is that the rules are part of the text itself and not anchored or inline elements such as drawn lines. Since the rules are part of the text, they flow and move correctly while maintaining position during most edits. When you start anchoring a bunch of objects within text boxes you can have trouble with editing later.</p>

<p>In addition, with these methods you can create paragraph styles. So, applying them simply takes a click rather than a few minutes to draw lines and make certain they are aligned correctly, the re-align things after any edits.</p>

"Billboard Designing: Why design at higher resolution instead of the actual, lower print resolution?","50257","","<p>Perhaps I haven't understood the concept of the ""Scaling Workflow"" and hence my confusion ...</p>

<p>I checked out most of the Q&amp;A for designing large format images on Photoshop (like for huge billboards), and the most popular suggestions were to ""scale"" the image down and design at high resolution.</p>

<p>Examples -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For instance, if a billboard is to be 20' wide, the vendor may ask you
  to send a file 20 inches wide. If the billboard will be printed at
  40ppi, then your 20"" wide file would need to be set to 480ppi to allow
  for the scaling (12X40).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source: <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/a/26355/30233"">https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/a/26355/30233</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>30 dpi for final output is more than enough for a billboard of that
  size. It's not unusual for final output to be 12-15 dpi in this
  context. The usual professional billboard workflow in Photoshop is to
  build the image at a small scale with high ppi (e.g., 4x6cm @ 300
  ppi),</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source: <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/a/3652/30233"">https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/a/3652/30233</a></p>

<p>How does this help? </p>

<p>For example, let's assume a billboard's print spec is <strong>35 meters (W) x 15 meters (H) at a resolution of 50 DPI / PPI in CMYK</strong>. And the billboard designing will be done with a raster image using Photoshop.</p>

<p>So how does it help if you design it at 350 cm x 150 cm @ 500 ppi (scaled to 1/10, for example) or at its actual size of 3500 cm x 1500 cm @ 50 ppi? </p>

<p>Calculation -</p>

<p>A 350 cm x 150 cm @ 500 PPI will have ~ 68,898 x 29,530 pixels (350 cm = 137.795 inch x 500 PPI = 68897.5 and 150 cm = 59.06 inch x 500 PPI = 29,530).</p>

<p>A 3500 cm x 1500 cm @ 50 PPI will also have 68,898 x 29,528 pixels (3500 cm ~ 1377.953 inch x 50 PPI = 68897.65 and 1500 cm ~ 590.56 inch x 50 PPI = 29,528).</p>

<p>In both cases, the file size in Photoshop is going to be approximately the same (around 4+ GB!), since the amount of pixels in both the Photoshop file will be the same! When the document size is the same for both cases, how can Photoshop use less resource for the ""scaled"" down size? How does it become easier to design using a ""scaled"" down version?</p>

<hr>

<p>To be clear, I understand the theory of why a lower resolution works with large images for bill boards.  </p>

<p>My question pertains to the ""scaling"" designing workflow that was suggested for editing large raster images (mainly in photoshop). I fail to see what benefit this approach offers, and hence my query ... </p>
","<p>Very large format artwork, such as for billboards, is <em>always</em> scaled for several reasons. </p>

<p>One is that the major design tools -- Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign, have maximum document dimensions that can be too small to work the largest sizes at full scale. The common output format, PDF, also has dimension restrictions that won't allow full scale billboard artwork. It's not just a matter of ""how many pixels."" These applications have limits on how many cm or inches you can specify.</p>

<p>Another simple reason is that the billboard companies you'll be submitting the artwork to specify them that way. They even provide templates for each of the sizes they sell, usually Photoshop documents, sometimes other formats also, but they are always scaled. At the very least, you will always find a detailed spec sheet for every size in the inventory.</p>

<p>Within the application UI, you will often work with rulers and guides. Inches and especially cm tend to be impractically small if you're trying to work with a document that is several meters wide, so scaling makes sense there, too. A 35 cm wide document has a scale that's readable and fairly easy to work with. A 3500 cm ruler, if you could create a document that large, would be much less so.</p>

<p>A billboard spec such as your imagined example is not what you'll meet in the real world. Here is a typical one, for a 14 ft x 48 ft ""bulletin"" (billboard companies in the U.S. almost always specify height before width):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SCALE / RESOLUTION / LIVE &amp; TRIM AREAS</p>
  
  <p>Built at 9ppi @ 300 document resolution </p>
  
  <p>Live area document size: 5.04” x 17.28” </p>
  
  <p>Overall document size: 5.40” x 17.64”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word ""at"" in that second line means ""targeting; with the purpose of achieving.""</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> build the artwork at 9 ppi if you wanted to, and it's certainly possible to do, but then you'd have to scale the difference between the live area and the overall document size so you'd know where to put your guides. Why bother? Why not use the handy, company-provided template, or at least their spec sheet, and build from there? There is an excellent discussion of billboards and scaling in Chapter 4 of Dan Sorenson's ""<a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321350286"" rel=""nofollow"">Photoshop CS2 for Advertising and Marketing</a>"" (Peachpit Press).</p>

<p>Working to a company's scaled template has another advantage: it leaves less room for error. At an absolute minimum, the production file you deliver to your billboard provider should be precisely to spec. When the work is time-critical, that can mean the difference between a successful project and a missed deadline. </p>

<p>The easiest, most foolproof way to make sure that happens is to use their template. Failing that, read their spec <em>carefully</em> and follow it to the letter. If it says ""8 cm x 16 cm @ 650 ppi"", do it exactly that way until you have delivered a few successful projects. With that experience under your belt, you can consider building your own templates that better fit the way you like to work. </p>

<p>Billboards have traditionally been done in Photoshop. I prefer to work in InDesign because it's usually a much faster workflow, so I have made (scaled!) InDesign templates, along with the appropriate color profile and PDF .joboptions file for each provider's equipment.</p>

<p>So there's nothing inherently wrong or right about working on a scaled document, but the practicalities of real-world production, where mistakes can be costly and getting it right is essential, make it important that you know how to work with them and only forego their use when you are certain you know what you're doing.</p>

"What’s the difference between an art director and a creative director?","50006","","<p>I have seen both <strong>Art Director</strong> and <strong>Creative Director</strong> as titles, but I'm not sure what the difference is. Is one to do with visuals and the other with content? Are they more or less interchangeable? Do they have different responsibilities? Can you have both in the same shop?</p>
","<p><em>Is one to do with visuals and the other with content?</em></p>

<p>An article published <em>""Creative Director vs. Art Director""</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Creative Director's Key Role</h2>
  
  <p>The creative director typically thinks through the early phase of the
  project to develop the concept. This director oversees the entire
  team, which includes the copy chief, photographer and art director.
  Many creative directors ultimately work their way up through the ranks
  to become partner or CEO. The creative director generally has the
  final say on what gets delivered to the client. This vital position
  nurtures the studio or agency's talent and also steers its design
  philosophy.</p>
  
  <h2>Art Director Key Role</h2>
  
  <p>An art director executes a strategy, concept or idea provided by the
  creative director. After the concept has been created, the art
  director is generally responsible for the stylistic look of the ad or
  design. He brainstorms with workers and provides direction and
  inspiration to the staff, which includes the graphic designer, sketch
  artists or typesetters. The art director helps maintain brand
  consistency. He oversees the project through the production department
  and other phases, including prepress and printing. The art director
  may have the final approval for delivery of the project if there is no
  creative director.</p>
  
  <h2>Joint Forces</h2>
  
  <p>The creative director relies on intuition and creativity to get the
  job done. He understands the psychology of advertising and works to
  create an effective vehicle for reaching consumers. Although a
  creative director's forte is not necessarily his technical skills, he
  can write copy, design logos or choose typefaces, if necessary. The
  art director relies on his technical skills to execute the project.
  Both roles complement each other.</p>
  
  <h2>Education and Pay</h2>
  
  <p>Both creative directors and art directors need at least a bachelor's
  degree in advertising, fine art or design. Creative directors may
  continue their education to prepare for the best job opportunities.
  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median salary for art
  directors in 2010 was $80,600 per year. In comparison, a creative
  director's median salary was $125,000, according to a 2011 AIGA/Aquent
  Survey of Design Salaries.</p>

<h1><em>Are they more or less interchangeable?</em></h1>

<p>Art Directors at bigger studios or corporations often oversee just a particular segment of design or at least different teams. So you might have an art director for interactive design and another for package design. The Creative Director would oversee all these.</p>

<a href=""http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatpro/print-to-pdf.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatpro/print-to-pdf.html</a></p>

<p>So we got Acrobat X Pro, but printing to the PDF doesn't seem to do anything.  The print booklet dialog closes and we never get a prompt for a PDF filename, searching our filesystem doesn't show any new files created..  Adobe has a document on printing PDFs on a Mac:

<p>But that doesn't work either :(.  When we choose that Save as PDF option (tried both Save as PDF and Save as Adobe PDF), we get a dialog stating that saving as PDF is not supported in printer dialog.</p>

<p>Tried this on 2 different Macs.  Is there another way or better way to print booklets from InDesign CS6 to a PDF file?</p>
","<p>Acrobat X does not install a print driver on the Mac to the best of my knowledge. Acrobat Stopped installing the PDF printer driver at version 9 on the Mac due to how Apple built in the PDF saving.</p>

<p>I believe your first link is referring to a Windows system since the Mac OS has PDF saving built into the OS print dialogs (as shown in your second link).</p>

<p>All previous PDF print drivers from Acrobat will fail with CS5 or newer.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FUsij.png"" alt=""Distiller""></p>

<p>Acrobat Distiller will convert the (bookleted) postscript file (.ps) into a viewable PDF.</p>

<p>The Save as PDF option within Indesign won't paginate the way the Print Booklet.. command does. So if you need Print Booklet, this method is the best way to use that in conjunction with PDF output.</p>

<p>Depending on which file type you save to there are often more options that can affect the appearance of jagged lines in your art. What you are saving can influence how you should use these settings, as you may want to do things that may seem counter intuitive. Small type for example may need no or very little anti-aliasing or it will become muddy. Also take into consideration the PPI of the file. Low resolution images will appear have jagged edges even with anti-aliasing—the human eye can detect up to 150 ppi, at 72 ppi the pixels will not resolve at a normal viewing distance.</p>

<p>Since I`ll be most likely making changes to the template in the future I figured it would be better to automate it somehow.</p>

<p>Is there a simple solution to this problem?</p>
","<p>It depends how you define ""simple."" Photoshop has variable data functionality built in, but it's not terribly well documented and is considered an inappropriate subject for polite conversation, such as at cocktail parties or church socials. On the other hand, it's years since I used this myself, so constructing this tutorial has been a good refresher.</p>

<p>You'll need a comma- or tab-delimited file with a name for each variable (I'm going to use ""Image"" and ""ImageNumber""). Here's the one I mocked for this exercise. Note that the image filenames have no path only because they are in the same folder as the data file. You can use relative or absolute paths for the filenames:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yirmJ.png"" alt=""data file""></p>

<p>You need to set up your template. Lets assume that you need two layers: the image (variable) and the number (a text layer, variable). The image layer must be an actual layer, not the background.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ipvyl.png"" alt=""define image variable""></p>

<p>Change the ""Name"" field to your chosen variable name (""Image"") and set the ""Method"" to what you need. I'm choosing ""Fill,"" which will resize the image proportionally, but you may prefer something else. Information about each method shows in the Description field when you hover on the name. Close the dialog.</p>

<p>We select the text layer and repeat the process, naming the text variable ""ImageNumber.""</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mhYWB.png"" alt=""define text variable""></p>

<p>Now we have to define a Data Set, so click the ""Next"" button in the dialog and click the New Data Set icon (right by the trash can) in the dialog. </p>

<p>A Data Set is a collection of values that apply to a particular output document, <em>not</em> a complete set of values in a comma-delimited file, so now we define a starting image for our template by clicking the ""Select File..."" with the Image variable selected. I chose the Chrysanthemum image. Be sure that ""Do Not Replace"" is NOT selected. </p>

I've only drawn some trees and landscape using AI, doing this has me totally lost. Any help would be appreciated. </p>
","<p>I think the best solution in this case would be to use Illustrator's “View->Pixel Preview” mode if applicable (I don't know which version you've got there). This way you'll have much greater control over final results, than by any form of automatic rasterization (e.g. “Save for Web”). Think of it as of manual “pixel perfext hinting”.</p>

<p>Also using “pixels” as “document units”, as Mark Edwards suggested, would be a good thing. It will make it possible to set artboard to exact needed size in pixels.</p>

<p>Of course “Save for Web” still would be useful, with its possibility to provide quick preview and optimization of resultant file.</p>

<p>Some of the advantages are: </p>

<ul>
<li>If you need to do a lot of color correction/other color based image manipulation you lose less data in transit.</li>
<li>If your data source has more than 8 bits of color then you can gain benefit from that.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the disadvantages are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not all filters work in 16-bit mode</li>
<li>You use twice the amount of memory with all problems associated with this.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically as a rule of thumb if you do not have any specific reason to use 16 bit color, then you do not need to use it. There's no real advantage for the final image to be 16-bit unless you expect your client to do extensive color manipulation.</p>

"How to decide what type of paper to use for a flyer to hand out at a tradeshow?","48127","","<p>I'm printing a tradeshow flyer and was wondering what type of paper I should print it on. I don't want anything glossy so I'm trying to decide on the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>100# text weight matte</li>
<li>80# cover</li>
<li>80# matte</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the difference between the types above? And how can I make a decision?</p>
","<p>There are basically 3 or 4 types of general <strong>finishes</strong> on stock without getting into texture finishes such as laid or linen...</p>

<ul>
<li>Newsprint/Craft/etc. : These are low-end raw papers used more for
utility purposes. Customarily not used for consumer level marketing
materials. Newsprint obviously refers to newspapers to give you an idea of quality.</li>
<li>Offset : a general uncoated raw paper. This is sometimes referred to as ""bond"" at the consumer level and would be in line with average every day copier or writing paper. It's got some teeth in the finish and would not be considered smooth to the touch.</li>
<li>Matte : Sometimes referred to as ""Dull coat"" - a dull semi-gloss
coating on the stock. Basically it's like a no-glare gloss but not as
slick and shiny. Think of laser printer paper, where it's smooth but not particularly shiny. That would be close to a matte stock.</li>
<li>Gloss : Slick and reflects light (glare). Gloss is the shiny stock.</li>
</ul>

<p>The weights vary considerably and refer to the weight of 500 sheets. So 100# means every 500 sheets of stock equals 100 pounds. This is designed to give an indication of the thickness or heft of the stock. A 100# stock will be roughly twice as thick as a 50# stock.</p>

<p><strong>Weights</strong> are generally in 3 categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Book : These are very light weight papers designed for, you guessed it,
books. They can be coated or uncoated but are generally just all
purpose inexpensive papers. Think of bible pages and how thin and lightweight that stock is... that's a book weight.</li>
<li>Text : Text weight stocks are generally better quality paper than book weights and come in slightly heavier weights designed to hold details a bit better (like text). Magazines or novels most often use text weights for their interior pages. </li>
<li>Cover : Cover weight papers are thicker in nature and more rigid. Covers are designed to have a bigger ""snap"" to them and are designed to rip less than lighter weight papers. Postcards are often printed on cover stock, just to give you an idea.</li>
</ul>

<p>When considering stock weights there are a couple things to think of....
Heavier text weight stock will help ensure you can't read through the stock (you know you read side A but can also slightly see side B on the back at the same time). Lighter weight text stock will fold and crease better.</p>

<p>As for your list.....</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>100# text matte</strong> would refer to a relatively heavy paper with a dull
finish. A good all-purpose finish and weight to use for any flier. Although a 60 to 80# text stock would work well also. 100# just means you'll have a ""thick"" flier that feels heavier than average copy paper.</li>
<li><strong>80# cover</strong> refers to a thicker stock with some additional rigidity
when compared to average text weight stock. (there's no mention of finish here) I would not use a cover stock for a flier. You'd essentially be creating a large postcard with the same rigidity making it difficult for people to fold it and put in in a pocket. But, if that's your goal, this may be an option.</li>
<li><strong>80# Matte</strong> is <em>exceptionally</em> ambiguous. 80# matte cover will be much
different than 80# matte text. See above to text and cover differences. The only thing which is clear here is that the finish is a dull coat (matte). </li>
</ul>

<p>Realize that 100# text will be in the neighborhood of a 80# cover in terms of thickness depending upon the stock. The cover stock will simply be more rigid.</p>

"How Should Adobe Bridge Be Used?","47143","","<p>Adobe Bridge was installed by default when I installed Adobe CS5. What is Adobe Bridge used for, and how can it be integrated within a designer's workflow?</p>

<p>What I know about it is that it is basically a file manager, which is somewhat redundant to me because Finder or Windows Explorer can be used to manage my files.</p>
","<p>I use it for browsing a huge amount of images in one spot very quickly. </p>

<p>Example: I have a new brochure I'm designing for a steady client, the Smith Company. The client says ""I want to use the headshot with the two founders in it. Not the old guy, the younger one &mdash; his son. And the guy he works with. The son is on the left. And no background. I want it siloed."" (silhouetted)</p>

<p>The client doesn't know that when we got that color photo over two years ago, we cleaned it up, made a copy in grayscale, a copy in duotone, did clipping paths for each, made a version that's a cameo with a nice gradient fade, and flipped a copy. That's not including all the other headshots we've gotten from them in the last five years, with different people in different combinations. There are like 200 images in that folder.</p>

<p>So I open my SMITHCO-HEADSHOT folder in Bridge, and it takes me about 15 seconds of scrolling to find the shot the client needs. I make note of the file name, drop it in, and go on with my day.</p>

<p>The nice thing about Bridge is that is also does EPS files, which Mac Finder's Cover Flow does NOT do. So if I need a chart with two lines and one set of bars, with the axis for the bar chart on the right, and I have 200 charts in that folder, I can use Bridge to zip through all the charts quickly rather than opening up 200 files. </p>

but its not giving dashed circle..</p>

<p>thanks</p>
","<p>Photoshop's not the first tool I'd use to do something like this (Illustrator would be my choice), but you can achieve those results by stroking a path using a square brush with the right settings.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create your circular path using the Ellipse tool.</li>
<li>Select the Brush tool and load the Square Brushes brush set. Select one of the square brushes.</li>
<li>Open the brush options palette and change the Brush Shape settings:

<ul>
<li>First, change the spacing so that there are gaps in the brush stroke (ex. 240%).</li>
<li>Then change the square to a rectangle so it looks more dash-like by adjusting its ""Roundness"" (ex. 50%). </li>
<li>Next, adjust the size of the brush as appropriate for the thickness of the stroke you want (ex. 12px).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Then change the Shape Dynamics, setting Angle control to ""Direction"".</li>
<li>Now select the Path Selection Tool (<kbd>A</kbd>) and right-click on your circular path and select ""Stroke Path..."" and choose ""Brush"" as your tool.</li>
</ol>

<p>You should be able to come up with something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8mTjw.png"" alt=""crude black dashed circle on red background""></p>

<h1>Better Way</h1>

<p>The above method is fairly quick, but because of the way the brush is transformed, the results are somewhat crude. So here's a better method using vector paths:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use the Ellipse tool to create a circular path.</li>
<li>Duplicate the circular path and then using Free Transform, shrink the path to create the inside edge of your eventual stroke.</li>
<li>Combine the 2 paths by subtracting the inner circle from the outer circle.</li>
<li>Use the Polygon tool to create a triangle (set number of sides to 3 and hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to make sure it's straight) that points down. Move the triangle so that the bottom vertex snaps to the center of your circles.</li>
<li>Free Transform the triangle and stretch it vertically, pulling the top edge of the bounding box past the top of your circular stroke. Adjust the width of the triangle to the length of the dash (or gap) you want your stroke to have. Apply the Transformation.</li>
<li>Free Transform the triangular path again. This time set the reference point to the bottom center and rotate by an even angle (e.g. 10°, 15°, 20°, 30°, etc.). Apply the transformation.</li>
<li>Hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> and hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> to repeat the transformation with a new copy of the path. Do this until you've made a full circle with the triangular paths.</li>
<li>Select all the triangular paths and combine them additively. Then either subtract (if you want to use them as the gaps) this new path from the stroke path, or combine it with the stroke path via intersection.</li>
<li>Now you should have a vector path of a dashed circle, and you simply have to go to ""Layer""->""New Fill Layer""->""Solid Color..."" to add it to your composition.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iMoFy.png"" alt=""Cleaner gold dashed circle on white background.""></li>
</ol>

<p>This method takes longer, but the result will be cleaner. You can also resize the path easily, as well as save it as a custom shape. Or you can just save the triangular paths as a custom shape so you can re-use them to intersect/subtract them from a circular stroke path of different thicknesses in the future.</p>

"Dragging And Moving One Corner Of A Rectangle In Illustrator","46562","","<p>I am struggling so hard trying to do a simple thing.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/I8zfA.png"" alt=""My PNG""></p>
","<p>Not sure about your exact instance, but I've often encountered PNG files that open with black or another color in place of the transparency. This is typically due to the PNG file using indexed colors and having an alpha palette rather than using a full alpha mask on the image itself.</p>

<p>Basically, when you normally save a PNG file, you're using full 24-bit truecolor (8 bits per channel) plus an alpha mask that stores the transparency info (basically another 8-bit channel). When you use palette colors, it indexes the colors as 24-bit RGB colors and keeps a separate 8-bit alpha mask.</p>

<p>However, <a href=""http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngintro.html"">PNG also supports alpha palettes</a>. This means that each of your indexed colors is stored as a 32-bit RGBA color with the transparency data embedded in the palette. This is uncommon since it's difficult to do intelligently, and unfortunately it doesn't fit in with Photoshop's color modes. So when Photoshop opens it, it only reads the RGB components of each indexed color and doesn't find an alpha mask, so all the transparency data is lost.</p>

<p>I don't recall encountering a file where an arbitrary matte color is applied to the partially transparent regions, but this still could be a variation of the same problem.</p>

<h2>How to make a Project and Compositions</h2>

<p>When you start AE, you can press <kbd>Cmd+N</kbd> to create a new Project with one Composition inside it.</p>

<p>If you already have a Project open, pressing <kbd>Cmd+N</kbd> only creates a new Composition.</p>

<p>In this project, I used 2 compositions. <code>GUI</code> comp to hold the GUI and its animations. <code>iphone</code> comp to hold both, the background and <code>GUI</code> comp. </p>

<p>The second composition with GUI animations should be the same size as the screen, or at least have the same aspect ratio. Later, when you are going to place it on the screen, it might stretch to look odd if the aspect ratio is off. </p>

<h2>Importing images to AE</h2>

<p>After Effects has a pretty good system for importing .psd files, but I don't like to use it because if you misplace, move or rename the .psd file, after effects can't find it and you have to replace footage for every layer separately.</p>

<p>If you import a folder of images into the projects and you, for example. rename the image folder, you only have to replace one image footage and all the missing images are restored ( As long as all the missing images exist in the same folder ). Also this way there's less clutter.</p>

<h3>How to import images to a project</h3>

<p>Right-click inside the Project panel on the left choose: <code>Import &gt; Multiple files</code></p>

<p>When you've animated B, go forward in the timeline and click the keyframe icon on the left side, here: <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fXKc4.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><em>It should look greyed out, so don't worry. That just means there is no keyframe in that position</em></p>

<p>Since keyframe #2 and the newly created keyframe #3 transform have the same values, there is now a pause between those two keyframes. Then you can continue animating normally, by moving forward in the timeline, and changing the values again.</p>

<h3>Animating other things, like Rotation or Opacity</h3>

<p>I just wanted to take this time to tell you that all of them work just like position animations ( ...minus the dragging  ).</p>

<p>Just use the number sliders that show up when you press the hotkeys below.</p>

<h3>Hotkeys for different transform methods:</h3>

<ul>
<li><kbd>P</kbd> - Position</li>
<li><kbd>T</kbd> - Opacity</li>
<li><kbd>R</kbd> - Rotation</li>
<li><kbd>S</kbd> - Scale</li>
<li><kbd>A</kbd> - Anchor point</li>
</ul>

<p>Just select object(s) and press one of these hotkeys and start animating. If you don't select anything, it reveals transform methods for each object in the comp.</p>

<hr>

<hr>

<h2>How to slave objects to other objects</h2>

<p>In the Comp panel you'll notice a Parent dropdown list on every object.</p>

<p>You can use it to define a parent for an object.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bImMk.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If you then move the Parent, you'll notice that the Child element now moves with it. Same goes for animations that you attach to the Parent element.</p>

<p>If you animate Parent object to rotate, the Child will follow...</p>

<hr>

<hr>

<h2>Adding elasticity to your animation</h2>

<p>So maybe you noticed that the button animation doesn't stop to a wall, instead it stops in a very elastic way.</p>

<p>After Effect Expressions can be used to achieve this ( It can do a lot more as well ).</p>

<p>To apply Expression script to an animation, <kbd>Alt+{mouse click}</kbd> the stopwatch and paste in the script.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Unhgx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h3>The Expression I used in my button animation</h3>

<p>The first 3 variables <code>amp, freq, decay</code> can be edited to get different results out of it.</p>

<p>You can apply this same script to movement based animations. For example, opacity animation is not affected.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.graymachine.com/blog/my-top-expressions"">Can also be found in here.</a></p>

<pre><code>amp = .1;
freq = 1.0;
decay = 9.0;
n = 0;
if (numKeys &gt; 0){
n = nearestKey(time).index;
if (key(n).time &gt; time){
n--;
}}
if (n == 0){ t = 0;
}else{
t = time - key(n).time;
}
if (n &gt; 0){
v = velocityAtTime(key(n).time - thisComp.frameDuration/10);
value + v*amp*Math.sin(freq*t*2*Math.PI)/Math.exp(decay*t);
}else{value}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<hr>

<h2>Easing....</h2>

<p>So this is another thing that can make the animation seem a lot less linear, just like the Expression script above.</p>

<p><em>I used Ease Ease in that ""touch indicator circle"" to make it look at bit more human like movement.</em></p>

<p>You can select one or multiple keyframes and right-click one of them.</p>

<p>Then from the list: <code>Keyframe assistant &gt; Easy Ease</code> 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xUDXk.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I often use Easy ease, because I'm lazy...</p>

<h2>Pics or didn't happen...</h2>

<p>Here's a simple position animation demonstrating how easing and this particular expression script can have a huge impact on the animation.</p>

<h2>Placing animated comp/footage into a screen</h2>

<p>So after the GUI is animated, it's time to place it on the screen of the device.</p>

<ol>
<li>Place GUI comp inside iPhone comp, just like you place images inside a composition. </li>
<li>Double click iPhone comp in the Project panel</li>
<li>Select GUI comp <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QzsSr.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></li>
<li>From the top menu <code>Effects &gt; Distort &gt; Corner pin</code></li>
<li>Then just drag each corner to match the device screen corners.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pNsOL.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h2>Exporting to .gif</h2>

<p>AE doesn't have native method for doing this, but do not worry, there are ways.</p>

<p>I prefer to do this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click a composition in the <code>Projects panel</code></li>
<li><code>Composition &gt; Add to render queue</code> <kbd>Cmd+Ctrl+M</kbd></li>
<li>Then at the bottom where timeline normally sits, you choose what to export and where.

<ul>
<li>I usually export a lossless .mov</li>
<li>If you click the ""Render settings"", you can choose a framerate, otherwise it'll use the Comp framerate</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Then just press render on the upper right corner or that panel.</li>
<li>Find the exported file and open it up in photoshop.</li>
<li>Save for web <kbd>Cmd+Shift+Alt+S</kbd>

<ul>
<li>Save as .gif</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>It's honestly not that bad...</p>

<hr>

<hr>

<h2>Exporting as a video file</h2>

<p>So even though the above method shows you how to export a lossless file, it's not the way you should export video files.</p>

<p>You do that like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Save your project file.</li>
<li>Click a composition in the <code>Projects panel</code> ( if you have more than one )</li>
<li><code>Composition &gt; Add to adobe media encoder queue</code> <kbd>Cmd+Alt+M</kbd></li>
<li>Drag a preset from the right column to the left column</li>
<li>Press play.</li>
<li>If you don't choose export folder, by default it goes right next to the project file.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<hr>

<h2>How to replace footage</h2>

<p>So AE can't find your files? Do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Right click one of the missing footage in the Project panel</li>
<li>From the list <code>Replace footage &gt; File...</code></li>
<li>Locate your footage and stuff</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<hr>

<h3>Other useful hotkeys</h3>

<ul>
<li><kbd>U</kbd> - Reveals all used keyframes in the comp (if you have nothing selected). Really useful when you need to move multiple keyframes at once, for example.</li>
<li><kbd>U</kbd> (<em>Double tap</em>) - Reveals everything that was changed. </li>
<li><kbd>E</kbd> (<em>Double tap</em>) - Reveals all used Expressions.</li>
<li><kbd>J</kbd> - Moves to the previous keyframe.</li>
<li><kbd>K</kbd> - Moves to the next keyframe.</li>
<li><kbd>space</kbd> - Plays comp</li>
<li><kbd>I</kbd> or <kbd>home</kbd> key - Moves current time indicator to the beginning on the timeline. </li>
<li><kbd>Cmd+K</kbd> - Current composition settings.</li>
<li><kbd>Cmd+I</kbd> - Import files.</li>
<li><kbd>Alt+{Arrow keys left and right}</kbd> - Select keyframe(s) and press the hotkeys to move them around.</li>
<li><kbd>Alt+Shift+{Arrow keys left and right}</kbd> - Select keyframe(s) and press the hotkeys to move them around.</li>

"How to join two overlapping non-end points that belong to two paths?","45563","","<p><strong>Steps to Recreate:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Create a Rectangle without a fill but with a stroke (Empty rectangle)</li>
<li>Select ""Smart Guides"" &amp; ""Snap To Point"" from the View Menu.</li>
<li>Select the ""Line Segment"" tool from the toolbar and draw two diagonal lines joining the opposite points of the Rectangle (Make sure the anchor points get snapped to the pointer)</li>
</ol>

<p>You will get a similar image.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/spGAn.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li><p>Now select everything you've drawn, and select ""Divide"" option in the ""Pathfinder"" toolbar, in-order to separate the shape into 4 segments.</p></li>
<li><p>But now you'll also be getting the following artifacts on the four corners resulting due to the corner anchor points not being joined.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/N3101.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If you now use the ""Direct Selection"" tool and drag one corner point outwards, you'll see it has been correctly divided into 4 smaller shapes, but I would like the overlapping points to be joined in four corners.</p>

<p>Note: If I try to join them by selecting all the points in 1 corner, it complains about them not being on the same shape, which is also correct since I used ""Divide"".</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>My question is, how to I join these points that are perfectly overlapped, but when they belong to different paths?</p>

<p>Additional Information:
I've already tried the ""Average"" -> ""Join"" workaround. Still get the same error.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Cw5g.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>""To join, you must select two open endpoints. If they are not on the same path, they cannot be on text paths nor inside graphs, and if both of them are grouped, they must be in the same group.""</p>
","<p>The corners are simply sharp corners. You can't join un-opened anchor points (corners).</p>

<p>If rounded corners work you can simply alter the corner options in the <strong>Stroke Panel</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want sharp corners, you need to rethink construction. You can expand the strokes and then use <strong>Pathfinder > Merge</strong> to create the overall shape. But that will combine everything and not result in 4 separate objects.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4xwex.png"" alt=""boxes""></p>

<p>In reality, this is a common issue which Illustrator fails miserably at. The corners are sharp due to the Miter Limit on the stroke panel. But you can't adjust the Miter Limit well enough to actually remove the points on sharp angles. If your original shape were more square than rectangle the corners wouldn't do the same thing. But with sharp angles, you simply need to rethink construction. Without knowing your final goal, I can't really offer anymore solutions. In some cases a custom arrow head which is a 45° point helps, but not for closed triangles with sharp angles.</p>

"Adobe Illustrator vs Adobe Indesign for brochures","45527","","<p>You may know me (not that I am worth knowing) from my <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/6609/opening-adobe-illustrator-cs5-file-in-coreldraw-x5"">first question</a>. I am a noob in web design, graphic desgin, font theroy, color theory, guess all of the mixes that are crucial. My expertise (whatever level that maybe) is in web coding (html, css) and RDBMS with strong skills in Database Modeling. Having successfully (to some extend at least) designed a logo, letterhead, small and big enevelops (maybe a corporate portfolio?), I was asked by the customer to design a company brochure as well. Having learned AI-CS5 (to some extend atleast) and helped by the Graphic Design Community (a million and three thanks to them), I designed the brochure in AI-CS5 and was very happy (as a noob) since it came out really nice (to me &amp; the customer atleast).</p>

<p>The problem as it happens, comes (as it always comes when new knowledge is acquired) when I read that most if not all brochures are designed in Adobe InDesign and not Adobe Illustrator. That really put a halt (stop! you are going to the wrong road) in my learning of AI-CS5. Please see the below images for samples of what I have come up with.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vjys1.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mvLSA.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now I will try to put my question. Why are the brochures designed in indesign rather than illustrator OR more importantly do I really need to or have to ""re-design"" the above in indesign due to the benefits it offers (as some say given my readings on the net)?. Does it mean I am going to the wrong road and using the wrong tool for the job.</p>

<p>You really can't teach an old dogs new tricks and it has been difficult for me (not that I am excusing my short comings of which I am well aware viz. I have not creative talents and am dull as ditch water) to learn AI-CS5 and now I have to shift/move to InDesign just because (beacuse what?).</p>
","<p>In reality, since the implementation of multiple artboards in Illustrator the reason for using Indesign compared to Illustrator changed a bit. Pre CS4 the immediate reason was a single Indesign document rather than separate documents for each page with Illustrator.</p>

<p>Nowadays, there are still reasons one may prefer Indesign over Illustrator but, similar to the Mac OS vs Windows, the reasoning is <em>often</em> based more on preference than actual hard limitations of either app.</p>

<p>Few of the items below are black and white, right or wrong, reasons. Rather they are more strengths in the particular app. There is some crossover and some items possible in Illustrator are possible in Indesign and vice versa. <strong><em>The primary difference is which app has a stronger code base for a particular feature set</em></strong>.</p>

<h2>Indesign benefits:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Better text handling.</strong> Indesign handles a lot of text editing much, much easier and more fluently than Illustrator. While some of the text features can be similar between the two apps, only Indesign has a story editor, column settings, column splitting/spanning, grep searching, etc. Setting massive amounts of text in Illustrator can be a lesson in frustration due to how little management over columns Illustrator contains. In addition things like Character and Paragraph styles in Illustrator are, to me, backwards. AI : Paragraph style dependent upon Character style. ID : Character Style dependent upon Paragraph style. Indesign's text engine is simply more intelligent and better developed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TOC and indexing</strong>. Indesign contains automated tools to control a Table of Contents, indexes, hyperlinks, bookmarks, etc. There's absolutely no such tools in Illustrator.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Master Pages.</strong> Indesign's master pages far, far, outweigh anything in Illustrator which may have similar functionality. In reality, all you can do with Illustrator is symbols and a common layer. Not anywhere near the master page logic in Indesign.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>File sizes.</strong> Since Indesign is a ""container"" app it doesn't store images and placed artwork within the file. This allows for much smaller file sizes in general and the ability to use one image file for multiple documents rather than having to embed the same image data in multiple files. I'm referring more to embedded images in Illustrator or original artwork in Illustrator. Illustrator, does of course, have a link option. But many things need to be embedded within Illustrator to achieve desired appearances.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Output.</strong> From a single Indesign file I can export or save to a wide variety of necessary formats with little post-processing. For example one Indesign document can create a press-ready PDF-x1a file, an interactive pdf file, or an epub file. Illustrator will save to PDF, but forget about epub or interactive pdf.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Illustrator benefits:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Easier custom layouts.</strong> It's much easier in Illustrator to create layouts which have some variety in both object placement or trim dimensions. For example, an oddly shaped piece where a die cut is needed is easier to see and use in Illustrator than it is in Indesign. It's not impossible with Indesign, it's simply easier with Illustrator.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A perceived design freedom.</strong> Illustrator, and the nature of the object-based elements, lends itself to an aire of less restriction. Allowing a user to more quickly draw, paint, or rough out something then refine it. With Indesign it's often a matter of needing to plan the layout first, then implement it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>More visual versatility.</strong> This may simply be my opinion, but I find the ability to alter the appearance of any item much easier within Illustrator. This is primarily because Illustrator is a drawing tool first then a layout tool second. Where Indesign is a layout tool first, then a drawing tool second. Things like custom designed headlines go much faster with Illustrator, and even faster than if one were to create them in Illustrator and place links in Indesign. Things like Text on a Path, or envelope warping, are much easier within Illustrator as well.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Drawing tools.</strong> While Indesign does contain some basic drawing tools, they are rudimentary when comparing them to Illustrator tools. This may not be a ""deal-breaker"" where layout is concerned however. It depends a great deal on the desired appearance. I've created layouts in Indesign and used the drawing tools there for some simple items. Using Illustrator simply makes more sense to me if a layout is highly illustrative in nature.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Since the release of CS4 I've relaxed a great deal on which tool should be used. I used to be adamant that any document containing more than 2 pages should be done via Indesign (Or XPress, heaven forbid). However, with multiple artboards in Illustrator I've found myself using Illustrator for very custom layouts where it simply makes more sense to have the freedom of layout as opposed to beefy text handling. </p>

<p>The decision for me has now become, <br>
""How much text handling do I need here? 
<br>An Index? <br>
Page Numbers? <br>
Table of Contents? <br>
Active hyperlinks?"" </p>

<p>As well as, <br>
""What output is needed? <br>
PDF? <br>
epub? <br>
Interactive PDF?"" </p>

<p>IF I answer ""yes"" to any of these, I'll still use Indesign just to make my life easier. However, if I'm asked for a poster, simple brochure, flyer, etc. I have no issue using Illustrator for the layout. I still tend to jump to Indesign if a project contains more than 2 signatures. But anything with 1 or 2 signatures I'm up in the air about which app I'll use until a design has been roughed out.</p>

You may or may not be able to create outlines of the fints (in many cases if embedding is not permitted, neither is outlining.)

"Is there a way to mirror paths as you draw them in Photoshop? (For drawing symmetric shapes.)","45163","","<p>When drawing something symmetrical with the pen tool in Photoshop, is there any way to set up a mirror line at a given angle, so as you draw a shape on one side it gets automatically duplicated and reflected to the other? I'd rather not have to copy-paste-transform at multiple intervals to see how it's looking.</p>

<p>This is essentially equivalent to 3ds Max's 'Mirror' modifier for meshes.</p>
","<p>Photoshop doesn't have such a function natively, but you can fake it, if a little awkwardly.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start your shape. Select the shape layer AND the background layer and turn them into a Smart Object (Filter > Convert for Smart Filters <em>or</em> Layer > Smart Objects > Convert to Smart Object). I'm assuming you'll make this the left hand half, so position it to the left of the document. (For other relationships adjust these steps accordingly.)</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the layer by pressing Cmd/Ctl-J or by dragging it to the New Layer icon. You now have a copy of the same shape and background layer.</p></li>
<li><p>Double-click either Smart Object to open it as its own document.</p></li>
<li><p>Press Cmd/Ctl-T to activate Free Transform on your shape layer. In the transform proxy in the control panel, change the transform position indicator from the center (default) to the right-hand middle position.</p></li>
<li><p>Right-click the object and select ""Flip Horizontal."" Press Enter/Return to lock in the transform.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose Window > Arrange > Tile.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You now have your main canvas and the master shape visible. Any changes you make to the master shape will appear in the main document every time you save the .psb document that is your smart object.</p>

<p>The plus with this approach is that all the tools of Photoshop are at your disposal in working on one half of the shape, and will be immediately duplicated in the other half as you save.</p>

<p>The downside is that creating a merged, single shape requires several extra steps. I'll outline them if you need to do that.</p>

<li>I made a new adjustment layer and chose ""negative"".</li>
<li>I ticked ""Clipping mask"" so that the ""negative"" isn't applied to all my layers.</li>
</ul>

<p>And... it doesn't work at all.
Like nothing changes. I tried switching the mask color (alt-click on the clipped mask) but nothing either.
What am I missing here ?</p>
","<p>It all depends upon the pattern.</p>

<p>I don't have a ""negative"" adjustment layer option. I'll assume you mean ""Invert"". Should be the same thing.</p>

<p>What gets inverted is the pattern. So, if the pattern is composed of only white and transparent items over black text, what gets inverted is the white pattern. The transparent areas won't invert.</p>

<p>Things which may help...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Set the <strong>pattern's blend mode</strong> in the Layer Styles Dialog to <strong>Difference</strong>, then try the clipped adjustment layer.</p></li>

<p>I'm an InDesign beginner - in fact this is the first time I every used it. This is how it looks:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rgZ8A.png"" alt=""Image""></p>

<p>[Note, I used the background's color (which is #ef4723) as the text color - so it's not transparent]</p>
","<p>The <code>Paper</code> swatch is meant to imitate your paper color for when you are printing to colored paper. It's like ""non-printing color"" as in the resulting background is really transparent. </p>

<p>In your example image, the ""white background"" is just the background color of acrobat.</p>

<hr>

<p>To make background color for your document, I'd recommend Master pages.</p>

<p>From the top menu: <code>Window &gt; Pages</code> In the top of this panel ( as a default ) you will have the Masters and the pages are shown at the bottom.</p>

<blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>This acts as a background for the pages you set this master page into. ( You may want to think of master pages like they were locked layers that are always at the bottom and you can assign them to specific pages easily ).</p></li>
<li><p>You can't arrange anything below the elements in a master page,
unless you are in the master page of course.</p></li>
<li><p>None of the selection tools will react to the elements in master page if you're in the Page view. </p></li>
<li><p>Master pages are great for elements that are static, like if you have a header that repeats throughout all of the pages, this would be the way to go. The red rectangle in my example exists to show that you can put more than just a background color in there. </p></li>
<li><p>The bottom of my Pages panel says <code>1 Master</code> and also I clearly have ""A-master"" selected, these two things indicate that I'm in Master page view at the moment.</p></li>

"Is there way to convert a PSD or Illustrator file to PowerPoint?","44381","","<p>I got a bunch of PSD and Illustrator files and my boss wants that ability to edit the information in the files without having to ask me to do it.  This would be more like editing just the text, there would be no need to edit the graphical elements. Is that a way to convert these file to PowerPoint?  </p>
","<p>There's not a direct way that I'm aware of.  What you could do is export the background elements as a PNG and use it as a background in Powerpoint.  If you set the master slides to use the exported background and do all your text styling there, you could have a reasonable platform for your boss to do simple edits while retaining control over the presentation style.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that your graphics will lose some of their quality when printed.  I believe (though am not sure and can't check right now) that PowerPoint will resize whatever images you give it.  Even if you supply a graphic that should print at 300 PPI for a letter-size page, PP may resize it to where it's essentially 72ppi and a crappy print.  I'm not absolutely certain of this, but you probably want to sample some prints from PowerPoint before doing any major work creating templates.</p>

"How does one generate a palette similar to the ones in Google's material design?","44270","","<p>Google's material design specifications have <a href=""http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html"">sets of colour palettes</a>:</p>

<p>Starting with a base primary colour, which they designate as ""500"", they then have a range of incremental steps of shade, brighter and darker, to create a range of about 10 colours. The lightest is designated ""50"", and is near white, and the darkest, ""900"", is near black, but both retain some of the base colour.</p>

<p>I can't quite determine how the increments are calculated. I tried <a href=""http://slayeroffice.com/tools/color_palette/"">this online swatch generator</a>, but I can't seem to dial in the range.</p>

<p>I think it's just a matter of adjusting luminosity up and down from the base ""500"" color, and I'm guessing that a value of ""0"" would be pure white and ""1000"" would be pure black, but the ranges in Google's palette's seem to have more saturation than a simple luminosity range.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/se6eG.png"" alt=""PSScreenshot""></p>
","<p><strong>I believe bmp only supports 8 bit RGB (24bit images)</strong></p>

<p>Things can get confusing when dealing with the word ""bit"" at times. </p>

<p>By Adobe definitions.....</p>

<p>8 bit RGB = 24bit image (8 bits R, 8 bits G, 8 bits B = 24). </p>

<p>16 bit RGB = 48bit image (16 bits R, 16 bits G, 16 bits B = 48). </p>

<p>Using these numbers, standard RGB images are referred to as 8 or 24 bit. 16 bit refers to an RGB image with more than normal color depth.</p>

<p>Photoshop has the ability to work with 8, 16, or 32 bit RGB, which translates to 24, 48 or 96 bit images. However, most non-photo software (web browsers) utilize 24bit RGB images and often don't support the 48 or 96 bit images.</p>

<p>To further confuse matters, you can have an additional bit depth for transparency. For example a 32bit Image can refer to a 24bit image + 8 bits of alpha (transparency). [BMP doesn't support transparency so it can't save 32bit images either]</p>

<p>I've used a clipping mask to obtain the top ribbon, but I was wondering how I could get the same effect with the bottom ribbon, where the ribbon is filled in with the horizontal lines.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,
Michael</p>
","<p>I think what you are asking is how to get the squiggly lines in the ribbon. </p>

<p>One way you could do it is.. </p>

<ul>
<li>Select the layer with the squiggly lines.</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd> on the layer with your ribbon (the one you want the pattern on).</li>
<li>On your layer window/tab, click on the ""Add layer mask"" button. </li>
</ul>

<p>This is the most simplest way I can think of doing it. But if you wanted the squiggly lines to bend with your ribbon, that's going to take some work. </p>

<p>To align the pattern with the arch of the ribbon..</p>

<ul>
<li>-Divide the ribbon in half, vertically( so you have left and right pieces). Delete one half and keep the other.</li>
<li>Select your squiggly line layer. <code>Go to Edit &gt; Transform &gt; Warp</code></li>
<li>Play around with warping the lines until you get your desired effect.</li>
<li>Follow masking instructions from above.</li>
<li>Duplicate the layers to create a mirrored half.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you follow the above, you will notice that your mirrored squiggly lines may not look too great. If you are up for the challenge, I suggest you try warping the entire squiggly line layer to fit the curve of your ribbon. </p>

<p>I hope this was helpful. Good luck. </p>

"GIMP ""color to alpha"" is not selectable","43905","","<p>Do I have to do something ""special"" to get the <strong>Color</strong> -> <strong>Color to alpha</strong> menu option to work in GIMP? I am trying to convert a background color on a GIF image to transparent by converting the background color to an alpha channel but the Color to Alpha menu option is not selectable.</p>

<p>I've gone through the GIMP documentation and it looks pretty simple :-) I must be missing something rather obvious here!</p>
","<p>If you imported a GIF file into GIMP, your problem is that your image is in indexed mode.
In this mode, most filters and color tools won't work, and be grayed out (up to GIMP 2.8 - expect news on this front on GIMP 2.10).</p>

<p>So, all you have to do there is to go to <code>Image-&gt;Mode-&gt;RGB</code>, and the Color to alpha menu entry will be enabled.</p>

<p>I don't think that will resolve your problem there: Color to alpha is a sophisticated plug-in to remove a color in a way that if the image is put over a solid background with the same color that was removed, it will look exactly like the initial image again: for that, it does not remove just the places where that color appear in pure form (say (0,0,255) green)  - but it makes all colors that take green in their composition partially transparent.</p>

<p>My advice would be to use the Select By Color option to select the color you want to make transparent. If it is a single indexed color, instead of various shades of it, you can set the <code>threshold</code> parameter to 0 - otherwise, experiment with the <code>Threshold</code> and <code>select by</code> controls until you mark all parts of the image you want transparent. After that,just perform <code>Edit-&gt;Cut</code>  (don't forget to add an Alpha channel to your layer before doing that <code>Layer-&gt;Transparency-&gt;Add Alpha Channel</code>), and export your image as a GIF file. You won't need to convert to RGB and back to indexed mode if you just want to add alpha, and choose this method - it should work with the image in Indexed Mode.</p>

"How to convert clipping mask to individual paths?","43748","","<p>I'm a programmer, not a designer. I'm handy with a graphics program as long as it doesn't require artistic abilities. However, I'm not sure about the correct terminology.</p>

<p>One of the files has a line through the text. The text has been converted to outlines. The line is a stroke with no fill. A clipping mask is used to hide any excess line.</p>

<p>Here is what it should look like.</p>

<li>Make a duplicate of this path, using the layers panel. Window > Show Layers</li>

Just be aware there will always be some variance from design on paper to actual code.  Dont worry about the CSS or visuals something along this line that works on the intended device: </p>

"What PPI settings should I use to print a poster from Photoshop?","43141","","<p>Recently I needed to make an A3 size poster for my college fest so I opened up a new <code>.psd</code>, set the dimensions to <code>11.7"" x 16.5""</code> 300 PPI under 16-Bit. </p>

<p>As you know the file size ran into 100 MBs and also I my computer lagged while putting text/images over that document. My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>For printing a poster, should I go for 8-bit or 16-Bit mode?</p></li>
<li><p>For putting my poster on the web what should be the PPI because I think 300PPI
is just too much? Also, should I go for 8-bit or 16-Bit mode?</p></li>
<li><p>My computer lagged while editing, so if I'm designing an A3 size poster for printing, can I lower the quality (e.g. 100PPI, 8-bit) just for the sake of ease of making it prevent lagging once the poster is complete, switch it to optimum quality as before? Will it effect anything provided I'm using high-res images?</p></li>

","<blockquote>
  <p>For printing a poster, should I go for 8 or 16-Bit mode?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>16-bit color is usually overkill for most any project. Professional photographers will often use it for the flexibility it provides when editing RAW imagery, but beyond that, it's not usually something you'd need to deal with. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For putting my poster on web, what should be the ppi because I think 300 is just too much? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the web, PPI is completely irrelevant. PPI settings in PhotoShop are only relevant when a) you are printing and b) the software you are printing from recognizes PhotoShop's PPI setting and automatically sizes your image to match. (This means that most of the time, the PPI setting in PhotoShop isn't really relevant outside of PhotoShop.)</p>

<p>For the web, ignore PPI. All that matters is the pixel dimensions. If you want to display your image 800 pixels wide, make it 800 pixels wide. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also should I go for 8 or 16-Bit mode?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not aware of any file format on the web that supports 16-bit color. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You <em>can</em> but...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will it effect anything provided I'm using high-res images?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you will essentially be working with a 100ppi image. While increasing resolution in PhotoShop <em>can</em> improve the image quality slightly, it can't magically turn low-res imagery into hi-res images very well. So you typically don't ever want to increase the resolution of your image as the gains aren't there. </p>

<p>All that said: <strong>Note that posters rarely need to be 300ppi</strong>. The 300ppi 'standard' typically refers to quality print work done for hand-held reading. Typical example being decent quality magazines. </p>

<p>A poster is rarely read at the same distance as a magazine. Most people will view a poster from 3-10' away. At that range, 300ppi is overkill. You likely can get away with 150ppi in a lot of cases (if not even lower).</p>

<p>Finally, consider using a vector-based tool in the future such as InDesign or Adobe Illustrator. This is often the best of both worlds. For instance, you may import a background photo at 150ppi, but then set your type in Illustrator on top of it, giving you the maximum resolution for your type that the printer supports. </p>

"is there a way to add hyperlinks in a Illustrator document?","42997","","<p>I am creating a CV in Illustrator and exporting it to a PDF. I just read an article which stated that it is a good idea that we use hyperlinks in the CV so that the employer can just click and not have to copy the address.

","<p>In short, no.</p>

<p><a href=""http://forums.adobe.com/thread/565216"">This forum post</a> points out that Illustrator does have hyperlinking capabilities, but they have more to do with exporting to HTML than PDF. They won't do you much good.</p>

<p>Your alternatives are to either add the links in Acrobat after you've exported to PDF or to make your CV in InDesign instead of Illustrator. </p>

<p>If you choose to use Acrobat, it's as simple as using the Link tool to create a rectangle, which you can then assign a link to. When it comes time to update your CV and re-export to PDF, you have a couple of options: you can either select all of the links with the Link Tool or Select Object tool and copy/paste into the updated document, or use the Replace pages feature to replace the current page with the updated page (it keeps the links).</p>

<p>If you choose to use InDesign, you select your text and then enter your link in the Hyperlinks palette. Just make sure that when you're exporting your PDF, you check the box to include hyperlinks.</p>

<h2>Part 1: Creating the Pattern</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Create new file in Photoshop</strong>. Go to <code>File</code> > <code>New...</code> or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>, enter the values of <code>200px</code> for <code>Width</code> and <code>Height</code>. <em>Until otherwise indicated, we are working in this file.</em></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HPkeA.png"" alt=""Create new file in Photoshop""></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fill the background with black</strong>. You can do this by pressing the <kbd>D</kbd> key to reset the selected foreground and background colors to black and white and then using <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Backspace</kbd> on Windows or <kbd>⌥</kbd>+<kbd>Delete</kbd> on Mac to fill the whole canvas. You should now see a canvas filled with all black.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lunrX.png"" alt=""Fill the background with black""></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Add noise</strong>. Go to <code>Filters</code> > <code>Noise</code> > <code>Add Noise...</code> and wait for <code>Add Noise</code> dialog box to appear. Set the <code>Amount</code> to approximately <code>100%</code>. <code>Distribution</code> option does not matter (I used <code>Gaussian</code>). Check the <code>Monochrome</code> checkbox if it is available and click the <code>OK</code> button.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0tm2a.png"" alt=""Add noise""></p></li>
<li><p>At this point canvas should display a grainy black &amp; white pattern, more black than white. If you have more white than black, go back through the earlier steps and make sure you did everything precisely. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AO9xD.png"" alt=""State of the document at this stage""></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Define this image as a pattern</strong>. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> on Windows or <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> on Mac to select the entire canvas, then go to <code>Edit</code> > <code>Define Pattern…</code>, and wait for <code>Pattern Name</code> dialog box to appear. You can enter whatever name you like, such as <code>Grainy Texture</code> for example.</p>

<p>You now have a pattern defined that you can use anytime when working in Photoshop. Let’s use it to create the blue texture like on the Twitter homepage.</p>

<h2>Part 2: Creating the Effect Using the Pattern</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Create new file in Photoshop</strong>. Enter your values for <code>Width</code> and <code>Height</code> (I used <code>900px</code> and <code>800px</code> respectively). <em>We are now working in this file, not the Texture File.</em></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wIK43.png"" alt=""Create new file in Photoshop""></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fill the background with blue-gray</strong>. Left-click on the foreground color swatch at the bottom of the <code>Tools</code> Panel and wait for <code>Color Picker (Foreground Color)</code> dialog box to appear. Enter <code>51708a</code> as a value for the HEX text field (you will find it near the bottom-right, with a hash sign <code>#</code> beside it). This value represents a blue-gray color similar to what Twitter is using, and the picker should display that color after you type in that text. Click <code>OK</code> in the dialog box and press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Backspace</kbd> on Windows or <kbd>⌥</kbd>+<kbd>Delete</kbd> on Mac to fill the current layer with this blue-gray color.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f9yY9.png"" alt=""Fill the background with blue-gray""></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Create a <code>Pattern Fill</code> layer with previously created pattern</strong>. Go to <code>Layer</code> > <code>New Fill Layer</code> > <code>Pattern…</code>, wait for the <code>New Layer</code> dialog box to appear, enter <code>Texture (matte)</code> in the <code>Name</code> field and click <code>OK</code>. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f1Yqq.png"" alt=""New Layer dialog box""></p>

<p>Wait for the <code>Pattern Fill</code> dialog box to appear and make sure previously created pattern is selected. If not, click the down arrow near the preview of the pattern and choose <code>Grainy Texture</code> (you can mouse-over the patterns to see their names in the tooltip).</p>

<li><p><strong>Lower opacity and change blend mode to <code>Overlay</code> for texture layer</strong>. In the <code>Layers</code> Panel, you should see a menu option that says <code>Normal</code>.

<p>Both schemes have their own perks on different types of elements. Unsurprisingly, Art Optimized excels for anything <em>but</em> text, whereas Type Optimized is often a lot better at rendering text/fonts. (Well, I guess that could be a subjective topic, but it's irrelevant to the discussion – let's just stay true to the fact; sometimes you prefer one or the other, and often (here's the gist of the whole thing) you prefer both schemes treating their intended elements, respectively, right?</p>

<p>I often have to export two versions; one *_art_opt.png and one *_type_opt.png when making e.g. a logotype. Then, I have to place both rendered images on two layers in Photoshop, cutting off the Art Optimized portion from the Type area, and vice versa. Just in order to get what I was looking for in the first place: OPTIMIZED art … in other words, ""art"" rendered Art Optimized and text rendered Type Optimized.</p>

<p>Factor in that I often make various different sizes; transparent versions and opaque versions; saved in various formats … and you have some SERIOUS™ time waste right there.</p>

<p>Another advantage of this method is that what you see on your artboard (once all rasterize filters are applied) will be exactly what you will get when exporting so you can really control the final output.</p>

<p>The object will be rasterized but as it is an effect you can turn it on/off in the <code>Appareance</code> panel – so it isn't really rasterized and doesn't get altered. Then when exporting, don't apply any anti-aliasing in the <code>Save for Web &amp; Devices</code> panel.</p>

What else printing options would hint that they're capable of doing prints with white ink?</li>
<li>How should I go about preparing my file for the printer? What technical requirements should it meet? I mean generally—but if there are shortcuts for this when using Adobe's Creative Suite, I'm all ears.</li>
</ol>
","<p>To answer the first question: you want a printer who says they can do white. It's not a matter of 5-color printing, it's more whether that printer does that kind of thing.</p>

<p>As you can tell from a look at the Pantone swatch book, there is no white ink in conventional printing. The translucency of the few whites that are available makes them unsuitable for most projects and you'll not find many printers willing to go to the hassle without charging you handsomely for their trouble. (Contamination from traces of other inks becomes a major issue with white, because any defect is so visible. That means the press guys have to do surgical cleaning of blanket, rollers, etc. before loading white.) On dark stock you'll almost always need more than one pass to build up enough ink density.</p>

<p>For pure offset, you can use one of the neutral Pantone metallics to get at least a pale gray look. On colored stock, especially uncoated matte stock with some tooth, there is no metallic sheen. The metallics aren't terrifically opaque, so a white underprinting or multiple passes are often needed. The standard advice applies: talk to the printer and see what they advise with their equipment and the card stock you're planning on.</p>

<p>For real opaque white, your best bets are thermography or white foil stamping. In either case put the text or graphic on a layer that's specified as ""White"" in the same way you would specify a spot varnish. Foil stamping houses generally prefer a separate file with just the foil portion, but whoever is doing the printing can advise you. Stamping involves a custom die, just like embossing, so be prepared for that to cost quite a bit extra for your first run of cards.</p>

<p>For your specific job, one ""color"" on dark stock, almost all printers want your text and graphics in black. You specify ""white"" in the order, and you can name the layer ""white"" just to remind them, but the objects should be black in the file. Same goes for foil and embossing.</p>

"Convert text to paragraph text in Illustrator","40302","","<p>Is there any quick way to convert text created at point (automatically resizable boundaries) to a area (paragraph) text (with fixed boundaries) in Illustrator CS3?</p>
","<p>Point text and area text are such different objects under the hood that there's no instant way to convert from one to the other. Many typographic functions tied to paragraphs, such as the Single Line and Paragraph Composers, justification, text wrap and hyphenation are inapplicable to point type.</p>

<p>As DA01 says, the simplest way to do this is to select the text, then cut or copy and paste into a new text frame. Select the Text tool and drag out the new frame, then paste. (Your text cursor has to be active inside the frame for this to work.) You'll then have to check for forced line breaks in the point text that will still be present in the new area type.</p>

","<p>There's multiple ways. The easiest would be to add a 'colour overlay' layer style.</p>

<ul>
<li>Double-click the empty area in the Layers palette, on the right of the layer's title. This will open the 'Layer Styles' dialogue box.</li>
<li>Click the words 'Color Overlay' on the left -- just clicking the checkmark isn't enough.</li>
<li>Click the colored rectangle in the mid-top of the dialogue box to pop up the colour picker and choose your colour.</li>
<li>Click 'OK' to leave the colour picker and confirm, and 'OK' again to leave the layer style dialogue and confirm.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a non-destructive effect (you can revert or alter it as needed), but only if you save it as a *.psd file. If you save as *.png, it will just be the new colour.</p>

<p>A more direct way might be to destructively alter the pixels' colour:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the layer palette, seek out the word 'lock', and click on the checkerboard icon next to it. This will lock the layer's opacity: you can edit the layer as you like, but pixels will retain their current opacity value.</li>
<li>Paint in your colour in any way you like.</li>
<li>Unlock the transparency again to prevent stumping yourself later.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since it's the loss of opacity anti-aliasing that creates your unwanted effect, locking the opacity will prevent this from happening.</p>

<p>EDIT:
As proposed by Larme in their comment, here is another non-destructive method:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a second layer above your layer and fill it with your colour. This can be a 'solid color' layer or just a pixel layer filled with the desired colour.</li>
<li>right-click in the empty part of this layer in the layers palette, and choose 'Create Clipping Mask' OR hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> and click on the border between the two layers in the palette (you'll see a square and arrow cursor).</li>
</ul>

<p>This way, the bottom layer's transparency act as a mask for the top layer.</p>

"Problem converting color from RGB to CMYK for print","39913","","<p>I designed a poster in CorelDraw X5 for printing purposes. I was told by the Printshop guy to use colors only in CMYK. For the most part I did, I don't know why I missed it but I used one color in RGB. I liked this color so much that I've used it at many places. So, current situation is that some colors are in RGB and some are in CMYK. So, I want to convert all RGB to CMYK and thought the problem would be solved. But now I'm actually facing a lot of trouble. The colors are not at all same. I hate the colors that it is showing me.</p>

<p>This is the color I used in RGB:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/h0ZbN.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>When I changed the ""Model"" to CMYK, the color it shows is really different. As you can see in the picture below, it's too dull:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NEfRJ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The RGB values of both colors are not the same. What can I do to get the same color in CMYK? I did a little bit of reading here and there. They say, that you can't get same. In that case, what is the closest color that I can get?</p>
","<p>The range of colors that can be reproduced in any CMYK-only color (known in the trade as ""Process Color"") printing method is considerably smaller than the sRGB range of colors reproducible on a standard monitor. Here is an <a href=""http://www.hidefcolor.com/color-management/rgb-convert-cmyk-profile-color-photoshop/"">excellent video</a> that demonstrates this visually using 3D color models.</p>

<p>It happens that one of the ranges of RGB color that can't be reproduced at all is in the relatively ""pure"" and saturated blues, and you've run into a problem that confronts many a beginning or untrained designer: ""everybody's favorite color is blue,"" but blue doesn't print.  This is not the only difficult range. Huge chunks of green and yellow-green, and all the bright reds and oranges just don't appear in CMYK at all. (There are ways to get many of these colors into print, but you have to go beyond just CMY and K into special inks to get there.)</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with Corel, so I don't know if it has a ""gamut warning"" feature similar to what you'd find in Photoshop or Illustrator to let you know that you're picking colors that are outside the range of CMYK ""process colors"". What I can tell you is that in this case Corel is trying to give you the closest achievable CMYK blue to the one you picked in RGB. Unfortunately, as you've discovered, it's not very close.</p>

<p>The other thing that may help is to make sure that your CMYK color profile is <em>not</em> set to the usual default of SWOP v2. Not only is this very out of date, it doesn't accurately reflect what is really achievable on modern presses. The best CMYK color space for most purposes these days is Coated GRACol 2006, which is also an ISO standard. If you can change your CMYK color profile to GRACol or FOGRA39 you'll find you have considerably better choices in the blue range. They're still nowhere near the full RGB gamut, but a definite advance on SWOP.</p>

"How do Pantone coated and uncoated colors relate?","39381","","<p>I need some help understanding the relationship between coated and uncoated Pantone colors.</p>

<p>From what I've read online, the coated formula (say <code>200 C</code>) is for printing on coated (glossy) stock, and the uncoated variant (<code>200 U</code>) is for uncoated (non-glossy) stock.</p>

<p>This would lead me to believe that the colors are formulated to look as similar as possible when printed on their respective stocks.</p>

<p>However, they look quite different on my display, and when running them through the <a href=""http://www.pantone.com/pages/pantone/color_xref.aspx"">Pantone xref app</a> targeting the <code>TPX</code> color book, it returns rather different results for each:</p>

<pre><code>200 C =&gt; 19-1763 TPX
200 U =&gt; 17-1641 TPX
</code></pre>

<p>Is the difference between colors achievable on coated and uncoated stock severe enough to lead to this discrepancy? Or am I mistaken about the coated and uncoated colors being meant to produce the same results on their respective stocks?</p>

<p>When a color is referenced as simply <code>Pantone 200</code>, should this be construed to meant the coated or uncoated color?</p>
","<p>You're pretty much spot on, they are formulated differently for the different papers. Uncoated is a more matte finish whereas coated is for glossier finishes, although in part that is down to coated paper being naturally more glossy. Additionally due to the lack of the steaming and pressing process, uncoated stock is by far more absorbent and requires the inks to be thinner and in lower quantities, however, in the vast majority of cases, the result will be almost identical. Its important to note that uncoated will obviously bleed more, by a margin of up to 10% extra, causing a shift in the print, especially with halftone printing, which will in turn affect the visible output.</p>

<p>In recent years however Pantone have skipped the U/C variants for the consumer market, and by default target uncoated variants. Some colours will look drastically different due to the difference in absorbency and whiteness of the paper, due to pantone white actually being transparent, to let the paper's whiteness show through.</p>

<p>In short, by default uncoated will be targeted, but if in doubt, contact your printers.</p>

"Is there a difference between the actual ruler and InDesign's inches scale?","39314","","<p>I am pretty new to InDesign. I have set my scale to measure in inches. Today I had an actual physical-ruler (like the one image below) lying around so I picked it up and compared it with the scale on screen in InDesign.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Uts3K.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>To my surprise, I found a difference. Note that there are 16 points/stops that makes an inch. On comparison, I found the on-screen-scale to be one point shorter than an actual physical-ruler. I assume it is not supposed to be like this, what am I missing ? I have my document size view set to actual (<code>Ctrl + 1</code>). </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> - Seems like I was missing  the obvious concept, that the measurement in a software is just a simulation and are dependent on the resolution of the device they are used in. </p>

<p>I also got some very useful insights in this Photoshop article on <a href=""http://www.keptlight.com/photoshop-view-print-size/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">View Print Size</a>. Unlike InDesign, Photoshop has a menu named ""Print Size"" that can be used to get an almost accurate (It worked for me) size simulation provided you have a similar setting (again depends on your screen size and resolution).</p>

<p><code>Preference &gt; Units&amp;Rulers &gt; New-doc-presolutions &gt; ScreenRes. &gt; 100 pixels/inch</code></p>
","<p>Simply put the computer has no idea how big your screen is. 100% zoom does not really mean anything meaningful*. You can tell the computer how big your monitor actually is but this is a bit unreliable and has some side effects in other software.</p>

<p>So simply the computer is showing how big the relative ruler is. There is also no guarantee that the printer is calibrated correctly.There's also no guarantees that the pipeline is respecting your scaling settings. So you should measure your print. Nothing exactly new. </p>

<p>*Unless you make pixel based graphics for screens. Still no measure what it looks like on another screen. Pixel based things have NO inherent size in inches.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> What you see on screen does not need to reflect physical size, its still correct in relative terms.</p>

<p>Without the notches you're likely to see the edges of the bottom shapes where they meet the edges of the overlaying shapes (on screen anyway, it's not really a problem when printing).</p>

<p>I'm new to SVGs, and just made my first decent graphic in Illustrator. I've embedded it into a page with the GWF script for the Ubuntu font in the tag. As it turns out, the Ubuntu font displays correctly in regular text, but for this trick to work in the SVG, the Google script has to be embedded in the SVG itself. How can I do this?</p>
","<p>You embed fonts in CSS by using base64 encoding. You can apply styles in SVG documents similar to CSS by using a <code>&lt;style /&gt;</code> element. So if you have a WOFF font, you'd embed it like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
@font-face {
    font-family: ""Sample font"";
    src: url(""data:application/font-woff;charset=utf-8;base64,..."");
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>...</code> is the base64 encoded font data.</p>

<p>You can find examples of this by looking at Typekit's stylesheets. I'm not sure if the mime type of <code>font/woff</code> is correct, as I've also seen people claim that it should be <code>application/font-woff</code>. Though <code>font/woff</code>, <code>font/truetype</code>, <code>font/opentype</code>, etc. seem to be more popular.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could actually take the SVG version of the web font and <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/fonts.html"">embed the SVG font's description markup</a> inside of your document (though browser support is still very limited as Luke notes in the comments).</p>

<p>However, you should also be able to link to an external font <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/fonts.html#FontFaceSrcElement"">according to the SVG specification</a>. That would seem to be the best solution if you're gonna have multiple SVG documents referencing that font.</p>

","<p>After reading comments under the question....</p>

<p>Photoshop has <em>basic</em> path editing capabilities. That is not to say they are lacking for the most part, but there are some areas which Photoshop is not as robust as Illustrator. Remember vector items are an <em>addition</em> to Photoshop, not it's core goal.</p>

<p><strong>For Photoshop</strong>, you need to use the <strong>Pen Tool</strong> to draw a <strong>vector layer</strong>. This means you need to use Photoshop CS6 or newer. You can then add a stroke to that vector layer and move the stroke to the <em>inside</em> of the vector shape. This will force the stroke to have the corners you draw as opposed to rounding everything.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NGFYv.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In many cases the strokes can cause extreme corner miters like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pDwzf.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>There's not a lot you can do about those other than to edit the path and ensure the corners aren't <em>that</em> tight of an angle. This is where Photoshop can fail with paths at times. You'll notice in the image above there are a couple sharp corners that are a bit <em>too</em> extended. There's no way to solve that other than to alter the angles at the corner by reducing/enlarging the amount of curve on the associated paths.</p>

<p>You do <em>not</em> want to use a brush and then use <code>Edit &gt; Stroke...</code>. This will <em>never</em> get sharp corners. You <em>could</em> use a layer style with a stroke, provided the stroke is also <em>aligned to the inside</em> of the shape. </p>

<p><strong>For Illustrator,</strong> It's a simple matter of drawing your shape.</p>

<p>Illustrator provides specific adjustment to miter limits. This allows you to somewhat control how and when points become sharp:</p>

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0MBcl.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You can also align the stroke to the inside using Illustrator (for closed paths). This generally results in a better stroke than Photoshop provides.</p>

<p>Any help/ideas for my issue?</p>
","<p>In general you have three basic possibilities:</p>

<p>1) Increase your picture's dimensions (on the shortest side) to make it square (As Lauren suggested)</p>

<p>2) Crop them to be square (As DA01 suggested)</p>

<p>3) Stretch your images to fit a square</p>

<p>All three of them have their pros and cons of course.</p>

<p>The first one makes it square, but it adds useless ""information"".</p>

<p>The second technique takes away some of your picture, and you may lose some ""information"".</p>

<p>The third one keeps everything but it makes it look distorted and strange.</p>

<p>There are of course more complicated options such as <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=extract%20an%20object%20photoshop"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">extracting your object</a> and then standardizing a background or faking the background by <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=extract%20an%20object%20photoshop#sclient=psy-ab&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=extend%20background%20photoshop&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=extend%20background%20photoshop&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g2g-v2&amp;aql=1&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=22925l26485l0l26636l27l17l0l5l5l1l483l5912l2-1.11.4l19l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&amp;fp=b571422ac7922aeb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=989"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">extending it</a>.</p>

<p>If you are the photographer, then I would suggest setting up a system when you take the pictures of your objects and leave plenty of room around your object so that you can crop it square later.</p>

<p>However, if there as the pictures you are using, then it shouldn't be a hassle to use either of the above techniques.... here's an example of the first three, respectively.</p>

<p>Extra background:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fWYHp.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Cropped:</p>

<p>Stretched:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/z9io9.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In addition to that (again, given that these are the actual pictures) it's important to remember what you're using these images for. If you're selling furniture, it's best that you don't stretch the image in any way, as it may make the furniture seems smaller/larger or more out of proportion than it really is. The second technique works great if you can simply crop out the background, and if that's not an option then adding a background to expand the image may be your best bet.</p>

"Saving a document in photoshop CMYK turns SOME black into gray","36668","","<p>I am creating a rather big photoshop document 3000x3000 which i want to print. I thought i took all the precautions:
CMYK color mode
300ppi
save as pdf and so on</p>

<p>Still when i save the picture as pdf or jpg, SOME, not all, of the blacks turns out to be dark gray instead. I really don't know what to do since I need the picture printed tomorrow.</p>

<p>Please help me out, if it helps I have the full .psd</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>The different blacks originates from a ""linear burn"" blend mode on top of a black layer! which has no different black output in photoshop</p>

<p><strong>FIXED - Solution:</strong></p>

<p>I fixed the screen output by putting a black layer with the hex value #000000 on top of the other layers and setting it's blending mode to lighter color - which only doesn't allow the gray'ish black to shine through, but preserves the rest of the colors!</p>

<p>Again - thanks a lot for the quick response, even though your comprehensive answer did not fix my problem, I am sure that it will help a lot of other people...</p>
","<p>Welcome to what is probably the Number 1 'gotcha' for people new to print design :-) and yes, people who encounter it for the first time not pre-warned almost always run into just before a deadline...</p>

<p>RGB black is simple. It's just no light coming from the screen.</p>

<p>CMYK black isn't simple. There's black ink (the 'K' in CMYK), but even with 100% black ink, it doesn't create a magic black hole that absorbs all light. There are a whole range of shades of printed CMYK colours that look black, but with a very slightly different edge or character to them because of slight differences in precisely what light the stacks of ink absorb:</p>

<ul>
<li>100% K, 0% everything else, when printed in large areas, looks a bit dull and uninspired. But it's great for text and fine lines, because there's no risk of indistinct edges if the print plates are very very slightly mis-aligned</li>
<li>There's ""<strong>Rich black</strong>"", which is a mix of inks intended to create a more vibrant black. There are as many rich blacks as there are print configurations - <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/5611/rich-black-and-shades-of-grey"">see here for more info</a>.</li>
<li>Some designers will sometimes create their own rich black for a project. If you want a slightly cooler black, more cyan. A slightly warmer black, add magenta. And so on. (beware <code>total ink</code> - if you don't know what that is, google it, because that's maybe the second biggest print design gotcha and you don't want to learn what it is after asking the question ""Help why do the dark colours in my print keep smudging?""... you probably don't have total ink problems, but you might create total ink problems if trying to fix rich black problems clumsily, I did once...). If doing this, always check proofs and work with the printer on this, they know their setup better than you can, never make assumptions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rich black's colour balance typically looks like this (the Adobe default mix, from <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/668/whats-the-difference-between-cmyk-black-and-rgb-black"">this related question</a>):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MTL0H.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The washed-out greys you're seeing are the software trying to simulate the range of possible blacks on a screen. That's near impossible to do well, but it's valuable because it shows you where two blacks have a different mix and would look different on the printed page. So, it doesn't look good on the screen, but that's fine, because if the document is CMYK, you're not designing for a screen. </p>

<p>Be very careful not to accidentally have two mixes of black up against each other unintentionally... It's a really common newbie error. </p>

<p><strong>How to fix it?</strong> Depends on the file. Different black mixes in one file is not usually desirable, but can be okay so long as there aren't any sharp edges where one meets the other. Don't panic too much about how things look on the screen for the aforementioned reasons - assuming it's <em>actually</em> black, it shouldn't look as washed out or grey when printed. Get print proofs.</p>

<p>Try to track down where the differences came from. You might have picked different black swatches without realising it, or got black from the colour wheel somewhere and a swatch/dropdown somewhere else... If you can identify the different blacks you can go some of the way towards equalising them with careful use of <code>Select &gt; Color range</code>. Or if you converted from RGB, you can look at the conversion settings.</p>

<p>If I mix equal amounts of red, green and blue paint together in real life, I will never achieve a white color, in the way you do when setting the maximum values for them in RGB (#FFF), and I'd be hard pressed to get an exact shade of grey. </p>

<p>Looking at an RGB code, how can I know what proportions to mix the colors in to get the same with real paint?</p>

<p>Is RGB to CMYK conversion the answer?</p>

<p>To put it another way:</p>

<p><strong>How can I mix real paint colors together to achieve the same color that I've got on my screen in RGB?</strong></p>
","<p>Real color is a quite complex subject. In essence color is something that happens somewhere between your cornea and brain. Simplifying this a bit color is what you sense when some photons interact with the three color sensing structures in your eye. Other definitions exist but they fail on many levels.</p>

<p>Photons can reach your eye trough many processes. They can reach your eye directly from the light source, or they can bounce on the way. When they bounce your actually seeing the color that the surface did not absorb. Whereas when you emit light you see what was sent unless something obscures the light on the way. The photon can also reach your eye trough other processes, some which are weird and obscure but that's another subject.</p>

<p>Because we have 2 primary systems for imaging in design, we also have 2 base models: additive and subtractive. One deals with emissive media like monitors. The other with reflective media like paper, but also works for things like stained glass. These models are inverses of each other: RGB is the inverse of CMY; mixing RG gives you Y and so forth.*</p>

<p>Manually mixing color has some other challenges. Your pigments may not react with each other chemically, or anything can happen. The pigments also need to be pure, and not have too big of a spread in what they remove from the spectrum as the eyes sensors overlap slightly. I find it extremely unlikely that you will find paint that fulfills this requirement easily.</p>

<p>It's also important that your lightning conditions need to be good as it affects how the subtraction happens. It's possible to design colors that change when you go indoors under artificial light, as compared to direct sunlight (This is called metamerism).</p>

<p>Now comes the mindblowingly hard part. In order to mix the right color you need to measure the colors. See, RGB values themselves are just signals; they do not represent colors without you knowing how the device displays the color. Each monitor behaves differently, and so do your pigments.</p>

<p>* <strong>Interesting fact:</strong> The ordering, RGB and CMY, are not mistakes. Any of the two colors in a triplet combined makes the corresponding color you didn't choose in the corresponding inverse triplet, so G + B = C and C - Y = G. The fact that the colors don't display as pure is because the computer tries to mimic available pigments, failing miserably.</p>

"Colors change in Photoshop when copying a selection from one document into a new document","36283","","<p>I'm trying to copy a particular layer out of a Photoshop document into its own new document and export it for use on the web.  I'm doing this by right-clicking the layer in the layers palette, choosing 'Select pixels', copying to the clipboard, creating a new document with the default size (based on clipboard contents), and pasting.</p>

<p>This works, but causes the colors in the copied image to change.  As an example, a gray divider image goes from <code>#d6d5d5</code> -> <code>#b0adad</code> (I'm getting the colors in the source and destination image by using the eyedropper tool).</p>

<p>Anyone know how I can extract a layer from my image without incurring a color shift?</p>
","<p>From the description, your source document may be using a non-sRGB color profile. When you force it into an sRGB document the colors are rendered differently.

<p>The solution in this case is <code>Edit &gt; Convert to Profile</code> in the original. Be sure to use ""Perceptual"" or ""Relative Colorimetric"" as the method to avoid other undesirable color shifts.</p>

Option-click on the eyeball by that layer to ""solo"" it, and check your colors. If they've changed, that's the problem. The remedy is to use Copy Merged (Cmd-Shift-C) rather than Copy.</p>

<p>Your best bet is to get color samples from your printer. Bigger printers will often print out color grids showing you different CMYK mixes on various paper stock. Barring that, you can invest in some Pantone CMYK books that do the same.</p>

<p>If you use a regular printer, and tend to run larger jobs that require cropping/trimming, you can make these yourself by placing CMYK color grids in the gutters of your press sheets. Ask the printer to keep those for you when they trim them all. </p>

"What DPI should be used for what situations?","35902","","<p>I've been seeing the word 'DPI' pop up quite a lot when I export my work out in Photoshop and Illustrator. While I know that DPI stands for 'dots per inch', and that if you have too low of a DPI on an image, heavy pixellation occurs if you try to zoom in, what would be the optimal DPI for what situations?</p>

<p>For example (Situations):</p>

<ul>
<li>Exporting a print A4 design</li>
<li>Website layout</li>
<li>Logo (Website only - Roughly smaller than the current SE Graphic Design one.)</li>
<li>Logo (Scaling up and down - From business cards to large banners.)</li>
</ul>
","<p>I've always thought DPI was somewhat of a misnomer... It really only applies if you are printing an image, otherwise, well, pixels are pixels. For an image on a site, well, it really doesn't matter, just get as many as possible, to fit the required size. Printers vary somewhat, but around 300 DPI is usually a good rule of thumb for anything around the size of a sheet of paper or smaller.</p>

<p>For Logos, I'd hope they are being designed in a vector program, which means the DPI can be adjusted to whatever the size is of the object. </p>

"Illustrator Artboard dimensions for mobile ui design?","35889","","<p>I want to create one document with multiple (3) artboards in Illustrator for mobile wireframing/ui design. One for iPhone, Android and iPad.
Can I create artboards with different 'resolutions' within the same document, or do I just scale up for retina etc?
What pixel dimensions for artboards are recommended/most-frequently-used when designing ui for mobile apps for these three devices? 
Have worked for years with Illustrator, but I'm from a print background – these virtual dimensions are giving me a headache! Any suggestions gratefully accepted.</p>
","<p>My recommendation: create an Illustrator document using the ""Web"" profile, to ensure that ""Align New Objects to Pixel Grid"" is on. That way when you place new shapes onto any artboard, they are pixel-perfect, and will look clean on export at 72dpi. Also, make sure you are in Pixel Preview mode when designing so you can align shapes to the pixels.</p>

<p><strong><em>Edit: Yes you can create more than one artboard at different dimensions. Just use the Artboard tool, and drag out new artboards in the Illustrator document.</em></strong></p>

<p>Then, create each artboard at whichever size you prefer to work at: either @2x or not. Here is my goto list, in px:</p>

<ol>
<li>iPhone 6: 750 x 1334 </li>
<li>iPhone 6 plus: 1242 x 2208</li>
<li>iPhone 5s/5c/5: 640 x 1136</li>
<li>iPad: 1536 x 2048 </li>
<li>HTC One: 1080 x 1920
[this is the device I have, but its pixel ratio is equivalent to the
most popular Android phones, namely the Samsung Galaxys, etc]</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, I prefer working at full @2x (or more) resolution because during export of artwork I have to do less work. In general, the best way to gauge screen size is to just take a screen capture off of the device you are designing for, and look at the pixel size for that image.</p>

<p><strong>Now, the part you are most interested in.</strong> As you already know, working in vector graphics is awesome. Infinite resolute support and (almost) infinite scalability. When you are ready to export the artboards do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the artboard you are working with </li>
<li>File > Save for the Web</li>
<li>In the dialogue that opens, select the PNG-24 setting. Toggle
transparency on/off as you wish</li>
<li>Look to where it says Image Size. Here you can export the artboard at any size without loss of quality. You can do 50% size for your low-res devices. Or 100% size for the @2x device sizes I mentioned above. </li>
<li>When you change a size, make sure all values get updates in image size. You may have to click around into the width/height boxes a bit before that happens. Otherwise your export will come out at the original size. </li>
<li>Finally you will have a file at the right size, with minimal headache, and
compressed in file-size for use anywhere you want. My favorite from
here is to import the files onto an actual Phone/Tablet and then
thumb through them to get a feel for what the interface might look
like on an actual device.</li>

"Photoshop CS5 - how to ""normalize"" colors in an image to reduce the noise?","35864","","<p>New to photoshop so bear with me...</p>

<p>I have a scanned image that, ideally, should be just three colors: red, black, and white.  The original was a pen an ink drawing and the act of scanning added all sorts of slight color variations.</p>

<p>To make things worse, the image was saved as a .jpg before it was sent to me, so the compression has created some artifacts as well.</p>

<p>I've already tried ""reduce noise"" filter in a hundred different ways and, while somewhat helpful, does not produce the effect I'm looking for.  Is there some way to convert, normalize, or blend all of these different shades of red to a single ""red"" color?  Likewise for the blacks and whites.  I don't want 35 different shades of light gray around the edges of the my image.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.</p>
","<p>There are three ""brute force"" approaches you can take:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add a ""Posterize"" adjustment layer and set the color count to 3. One you have it to your satisfaction, flatten the image. This is probably the quickest and simplest approach, and will likely work fine for your purposes. This is the only approach that doesn't mandate making a copy of the base layer first.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>Filter &gt; Blur &gt; Surface Blur</code> to smooth out the variations without affecting edges.</p></li>
<li><p>Eliminate the noise on a channel-by-channel basis using Surface Blur or <code>Filter &gt; Noise &gt; Median</code>. You can even go into Lab mode and run the noise filter on the a and b channels, then Surface Blur on the L channel, but in a simple case like this I doubt that's needed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If the jpeg artifacting is really obnoxious around your hard black/white boundaries, as it sometimes is, you can prep the image for the Posterize treatment by using a hard-edged white brush in Overlay mode (or the Dodge tool set to ""Highlights"" and about 50% exposure) to turn the gray blocks white without affecting the black.</p>

"How to convert between Android DP and CSS px?","35824","","<p>I see this is probably a noob question, but it truly confuses me.</p>

<p>I'm reading documents from the Google Material Design, along with some of its implementations in css. The specification is written in Android's <code>dp</code>, while  css codes uses <code>px</code> as a length unit.</p>

<p>What confuses me is that the css implementations often uses the exact value from specification, for example, a toast <a href=""http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/snackbars-and-toasts.html#snackbars-and-toasts-specs"">should have</a>:</p>

  <p>2 dp rounded corner</p>

border-radius: 2px;

<p>In my current understanding, an Android <code>DP</code> is generally displayed at the size of one pixel on a 160dpi screen, while the CSS <code>px</code> is defined as a visual angle. So does a <code>px</code> happens to be the same as a <code>dp</code> when seeing in some distance?

<p>I have the cc edition, if only on a trial basis.</p>

<p>I have a shape selected - it is a white ""rectangle"", with a drop box and so forth. Rectangle is in quotes, because to <em>me</em> it is a rectangle, but I do not know how the rectangle was created.</p>

<p>As seen here:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QmS0M.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I want to resize this (which was harder than it needed to be - i had to go to edit - free transform. </p>

<p>But when i drag the image, the rounded corners go bonkers! I read <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/a/13521/29390"">in this answer - see the comments</a> that it should be possible to edit the corners now.</p>

<p>But i do not know what to press...  in the pictures i found on youtube, it looked like when i opened ""properties"" i should be able to see the transform options. </p>

<p>How do i make this simple image bigger and with a rounded corner?</p>
","<p>I don't know why your Properties options don't have the radius section.  I think Emily is on the right track, in stating that your ""shape"" may in fact just be a layer mask on a filled layer.  My Properties option box has a separate ""Shape"" section in it (see below).<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qhb76.png"" alt=""shape""></p>

<p>I would just create an actual shape and scrap what you have there with that mask, but if you do insist on using what you already have, the best way that I can see to resize it and still maintain your radii would be by moving the points on either side of each radius.  I have to disagree with Emily here, I ALWAYS avoid rasterizing - at all costs.</p>

<p>Use the <code>Direct Selection Tool</code> for this, as pictured below:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kQSDs.png"" alt=""tool""></p>

<p>Select this group of <code>Anchor Points</code> to adjust the rectangle's size horizontally.  Hold down the <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> key, to drag the points in a straight line.<br>

<p>Like I said, I always try to avoid rasterizing and instead prefer to work with shapes, smart objects, and layer masks.  This keeps everything scalable and is also a non-destructive way of working.</p>

"Why don't upper case numbers exist?","35079","","<p>Capital letters add a lot to text in various ways, for names, brands, emphasis (although capitalisation for emphasis is frowned upon)</p>

<p>Why then, are there no upper case numbers?</p>
","<p>They do. The thing is, you probably don't realise, because upper case numbers have been all you've been using or seeing.</p>

<p>There is a distinction between 'default' numbers and 'oldstyle' numbers. The default numbers we all know are the actual capitals, with the 'oldstyle' numbers (sometimes incorrectly called 'proportional numbers') are lowercase.</p>

<p>Fonts tend to default to one style or another. Most font files allow you to change default numbers into oldstyle ones by turning them into 'small caps', but you can also select them from the Glyphs palette (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F11</kbd> in InDesign).</p>

<p>Don't confuse 'default' vs. 'oldstyle' with 'tabular' vs. 'proportional', that's a distinction in how the numbers are lined out horizontally.</p>

<p><strong>3) Remove the color with the color picker</strong> </p>

<p>If you still have a background even if the box ""transparency"" is checked, then use the color picker tool on the top left of your ""save for web"" window, and click in the white background. Then, go on the right side where the color chart is, and click the first small icon; it will change the color you previously selected to transparent.</p>

<p>You can also do this by simply clicking on the white swatch on the right side color chart, and then clicking the small icon I mentioned above. You can do this for as many color as you want.</p>

<p>Note that this technique will remove ALL the white or the selected color on your gif!</p>

","<p>As mentioned in the comments, it would be better if you re-drew the shape using the pen tool. This might seem like quite a challenge at first, but it's really not difficult at all, once you do a couple you will find the rest very easy. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.sitepoint.com/illustrator-drawing-tools-part-5-pen-tool-%E2%80%93-curves/"" rel=""nofollow"">This article</a> is part of a series on drawing tools in Illustrator, and it focuses on drawing curved paths. The basic principle is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike straight paths, curved paths are created by clicking and
  dragging. The first time you click and drag, you set a starting point
  for the curved path and importantly, you also determine the direction
  of the curve. As you continue to drag, a curved path is drawn between
  the previous point and the current point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you click and drag with the Pen tool, two things happen:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An anchor point is placed on the artboard when you click.</p></li>
<li><p>Direction lines and direction points are drawn when you drag.</p></li>
</ul>

"Auto crop layer in Photoshop","34580","","<p>I've been googling this subject and also searched in this forum, all I found were posts about removing semi transparent pixels, ie. not what I have a problem with.</p>

<p>Basically, I've added a layer to my image that has the same size as the image. Then I add something to the layer, way smaller than the entire image. Now I want a quick way to ""auto crop"" the layer so that the layer only spans over the pixels that actually contain something.</p>

<p>In GIMP I choose Layer -> Auto crop layer. But there doesn't seem to exist such an action in Photoshop. Does anyone know where I can find this tool?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong> Ok this is pretty much the scenario.</p>

<p>I have an image that consists of a lot of layers. On a certain part of that image I want to create a magnifying effect. So </p>

<ul>
<li>temporarily I flattened the image</li>
<li>copied a circled area</li>
<li>undid the flattening</li>
<li>pasted the copied circle on to a new layer</li>
</ul>

<p>now I want to use: <em>Filter</em> -> <em>Distort</em> -> <em>Spherize</em> to give it a magnified effect. However, the spherize effect affects the entire size of the layer and not only where the content of the layer is. This makes the circle that I pasted not the centre of the sphere but rather the lower right corner of the sphere, resulting in a totally different effect than wanted.</p>

<p>I hope this clears the issue up.</p>
","<p>If I understand Photoshop layers correctly, I can assert that a layer is always the size of the canvas no matter what. A square inside of a layer may be smaller, but when it comes to effects, it'll be relative to the size of the canvas unless you make a selection.</p>

<p>If you want to achieve your effect, either paste that flattened circle into a new image, do your effect, and then paste it back in the original, or run the Spherize filter on the pasted layer while the item is selected (Ctrl-click the thumbnail in the Layers palette) and it should work the way you expect.</p>

<p>If you're looking for Auto Crop in Photoshop, I believe that <code>Image</code> > <code>Trim...</code> is what you want. But that crops the entire canvas, not individual layers.</p>

"Techniques to draw tasteful lines and border in Photoshop","34270","","<p>When I draw lines or borders in Photoshop for my web design work, they are usually not beautiful and seem to me to not be aesthetically appealing. I don't know why, as drawing a line seems to be a very easy concept. I mean it shouldn't matter who how draws a line. A line or a border is a simple thing. But I really see that lines and borders in many websites are more beautiful than my lines and borders.</p>

<p>Is there any special technique I should know while drawing lines and borders in Photoshop, to make them beautiful?</p>
","<p>In my experience, one of the main reasons a border looks ugly is it's too heavy. ""Heavy"" is created by thickness, of course, but also by too much contrast. A black line on a white background must be thinner than a light grey line to avoid looking too severe (unless you're trying for the ""prison camp"" look).</p>

<p>Another reason that a border (or a rule) will seem wrong is if it is almost-but-not-quite the same weight as the text on a page. If your text characters are one pixel thick, your rule should be the same.</p>

<p>Finally, the number one reason a border looks ugly is it's unnecessary. It's almost a hallmark of untrained design to stick boxes around everything. In 99% of cases, like explaining a joke, they are redundant.</p>

<p>Previous answer, related primarily to <strong>Illustrator CS6 or older</strong>.</p>

<p>No. You can't have multiple, differing, iterations of the same symbol. You can use the Symbol tools, like the Symbol Stainer, but that won't allow specific color assignments within any symbol.</p>

<p>If you need different colored symbols, you need different symbols. </p>

"Web design what to use Photoshop or Illustrator?","33026","","<p>What should I use to design websites, Photoshop or Illustrator?</p>

<p>Is there a correct software or is it more a personal choice?</p>
","<p>I disagree with Anaksunaman's answer in regards to Photoshop.  The other day we had a similar question that I answered (<a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/38434/organizing-psds-for-developers"">Organizing PSDs for developers</a>) where I mentioned that in this evolving era, we as designers and coders must evolve with the workflow and using Photoshop is archaic and serves no purpose anymore in web design as an EFFECTIVE means of development.  Its still a great tool for photo manipulation but using it to implement a website design is pointless, to me.  </p>

<p>I will recommend (reference: <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/36884/what-are-the-steps-in-designing-a-website"">What are the steps in designing a website?</a>) that a better approach can be achieved with Illustrator especially with using artboards.  Although, I'm not referring to designing the entire site in Illustrator Im talking about the wireframe and mockup.  You should still design in the browser but if you design any icons they can be completed in Illustrator and exported.  If you are going to be developing branding or anything print related I would surely hope that the logo you developed is in vector shape and that vector shape can be saved as an SVG for a scalable image in responsive web design.  So a simple mockup or anything icon related can be exported out as SVG code and included in a XHTML document (reference: <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/38017/i-made-a-map-in-ai-but-the-file-size-is-huge-as-an-svg"">I made a map in AI, but the file size is HUGE as an svg?</a>)</p>

<p>On the topic of coding I believe that Dreamweaver is pointless and wasted money and if you ask around at a few web development companies that I've talked to they chuckle at Dreamweaver.  Its ok for new users but people that I have worked with that started using Dreamweaver relied heavily on the design preview area instead of working on the code and code completion is a bad habit for a new coder to rely on. You wont remember how to properly code if you always use code completion starting out.  There are some great and powerful code editors that are free such as Notepad++, Text Wrangler (I prefer BBEDit which is paid) and Sublime Text.</p>

<p>So a recap to your question ""Web design what to use Photoshop or Illustrator?"":
Both, image manipulation use Photoshop and Illustrator for logo, mockup, wire-framing, icons and anything that can be executed as a SVG.  After your mockup is completed I would work in a code editor and develop the rest of your site.</p>

"Simple Spot Color Separations for Screen Printing","32515","","<p>Ok, I'm an Illustrator noob, but I've worked in screen printing. </p>

<p>I made a design which is composed of an expanded Live Trace, a couple of rectangles with fills and strokes, and some text within said rectangles/boxes. It's a simple design and we have three spot colors, black, red, and yellow.</p>

<p>So my idea is (was) to flatten all layers, select each color, and move them to their own newly created layers, one color each layer. Print each layer black and, voilá, color seps.</p>

<p>I used the layer command Flatten Artwork, then selected a black object then Select -> Same -> Fill Color. Then created a new Layer, and slid the black on up. When I did the next color, which also happens to be the rectangle fill color, the text was now beneath the box. In other words, all objects (and text) were still on different layers, even though I thought I'd flattened the artwork. Nothing underneath my boxes or text was knocked out.</p>

<p>Can you flatten both art and text in Illustrator? If so, how?</p>

<p>Can you output (print) each layer separately, or must you create a new file for each? I saw no provision for printing individual layers in the Print Dialog box.</p>

<p>I'm using CS5 on Mac OS. Thanks for your help!</p>
","<p>There are a couple of ways to do color separations for screen preparation in Illustrator. You're trying to do it the more complicated way, so I'll walk you through how I'd do that first.</p>

<p>Let's start with a simple text object that has a fill and a stroke on top of a rectangle:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QheTp.png"" alt=""Starting Artwork""></p>

<h1>The Long Way</h1>

<h2>Step 1: BACK UP YOUR ORIGINAL ARTWORK!</h2>

<p>This process will make irreparable changes to your artwork. It won't affect the appearance, but it will certainly lessen the editability. Either save the original in a different file, or duplicate the artwork and store it in a locked and hidden layer.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Expand All Text and Strokes</h2>

<p>This is why we back up the original. Once we expand the text, we can't edit it again (without re-creating it). Use <strong>Object</strong> → <strong>Expand Appearance...</strong> and <strong>Object</strong> → <strong>Expand</strong> as many times as necessary until you have only shapes with fills (no strokes) and no text objects.</p>

<p>If we view the outlines of our artwork now, it looks very messy, but we'll clean that up in the next step.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1TClm.png"" alt=""Messy Lines""></p>

<h2>Step 3: Merge and Trim</h2>

<p>Click the <strong>Merge</strong> button on the <strong><em>Pathfinder</em></strong> pane. This will clean up the shapes so that there is no overlap. The artwork should still look exactly the same as the original, but in Outlines view it looks nice and tidy</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ySgvt.png"" alt=""Tidy Art""></p>

<h2>Step 4: Separate Colors into Layers</h2>

<p>Now, all we need to do is repeat a <strong>Select</strong> → <strong>Same</strong> → <strong>Fill Color</strong> and drag the selected colors into a new layer for each color.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ngccC.png"" alt=""Separated""></p>

<p>And you're done! You can now apply a black Fill and export each layer to have your screen separations.</p>

<hr>

<h1>The Easier Way</h1>

<p>If you have Acrobat (or another PDF printer?<sup>[Unverified]</sup>) installed, Illustrator has a nice way to do all this for you from the Print menu. <strong>Ignore all the previous steps and just start with your artwork</strong>  </p>

<p>Pull up <strong>File</strong> → <strong>Print...</strong>, and select <strong><em>Adobe PDF</em></strong> as your printer from the <strong>Printer:</strong> drop-down box.</p>

<p>On the left, go to the <strong>Output</strong> settings, set the <strong>Mode</strong> to <strong><em>Separations (Host Based)</em></strong>: and deselect all the process colors.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qaosU.png"" alt=""Output Settings""></p>

<p>When I hit print, the following PDF file is generated:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NtB1X.png"" alt=""PDF Output""> </p>

<p>Each color is separated on its own page.</p>

<h2>Added Bonus:</h2>

<p>Check out the <strong>Marks and Bleed</strong> settings as well. You can have it automatically add trim and registration marks which is ultra handy for lining up your screens. I prefer the Japanese Printer Mark Types (as opposed to Roman), but check them out and see what works for you.</p>

<p>I'm trying to avoid re-creating this gradient again from scratch since all I really want to do is change the color and orientation slightly. It's not the most complicated of gradients, but starting over would lead to me spending an hour tweaking things to get them just right again. I've got other things to work so, in the meantime, I thought I'd see if any of you guys knew what to do.</p>
","<p>In Photoshop, the only way to retrieve gradient color data is to...</p>

<p>C) Apply the gradient as a Gradient Overlay Layer Style.</p>

<p>D) Use a gradient fill layer via <code>Layer &gt; New Fill Layer &gt; Gradient</code></p>

<p>If you did none of these, then the specific gradient data is not stored anywhere directly. You can use the eyedropper tool to sample colors at the end of the gradient and rebuild it, but you can't directly access the gradient data.</p>

"When should I use SVG or SVGZ for my web graphics?","32261","","<p>From my understanding,</p>

<p>The SVGZ is a compressed file type of an SVG. I love using SVG images and have had a lot of experience with them. </p>

<p>All of the times I used them I have never had a graphic that went over a few hundred kilobytes.</p>

<p>I use SVG for responsive graphics while making responsive websites. I also use them since my favorite design style is vector based graphics. My strongest design strength is illustrator, especially when it comes to graphic design.</p>

<p>The other reason I would use an SVG graphic is due to the ease of animating certain elements of the graphic, like arms, legs, etc.</p>

<p>Especially background elements, like a city to span across the entire page while I animate some flickering of lights and so on.</p>

<p>If the file is compressed, would it lose the SVG code so I couldn't animate it?</p>

<p>Is there any reason I should use an SVGZ over just an SVG?</p>

","<p>As the name implies, a .afm file contains the metrics (kerning, letterspacing, etc.) information for a font. It is a Postscript file, but is not the font itself, which would have the same name with a .pfa extension. You would need both in order to run a conversion utility. The exact nature of the files and the conversion utility you would need (.pfa and .afm are generally Linux files, ascii Postscript versions of what would be compiled to .pfb and .pfm binary on Windows, for example) depends on which platform you're on.</p>

"Font (anti)aliasing in Photoshop","32163","","<p>I'm using Photoshop for designing websites and whenever I compare a photoshop design with the live browser preview the fonts appear to be rendered differently.</p>

<p>Is there a method I can achieve the same kind of font rendering in Photoshop like the one that Windows uses with cleartype?</p>

<p>If not, are there any fonts out there that look better than Arial when anti-aliasing is off ?</p>
","<p>There are two reasons ClearType text is so crisp.</p>

<ol>
<li>it uses <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering"">subpixel rendering</a>. I don't think Photoshop supports that.</li>
<li>it uses aggressive hinting to fit lines into the pixel grid</li>
</ol>

<p>You can type your text in Notepad, screenshot it with some nice convenient tool, and paste it into Photoshop with blending mode Multiply (because it's black text on a white background). But that's not convenient. <strong>Edit:</strong> it may also be almost impossible to do with any foreground color other than black.</p>

<p><a href=""http://thomasmaier.me/blog/2010/03/17/yes-add-subpixel-hinting-to-your-photoshop-text-layers/"">This guy</a> has described a method to do manual subpixel rendering, and to my eyes, it does improve the font sharpness, making it nearer to ClearType. But it still uses Photoshop's hinting, so it's not as sharp as ClearType.</p>

<p>Do you really need ClearType-style rendering in Photoshop? If you export any graphics containing text for use in your web design, they shouldn't contain subpixel rendering because it's not appropriate for some displays (CRT, rotated phone). And if you're not exporting text but just looking at it, Photoshop's rendering seems OK.</p>

<p>Following this process exports a PDF file from InDesign which is pretty good for printing. However, the problem is that I have images in my InDesign file which are only 72 DPI, and with the High Quality Print PDF preset all the images are converted to 300 PPI. This makes them look pixelated.</p>

<p><strong>First Question</strong>: What is the diffrence between PPI and DPI?</p>

<p><strong>Second Question</strong>: If I save/export as a custom PDF profile with the image settings set to 72 PPI is there any chance I'll get a <strong>high quality</strong> A4 print?</p>

<p><strong>Third Question</strong>: How can I get a high quality A4 print with only 72 DPI images?</p>
","<p>In general, Pixels per Inch is for screen resolutions and Dots per Inch is for print resolutions, as lawndartcatcher says, but when you're dealing with an image that will be printed at a specific size, it is correct to use Pixels per Inch (because the image is in pixels) regardless of the number of <em>dots</em> per inch that the printer will lay down on the paper. (A 72 ppi image will print at 72 pixels per inch, whether the printer resolution is 300, 600 or 2800 dots per inch.)</p>

<p>To understand how this works in relation to a layout program like InDesign, you have to really grasp the difference between an image <em>resolution</em> in pixels, and an image <em>size on paper</em> in centimeters or inches. It is <em>output size</em> in inches that determines the pixels-per-inch. Image metadata contains a ppi number so you can work out how big it will be when printed at that resolution. It has almost no other use.</p>

<p>F8 in InDesign toggles the Info panel, and you should work with it extensively when you have images in a document.</p>

<p>The Info panel shows two resolution numbers for an image, both in ppi for the reason I gave in the first paragraph. The first number, called ""Actual ppi,"" is the ppi recorded in the metadata for that image. This is commonly 72 ppi for images you'll find on the web and from small digicams, 240 ppi for images from DSLR cameras, etc.. This is an ""information only"" number, and of no practical importance in a layout. I really wish they had left it out, because it serves no useful purpose and (as in this case) simply confuses the issue.</p>

<p>The number you have to pay attention to is the ""Effective ppi,"" because that directly affects print quality. An image that is 600x600 pixels, placed as a 2 inch square image, has an <em>effective</em> resolution of 300 ppi, regardless of what the metadata says. That same image placed as a 6-inch square has an effective resolution of 100 ppi. A 300 ppi (in metadata) image may be only 50 ppi when placed in the document at the print size specified. Similarly, a 72 ppi image may be 450 ppi at the size it has been given in the document. You get the idea.</p>

<p>If the effective resolution of an image on export is less than the target ppi (usually 300, but not always), InDesign <em>will not upsample</em> the image. If it's 72 ppi effective in the InDesign document, it will be 72 ppi effective in the PDF. And yes, that will look pretty bad when it's printed.</p>

<p>If you have an 4 inch x 4 inch (10cm x 10cm) image that says it is 72 ppi (i.e., it's 288 pixels wide and tall), you can place that in InDesign at 1 inch (2.5 cm) square and you'll be fine. But you can't make it 10 cm square and expect it to look good in print.</p>

"Photoshop: How to save only the masked area of an edited photograph?","31122","","<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>If you have a PSD file that consists of one main mask (masking all other layers), isn't there an easy way to save just the masked area as an image?</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>So I have a photograph I've edited in photoshop, mostly cropping things and moving them around.  As a final step, I created a rectangular mask to crop everything (while keeping all of my layers and edit history in tact).  The end result is a picture of my wife standing in a different place and cropped smaller.  That is, it looks like there's a photo in the middle of the canvas with about 2-3 inches of white all around it.</p>

<p>Now I want to save this picture in the simplest way possible.  What I ended up doing was:</p>

<ol>
<li>Save PSD file</li>
<li>Flatten image</li>
<li>Magic Wand > tolerance 1 > select all white area</li>
<li>Select Inverse</li>
<li>Cut</li>
<li>New File</li>
<li>Paste</li>
<li>Save For Web as JPG</li>
<li>Close everything, without saving</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>When I choose, save for web, it saves the entire canvas. I don't want the extra white ""padding"" all around and I don't want to manually crop it again (the mask has already done that for me).  Surely there's an easy way to save only the area within the rectangular mask.  Any and all suggestions welcome...  </p>
","<p>You can also select the mask (open the Layers palette, hold down the apple key, and click on the mask icon next to the layer) and then select Image&rarr;Crop. </p>

<p>SAVE FOR WEB (NOT JUST SAVE) or Save As if you want to keep a copy of the original. </p>

"Cheap Cintiq alternatives - tablet PCs with digitizers?","31082","","<p>Most of us would love to work with a cintiq-like tablet, but very few could afford one, especially if they are not professionals.</p>

<p>There have been questions about this, ideas to try to use an android tablet for such purposes, but everyone used the phrase ""just buy a wacom bamboo tablet"" like a mantra.</p>

<p>I didnt give up on my pursuit and found solutions that fit in a 150-200$ price range. Those would be PC laptops with integrated digitizers. Ill be buying a second hand Fujitsu LifeBook T4220 for around 190$. There are others, like the IBM X61, some toshibas, HPs etc...</p>

<p>So my question is: how come nobody advised buying such PCs? Are they little known about, or do they have some big disadvantages I dont know about? </p>

<p>I mean - its wacom technology. Sure, in the soon-to-be-mine Fujitsu model there are 255 pressure levels, not 2k like in intuos devices, but I am not a pro and I probably couldnt feel any difference between the two. These computers have reasonable specs, nice processors and should do fine. One might say that they have integrated graphics card, but is that such a big deal? Photoshop should run fine, at least for typical digital painting tools, and there is always GIMP (pretty lightweight compared to PS) or using the entire laptop as a remote desktop display for a stationary PC with decent hardware. All this in a price range below one fifth of the smallest cintiq!</p>

<p>Why wouldnt an amateur use such laptops for drawing, designing, digital painting etc? Is there something i need to know before making the purchase?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> a bit more info about what im looking for: 
Im mostly interested in sketching, drawing and digital painting with the tablet. I dont like the pen-picture detachment when using regular graphic tablets, also i dont like it how i cant turn them to get comfortable drawing angles, and thats why im seeking a cintiq-like solution. I tried using some android tablets, but the lack of ANY pressure sensitivity makes painting very cumbersome - maiking a smooth colour transition is a lot of work, while with pressure sensitivity it would only take a few swipes. I dont really do any photo work. Also, Im just an amateur and do drawing/painting as a hobby, not a job.</p>

<p>So, any reasons why a PC tablet like the one I mentioned wouldnt satisfy my needs?</p>
","<p>lets start:</p>

<p>I'm an amateur artist as well, but managed somehow to get a lot of equipment xD. I haven't tried those tablet pc's but I have a Cintiq UX21, Intuos3 A4, and a few bamboo's.</p>

<p>By my experience I would tell you to get a intuos, 3 or 4.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<ol>
<li>Those laptops as suggested on the comments won't run the creative suite or corel painter properly, even if you are doing it
as a hobby, there will come a day (trust me) when you will want to
paint at a better resolution to print your work, or a big
illustration to add nice details, then that laptop/tablet will cry.</li>
<li>The pressure difference IS noticeable, as you get better painting,
you will notice it more. I just can't work with the bamboos, the
pressure, and more importantly the precision when drawing/painting
sucks. I gave away most of the bamboos.</li>
<li>A scratched laptop is useless, or at least uncomfortable. Oh yes, it will end up scratched, don't come to me with gorilla glass or whatever-glasses, they all end up scratched, just google about people complaining their cintiqs being scratched, just use the thing long enough and it will be. A scratched normal tablet looks uglier(or cooler, like scars), but you still can use them well.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The Cintiq Illusion</strong>:</p>

<p>A Cintiq is a nice toy indeed (and more the 21 inches version), when I first had it on my hands I was almost crying of happyness. But on the long run it turned out not being so cool:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's not such a big difference, when you get used to the intuos,
using the cintiq is mostly the same, maybe you can get adapted
quicker to the cintiq, but it's the same in the end.</li>
<li>The only difference is that with the cintiq sometimes you cover a
great part of the image with your arm/hand, and have to lean back and take your hand off the screen to see it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also it's more troublesome to actually rotate the screen than using software rotation, ie holding R in photoshop to rotate the canvas, where this takes us to the next points:</p>

<ul>
<li>The keyboard. Even if you are not a programmer, you will (or should)
end up using the keyboard for the hotkeys a lot, it just makes your
life easier/quicker. while using a cintiq, you will have to forget
about the keyboard, it's too big, and the keyboard will be far away,
despite they have shortcut keys and stuff, they are just not enough,
trust me, they are not.</li>
<li>It's so big... It takes too much space on my desk, and I have a big one. A lot of times I just keep it stored in a closet or something, because it's an expensive toy and at least I, don't want to use it for gaming/whatching movies/surfing web. You will be wanting to make it last xD.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I end up using the Intuos a lot more, it's more maneuverable, and more comfortable to work with. It has special areas you can set up so a small square is equivalent to the whole screen and stuffs like that. </p>

<p>In the end even an A4 is very big, a lot of people having A4 tablets end up using just a portion of it, you can notice because only that part looks more ""scratched"". Also it won't fit on my backpack, sometimes I wanted to take it to a friend home to paint together or teach them stuff or just going to a LAN party with design contests. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>Go for an intuos3 A5, it's big enough, and small enough, affordable (250$ or so) and with the same precision and pressure sensitivity as the expensive ones. If you feel rich grab the intuos4, it's cooler xD.</p>

<p>I know some professional artists (spanish) that works with the bamboo, but I think the price difference just don't worth it.</p>

"Charging an Intellectual Property transfer fee for design work","30963","","<p>So, you've finished a design job (eg. a logo design) and the client asks for your IP surrounding the logo, eg copyright, original artwork files, notes, sketches, all of that stuff that went into creating the finished piece. Do you charge for this transfer? If so, how do you calculate your fee (eg. XX% of the value of the project, or perhaps a flat fee of $XXX)</p>

<p>Do you also hand over just the work that went into creating that finished concept, or do you hand over all of your alternate concept designs and ideas as well?</p>

<p>Edit: IP = Intellectual Property as defined here: <a href=""http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/understanding-intellectual-property/ip-for-designers/"">http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/understanding-intellectual-property/ip-for-designers/</a></p>
","<p>Any contract should clearly state what the client is purchasing rights to, what those rights are, and what the designer is retaining.</p>

<p>I never sell rights to sketches, preliminaries, notes, etc. They are always retained and the client is purchasing the final image/design/product only. </p>

<p>I will sell the rights to the final product if it's negotiated - this refers more to native files for layout such as Indesign files, layered Photoshop files, or Illustrator files. Logo projects are always assumed to include delivery of native files (vector artwork) and full rights to those files. </p>

<p>Fees vary based on project size and complexity, but a general rule of thumb I use is three times the fee for the project. (e.g. Design costs $500, Native files cost an additional $1500, total for design and native files $2000).</p>

<p>Additionally, if there are third party licenses which I own and can not transfer, those costs are added to any fees for deliverable native files. For example, I use a specific font in a print piece. Legally I can't simply give anyone the font. So, I factor in the purchase of an additional license which I will purchase for the client and include (with the associated license text) with any native files. </p>

<p>Final formula:<br />
<strong>Design fee + (design fee x 3) + (third party licenses) = Fee for native files</strong></p>

<p>I never sell rights to anything which is unrelated to the final design. Ever. </p>

<p>I would honestly be a tad wary of a client expressing interest in literally <strong>all</strong> IP - regardless of how, or if, it is related to the final design. This is especially true where logotypes are concerned or if the topic is broached AFTER a project is complete. If the contract doesn't expressly state it, we haven't discussed it before work began and pricing was based on traditional retainment of such rights. Generally such requests are made because someone, somewhere said something like... ""Remember that first design with the boat, the one we didn't use. If we get that file we could use it for our other branch."" I'm generalizing, but it happens often that a client sees a way they think will save them money. Whether maliciously or not, it is never favorable to supply multiple ideas/designs if they weren't initially discussed when a contract was signed.</p>

<p>Preliminary sketched art is a real commodity and can often be used to inspire work later for completely unrelated projects. Not directly, but reflecting on how a very early problem was solved via a sketch, which was not the direction the project went, could inspire something new and unrelated. (ooo.. what was that sketch of a dog I started to use for Client XXX and they hated.... that would work perfect here.) By selling all those preliminaries you've sold all possibility of anything even remotely associated with them. The price for such IP would be very, very, steep. But as I've posted, for me, they aren't even priced. I simply say no and point to the contract.</p>

<p>So essentially...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you dont' use a contract. START. NOW.</p></li>
<li><p>Final deliverables - PDF, Vector art, HTML/CSS/PHP/MYSQL - that's the design fee.</p></li>
<li><p>Native files for final design (Indesign, Layered Photoshop/Illustrator files), yes I will sell them for a price. They are never free.</p></li>
<li><p>Preliminary sketches, notes, rough drafts, which were not used in the final design - never for sale.</p></li>
<li><p>Cost of any third party licenses are added to any fees for native files and any related license text is included with deliverables. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, clients will and do complain. They are too accustomed to novice designers handing over absolutely anything and everything for nothing. I've had favorable discussions with clients once I explain how any such materials are commodities and it's merely fair practice to charge for relinquishing the rights to such commodities. After all unlimited future use of any and all art I create is one heck of a package. </p>

<p>What I've done in the past is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create my tables in LibreOffice Writer, applying formatting such as row borders, cell spacing, and so on.</li>
<li>Copy the table, open up LibreOffice Draw, and paste the table as a ""LibreOffice Text Document"" using ""Paste Special"".</li>
<li>Select just the table.</li>
<li>Go to File > Export and export in your preferred vector format (in the past, I've used EPS without any problems). Be sure to check the box that says ""selection"" otherwise Draw will export the whole page.</li>
</ul>

<p>A similar approach can be taken with charts.</p>

<p>If you prefer to stick with Excel, at least for the charts part, you can install the ""Save as PDF"" office add-on and select your charts as PDF files which you can open just fine in Inkscape.</p>

<p>I am sharing what I learned about snapping to grids in my answer below.</p>

<ol>
<li>View Page Grid</li>
<li>Document Properties</li>
<li>Snap Controls Bar</li>
<li>Preferences</li>
</ol>

<p>We will look at each of these. The images may look different for different operating systems, but the general settings should still be the same.</p>

<h1>View Page Grid</h1>

<p>This does not directly affect snapping to the grid, but if you can't see the grid at all, then make sure that the menu item <strong>View > Page Grid</strong> is checked. The shortcut key is <kbd>#</kbd>.</p>

<h1>Document Properties</h1>

<p>To get here, go to <strong>File > Document Properties...</strong> and click on the <strong>Grid</strong> tab. You can create a new grid by pressing <strong>New</strong> if necessary. Make sure that it is enabled and that you are snapping to visible grid lines for now.</p>

"Illustrator: View -> Actual Size smaller than life size","30418","","<p>I'm using Illustrator CS6 on OS X.  When choosing View -> Actual Size, the displayed elements are smaller on the screen than their actual size, say in centimetres.  How can I ""calibrate"" Illustrator to my screen's resolution (dpi) so that it can display objects at life size when using 100% zoom?</p>

<p>(Acrobat does have a DPI setting in its preferences, and I assume Illustrator must have it too.  But I cannot find it.)</p>

<p>Edit: To clarify, if I put a ruler next to the screen, and also turn on the ruler in the document, I want them to match up when selecting View -> Actual Size.</p>
","<p>Illustrator doesn't have a setting to adjust the Actual Size view of print documents to a screen's pixel density. </p>

<p>To 'calibrate', I helped myself by holding an A4 sheet against an A4 document on the screen and zooming until they matched. Then I – <em>ahem</em> – wrote down the zoom percentage on a super-sticky Post-it, which now adorns the frame of my screen… (The percentage works for InDesign and Office applications as well.) </p>

<p>Shortcut key workaround: Illustrator can't have a shortcut key for a user-defined zoom percentage, nor can you record an Action macro for that (which would have allowed for a shortcut key). A workaround would be to create a custom view of your document at that zoom percentage <code>View &gt; New View…</code> and then <code>Save</code> the document. This custom view is then saved within the document file and appears in the View menu. Illustrator allows to set shortcut keys to change to custom views of documents. Use <code>Edit &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts…</code> and in the drop-down menu choose <code>Menu Commands &gt; View &gt; Custom View 1</code>.</p>

"What's the width to mockup websites for desktop and mobile now?","30357","","<p>Recently, I was practicing web design beyond code things. But after I opened Sketch and just started to make a rectangle of my site, I got stuck. </p>

<p><strong>What <code>width</code> should I use?</strong></p>

<p>I'd search for the resolution stats <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_display.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">at this site</a>. And for my own taste, I chose 1440px for width. (Due to the characteristic of 1440, it's easier to divided 2, 3 or 6. ) However, now I have to choose the width for <em>mobile</em> (and also, if possible, for <em>tablet</em>). Although there's an article about <a href=""https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/"" rel=""nofollow"">media query on CSS Tricks</a>, I have no idea how many px should I use.</p>

<p>Is there any way to figure out this?</p>
","<p>The short answer is: there is none.</p>

<p>If you want your website to be prepared for use in the wide, wild world, you should keep <em>any</em> screen width between, say, 480 and 4800px in mind. Modern designers for <em>responsive</em> webdesigns (designs that adapt to the width of the viewport) work with <strong>ranges of widths</strong>. Each range has its own quirks to adapt the website to the width.</p>

<h2>The borders of these ranges aren't set in stone.</h2>

<p>In my case, they usually depend on the particular design. I start out with the smallest screen, design that, and stretch the viewport until the layout becomes ugly or unwieldy. Then I set a boundary and start designing for the next width range.</p>

<h2>Pixel size is no longer an indication of device type.</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that a screen size in pixels does not necessarily give an indication of the type of device used: there's small phones on the market these days that use Retina screens, effectively doubling their pixel widths without changing the physical dimensions (much). Therefore, you could have a 960px phone as opposed to a 800px monitor. (Admittedly, those latter ones are rare these days.)</p>

<p>What this panel does is allow you to alter Illustrator's default X/Y graph and constrain angle to anything.

Black papers (if they even exist) are nowhere to be seen in any stores I've been] would work.

How about if I print the turquoise text on the black paper, too? If not, can you suggest any alternative? I thought of printing this entire design but I decide not to because the bulletin is quite big (26 and 1/2 in X 44 in). It will cost us a lot of ink, I believe (or not?).

It looks like you want 1) free, 2) multiple weights, and 3) extended character sets. That's a difficult combination. With a lot of these, a combination of 1 and 3 is possible, that usually means you have to pay to get 2. If 1 and 2 are combined, it's often at the expense of 3.</p>

The link I provided links you to all of their fonts tagged as ""humanist"". Out of these, I think Aller gives you the right general proportion and a variety of styles, though the letterforms for plenty of these are going to be different, and there are no Cyrillic characters that I could see. Droid Sans is a humanist font that has a lot of glyphs in it, but won't look and feel exactly like Trebuchet. Same story with Pigiarniq and Source Sans.</p>

<p>Another poster mentioned Google Web Fonts, so I won't repeat the exercise there. </p>

<p>Just for kicks, I ran Trebuchet's glyphs through <a href=""http://www.identifont.com/find?font=trebuchet"">Identifont</a> to see what it thought was similar.

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JopNU.jpg"" alt=""Isometric vector drawing example""></p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Please do not confuse Isometric drawing with 1,2 or 3 Point Perspective Drawing.</p>

<p><strong>ISOMETRIC DRAWING:</strong>  </p>

<p>[the isometric system is just a convention/invention, useful for a lot of stuff, not to reproduce what the eyes sees in reality but really just a convention useful for measurements and other stuff]</p>

<p>iso(equal)  metric(measurment)</p>

<p>In an <strong>isometric drawing</strong>, all the edges of a cube <strong>would be parallel</strong> in sets of four. <em>(2 parallel lines means that the lines will never meet each other no mater how long you draw them)</em> </p>

<p><strong>PERSPECTIVE DRAWING:</strong>  </p>

<p>[The perspective drawing conventions (1 point, 2 point, 3 point..and some other) are still conventions but they do try to imitate and be as close as possible to what the eye sees in reality(3D), but as it is on 2D(paper/screen) it is never like reality actually is.]</p>

<p><em>[Another thing that some may argue is that do to the fact that we have two eyes</em>(just some optical devices)* and the image actually unites(is created) trough some magic that happens in the brain, makes another point why none of these conventions truly accurately resemble reality either... but this is for the Philosophy SE :P]*</p>

<p>In the <strong>perspective drawing</strong>, the edges would taper towards <strong>one or more vanishing points.</strong></p>

<p>With the <strong>Perspective Grid in Illustrator CS 5</strong> there are 3 options :</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> point perspective, <strong>2</strong> point perspective, and <strong>3</strong> point perspective. </p>

<p><strong><em>After processing all of the information from above(info from the internet...might be wrong, feel free to deliberate) I make the simple assumption that it is not possible to achieve an isometric view of multiple objects on a canvas(like in the example above, twigital.co.uk (thanks to George for its explanation of how it was done in his answer) with a perspective grid, that is with 1 point perspective: lines will meet in one point on the horizon, 2 points: lines will meet at 2 points on the horizon, 3 point... you get the idea...</em></strong> </p>

<p>Please help me, how to rotate smoothly (without any jerk)  via frame by frame animation in short time/ short method.</p>
","<p><strong>To find the right tool panel in Photoshop:</strong>
For <em>Photoshop CS5</em> and lower, access the animation window by opening “Window” + “Animation.” Likewise, click “Window” + “Timeline” in <em>Photoshop CS6</em> and Photoshop CC to access the Timeline window. For <em>Photoshop CC</em>, click the drop-down menu in the middle of the Timeline window and select “Create Frame Animation.”</p>

<p><strong>Then</strong>, one method would be having each frame of your animation in one separate layer. It means that, in your case, you should have the same object in all layers, but with different angle rotations applied to each of them.</p>

<p><strong>To duplicate a layer:</strong>
Right click on the layer to see context menu, click on ""Duplicate Layer"".</p>

<p><strong>To rotate an object:</strong>
With Photoshop you can select any object (you should select the right layer where the object is), right click on the object to see context menu, select ""Transform"" and you will be able to rotate the object manually (by dragging one corner) or writing the exact angle in the angle input on the top bar (it appears after you click on ""transform"").</p>

<p>In the Photoshop’s sequencing tool panel we activated before, click on small, right-facing arrow in the upper-right hand corner, and then select “Make Frames From Layers.”</p>

<p><strong>The smoothness</strong> of the animation depends on how much frames you have and how fast do you show them. If you use 24 fps (Frames Per Second) or a higher value, no jumps between frames will be noticed by the viewer.</p>

"GIMP: 'move layer' stops working","29003","","<p>I'm having intermittent problems with GIMP, where the 'move layer' command suddenly stops working. The mouse pointer changes to the one below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uqY5M.jpg"" alt=""cursor""></p>

<p>When I make an explicit selection, e.g. <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> on a layer, then MOVE works again. But normally I can move whole layers without any selection (e.g. Select/None or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>). This stops working out of the blue and I have no idea why.</p>

<p>It behaves very much like when you press ALT in MOVE mode. Pressing <kbd>ALT</kbd> with a selection allows you to move the selection around, as opposed to move the layer. Pressing <kbd>ALT</kbd> without a selection gives the same cursor as above, which is perfectly normal. Somehow when my problem starts, it looks as if ALT-mode is stuck and I can't get out. </p>

<p>Note I am a rather seasoned GIMP user and I use keyboard commands a lot, perhaps I switch too fast between commands, but I haven't been able to consistently reproduce it yet. Happens once every few hours or so. Only solution I found so far is to quit GIMP and restart. Other functions continue to work, I can still save etc (luckily). </p>

<p>I'm using GIMP 2.8.2 on Windows.</p>

<p>The <kbd>Alt</kbd> key toggles to the 'Move selection' mode (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> does the same for 'Move path'), and is supposed to switch back to 'Move layer' once you let go of the key. If you manage to steal the input focus from the canvas while in this mode, then the tool may remain in 'Move selection' mode. </p>

<p>So to answer the question and solve the problem, you should set this back to 'Move layer'.</p>

"What is the relationship between hue, saturation and value?","28675","","<p>I see people adding color on top of a gray-scale drawing and their colors look great, but when I do myself, the colors look terrible (dirty, not the color I seem to pick from the color wheel). People tell me I need to learn about tone and value and the color wheel. I've gathered from this site and others that tone is really hue, which is really what we call color. But I'm not sure how saturation and value work into this.</p>

<p>What is the relationship between hue, saturation, and value and how does this factor in to coloring a gray-scale picture?</p>

<p>And even a good explanation of the color wheel would probably help. Thanks.</p>
","<p><strong>Value is essentially the darkness of the pigment</strong>. Less value equates to a darker color. If you take a color and remove all hue, you are left with value - basically greyscale. Brightness is another term used for value. Often brightness is a bit easier to remember since more value means a ""brighter"" color.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Ou7U.png"" alt=""value""> </p>

<p>Basic Value scale</p>

<p><strong>Saturation is essentially the depth of the pigment</strong>. More saturation means more pigment. Less saturation equates to a tint or lighter shade of the color. Luminosity is another term used for Saturation.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sBffj.png"" alt=""saturation""> </p>

<p>Basic saturation scale. (based on a red hue)</p>

<p><strong>Hue is the base pigment.</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VQiAV.png"" alt=""Hue""> </p>

<p>Basic Hue scale</p>

<p><strong>""Color""</strong> would actually be the combination of all three of the above.</p>

<p>For example if you have a Hue which is red.</p>

<ul>
<li>Decreasing Saturation/Luminosity will cause the red to start moving into the pink areas. <strong>Hue minus Saturation = lighter color</strong></li>
<li>Decreasing Value/Brightness will cause the red to move into the maroon or burgundy range. <strong>Hue minus Value = darker color</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Anther way to think of the relationship is to consider removing Saturation as adding white to the hue. And removing Value as adding black to the hue.</p>

<p>If you are coloring a greyscale image, you would use the greyscale to designate the value of the colors. To that end you would never adjust the value of the color you are using allowing the underlying greyscale tones to create darkness. You would choose a hue and a saturation, then paint over an greyscale area, setting the blending mode to Multiply or Darken to allow what you are painting to interact with the underlying image. Because you are using a base greyscale image, you would never want to create an area which is lighter than the image. The only variation would be how much color is applied, thus hue for the pigment value and saturation for the amount of pigment.</p>

","<p>85cm x 200cm is 33.4646in x 78.7402in. To set it at 700ppi (pixels per inch) you need to multiply that by 700, so your document should be: 23425px x 55118px, independent of whatever ppi you choose in Illustrator.</p>

<p>That is a LOT of pixels, particularly because illustrator outputs a vector file that is 100% scalable (unless you are using raster images within). 700ppi is overkill for a sign of that dimensions imho, you could easily get away with 150ppi, or even 70ppi. </p>

<p>What fonts are great for dense information displays? I've played with usual suspects like Helvetica, Helvetica Neue and Tahoma, but are there others that would add a splash of unique feeling, but still would be an excellent choice for displaying tabular data? </p>
","<p>Typically with lots of data you're looking to do two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cram lots of data into a limited space, and/or</li>
<li>Make it readable.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you get both, that's ideal.</p>

<p>When it comes to the ""safe"" web fonts, I think that <strong>Tahoma</strong> tends to be a little more vertical and thus can get more data squished in. Typically <strong>Verdana</strong> and <strong>Georgia</strong> are regarded as the most well-designed of the six or so; Verdana in particular is very readable but takes up a lot of width to do so.</p>

<p>Depending on who's using the site, you should definitely take a look at <strong>Calibri</strong>. Microsoft's ClearType fonts are well-designed, fairly well-regarded, and not ubiquitous enough to be annoying yet. Calibri is modern, made for the screen, and is pretty narrow - a good compromise. If you need something monospace, look at <strong>Consolas</strong> over Courier New. ClearType should be pretty well saturated by now; anyone with Vista or a version of Office that's 2007 or later (2008 for Mac) will have them. And apparently you can get them freely as well; <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibri#Availability"">Wikipedia has more on this</a>.</p>

<p>If you're looking to buy, check out <a href=""https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/info-text""><strong>FF Info</strong></a>. Haven't used it but it has a good pedigree and seems to be well-built for lots of data.</p>

<p>And, as Joonas commented, fonts aren't the only way to make something readable. Watch your line-spacing and cell padding, stuff like that. It can make a world of difference.</p>

<p>Is there a way to counteract this? Other fonts look great, but Helvetica (Neue or otherwise) always looks horrible, as if subpixel rendering is off.</p>
","<p>First, two common causes of wonky, misaligned, disjointed text where characters don't line up or size correctly relative to each other that <strong>are not the causes in this specific case</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mis-alignment to the pixel grid. More recent versions of Illustrator have an 'Align to pixel grid' option, but it affects everything and has consequences like preventing stroke widths of less than 1pt. You can pixel-align individual objects without other consequences with the <a href=""http://www.wundes.com/JS4AI/pixelAlign.jsx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pixel Align script (download)</a> from <a href=""http://www.wundes.com/JS4AI/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wundes</a>.</li>
<li>Double check that the text isn't very slightly rotated, as this will make the hinting go nuts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This particular case</strong>, however, is a combination of the particular type of anti-aliasing and hinting. In Illustrator CS5+ there are <a href=""http://help.adobe.com/en_US/illustrator/cs/using/WSf01dbd23413dda0e1e23acb6124476da654-7fea.html#WSf01dbd23413dda0e1e23acb6124476da654-7fe6"" rel=""noreferrer"">options for how type is anti-aliased</a> similar to those in Photoshop, so we can compare the combinations (top rows are 10 Helvetica Neue Light, bottom rows 14pt), of which CS4 appears to only use 'Sharp':</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>With hinting</strong> (i.e. onscreen preview, or, in CS5+, save for web with ""Type Optimised"" selected)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ww9jP.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Without hinting</strong> (i.e.'Art optimised' save for web, or less than CS4 save for web ):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OTl4C.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<hr>

<p>You can see the ugly distortion, lowering flat-topped letters and raising round-topped letters, appearing <strong>when hinting is on and when anti-aliasing is 'Sharp'</strong>, regardless of whether the object itself is aligned to the pixel grid - because the hinting (adjusting details to fit the pixel grid) is happening at the level of each detail of each character, not the text object itself. </p>

<p><em>(I can't find anything spelling out exactly what each anti-aliasing method does - it looks like 'Crisp' and 'Strong' may actually be turning Illustrator's hinting off, or at least, dampening it down)</em></p>

<p>Note also how aligning the text object to the pixel grid <strong>does</strong> make a small difference when hinting is off (e.g. the ""il"" in Evil in the Sharp case). But there's a certain amount of randomness to this. Sometimes it'll be an improvement, sometimes it might make the text rendering worse, sometimes it'll make no difference.</p>

<p>On CS6, you have control over these things. On CS4 for in-image text for web output, the workaround I'd recommend is to copy screenshots of the on-screen preview at 100% to Photoshop when you do want hinting, and using Save For Web plus the <a href=""http://www.wundes.com/JS4AI/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pixel Align script</a> when you don't want hinting, and where appropriate combine the two images in Photoshop, overlaying them and erasing areas of one where you want the rendering of the other. Or, apply the text in Photoshop and make use of its anti-aliasing controls. </p>

<p>Hinted text is usually better for readability, but in some cases like these, it does go badly wrong...</p>

","<p>This background looks like it was created with the Lens Blur filter in Photoshop, with a high radius and with specular highlights set to 0. Shape Blur could also get this effect, using an elliptical solid shape. It doesn't look like in-camera blur, and it certainly isn't gaussian blur.</p>

<p>Either way, it's very important to add noise after the blurring, which wipes out the noise, so the background looks like it belonged to the foreground.

<p>I wasn't sure though, so I had a look at the definition of design, by Google:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>de·sign</p>
  
  <p>noun</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>a plan or drawing produced to show the look and function or workings of a building, garment, or other object before it is built or
  made.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>synonyms:</strong> plan, blueprint, drawing, sketch, outline, map, plot, diagram, draft, representation, scheme, model</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>the art or action of conceiving of and producing a plan or drawing.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>synonyms:</strong> pattern, motif, device</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>purpose, planning, or intention that exists or is thought to exist behind an action, fact, or material object.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>synonyms:</strong> intention, aim, purpose, plan, intent, objective, object, goal, end, target</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Based on that definition, a designer could be the creator of many things. So in that way, it seems every artist might be a designer. </p>

<hr>

<p>So, are the two interchangeable? If not, <strong>what is the difference?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: Please support your answer via citation or definition so that your answer might be marked correct, rather than being a matter of opinion.</p>
","<p>There is no difference.</p>

<p><strong><em>Design is art, art is design.</em></strong></p>

<p>Any good artist is designing their work. Any good designer has an art to their work.</p>

<p>The artist ""designs"" the composition of any piece they create, be it a painting, sculpture, furniture, etc. There is design even in a child's drawing. They choose where the sun goes, where the dog is, where the grass stops, etc. That's all design within artwork.</p>

<p>The designer uses ""artistic"" choices to create appealing images. Colors, line weight, position, proximity, scale, motion, are all artistic choices made by a ""designer"". </p>

<p>If any possible difference does exist, it could possibly be argued that there is a responsibility difference. But that does not convey to any of the work specifically. Those who self-classify themselves as ""designers"" may perhaps be more time clock punchers while creating art. And those who self-classify as an ""artist"" may be slightly more free to create their designs when the mood strikes them.</p>

<p>I see this question as being similar to asking, ""Is that a dollar or a buck?"", ""A quid or a pound?"" Same thing.... just different terminology.</p>

<p>Referencing dictionary.com....</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Designer:</strong> a person who devises or executes designs, especially one who creates forms, structures, and patterns, as for works of art or machines.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Artist:</strong> </p>
  
  <p>1 a person who produces works in any of the arts that are primarily subject to aesthetic criteria.</p>
  
  <p><s>2.

  <p><s>4.

  <p>5.
  a person whose work exhibits exceptional skill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've crossed out obvious unrelated definitions, but the other three are pretty much the same as the definition of ""Designer""</p>

<p>In today's world, many may see a ""designer"" as a computer operator and sadly many designers may see themselves that way as well. However, design traditionally has required great craftsmanship, steady hands, a good artistic eye, etc. Design hasn't always been as simple as launching an application and them moving some objects around on a digital page. There is art in it, same as there is design in art. </p>

<p>I, personally, don't know any designers who would <em>not</em> also qualify themselves as artists. I do know several artists who would <em>not</em> qualify themselves as designers, but that's more a bigoted stance about money than the actual work. </p>

<p>Were the designers who created the wonderful music posters and album covers of the 60s and 70s not artists? </p>

<p>Any ideas? Here is a screenshot of the gradient in CMYK (left) and PMS (right); I want to make the zone where colors are transitioning smoother and have a printer-friendly file.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BhcOT.jpg"" alt=""CMYK gradient on left and PMS gradient on right""></p>
","<p>I had exactly the same problem you have, with almost the same colours: two blues. My solution was very similar to what Scott suggested in his answer but, (instead of overprinting one gradient on the other one) I ended up, by the suggestion of the printer, overprinting a gradient of 0 to 100% of the darker blue over an area of 100% of the lighter blue.</p>

<p>This is what I originally did (no overprint), and the result was awful:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9VCnS.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This is what I ended up doing</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ke6xI.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The are two reasons why I did it this way:</p>

<p><strong>Why Overprinting?</strong></p>

<p>As Scott suggested, the reason for overprinting is that when you have two gradients, one that goes from 0 to 100% an the other one going for 100 to 0%, there will be an area of lower density where both gradients meet, sort of mid way (depends on how fast your gradients change). There will be less ink in that area so the resulting colour in this area can look kind of washed out.</p>

<p><strong>Why one gradient over a 100% flat area?</strong></p>

<p>The reason for this was to avoid banding. When you have two gradient screens printed one on top of the other, if they are not perfectly registered, they can create an artifact that results in visible bands of colour instead of smooth gradients. I am sure you have seen this in low quality prints.</p>

<p>Word of caution: depending on the transparency of the darker ink, the colour at the bottom of the gradient, where both inks are at 100%, might not be exactly the darker PMS but a mix of both PMS inks. </p>

<p>This is how it ended up looking in different strata:</p>

<p>Cardboard:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MVPAm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Metal and Plastic (including labels). These strata are less absorbent so the overprint result is a bit bolder.</p>

go to the layer on which you want to apply texture/pattern.double click on it,a window will pop out saying layer style,<strong>in tutorial he also applied a color to make blue bit dark/another color, you can do this by applying a new colored layer just above the background layer(which contains the pattern) with less opacity</strong>.I have attached a SS to make you clear about how to apply pattern on layer in another way,don't get confused with it, it's very simple,hope this will help you....you can create your own pattern of anything,very detailed explanation given by <strong>Farray</strong> in another answer Please follow the same.</p>

"align text to curve but keep vertical orientation of letters","27203","","<p>In Photoshop, I am trying to align the baseline, x height, and cap height of some text to a curve, but I'd like to keep the vertical orientation of the letters strait up and down, and not let the curve influence their vertical orientation. Here is an example of the effect I'm trying to replicate:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FsrsW.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The part that says ""McKeesport and Youghiogheny"" has exactly the effect I'm trying to achieve. However when I use the ""type on path tool"" in photoshop, it changes the orientation of the letters so they are not strait up and down. If anyone know a way to do this please let me know! I would appreciate it. Thanks!</p>
","<p>Can't really do this in Photoshop. Photoshop's type on a path is as basic as it can be providing no options or refinements.</p>

<p>You may find for Photoshop, using the <strong>Warp</strong> options located at <code>Edit &gt; Transform&gt; Warp</code> will yield much better results than type on a path ever will.</p>

<p>Realize that these types of type manipulations on stocks and bods were all done by hand where the craftsman painstakingly made certain every stroke and counter was ""just so"" to get the effect he/she wanted. To create the same effect, and create it convincingly, you need to design with the same process in mind - carefully and manually.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Photoshop will only ever do a semi-satisfactory job at this type of stuff. Sure you can find a cool font and then use the warp transformations to get it to bend. But it will never look 100% correct due to the limitations of the transformations. Character stroke and counter weights can vary using transformations, note in your sample (and almost any sample you find which is similar) stroke weights do not vary unless there's an intentional reason behind it. </p>

<p>I would do this in <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong> and not even attempt it in Photoshop. Using <strong>Type on a Path</strong> in Illustrator you can set the options to <strong>Skew</strong> (<code>Type &gt; Type on a Path &gt; Type on a Path Options...</code>) which will maintain the verticals of the type and only alter the horizontals.</p>

<p>From that point you could create outlines and refine. Or simply copy/paste to Photoshop as a smart object if you must use Photoshop.</p>

<p>This is Illustrator with type on a path set to skew using a decorative font and an additional, offset, fill in the background to create the shadow.</p>

","<p>Vector graphics are graphics in which the image is represented in a mathematical fashion. What this allows one to do is to zoom in an image to infinite precision. They are ideal for situations in which an image might be used at various resolutions and dimensions.</p>

<p>Raster graphics are of a fixed dimension, somewhat like a grid pattern with specified values at each point. These graphics are the default for things from the real world (IE, scanned images, photographs, etc). They are ideal for use when an image will only be used once, and will never need to be enlarged, or if portions are coming from a photograph or other real-world image.</p>

"Gamma vs brightness - any difference?","27090","","<p>Is there any difference between these two terms, or they describe the same thing?</p>
","<p>They are two distinct terms - they aren't related.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Brightness</strong> is a general term for the intensity of light: how ""bright"" something is.  It's not a particularly technical term, but in context it could stand in for ""intensity"" of light, for example.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gamma</strong> is a more technical term for describing the mathematical formula for converting a stored luminance value (say, in an image file) to/from a raw light intensity value (say, in a monitor, scanner or camera).  A <strong>gamma curve</strong> is a graph of this function.  It's curved because the light intensity readings we store in image files is non-linearly related to the actual light intensity - in fact it's logarithmic.  The curve itself, or some coefficients to a function describing the curve, are contained within a <strong>colour profile</strong> (although a colour profile also contains other information).</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.argyllcms.com/doc/srgbplot.gif"">Here is the gamma curve for the sRGB colour profile</a> (it's shown here compared to the function <code>y = x^2.224</code>, a very close approximation).  sRGB is a very common colour profile - the profile used by default on the web and by the images output by default on most cameras and scanners.  Part of the sRGB colour profile is describing how raw light intensity values are converted to the values that are stored in the image file.  They follow this gamma curve.</p>

<p>The ""curves"" command in Photoshop or GIMP can be used to apply any arbitrary curve function to the luminance values in your image.  This is sometimes casually referred to as ""adjusting the gamma"", especially when the curve approximates a logarithmic <code>y = x^constant</code> function.  Some things like the settings in your TV might have a ""gamma"" adjustment, the purpose of which is simply to apply such a curve to the luminance values throughout the image.</p>

<p>Applying such an adjustment has the effect of lightening or darkening <strong>mid-tones</strong> while keeping the black point and the white point the same.  This is often described as having the effect of ""boosting shadows"" if the mid-tones are boosted.</p></li>

"Inkjet Printing on plastic","27082","","<p>I appreciate this question is borderline for this site (apologies), but I checked the FAQs and I think it is permitted.</p>

<p>I'm investigating ways to get single-colour text onto a thick plastic sheet, such as plastic business cards.</p>

<p>There seem to be a host of options: pad printing, screen printing, flat-bed printing (inkjet), thermal transfer printer <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/17780/how-can-i-print-vinyl-stickers-without-using-laminate?rq=1"">(as in this post)</a> and more that I cannot remember.</p>

<p>Of particular interest is inkjet methods because the printers are potentially so cheap. Flat-bed inkjet printers are often marketed as being able to print full-colour on iPhone covers, with a scratch- and water-resistant finish. However these machines seem to retail at $1k and up for A4 size. There also seem to be variations within this category, I believe that one is UV-curing of ink, and non-UV curing. I noticed that on a low end machine, some non-UV types  actually uses an Epson print head.</p>

<p>This leads me to believe that perhaps a regular consumer inkjet printer could be used to print on thin plastic, if filled with an ink that will not smudge on plastic. While cartridges might not be available for them, there are cheap continuous-ink systems where perhaps the ink suitable for paper could be replaced by ink for plastic.</p>

<p><strong>My question: does anyone know if there are inks that could be used on plastic with a regular inkjet printer?</strong></p>

<p>I know there are specialist OHP transparencies that can be used with inkjets but not only are the opacity and brilliance is poor, but it is also not resistant to smudging.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<blockquote>

  a regular inkjet printer?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please understand I am answering your question to a degree without getting completely into the technical side.  </p>

<p><strong>YES</strong>, there are inks on the market that would work on inkjet printers.  The most common used inkjet printer head is made by Epson.  Some people will reconfigure the head and motherboard based on their flow of output or ink used.  However, unless you have a commercial licence, or the like, you as an individual consumer will not be allowed to purchase these types of inks because they have to be disposed and managed in a certain way based on your city's codes.  </p>

<p>If you do have the correct paperwork your local supplier should have an option but be aware some machines have their own cartridges with ink pre-filled.  I would suggest going to <a href=""http://www.stsinks.com/eco-solvent-inks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">STS Inks</a> for a 3rd-party solution to inks.</p>

<p>Also, you must understand depending on the substrate you may need to do a pre-treatment because ""plastic"" is vague and different printers output different solvents.  </p>

<p>Now if your question is in regards to ""Can I buy a printer at Staples and print plastic business cards"" the answer is also yes but the quality will be very poor and I would not advise on it.  The only best solution I find with over the counter printers, such as the <a href=""http://www.heatpressnation.com/product_info.php?products_id=879&amp;gclid=COiV8Z2IlrcCFUWo4AodlCsArQ"" rel=""nofollow"">Epson Artisan 1430 Inkjet Printer</a> is with plate creation for screen printing.</p>

<p>If you're trying to print credit card like cards I would advise in thermal printing.  Any option you use I would note that it will be very costly to do quality work in-house and I would outsource what you need unless you plan to spend around 5 grand easily for quality equipment.  You can do it for less but I've seen poor quality work when it comes to printing cards.</p>

"Which is easier on the eyes: dark-on-light or light-on-dark?","27037","","<p>While working on my latest website, I started actually wondering if what I learned in grade school was true. I've been taught that programs like Word default to use a white background with black text because it's easier on the eyes than the old phosphorous displays which were always light-on-dark. However, I find more and more that it hurts much less for me to read light text on a dark background; my lenses feel like they're straining less, and irises can relax more due to the lower overall light level.</p>

<p>I've tested both on <a href=""http://BHStudios.org/about"">http://BHStudios.org/about</a> <del>and you can see the results of these tests by switching between ""Dark"" and ""Light"" themes under the ""Modern"" category in the dropdown in the sidebar. (This feature does not yet work in Internet Explorer)</del> (<strong>EDIT</strong> 2015-03-02 This feature has been modified such that all themes are dark-on-light)</p>

<p>So <strong>is it true that dark-on-light is easier to read?</strong> Have we just been told this to make us believe that these programs are advanced or something like that? Was the change to dark-on-light made more to simulate ink-on-paper moreso than for visual comfort?</p>
","<p>The science of readability is by no means new, and some of the best research comes from advertising works in the early 80s. This information is still relevant today.</p>

<p>First up is this quote from a paper titled “Improving the legibility of visual display units through contrast reversal”. In present time we think of contrast reversal meaning black-on-white, but remember this paper is from 1980 when VDUs (monitors) where green-on-black. This paper formed part of the research that drove the push for this to change to the screen formats we use today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, most studies have shown that dark characters on a light
  background are superior to light characters on a dark background (when
  the refresh rate is fairly high). For example, Bauer and Cavonius
  (1980) found that participants were 26% more accurate in reading text
  when they read it with dark characters on a light background.</p>
  
  <p>Reference: Bauer, D., &amp; Cavonius, C., R. (1980). Improving the
  legibility of visual display units through contrast reversal. In E.
  Grandjean, E. Vigliani (Eds.), Ergonomic Aspects of Visual Display
  Terminals (pp. 137-142). London: Taylor &amp; Francis</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, 26% improvement – but why?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People with astigmatism (aproximately 50% of the population) find it
  harder to read white text on black than black text on white. Part of
  this has to do with light levels: with a bright display (white
  background) the iris closes a bit more, decreasing the effect of the
  ""deformed"" lens; with a dark display (black background) the iris opens
  to receive more light and the deformation of the lens creates a much
  fuzzier focus at the eye.</p>
  
  <p>Jason Harrison – Post Doctoral Fellow, Imager Lab Manager – Sensory
  Perception and Interaction Research Group, University of British
  Columbia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ""fuzzing” effect that Jason refers to is known as halation.</p>

<p>It might feel strange pushing your primary design goals based on the vision impaired, but when 50% of the population of have this “impairment” it’s actually closer to being the norm than an impairment.</p>

<p>The web is rife with research on the topic, but I think these two quotes provide a succinct justification for why light text on a dark background is a bad idea.</p>

If it's shaded drawings, she should consider scanning either as greyscale (for black and white drawings) or full color (for color shaded drawings) and go from there.

"Photoshop CS6 Resize Rectangle with Rounded Corners","26567","","<p>This question is about Photoshop CS6. Hopefully the feature was added in this version. Before posting I looked up Google and <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/2125/how-can-i-resize-this-object-without-distorting-it"">this</a> and <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/5321/how-to-resize-vector-masks-without-changing-the-size-ratio-of-round-corners-of-i"">that</a> but didn't find an answer for CS6.</p>

<p>So the question is: Is there a feature within CS6 or a script that allows to resize a vector element with rounded corners <strong>without using the Direct Selection Tool (white arrow tool)</strong> and not changing the border radius? What would be great would be something like simply using the transform tool or something like a grid resize tool.</p>
","<p>The simple answer is: No.</p>

<p>I have asked Adobe to add the feature. If you'd like to see it, please vote here:</p>

<p>And now some good news. David Jensen has written a nice little script to help. It's not perfect (doesn't handle multiple shapes on the one layer), but it does the trick in many situtions.</p>

<p>The script allows you to transform shapes (distorting them), then you can reapply the corners. You will need to remember the radius you used though.</p>

"How yellow color is formed using RGB color model?","26552","","<p>It is said that red, blue and yellow are the 3 primary colors, which <em>can't</em> be formed by any other color.</p>

<p>Then how come we create yellow color in RGB color model?</p>

<p>Is there any theory or reason behind this?</p>
","<p>Yes the human color vision is based on 3 color sensors. If we simplify things to bare basics then it goes like this:</p>

<h3>RGB colors</h3>

<p>Our brain then processes this information and simply shows a mixture of red and green as yellow. Likewise red and blue as magenta*. Ok so that explains the RGB colors.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7NRLl.png"" alt=""Color sensors""></p>

<h3>The CMY colors</h3>

<p>Or what is usually taught out as Red, Blue &amp; Yellow is actually the inverse of RGB. See when light hits the paper you actually see the photons that the paper did not absorb. So Cyan is just a color that eats up all red colors, so absence of red. </p>

<p>This is called a subtractive color model. In reality there's no such thing, just that its easier to conceptually think when the color is reflective. All color that you see is from a additive color just the difference is where the light comes form the medium or another source.</p>

<p>In reality is much more complicated.</p>

"Can I reduce the file size of an SVG to be closer to its JPEG equivalent?","26317","","<p>I have an image that I’m using on a website. I would like to use an SVG so that it can be any size and still look crisp.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i5gf4mmppixw29g/AABsQ_7NQZJjP-UWQNMm-9a1a?dl=0"">This dropbox</a> contains the SVG file as well as the original Illustrator file.</li>
<li><p>This is a JPEG export:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OyFsp.jpg"" alt=""JPEG export""></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The SVG has a much larger file size than the JPG. Is it possible to optimise the SVG so that it has a similar file size? I might be able to lose some of the quality if that would help. I’ve tried <a href=""http://petercollingridge.appspot.com/svg_optimiser"">this SVG optimiser</a>, but it didn’t make much difference. </p>

<p>If I save the illustrator file as a JPG, trace the result and save it as an SVG, then I get a much smaller file size but some loss of quality. This makes me think that maybe the layers in the original are causing the large size? Is the image that I’m working with just too complex to be suitable for SVG? </p>
","<p>Your SVG contains an embedded pixel graphic for the shade in the bottom right of the controller. This is responsible for about ⅔ of the file size. If you remove it, your SVG file is en par with your JPEG. You can probably achieve an adequately similar effect with a gradient.</p>

<p>Other techniques of reducing SVG file size include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove all Metadata and similar. Inkscape has <em>Save as plain SVG</em> for this. I suppose that other programs have something similar.</li>
<li>Remove nodes that add little to the shapes, e.g., there are spurious nodes on your controller’s shape.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This makes me think that maybe the layers in the original are causing the large size?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless you are using absurdly many layers (think of one layer for each object), layers should not make a relevant contribution to the file size, and even then, it would only be a fraction.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the image that I’m working with just too complex to be suitable for SVG?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can reasonably create an image from scratch¹ it should not be too complex for the SVG format. There is no such thing as a magical complexity threshold beyond which file sizes explode (probably this holds for any vaguely reasonable format). Of course, if you only choose the resolution sufficiently coarse, you can export every SVG to a JPEG that has smaller file size. But that does not necessarily mean that you should not use SVGs.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>
¹ That is in particular without tracing and similar. To give an extreme example: If you want to exactly reproduce every pixel of a photograph with SVG primitives (i.e., without embedding a pixel graphics in SVG), you might indeed consider the result to be too complex for being efficiently represented in the SVG format. But that’s hopefully common sense.

<p>Given this information, using GIMP is it possible to just ""erase"" the background color, so that I am only left with the original, unblended alert background?</p>

<p>I only have the alert view in image form as a screenshot from a running app.</p>
","<p>Yes, it's possible.  Let me outline how it's done, using <a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PNG_transparency_demonstration_1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this image from Wikimedia Commons</a> (by <a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Ed_g2s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ed_g2s</a>, licensed as <a href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CC-By-SA 3.0</a>) as an example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PxVts.png"" alt=""PNG transparency demonstration image by ed_g2s, licensed as CC-By-SA 3.0""></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open the black and white background versions as layers of the same image (using <em>Open as Layers...</em> or just open both and copy-and-paste one into the other).  Move the white layer above the black layer if it's not already that way.  The two layers should looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OOhDd.png"" alt=""Demonstration image with black background"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/W0XXa.png"" alt=""Demonstration image with white background""></p></li>
<li><p>Take the difference of the layers: clone the black layer (you'll need it later), change the white layer's layer mode to ""difference"" and merge it down.  Invert the result.  This gives you the alpha channel of the original image.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/N6B4G.png"" alt=""Reconstructed alpha channel""></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> If your backgrounds are not black and white, the inverted difference layer won't have a black background.  To fix that, first desaturate the layer (using whichever mode that gives you the best contrast) and then use <em>Colors &rarr; Auto &rarr; Normalize</em> to make the background black.  You could also use the <em>Channel Mixer</em> instead, but it's a little trickier to use. </p>

<p>(<em>Normalize</em> above works if the alpha channel you're recreating has at least some parts with 100% opacity; if the image you're recreating is everywhere translucent, you can use <em>Colors &rarr; Levels...</em> to set only the black point instead.)</p>

<p>If you don't already have one, you also need to create a version of your image with a black background for the next step.  To do that, use the following extra steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pick whichever original version has the darker background.  Create a new layer on top of it filled with its background color.</li>
<li>Clone the difference layer and re-invert it so that it has a white background.  Place this layer on top of the new solid-color one you just created, set its layer mode to ""multiply"" and merge it down.</li>
<li>Finally, change the resulting layer's mode to ""subtract"" and merge it down onto the layer with the original image.  This should subtract away the original background, leaving you with the image on a black background.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If we were using an image format with pre-multiplied alpha, we'd be more or less done now.  But since we aren't, we still need to de-multiply the RGB channels.  To do that, clone the alpha layer we created in the previous step (or just copy it to the clipboard), set its layer mode to ""divide"" and merge it down with the black-background layer your cloned before step 2.  The result should look like this (compare with the original black-background version to see the difference):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J1jT3.png"" alt=""De-multiplied RGB channels""></p></li>
<li><p>Now, add a layer mask to the resulting layer, select the mask and paste the alpha layer into it.  The result should now look more or less like the original transparent image.  Finally, to turn the mask into a proper alpha channel, you can apply it (but GIMP's PNG export will do that for you even if you don't).  And there you go &mdash; one reconstructed transparent PNG ready to go:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PMpTa.png"" alt=""Reconstructed image with transparency""></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, this technique really requires that you have versions of the image on <em>pure</em> black and pure white backgrounds.  If the backgrounds are a little bit off, similar methods may still be usable, but you may need to do additional color adjustments and the results may not be as perfect.  (<strong>Edit:</strong> See additions to step 2 above.  The amended instructions should work with backgrounds of any color, as long as they're solid colors.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Ps. GIMP does also have a ""Color Erase"" feature (as a blend mode for the Bucket Fill tool, or as <em>Color to Alpha...</em> for the whole image), which is useful for <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/6449/add-transparency-to-an-existing-png/6460#6460"">reconstructing transparency</a> when <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/5446/making-the-background-of-an-image-transparent/5454#5454"">you have only <em>one</em> version of the image</a> on a solid color background.  However, unless used carefully, it does have a tendency to produce output that is <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/5648/why-does-my-transparent-png-not-look-good/5695#5695"">rather more transparent than you'd probably want it to be</a>.</p>

<p>Pps. If you compare the original and reconstructed images very carefully, you'll see that they're not <em>exactly</em> identical &mdash; some color values are off by 1/256 or so.  That's because of how GIMP's <a href=""http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-concepts-layer-modes.html#idp7161864"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""divide"" layer mode</a> works: rather than calculating the true inverse of the alpha multiplication, which would be <em>output</em> = (255 &times; <em>input</em>) / <em>layer</em>, it actually calculates <em>output</em> = (256 &times; <em>input</em>) / (<em>layer</em> + 1).  This mismatch, which is ostensibly done to avoid dividing by zero, means that some of the colors may round to a slightly different value than they should.  Alas, I know of no way around this, other than patching GIMP, writing a plugin to do the division the way we want it, or using some other program.  Fortunately, though, the color difference is rarely if ever actually perceptible by the human eye.</p>

","<p>I'm primarily a web developer and designer, so I do most of my work directly in Photoshop/Gimp cutting and clipping and filtering. I eventually stumbled upon the opportunity to purchase a very inexpensive reconditioned <a href=""http://www.dell.com/tablet"">Dell Latitude XT</a>, and my experience has been pretty positive. It allows me to much more easily create masks, draw layers, make my selections, etc. The pressure sensitivity is a huge plus, as it frees me up to make minor tweaks without having to constantly re-size my brush or keep my hand on a slider while I mouse-draw.</p>

<p>A few things to be aware of:</p>

<p>1) There are a variety of sizes and styles of tablets, but the industry standard is mostly assumed to belong to Wacom. You can see their products here: <a href=""http://www.wacom.com/"">http://www.wacom.com/</a> . As you can see, they provide products for both industry professionals and home/office users at a variety of price points. I would recommend trying out the Bamboo series as a first tablet.</p>

<p>2) If you choose to purchase something other than a Wacom device, be aware that they use a different API to interface with the tablet program and your OS than Wacom does, and they are not completely inter-compatible (especially with Adobe's products). NTrig, the makers of the touch-screen technology for both the XT and the HP TouchSmart have released new multi-touch and pressure-sensitive patches for their devices, which also makes them compatible with the WinTab API, so this is no longer as big of an issue, but it still causes compatibility problems with certain applications.</p>

<p>3) It mostly imitates the feeling of traditional media, but you'll find that it's not a true replacement. I'm terrible with a pen or pencil these days, but my dexterity with the tablet has gotten a lot better; these skills are not completely interchangeable.</p>

<ul>
<li>Business cards</li>
<li>Large format prints (42 inches and bigger)</li>
<li>Magazines</li>
</ul>

<p>Should I extend the design into the bleed areas?</p>
","<p><strong>Yes, ideally all files that need bleed should have it on all sides.</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6GRBg.jpg"" alt=""What is bleed""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AWv4V.jpg"" alt=""Bleed before and after trim""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J4Qbr.jpg"" alt=""Business card before and after trimming or cutting""></p>

<p>The bleed is an extra area that you add to your design to make sure there's no ""white border"" once the card or flyer is cut. The cutters that print shop use is not 100% perfect, pages might not be aligned or printed perfectly; when you add bleed, you make sure there's color everywhere no matter what.</p>

<p>That goes for business cards, postcards, flyers, covers, banners, etc. Even giant size banner need it unless you don't mind having a banner that is a bit smaller; it will be trimmed smaller if there's no bleed added to your layout!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The minimum amount of bleed should be around 0.125"" (3mm) outside your document final size</strong>, ideally 0.25"" (6mm). Each printer has his
  own requirement for this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The only time you don't need to use bleed is when there is absolutely nothing printed on all sides</strong> (eg. a design with a white border.) Some small ads in magazine or newspapers don't require it but it's better to provide a file with some bleed if you're not certain.</p>

<p>In this case, you can simply provide your final print-ready at its final size, without any extra bleed.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/a2YJl.jpg"" alt=""With and without bleed""></p>

<p>Another situation where you might not need to add bleed on all sides is when your file is provided as a ""printer spread""; for example, a book cover design with the spine, front and back cover on the same layout OR a brochure with a fold OR a greeting card. The bleed will only be necessary for the printer on the outside edges. It's still a good idea to create your own designs (front cover and back cover) with bleed on all sides; it will be easier for you to merge them together later when you'll prepare the final print-ready file.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0yB92.png"" alt=""Book cover design with spine, front and back cover""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vfaYt.jpg"" alt=""Brochure tabloid printer spread""></p>

<p>For magazine, they usually provide a template or precise instructions for bleed but the file still need to have bleed on all sides. The part where the fold or binding is will still be cut or folded. Printers also need bleed if the magazine or book is thick because they need to adjust the ""creep""; pages are not cut exactly at the same exact width on thicker magazine or book, otherwise the pages in the middle would look wider than the pages that are closer to the covers.</p>

"Batch replacing color with transparency","25942","","<p>I have a very large number of PNG images (too many to practically do one at a time) with a bright pink background and would like to replace the background color with transparency. If this is not possible or particularly difficult, replacing the specified color with white would be useful.</p>

<p>I have gimp but not photoshop and am not particularly comfortable with command line, so if a  solution requires that please show each step. It'd be great to be able to do this, any help would be appreciated.</p>
","<p>I know you said you're not comfortable with command line tools, but ImageMagick can do this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/color_basics/#replace"" rel=""noreferrer"">Replace a Specific Color</a></p>
  
  <p><code>convert balloon.gif  -transparent blue   balloon_trans.gif</code></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Where <code>balloon.gif</code> is the source image, <code>-transparent</code> specifies that you want a transparent bg, <code>blue</code> is the color you want to replace, and <code>balloon_trans.gif</code> is the completed image.</p>

<p>This is under the assumption that your ""bright pink"" is not part of any of the images. For a little more intelligent background removal (floodfill), check out this tutorial: <a href=""http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/masking/#bg_remove"" rel=""noreferrer"">Masking Simple Backgrounds (floodfill)</a></p>

<p>This can get a little hairy and some of the options they specify there probably aren't required for what you're trying to do, so as @graphics man suggests you can add <code>background</code> to the command</p>

<hr>

<p>If you can tell me what OS you're using and a sample image, I can help you with a script to automate this for many images</p>

<hr>

<h3>Specific to your situation:</h3>

<p>First, install <a href=""http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows"" rel=""noreferrer"">ImageMagick</a>. You may need to restart after installation for your PATH variable to be updated (I did)</p>

<p>Once it's installed, fire up a command prompt (Start Menu, type <code>cmd</code>, hit enter)</p>

<p>You need to change directories to where the images are saved. For your situation, enter the following command:</p>

<p><code>cd C:\Users\Eric\Pictures\pngs\logos</code></p>

<p>Now we need to make a folder to save all the images in:</p>

<p><code>mkdir batch</code></p>

<p>And now, the command to convert all the images:</p>

<p><code>FOR %G IN (*.png) DO convert %G -transparent #FF00FF batch\%G</code></p>

<p>If everything went smoothly, the newly saved images should be in the batch folder you created.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/asTqJ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>iOS 7 uses only the Helvetica Neue Ultralight font. I'm sure it doesn't use any seperate font just for the note app.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>iOS 7 moves to Helvetica Neue for the system font, with frequent use of the ultra light and light weights of that particular font. Apple is so proud of its change in fonts, it changed the “iPhone” font on the back of the iPhone 5s and 5c to match. It’s a not so subtle change, and iOS 7 also now places more emphasis on being typographically-centered. Much the same way that color is a theme that runs through iOS 7 applications, typography with a color tint applied is now supposed to define most of the user interface elements on their own.</p>
  
  <p>A new feature is dynamic type (through the new Text Kit set of UIKit classes), which essentially is an accessibility feature that enables users to change the font size bias system wide and in applications that use the UIFont method to get a font size. This automatically adjusts weight, character spacing (kerning) and line height, and seems like an awesome change for users who need larger font sizes for elements to be readable.</p>

"Which Wacom tablet would suit my needs, Intuos vs. Bamboo?","25898","","<p>I am not a graphic design student but digital painiting intrigues me quite a lot. I have been watching online lessons of it and have finally decided to buy a pen tablet. I want to pursue digital painiting as a hobby. </p>

<p>Budget is not a constraint for me (owing to the hige price difference between Bamboo and Intuous) but I want to use the money effectively.</p>

<p>Which tablet would you suggest me to buy?</p>
","<p>My first piece of advice is to be sure of the size you need. I have the Intuos A3, but I end up using only a section of the available surface. When I used the whole surface I found the increased travel was actually giving me RSI in the elbow. The size smaller would have been sufficient for my needs in the end. Perhaps you can rent one to try out?</p>

<p>I regularly use both - the larger Intuos at my studio and the lighter Bamboo  for when I'm working offsite - and I'd say you can feel the difference in the build quality; the Intuos pen and tablet itself feel nice and solid, while the Bamboo feels a little bit light and flimsy, but not by much. While there is technically a difference in the pressure sensitivity of both models if I were to be honest <em>I</em> don't notice the difference much. However, if you're going to use it for painting you might well need that extra degree of sensitivity.</p>

<p>Finally be aware that if you've never used a tablet before it feels <em>really</em> weird at first, so don't be disheartened. It took me a week or so to get really comfortable with one and now I can't live without it!</p>

"What exactly does the rasterize effect do in illustrator?","25884","","<p>What exactly does the rasterize effect do in illustrator ... as compared to object>rasterize, which certainly does rasterize the objects, and I completely understand what it does and it's purpose, but the rasterise in the effects menu doesn't appear to do anything, except add itself to the appearance panel, does it?</p>
","<p><strong>Why you should use one or the other is situational.</strong></p>

<p>In some situation, you might even end up using both to make sure your file is fully compatible, ending with Rasterize Object ultimately.</p>

<p>If you try to use both rasterize effects, you'll notice:</p>

<h1>1) The Effect Rasterize (In the menu -› Effect / Rasterize)</h1>

<p>The Effect Rasterize keeps your effect within the paths but will also have the same exact size no matter how you resize it. </p>

<p><strong>It acts like a pattern inserted in your shape</strong> and you can use this as <a href=""https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/graphic-styles.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a Graphic Style</a> to apply on other shapes later. To change the effect to be smaller, you'll need to change the filter settings or use Object Rasterize.</p>

<p>Your paths will still be editable. You might need to use Rasterize Object on it if you need to export your file to be fully compatible for other software or legacy versions of Illustrator.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tmSd6.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tmSd6.jpg"" alt=""Rasterize effect in Adobe Illustrator""></a></p>

<h1>2) The Object Rasterize (In the menu -› Object / Rasterize)</h1>

<p>The Object Rasterize will transform your effect into a real rasterized image like a picture, including the edges of the paths.</p>

<p><strong>That effect will change in size depending on how you resize the rasterized artwork</strong>, the same way as a picture that was placed in Illustrator. </p>

<p>Your paths won't be editable.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qg6xI.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qg6xI.jpg"" alt=""Rasterize object in Adobe Illustrator""></a></p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<h1>EXAMPLE:</h1>

<p>You could use the effect rasterize on shapes you need to modify &amp; want to keep the original effect no matter how you resize the shape; it won't get distorted with the effect rasterize, but will get distorted with object rasterize. </p>

<p>For example: to fill the shapes of a histogram you need to have different height for each bar. </p>

<p><strong>If you use effect rasterize</strong>, you can freely resize the height and the effect will fill that bar without distortion, like a pattern (like a background repeat in css.) </p>

<p>Notice how the pattern doesn't get distorted and gets adjusted to the size of the shape.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lu88N.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lu88N.jpg"" alt=""Effect rasterize example""></a></p>

<p><strong>With object rasterize</strong>, you'll need to create a clipping mask or do a custom effect on each bar. Object rasterize will also create a background that might be annoying.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qq4Wg.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qq4Wg.jpg"" alt=""Example object rasterize""></a></p>

<h1>Also: Effect Rasterize for Performance</h1>

<p><strong>You may wonder why rasterize the effect with the ""effect/rasterize"" if it does the same as if it wasn't rasterized; for performance.</strong> </p>

<p>If you have a lot of effects applied, you'll notice it can become very ""heavy"" for the computer to process. Rasterizing will help in this case. </p>

<p><strong>But even better:</strong> one nice feature about the effect rasterize (unlike object rasterize) is that you can work at low resolution and then change it back to high resolution later in the ""appearance"" panel. That can be useful if you need to work on a project that uses many effects; you can work at 72ppi to create your layout and change it to 300ppi when you're ready to export the file at high quality.</p>

<p>With the object rasterize, you can't go back like this.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eLoem.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eLoem.jpg"" alt=""Appearance panel and rasterize effect""></a></p>

<h1>So...</h1>

<p>You use effect rasterize because: 1) you want to be able to modify the paths or shapes, and 2) for performances and 3) because it's convenient.</p>

<p>Object rasterize is like doing a create outline on the text of a layout that you want to edit later... You will need to absolutely keep a ""non rasterized"" file if you ever want to modify something AND not forget to note down what effect+settings you used on the effect to get the exact same one if you need to re-create it again!</p>

","<p>Your first link, <a href=""http://customtattoos.net/cmyk.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://customtattoos.net/cmyk.pdf</a> is a CMYK guide. The squares of colour are all CMYK in a logical order, so when printed on press (the author looks to be fine with it being used freely for any purpose) it'll make a decent guide to what you can expect. You could also make your own of course in Illustrator or Indesign, it would be a bit tedious though (and even more tedious in Photoshop).</p>

<p>The second link (which may well be copyrighted material) isn't quite the same thing. It is a Pantone (PMS) ""bridge guide"". The squares are CMYK, but they are intended to show the closest matches achievable in CMYK to each PMS colour. This can be useful if you need to convert or match PMS ""spot"" colour based artwork to CMYK.</p>

<p>One answer to the cost of running the job is to have it printed as a run-on (extra pages at the end of a live job), or parts of it in the margins. As Alan mentions, you should have a copy on both coated and uncoated paper.</p>

I've seen this on several designers' resumes and was wondering if it is a new fad, if it's something that I should consider adding to my resume/website, etc.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BAxRV.png"" alt=""Chart showing somebody&#39;s experience with software""></p>

<p>Wouldn't this get you less clients if you forget or didn't have the room to add every single piece of software that you know and your skill level of said software? I can understand adding fundamental software like Photoshop and Illustrator, but what about all the little programs that I don't use very often, but I still know how to use? If I were to list all those, the resume would be like 3 pages long.</p>

<p>Is this a useful graphic to add?</p>
","<p>If the information is valuable (in other words, if it makes you look good), placing it in an immediately identifiable graphic is nice. It is not mandatory though and you shouldn't force it into a resume just because you can. </p>

<p>People intake information in two basic ways... simultaneous intake and linear intake. </p>

<p>Images, graphs, charts, all foster simultaneous intake. One can look at a graph or chart and <em>instantly</em> understand the intent. It takes mere seconds to understand that A is bigger or more important than B. </p>

<p>Whereas with text, everything is interpreted in a linear fashion. You have to read the preceding words before the following words make sense. Or you read a list from top to bottom. Once you're at the bottom you may not entirely recall what was at the top.</p>

<p>I, personally, don't think that's a great resume in your link. It's laid out nicely, color choices are good, but there's <em>very little</em> substance to it. I mean that word cloud at the bottom is just pointless. The <strong>entire</strong> goal of a resume is to get you a call back or interview. I would not be calling that designer because there's not enough information present on the resume, nothing about that resume makes me want to know more about him or his skills. In addition, there is some fairly poor gramar - even considering English may not be his native language..... have an English speaker proof-read it. I'd never create a Yugoslavian, or French, or any other language, resume without hiring a native speaker to review it before sending it out or posting it somewhere.</p>

<p>As for all the little apps you may know how to use..... it's not important to list <em>absolutely everything</em> you are familiar with. Simply cover what will be of primary interest to an employer... Adobe apps, Quark apps, web language/packages, etc. No one is going to care that you know how to use iTunes or Winamp.. so leave that stuff off. </p>

<p><strong>Luxury is often about the craftsmanship and quality of materials. This is a key point to identifying the characteristics.</strong> To elaborate, looking at the logos others have posted:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Very, very well crafted typefaces. These are typefaces that are flawlessly balanced, kerned, spaced, everything.</p></li>
<li><p>They are generally a solid color often black, sometimes gold, white, silver. There are no extraneous elements. No drop shadows, no outlines, no emboss. They stand on the merit of the type's craftsmanship, again like the underlying product.</p></li>
<li><p>Only time rounded corners occur are when used in a signature based identity such as Agnes B. Voyage and Salvatore Ferragamo. This could be extended to say only time letters aren't necessarily crisp, balanced, and kerned are also in signatures and could include Christian Louboutin logo into the mix.</p></li>
<li><p>There is rarely a marking associated, and when so it is frequently using the actual type as is the case in Fendi and Chanel (Chanel of course also tributing Coco Chanel). The only luxury brand I can think of that deviates from this is Versace. However, the type used is still in line with everything else. Watches and cars are more open to adding things however.</p></li>
<li><p>Everything is on a perfect horizontal... baseline, crossbars, ascent line, cap line, etc..</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The main takeaway is that luxury doesn't scream it. Its subtle, sophisticated, and well crafted. It lets the type speak for itself. To further illustrate this lets look at some toy companies:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ef78Q.jpg"" alt=""Toy Brands""></p>

<p>The type doesn't hold on its own. Spacing isn't as perfect, letters are more playful, angles and curves are used, colors not only around them but in the actual type, then there's shadows, strokes, gradients. As some pointed out the free space in luxury logos --- well its not just the free space but the lack of additional elements. Luxury isn't ""minimal"" but it is clean. These elements don't appear in luxury. Lots of rounded</p>

<p>Can think of it like food. A high quality restaurant uses the best ingredients and allows it to speak for itself. A typical lower end restuarant would be processed. The Toy companies are processed type, while the Luxury brands are the high end ingredients.</p>

<p>To <em>user568458</em> joking in comments about Comic Sans being used in a luxury brand. We don't see it because of the playfulness in the characteristics. The curved ends, the tilted letters, the variations in horizontal lines. All of the reasons people hate Comic Sans MS are the same ones that don't lend it to being used as a typeface signifying wealth and luxury.</p>

<p>To <em>scott</em> mentioning Polo Ralph Lauren. Polo is the lowest end of their product line, their luxury brands are Purple Label (highest) and Black Label. Those logos are:</p>

<p><strong>Another update</strong></p>

<p>I happened to be reading an article that had this as its final point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WHITE SPACE</p>
  
  <p>In art as in life, white space is the ultimate luxury. The most recent architectural addition to the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan is a superb example of the way acres of empty white walls can be used to make a superlative statement On the page, white space works the same way. It signifies that you have plenty of room to spare. It frames images with an aura of accessibility. The less crowded a magazine layout, the more elitist is its attitude.</p>
  
  <p>""The luxury of less.""</p>
  
  <p>One of the first magazine art directors to realize that a blank surface could have as much impact as a printed one was Alexey Brodovitch. His Harper’s Bazaar layouts in the 1950s treated white paper as if it was an electromagnetic field, with blocks of type and photographs charged with positive and negative energy.</p>
  
  <p>Because of its upscale connotation, white space was vilified in the 1970s as too elitist. Only in the late 1980s did a handful of art directors, Neville Brody and Fabien Baron among them, dare to reintroduce white space in magazines, chiefly on opening spreads, to show off their typographical wit.</p>

<p>I think this offers some valuable historic insight into the use of white space by luxury brands.</p>

<p>Is there any solution to this? I want to set my Windows 7 color scheme in that way so I can get the same color as a Mac.</p>
","<p>It sounds like the issue is (yet again) monitor calibration. If you're using the same color profile (sRGB, etc.) the values will be the same regardless of the OS used.</p>

<p>You and your designer should agree on a color profile (there are many, many profiles and they're mostly OS independent) simply for the sake of consistency. Since color is part of design I'd let them take the lead in that part. Color profile can't really be set in the OS; it really comes into play with browsers and print materials.</p>

<p>If you're concerned about the display not matching you could always calibrate your monitor with a calibration tool. Unfortunately, even if your display matches that of your designer's it's not going to match what's out there in the real world - no one outside of design studios really calibrates their monitors so despite your hard work it's always going to look different on end-users' displays.</p>

","<p>The simple way to do this (Photoshop CS5/5.1) is:</p>

<p>Step 1: In the Layers panel, Ctl(Cmd)-click on the thumbnail of a raster or shape layer that is the full size of your button. That gives you a selection that is the exact size (and position) you want.</p>

<p>Step 2: Edit > Copy or use Ctl-C.</p>

<p>Step 3: File > New or Ctl-N, and click OK. You now have a new document that is the exact size of your layer.</p>

<p>Step 4: Switch back to the original document and target the layer <em>group</em> in the Layers panel.</p>

<p>Step 5: Using the move tool, drag from the document (not the Layers panel) to the tab for your new, empty document. The focus will switch automatically to the new document.</p>

<p>Step 6: Hold down the Shift key, move the cursor onto the new canvas, and let go the mouse button.</p>

<p>All of your layers will import intact. You can then delete the background layer.</p>

<p>NOTE 1: In the case where you have effects applied, such as drop shadows, outer glows, etc., first convert the effects to layers. (In the Layers panel, right click on the word ""Effects"" under the layer name, and choose ""Create Layers"" from the menu.) Do this first, so your new document will have the dimensions to include the whole of the glow or drop shadow.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: Use ""COPY"" or ""COPY MERGED"" in Step 5 if you want a flattened image in the new document. To bring in the selected layers intact, deselect, then drag from the image window (NOT the layers panel) up to the new document's tab. When the focus switches, drop inside the new canvas while holding down Shift.</p>

<p>If you're using CS4 or earlier, follow steps 1-3, then copy and paste the layers one at a time.</p>

","<p><strong>Design in greyscale, black and white.</strong> And it's printed with one ink. It doesn't matter what color that ink is. It's still just one color.</p>

<p>Don't use Pantone or spot colors, just design everything with black and white. The printer will use whatever ink color they choose.</p>

<p>There is <em>never</em> a reason one would need to use one spot color to design something like this. There's absolutely no benefit to designing a one color print project using one spot color. All you essentially do is create more work for yourself. Whether you use greyscale/black &amp; white or a single spot color, in the end all that's output is a single color plate. That single plate is put on a press and the color is chosen by the press operator. Just because you go to all the work of setting up a file using Pantone 286U, the press operator can still simply put Pantone 185C into the ink wells for the press and run the job red rather than blue. </p>

<p>If your client isn't conceptual enough to understand that all you need is one color (black), you should still design the ad in black. Then for approval simply tint or apply a temporary color overlay to shift the color for client approval.

<p>In general terms, some people have to refocus in order to see the correct colors of Black and Blue. It is possible to re-""tune"" your eyes and see the Gold and White but very difficult. For the most part once you see it Black and Blue you can't go the other way.</p>

<p>Again though - the question is how can this illusion be reproduced in order to use it in various designs?</p>
","<p>Since you asked about color theory, I assume you are already aware of color theory and know a little of how it relates to shadows and highlights.  If not, take a look at <a href=""http://thevirtualinstructor.com/color-theory-for-highlights-shadows.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> which does an excellent job of explaining how to create objects with shadows when painting.</p>

<p>We can use this information as a tool for creating similar images as this dress.  However, it is worth pointing out that the reason why it is so easy for our minds to misperceive this image is because this is a grainy, poor quality jpeg and the lighting is considerably complex.</p>

<p>In fact, part of the reason why this effect is occurring is because this image was taken on a mediocre camera (almost certainly on a cell phone), snapped quickly (causing a bit of blur), and likely scaled-down in quality so that it would be easy to upload to a social media site.  </p>

<p>The bottom-line is that for the ocular portion of the nervous system to make a good judgement of a scene, it needs quality ""data"" coming in.  If our brains receive poor data, then it can easily make poor perceptual judgements.</p>

<p>Regarding this image, the lighting is as such that many tend to first notice the really <strong>BRIGHT</strong> source of light, coming from the window.  In our minds, we then assume ""<em>Ok, bright light outside, ergo... I must be looking at the shadow-side of this dress.</em>""</p>

<p>Being armed with our knowledge of blue-toned shadows and using complementary colors for shadowing, we can now understand why we may perceive that this is a white dress (that is being toned down to a bluish tone for shadowing) and that the gold lace is also being cast in a bluish tone because it is also in a shadow.</p>

<p>For those of us who misinterpreted this scene, we may have to stare at this image for a minute for our minds catch that there is a lot of light-bleeding from light glaring on the lens of the camera.  </p>

<p>This means that instead of seeing a dress in a shadow, we are actually seeing it in a room that also has a very-bright light shining on the dress.  Our minds then go:</p>

<p>""<em>Oh! This isn't a dimly lit, white/gold dress, it's a well lit black/blue dress!  Let me slooooooowly re-adjust our perception so that MAYBE we won't think we're complete idiots...</em>""</p>

<p>We are fooled because both the Black/Gold and White/Blue color-pairs in this image are both close to the center of the complementary color gradients for each color.  Since we are close to that center-point of the complementary color scale, and the image quality sucks, our minds simply don't know how to correctly process this image.</p>

<h2>How do we use this to our advantage?</h2>

<p>I can't give a straight-forward answer because using this information effectively requires a considerable amount of artistic capability in setting up a scene.  Though I'm no artist, I can offer some tips.</p>

<p>First, I'd setup a scene with an immediate focal point that isn't the object that you want to use as your ""confused"" focal point.  In the case of our image, this is the very-bright light coming from the window.  Make this the first perceived focal point by your viewer and make it, dare I say it, rather garish.</p>

<p>Next, device a scene where an object rests in a place that one would <em>assume</em> is a shadow.  As I mentioned, our minds tend to think this dress is in a dark room.  If the room is dark, we are seeing shadowed-tones.  Create this same effect by using complementary, shadowy colors, but be sure to use colors that are all very close to that grayish-blue tone that is somewhere in the middle of all high-to-low light complementary color scales.</p>

<p>Next, recreate a ""light bleeding"" effect like the one we see on this image from the light that was shining on the lens of the camera.  In fact, this bleeding effect is almost certainly necessary.  I can't see how else one could fool the mind without it.  It is this light-bleed that makes our minds miss that the object-of-focus is actually well lit, rather than poorly lit.  This is a necessary mechanism if we want to fool the mind, and have your viewers question what they are perceiving.</p>

<p>If you can follow these rules, and with a bit of practice, I think you could recreate a similar effect within a digital image, or possibly even a painting.  I would mock-up an example of this type of image but this is extremely difficult to replicate.  As Scott posted above, the cylinder with the shadows on the checkerboard show a good example of how our minds alter real color, so that we can get a better understanding of what an object really looks like, regardless of lighting, in a three-dimensional world.  </p>

<p>However, your end-goal is to create a scene that the eye can't easily correct and, in fact, will misperceive!  This will require a certain level of artistic creativity and a lot of experimentation.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you are an artist and hope to recreate this type of illusion in your work, then good luck!  I'd love to see someone play off of this psychological effect in art.  It's fun to observe and, for a second, makes most of us question our sanity when we are strikingly made aware that the world is often not as we immediately perceive.</p>

"How can I digitize my vector to a DST for embroidery (for free)?","24767","","<p>I'm not sure if this question is a good fit for you guys, but I don't know who else to turn to.  I can delete, if not appropriate.</p>

<p>I'm trying to get a couple of shirts embroidered with my company logo and the embroiderer is asking me for a .dst file.  I had never even heard of such a thing, so I turned to Google.  It's apparently a file format that tells the embroidery machine which colors to stitch where, in the design.</p>

<p>I have a one-color logo, so I'm wondering why I even need this file.</p>

<p>I have been digging around online for a couple of hours now, trying to find a free way to digitize a vector file, with no luck.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a way that I can digitize my file?  I only need this one-time order, so it makes no sense for me to go out and purchase the expensive embroidery softwares that I'm seeing on Google.</p>

<p>Am I better off just finding another embroiderer?  We have gotten shirts embroidered before and never had an issue with eps/ai.  Anyone have any experience with this?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong><br>
I'm on a Mac</p>
","<p>Converting an image file to DST or any other machine embroidery format isn’t same as like converting JPEG to PNG or any other. </p>

<p>Also, wilcom truesizer software converts one embroidery file to another one but not from the picture.</p>

<p>Instead of that, it requires a manual digitizing process which takes time + effort + techniques.</p>

<p>If you want to do it yourself then you have to get:</p>

<p>Embroidery digitizing software (like wilcom or pulse which are expensive)
Essential skills of machine embroidery digitizing (takes time to learn)
And then you will be able to convert a picture to PES or DST format.
It’s far better to get work done from an embroidery digitizer.</p>

<p><strong><em>BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS!</em></strong>  </p>

<p>Problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>getImageData</code> requires privilege elevation unless the source images are hosted on the same domain as the script.  You can't use any hosting services unless you want to bother users with priv-escalation prompts.</li>
<li>If your user has Javascript disabled, or an older browser that doesn't support HTML5, it won't work.</li>
<li>HTML5 is still in draft so the <code>canvas</code> implementation could change. </li>
<li>You're asking your browsers to do image processing for you every time the image is loaded.  If you're only using a few basic colors, you're better off doing your own processing and determining which image to serve at response time instead of expecting them to process.  (And, if you care, from a ""green"" standpoint, you end up asking users to reproduce the exact same ""Color X"" version countless times using countless CPU cycles which uses more power and yada yada yada.)</li>
</ol>

<p>You can save CPU cycles for you and your users by just creating the colors you need server-side (there are scripts that can do this for you) and serving them the colors they need.  You only want to use <code>canvas</code> for this if you have no other choice (e.g. the user is determining the color on the fly).</p>

<p>Can you please point me to which is the best application to do this kind of design? And if possible the techniques to achieve the effect? Thank you very much.</p>
","<p>Do it by hand. As far as I know, there is no function beyond <a href=""http://www.tagxedo.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Taxedo</a> (named in the question you referenced, and it's where your third example comes from) that will fully automatically create word-clouds in these complicated forms. </p>

<p>There is a place to start doing this manually, especially on the '7' example you give, and that's with InDesign's <code>Text Wrap</code> functionality. You can give any InDesign object a Text Wrap by selecting it and choosing settings in the <code>Text Wrap</code> panel (<code>Window &gt; Text Wrap</code> or <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Control/Option</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yLKH3.jpg"" alt=""Text Wrap panel in InDesign""></p>

<p>I'd advise to go for the third option: 'wrap around object shape'. This will create a border around your shape where text will not flow. If you then place the object over a field full of text, it will repel all the text. You will have to manually readjust and replace the text for good legibility and flow, however.</p>

"How do you handle client's browser zoom ?","24442","","<p>I have a lot of images on a page, a gallery. I want the images to stay sharp, so I don't do any browser scaling, I use the original dimensions of the image. </p>

<p>However, this works only when the browser zoom level is 100% . When I increase or decrease the zoom level, the quality of the images decrease. </p>

<p>Some clients actually have different zoom levels by default. I was wondering, how can you handle it and do we handle it at all ? </p>

<p>Cheers</p>
","<p>I think most of the other answers have missed the point: this isn't about overriding user preferences, it's about giving the best quality images in the  common scenario of a user's device assigning more than one physical pixel for each CSS pixel aka ""<a href=""http://alistapart.com/article/a-pixel-identity-crisis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reference pixel</a>"" in your image, resulting in the browser scaling up the image, making it pixelated and grainy.</p>

<p>My suggested solutions below, but first here are the four ways this can happen:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Most rare:</em> <strong>the user chooses to zoom in</strong>. Not such a big problem, since it's their choice.</li>
<li><em>Surprisingly common:</em> <strong>the user's browser is zoomed in by default</strong>. For example, many high pixel density Windows machines are zoomed to 125% or more by default, and <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/804949/why-does-firefox-interpret-100-zoom-differently-to-other-browsers"">Firefox recently (confusingly!) made it so in these cases it tells users they are zoomed to 100% when they're actually zoomed to 125%</a>, leaving them scratching their heads wondering why everything suddenly looks grainy.</li>
<li><em>Very common:</em> most Android devices (and other devices?) have a <strong>pixel ratio</strong> of greater than 1. This means that every ""CSS pixel"" actually gets displayed using more than one physical pixel - so a 200px by 200px image set to <code>width: 200px; height: 200px;</code> will actually scale that 200px by 200px image up across more than 200 x 200 pixels, potentially making it grainy.</li>
<li><em>Very common:</em> many modern Apple devices have ""<strong>retina displays</strong>"". This is essentially the same as an Android device with a pixel ratio of 2, but with better marketing, and a few custom properties that allow it to be detected by name.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any of these will result in John's problem of a gallery of images looking surprisingly grainy.</p>

<hr>

<p>I was hoping someone would have a great solution to this problem, but for now here are my preferred options, starting with most effective but least universally possible:</p>

<ol>
<li>If possible, go vector - SVG (or Raphael.js if you still need to support IE8). Realistically, this is only an option for icons, diagrams etc, and it's never an option for photographs. Very complex SVG can also be clunky on low-end mobiles due to the processing required.</li>
<li>If possible, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16541676/what-are-best-practices-for-detecting-pixel-ratio-density"">detect the device's pixel ratio,</a> and serve images based on that. This can also solve the Firefox on Windows problem because Firefox on Windows changes its reading of pixel ratios when it zooms in and out. The downside is, it becomes a tricky coding problem involving development work on the server and client side.</li>
<li><p>If 1. and 2. aren't possible, but it's really important and image quality is more important than, say, load time, just double up the image. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>This is what Google do with their logo on their homepage: they squash a 538px x 190px PNG image in a 269px x 95px container. It's also more or less the same as how responsive images work. </p></li>
<li><p>This used to be considered bad practice because old versions of IE were terrible at scaling down images, but those are now very rarely used and much less common than high pixel density screens. It's still somewhat undesirable since it will increase image size and therefore increase load time - that's a trade-off you need to judge case-by-case. </p></li>
<li>Doubling size is common because very few devices have a ratio greater than 2, very few users are zoomed in more than 200%, and scaling images 50% is cleaner than other amounts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If 1, 2 aren't possible and load times are too high a priority for 3, I'm not aware of any other options, and my recommendation is to not worry about it, because half the sites on the internet have the same problem, and people with this problem on your site will also have this problem on other sites. Hell, Firefox on Windows even pixelates <em>its own UI buttons</em>... </li>

<p>Pick up the <code>pen</code> tool and draw a <code>shape</code> like:  </p>

<p>This would be one of your rays. Copy it, modify them if you wish and rotate them, so they all are pointing into one spot. While this isn't too hard, it takes considerably more time than the first method, especially if you are approaching the deadline. </p>

"What is the difference between a font and a typeface?","24318","","<p>Originally, the typeface is a particular design of type, while a font is a type in a particular size and weight. In short, a typeface usually gathers many fonts.</p>

<p>Nowadays, with the digital design of documents, you often see those two words used rather interchangeably. It doesn't make much sense to say that “Helvetica 12” and “Helvetica 14” are different fonts (they used to be different drawers with different blocks of lead, now they're all a single OTF file!).</p>

<p>So, my question is: Does the difference between a 'font' and a 'typeface' subside in the language? Or are <em>font</em> and <em>typeface</em> now used interchangeably even by pros?</p>
","<p>They’re <em>almost</em> interchangeable – but there’s a difference of emphasis that can be useful. </p>

<p>If you talk about the <strong>typeface</strong>, your focus is on the end result, some type’s appearance and aesthetics in use. It might have come from a font, or it might not: hand-painted signs, graffiti art, comic lettering, calligraphy, logos etc can all have distinctive <strong>typefaces without fonts</strong>.</p>

<p>If you talk about the <strong>font</strong>, your focus is more on the product, the item or package that can be bought, downloaded or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font#Metal_type"" rel=""noreferrer"">stored in a box</a>, etc. That font is usually a package <em>for</em> a typeface, but not always: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingdings"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wingdings</a>, <a href=""http://tktype.com/chartwell.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">Chartwell</a> and icon fonts like <a href=""http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Font Awesome</a> are <strong>fonts without typefaces</strong>.</p>

<p>Here’s an <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/8131/are-light-type-face-versions-simply-thinner-than-the-roman-regular-ones"">analogy I adapted</a> from <a href=""http://fontfeed.com/archives/font-or-typeface/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this Fontfeed article, ""Font or Typeface?""</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use ""typeface"" when you’d use ""song"" (e.g. ""<em>I love that
  song/typeface …</em>""), and ""font"" when you’d use ""track"" (""<em>… so I’m
  going to buy the track/font for it</em>"").</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of the time, people use ""font"" and ""typeface"" interchangeably, but occasionally you need to focus on one or the other, like how sometimes musicians write great songs, but release bad recordings of those songs or never record them.</p>

<p>Lots of type foundries produce <strong>amazing typefaces</strong> that make for <strong>frustrating fonts</strong> because they <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/28354/add-diacritics-to-fonts-in-illustrator"">lack important glyphs e.g. for international use</a> or their <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/6347/why-does-helvetica-neue-look-absolutely-horrible-in-illustrator"">hinting is flakey at certain sizes</a> or their default kerning tables are inconsistent, etc etc. </p>

<p>People might say that Arial is a <strong>poor typeface</strong> (derivative and uninspiring), but a <strong>valuable font</strong> (huge range of glyphs, great international support, reliable at all sizes and on all devices, etc etc).</p>

<p>It’s a subtle difference, but often a useful one.</p>

"Why is black not a natural color?","24303","","<p>I've had at least two art teachers tell me that black does not naturally occur in nature, so using pure black makes your designs look synthetic. I do not understand this. Aren't the following black things natural?</p>

<ul>
<li>Asian hair</li>
<li>The darkness</li>
<li>Panther's fur</li>
</ul>
","<p>By ""pure black,"" I guess you and they are referring to a completely neutral black. Of the three things you ask about, only one potentially has that quality: darkness. ""Black"" animal fur and natural (not dyed) human hair are actually very dark brown, as a close examination will tell you. (I don't necessarily recommend close examination of a panther, except through a good 400mm or longer telephoto lens. At the very least, don't try it at home.)</p>

<p>Neutral black occurs naturally in charcoal, soot (once known as ""lampblack"" and commonly used as a pigment), graphite, some types of coal, certain types of marble, granite and basalt, and probably many other minerals I'm not immediately thinking of. What your art teachers are referring to, I think, is <em>living</em> nature, specifically plants and mammals. I've not delved into aquatic or insect life as regards color, so I can't say categorically there is no neutral black in either of those, but I would be surprised if there's a genuinely charcoal/soot black.</p>

<p>So yes, if your design includes a natural, non-mineral element that is <em>supposed to look natural</em>, avoid a totally neutral black, otherwise you will break the illusion. Very few designs would fall into that category, it seems to me, and not that many illustrations.</p>

<p>In designing for print, a ""pure"" black would be what's called a ""built,"" or ""rich"" black, composed of 100% coverage of black ink overprinted on carefully-selected percentages of cyan, magenta and yellow. ""Carefully selected"" means the exact percentages required would depend upon the type of paper and the particular ink manufacturer. Black ink, even at 100% coverage, is a very dark gray on white paper, not black, and often is <em>not</em> entirely neutral.</p>

"What kind of tablet are pros using?","24189","","<p>This is more of a curiosity, but I was wondering what professional graphics designers/artists are using now that tablet pcs have been much more common and powerful in the passed few years than they were in the past.</p>

<p>So, straight forward: are lots of artists still using tablets, or has there been a switch to tablet pcs?</p>

<p>Whatever the answer is, what model(s) are common/prevalent in your experience?</p>
","<p>I have used both tablets and tablet PCs; for ease of reading I'll break the two out into separate paragraphs:</p>

<p>1) Tablet PCs: I've used both the HP TC1100 and TC4400s; both running windows XP tablet edition. The TC1100 was a complete nightmare - the GPU was way underpowered (if you wanted to project video you had to choose between the on-tablet display or the external display) and the CPU crawled. The TC4400 was much better, but still suffered from performance limitations (this was using Photoshop / Illustrator CS2) and size restrictions. The one nice thing about it was that you could draw directly on the screen (something you have to spend a lot more money on is you want to be able to do with a WACOM tablet). I will occasionally use the 4400 if I'm throwing something together and don't feel like dragging my macbook out of its case but don't really use that for much graphics work.</p>

<p>I have also dropped the latest version of Ubuntu on an old TC1100; this version has support for the pen but I don't know if there's support for pressure-sensitivity.</p>

<p>2) USB Tablet: I use an Intuos 4 medium-sized tablet for Illustrator / Photoshop (CS5) and, once I got used to it, can't imagine using anything else. The definition is much better than anything I can get from a mouse, the actions seem more natural, and I can choose different nibs for a different feel (pencil vs. pen vs. brush). With a nice long USB cable I can lean back and work (I rarely use the hotkeys on the side so I still have to lean forward to hit hotkeys but it's a fair trade in my opinion). It also means that I can use a more powerful computer (with my preferred OS) and have more working area than on the tablet PCs.</p>

<p>Long story short, I'd personally recommend a USB tablet like the Intuos 4 (the Intuos 4 has higher definition, larger sizes and more pressure sensitivity than the Bamboo) over a tablet PC any day. You get more accuracy (touch sensitivity and higher definition), better ergonomics (not hunched over a crappy little 13"" screen) and much better performance (don't like the way it's working on your laptop? Plug it into your desktop.). </p>

"Can you see while drawing on the drawing tablet?","23616","","<p>I bought a drawing tablet. But when I draw on it, I can see the drawing I am making in an image editing software such as Microsoft Paint or on Microsoft Office products, but I cannot see anything on the drawing tablet. It is rather disappointing. It's just like a mouse in a different shape. I was hoping that when I draw on a drawing tablet, I will be able to see the drawing (like when you draw on your phone), and it'll have some in-built image editing software.</p>

<p>The tablet I bought is Bamboo One Pen CTE-660/K0-C.</p>

<p>Is this usual or is there some knob or switch I need to turn on to see things on the tablet?</p>

<p>Sorry for the stupid question.</p>
","<p>That's how they work. You draw on the tablet and see it on screen. It takes a bit of getting used to but the overall functionality is the same. You merely look at the screen when you draw rather than your hand.</p>

"InDesign: ""page bleed"" with pictures spanning on two pages","23587","","<p>lately I had a problem that I neved faced before now, I'll try to explain quickly: usually I setup documents in InDesign CS6 with side-by-side pages and work with pictures that run over two (side-by-side) pages, then I export to PDF.</p>

<p>The problem is that a printing service asked me to export to PDF only in single pages with page bleed on each size and each page, but of course in the ""middle side"" of the two pages, there is no bleed (on the left page there is no bleed on the right side, and on the right page there is no bleed on the left side).</p>

<p>Is there a way to achieve that result, or I have to work since the beginning with single pages? For example, if I want one big image on two side-by-side page, should I import two times the same image and position it cutting it properly (half image each page)? Isn't it very uncomfortable?</p>

<p>I tried many things but couldn't find any solution.</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks a lot for your answer that are great, but I'm adding some details to explain myself better (sorry but english is not my mother language and also my InDesign is in Italian).</p>

<p>The method explained works fantastic with the images if you add them into the pages, but if you have something in the ""master"" pages, they will overlap on the pages, I did an example to explain better.</p>

<p>This one is with a banner on the master page right and left, with different colors.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cbwTW.jpg"" alt=""test1""></p>

<p>You can see that a yellow part of the title background overlap the right page, and vice-versa. How do you manage this problem?</p>
","<p>I’m not sure I fully understand your problem.</p>

<p>If you create a document with Facing Pages in InDesign and specify a bleed of, say, 3mm, then that bleed will be there on all four sides of each individual page if you export as pages, rather than spreads. To illustrate:</p>

<h3>Set up your document with page settings like these</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b77Zh.png"" alt=""Document Setup""></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Make a spread with an image straddling the pages</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/83tGr.png"" alt=""Page-straddling image""></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Export to PDF</h3>

<p>In the <em>General</em> section, choose <em>Pages</em> (rather than <em>Spreads</em>)
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZoRFu.png"" alt=""Export to PDF - General""></p>

<p>In the <em>Marks and Bleeds</em> section, choose <em>Use Document Bleed Settings</em> (and whatever mark settings your printer wants)
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vAANK.png"" alt=""Export to PDF - Marks and Bleeds""></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Voilà!</h3>

<p>When you open the resulting PDF, the image should go past the crop area, all the way out to the edge of the bleed area. The parts of the image that flow over the crop area will thus be ‘repeated’, appearing once in the bleed area of one page and once in the crop area of the other page:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TtFnj.png"" alt=""Image flows into bleed area""></p>

<p>(I flipped the photo in the last screenshot because the white of the tiles meant you couldn’t see that it actually does extend beyond the crop area.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>To address your clarification:</h2>

<p>What you’re essentially looking for here unfortunately is not possible.</p>

<p>Since there is no <em>actual</em> bleed on the centre margin for spreads, what InDesign really does is take the first closest millimetres of the opposite page’s content and add that to the bleed area.</p>

<p>In your example, you really have two mutually exclusive requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>You need the big image to fake-bleed across the gutter of the final page</li>
<li>You need the title containers <em>not</em> to fake-bleed across the gutter of the final page</li>
</ul>

<p>There is, sadly, no good way of doing this. If you have spreads, both the image and the title containers will bleed over, and you get that ugly little sliver of the wrong colour on the side of the page; if you have single pages, you have to have the straddling photo on both pages, positioned so that it aligns perfectly.</p>

<p>The latter of these options is a <em>major</em> hassle, and it’s not a solution I would ever advise anyone to follow. But as Yorik and DLev have both mentioned, the ugly bleed in the former option <em>generally doesn’t matter</em>. The bits that are the wrong colour will be chopped off before printing when pages are reordered and imposed to spreads in a printing file if the document is to be saddle-stitched, and they’ll be chopped off after printing if the document is to be perfect-bound.</p>

<p>In either case, the risk of anyone ever seeing any of the ugly bleed is quite small. It is bigger with saddle-stitching because the staple spine has to align exactly with the gutter of the printed page: if the pages are folded and stapled a millimetre too far to one side, you’ll see the edge of the opposite side in the centre of every spread if you look closely (but this is true whether you have any bleed in your file or not). With perfect-bound prints, the gutter is usually tucked away in an ‘invisible’ folding area where the pages ‘buckle’ up towards one another, so no one will be able to see the edge of the page without breaking the book.</p>

"Converting a PDF that has multiple pages per page into all single pages","23438","","<p>I recently started a project converting a magazine's PDFs into a digital reader app. </p>

<p>Up until now, the PDFs that were given to me were all set up so that each page of the magazine was a separate page of the PDF. </p>

<p>Recently I have been getting them formatted differently however. Now they are set up so the front and back pages are single pages, but very inside page is set up as a landscape shaped PDF page that contains two different magazine pages per PDF page (I hope that makes sense).</p>

<p>The problem I have is the digital reader app cannot support this and I am at a loss trying to figure out how to split each page.</p>

<p>Any advice?</p>
","<p>@Scott is correct. It sounds like they are sending you full spreads rather than the single page PDFs, and that should be very easy for them to fix. </p>

<p>However, <em>for the ""programmer/designers"" among us</em>, I thought I would share another solution. This requires:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>pdfinfo</code> from <a href=""http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html"" rel=""nofollow"">xpdf</a> to identify the bounding box of the page in points</li>
<li><code>gs</code> from <a href=""http://www.ghostscript.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ghostscript</a> to split the left and right pages</li>
<li><code>pdftk</code> from <a href=""http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/"" rel=""nofollow"">the PDF Toolkit</a> to put the PDF back together again.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once these are all installed and in your PATH, you should be able to do the following.</p>

<p>Imagine you are dealing with a file named <code>Example.pdf</code>. You first run:</p>

<pre><code>pdfinfo -f 1 -l 1000 -box Example.pdf
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you a lot of info about your PDF, including, for each page, the size in points as <code>Page    1 size: 595 x 842 pts (A4)</code>. We need this information for our <code>gs</code> command. Specifically, each <em>page</em> (after being split) is 421 points wide by 595 points high. Since Ghostscript's <code>pdfwrite</code>'s resolution is 720 dpi and 1 inch is 72 points in PDF, we'll multiply those values by 10 in the <code>pdfwrite</code> step below. </p>

<pre><code>gs \
    -o out%03d_A.pdf \
    -sDEVICE=pdfwrite \
    -g4210x5950 \
    -c ""&lt;&lt;/PageOffset [0 0]&gt;&gt; setpagedevice"" \
    -f Example.pdf
gs \
    -o out%03d_B.pdf \
    -sDEVICE=pdfwrite \
    -g4210x5950 \
    -c ""&lt;&lt;/PageOffset [-421 0]&gt;&gt; setpagedevice"" \
    -f Example.pdf
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using Windows, replace the ""<code>\</code>"" with ""<code>^</code>"".</p>

<p>The above commands will create a bunch of files named something like ""out001_A.pdf"", ""out001_B.pdf"" and so on. Notice for the right pages, we use a negative page offset.</p>

<p>Finally, use <code>pdftk</code> to put it all back together again.</p>

<pre><code>pdftk out*_?.pdf cat output combined.pdf
</code></pre>

<p>This worked like a charm for me ;)</p>

In PS I would just use rectangle tool to select the area I want and click copy, however in Illustrator I don't see this same type of functionality.</p>

<p>What would be the easiest way to do this? Example. I have a picture of a snowman, and instead of the entire thing, I just want from the head up.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>Fundamentally this just isn't how Illustrator, or vector applications in general, operate.</p>

<p>Think of vector artwork as pieces of construction paper. You can't simply erase part of a piece of paper. You have to cut it then remove the cut section. This is how you would remove part of an object or group of objects in Illustrator. Features such as the <strong>Pathfinder Panel</strong> and <strong>Shape Builder Tool</strong> can make this ""cutting"" easier. There are a great many tutorials for these features on the web if you search.</p>

<p>One other possible method would be to use a <strong>Clipping Mask</strong> to <em>hide</em> the portion of the art you do not want visible. This is often helpful if the artwork contains many pieces or is very complex and cutting would cause either a change in the overall appearance or be to difficult to perform accurately.</p>

<ul>
<li>Simply draw a shape around the area you want to <em>keep visible</em></li>
<li>Select that shape and the artwork</li>
<li>Choose <code>Object &gt; Clipping Mask &gt; Make</code> from the menu.</li>

<p>I'm not sure if this fits your bill, but one approach is to convert the PANTONE color to CMYK or ditto, which is farily easy (ask if you don't know how). Then, record a macro where you assign this CMYK color to the artwork.</p>

","<p>I did a little research on SVG's and apparently the viewbox is not a element that is exportable via Illustrator. The viewbox element is only compatible with certain programs that chose to use this element or manipulate it. Sadly, Illustrator is not one of them.</p>

<p>If you saved the SVG from Illustrator without ""Preserve Illustrator Editing Capabilities"" you can reverse the process. Whatever changes you make in the data of the SVG file will then be reflected in Illustrator but through repositioning and resizing both the Artboard and Layers to create a pseudo-viewbox.</p>

<p>For now all you can do is design work in Illustrator and all extra code for offset and positioning of the viewbox within the file data. You can make a pseudo-viewbox by simply changing the Artboards Width + Height/X + Y position and then changing the objects Size and Position attributes as well. But there will never be a true viewbox attribute unless they release an update to Illustrator with editable viewbox features.</p>

"How to export to SVG from Illustrator using Artboards","23165","","<p>I am designing some icons. To keep the proportions correct, I designed all the glyphs in one artboard.</p>

<p>Now, I want to experiment a little with SVG icons, so I want to export these icons to different SVG files. How do I go about doing this? </p>

<p>I thought that I'd surround each icon with an artboard, then exporting would be easy... Turns out that the <strong>Export</strong> option has the 'artboards' option, but does not present any workable vector format. The <strong>Save for the Web</strong> also has the artboards option, but again, only offers gif, jpeg and png formats. The <strong>Save-as</strong> option does let me save as SVG, but does not offer any way to save the icons into different files.</p>

<p>Also, I have like 150+ icons, so I can't use artboards anyways (CS6 restricts me to 100 artboards only). So I tried to use slices, but where do I go from there?</p>

<p>Any pointers?</p>
","<p>In Illustrator CC - the <code>Save As</code> dialogue has a <code>Use Artboards</code> checkbox. Checking this will save each artboard as a separate SVG file (don't forget to select SVG format).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: File was handed off from a previous designer and is an embedded smart object within Photoshop and being opened from within Photoshop by double-clicking the vector smart object layer. This results in the file opening in Illustrator.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>Illustrator files as Smart Objects in Photoshop are dependent upon the version of Illustrator they were created in.</p>

<p>For example, if you create an Illustrator document in Illustrator CS4 years ago, then embed it in Photoshop as a smart object. Today you only have Illustrator CC, so when you open the Photoshop file and double-click the vector Smart Object, it opens in Illustrator CC. Then when you save in Illustrator, the <strong>file gets back-saved to the legacy version which created it</strong>, in this case CS4.</p>

<p>There were changes in Illustrator at version CS6 (16) which causes <em>anything</em> using a gaussian blur (glows, shadows, etc) to be expanded when saved to anything prior to CS6. So, if you open the CS4 smart object, apply a drop shadow to live text, then save. The file gets saved to CS4 and since the gaussian blur in CC is not compatible with CS4, the type gets outlined so that appearance is maintained. </p>

<p>The simplest solutions are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the version of Illustrator which created the file originally to edit the smart object.</li>
<li>Re-save the file using <strong>Save As..</strong> as a native Illustrator file for the version you are currently working in, then replace the smart object in Photoshop with this new, updated, vector file.</li>

<p>Is there a anti-aliasing choice that is best to start with (that has the most similar outcome) when planning to have the content live on the web?</p>
","<p>Most operating systems and browsers render with antialiasing or sub-pixel antialiasing. Sub-pixel antialiasing is common on desktop platforms, like Windows (with ClearType) and OS X. Standard monochrome antialiasing is common on mobile platforms, where the device's sub-pixel order may change with device orientation, and where sub-pixel rendering isn't as crucial, because they often have higher pixel density displays.</p>

<p>Aliased text rendering is common on Windows XP, where ClearType is disabled by default. Windows Vista and newer have ClearType turned on by default.</p>

","<ul>
<li><p>JPG is a compressed format. When you place images in Illustrator they are uncompressed. File sizes increase.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not want to use jpg for print production. It would be much better to use a simply .psd file to ensure quality is correct.</p></li>
<li><p>If you re-open a jpg image in something like Photoshop and then re-save that image as a jpg you damage the image quality. This happened each and every time you open a jpg, then save it as a jpg. The quality continually will get worse. You should never open a jpg, then save it as a jpg.</p></li>
<li><p>Illustrator, being a vector application, is resolution independent. The resolution, document raster effects settings, etc. you see within Illustrator refer directly to how Illustrator will handle its own raster content when you ask it to create something like a drop shadow or a glow. It does not refer to placed images. What this means is any placed raster image is placed at its existing Pixels Per Inch (PPI). Illustrator does not alter raster image PPI. Therefore an image with a low PPI will place as a larger file (width and height). And an image with a higher PPI will place as a smaller file (width and height).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Traditionally with print design file sizes (kb) are unimportant. Can I ask why you are eyeballing the file size so closely? It's very, very common for files to increase to hundreds of MB or a few GB in some cases. This is the nature of print design where resolutions need to be much higher than on-screen work. When designing for print, you need to watch image quality and resolutions. Print design should never be about file sizes (kb).</p>

<p>Can you give me some tips for doing that? For this, is it better to work in Photoshop or Illustrator? Thank you!</p>
","<p>If you need to scale images up at the ratio you're describing, it's practically necessary to work with vector images rather than raster images. The main difference is that raster images are made up of pixels, discrete dots of a fixed size, whereas vector images are described by geometric paths.</p>

<p>The essential point is that vector images can be scaled up practically infinitely while retaining smooth edges, but scaling up a raster image increases the size of each individual pixel and produces ""blocky"" effects.</p>

<p>You can read more about the differences here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics</a></p>

<p>Even though Photoshop is meant for working with photos, which by nature are raster images, it has a fairly decent set of vector tools. However, Illustrator is really the preferred tool for working with vector graphics, and probably the one you should be using. Fireworks provides a mix of both toolsets and may be less intimidating than Illustrator if you're just getting started.</p>

<p>One final note. If your final output is for the web, keep the vector file, but export a raster version (most likely a PNG), at the size needed for display on the site. This way you get the maximum quality output, since the vector to raster conversion is happening AT the size required and there is no scaling of the raster image after rasterization. You also preserve the vector file should you need to edit it later. </p>

Usually this doesn't seem to be a problem in print but in a recent proof, I did see some of the issue surfacing there too (albeit not quite as bad). However... Even if it's not as bad in print, it'd be nice to not occur in the PDFs too as these get sent out to customers via email too.</p>

<p>Now I know what people are going to say here... PNGs are a web format and not for print! I agree! I'm slowly converting people over to TIF/PSD here.</p>

<p><strong>The catch here is that I don't get this problem with all of the PNG files.

<p>Why?</p>
","<p><strong>There's a short answer here and that's to use TIF files and your problems will go away...</strong> </p>

<p>But if people would still like to know more, I'll try to explain what's actually happening. It is likely that these files are different since being created in different programs. It doesn't appear that one is ""wrong"" as such (I'll explain that later). It just seems to be a way that PNGs work and how they clash with PDFs. Different programs have different default settings and some must just add a black background. </p>

<p>In Photoshop, using <kbd>Layer > Layer Mask > From Transparency</kbd> we can split the transparency layer off from the image and we see that this particular file has a black background underneath:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Vjs2.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This isn't really that much use to us right now but this reveals the hidden black background in Photoshop (InDesign isn't just imagining it!). The alpha channel (transparency layer) is slipping out of alignment with the rest of the image when embedded into a PDF, causing us to be able to see some of that (usually) hidden black background when viewed on screen. It's unlikely to cause much effect in final print (though as we've seen, there is a little)... It's mostly an on screen issue.</p>

<p>As the hidden black background is already there, copying the image into a new document won't do anything. However we can replace that background with a different colour so when the transparency alpha layer slips, we don't see it as easily. Any colour can go in here but we want to use a colour that isn't contrasting to the image and whatever you're placing it on top of. I've added a flat white layer below the image and masked everything again here:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MHZp8.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Below is a comparison of the different versions. The mystery black background version on the left and modified version with a white background in the middle. You can see how there's far less issues with the white background when the image is so light. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PyNO1.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I mentioned that the hidden black background wasn't exactly wrong... The reason is that if an image with a hidden white background is placed on a dark page, you see a white halo instead as the transparency alpha layer slips:</p>

"How to see the size of your current selection box in Illustrator?","22530","","<p>When making a selection in Photoshop, you get the dimensions of your selection as a tooltip (at least in CC), and it's displayed in the info-box (<code>Window &gt; Info</code>) when enabled. I often use this to measure elements or especially distances between elements. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IOT9o.png"" alt=""Selection dimensions in Photoshop""></p>

<p>Is it possible to enable these dimensions in Illustrator's info-box? </p>
","<p>There's a key difference in the selection processes between Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>

<p>In <strong>Photoshop</strong>, <em>everything</em> is a pixel. The background, whether white, black, colored, or transparent are all pixels. So when you create a selection within Photoshop you are selecting those pixels as well as anything which may be visibly different than the background pixels.</p>

<p>In <strong>Illustrator</strong>, <em>nothing</em> is a pixel. There is no background. Illustrator shows a white page, but if you turn on the transparency grid (<code>View &gt; Show Transparency Grid</code>) you'll see there is nothing there. Since Illustrator is <em>not</em> pixel-based, the transparent or non-existent background is <em>never</em> part of any selection.</p>

<p>How it's different with the cursor.... </p>

<p>In Photoshop the cursor with any of the marquee tools shows you exactly what pixels are being selected. This is because everything is a pixel so everything must be counted in the selection drag. </p>

<p>In Illustrator there are no marquee tools (Lasso Tool doesn't count), so the cursor is merely visually reflecting where you are dragging for reference, but it's never actually selecting the area it's showing as reference. It only selects the objects the cursor touches or which are contained within the drag reference lines. It's not selecting the empty background pixels, because there are no pixels.</p>

<p>The <strong>Info Panel in Photoshop</strong> shows you the width and height of the selection because all those background pixels matter. The <strong>Info Panel in Illustrator</strong> shows you the total dimensions of all selected <em>objects</em> because there are no background pixels.</p>

<p>You can not get Illustrator to show you the width and height of a cursor drag primarily because the size of the cursor drag is largely irrelevant and has no actual correlation to the final selection size.</p>

<p>Ultimately it comes down to the core difference between a pixel-based application such as Photoshop and a vector-based application such as Illustrator. </p>

<p>If you need to know the size of a specific area within Illustrator, just draw a standard rectangle around the area and check the dimensions for that, then you can delete the rectangle. And if you're curious, no. There's no way to convert a rectangle to a selected area within Illustrator other than converting it to an artboard or crop marks.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>The main trick, in my experience, to <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/a/5454/3239"">adding smooth transparency to an image</a> in GIMP is using the <a href=""http://docs.gimp.org/en/plug-in-colortoalpha.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Layer &rarr; Transparency &rarr; Color to Alpha...</em></a> tool.  Of course, you have to know <em>how</em> to use it to good effect &mdash; on its own, all it does is make your images look all funny and translucent.</p>

<p>If I take the image you posted above, and just run <em>Color to Alpha</em> on it (picking white for the transparent color, of course), what I get is this:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4zWUz.png"" alt=""Logo after Color to Alpha""></p>

<p>As you can see, this image looks fine on a light background.  Unfortunately, putting it on a dark background makes the gray elements vanish completely, and the blue parts don't look so great either:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cmBQn.png"" alt=""Logo after Color to Alpha on a black background""></p>

<p>The problem is that the <em>Color to Alpha</em> tool did what it was supposed to do: it converted <em>all</em> the white in the original image into transparency.  This means that the gray lines became semi-transparent <em>black</em> lines, and the light blue became semi-transparent dark blue.</p>

<p>What we really <em>want</em>, however, is presumably that the basic colors of the text and the other elements of the logo should stay opaque, and only the anti-aliased pixels around their edges should become semi-transparent.  To fix this, we need to add some white back into the colors.
One way to achieve that, for an image like this where the opaque areas consist mostly of single colors, is this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Duplicate the layer.</p></li>
<li><p>On the lower layer, convert the transparency to a mask by doing  <em>Layer &rarr; Mask &rarr; Add Layer Mask...</em> and selecting ""Transfer layer's alpha channel"".</p></li>
<li><p>After transferring the transparency to a mask, make the lower layer completely white (e.g. using the Bucket Fill tool in ""Fill whole selection"" mode).</p></li>
<li><p>You've now added <em>some</em> white to all the colors of the image, but the interiors of the letters and figures still aren't completely opaque.  To make them so, we need to normalize the mask on the lower layer &mdash; but, since the different parts of the image have different colors and lightnesses, we need to do it separately for each part.  <p>To do that, click on the mask of the lower layer in the Layers dialog to edit it, use the Rectangle Select tool to select each distinct part of the image (the ""B"", the ""NANO"" and the drawing above them) in turn, and run <em>Colors &rarr; Auto &rarr; Normalize</em> on each selection.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>After doing all that (and optionally merging the layers), the result should look like this:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MdYi0.png"" alt=""Logo after restoring white to opaque parts""></p>

<p>If you compare this with the first image above, there's almost no difference to be seen.  But see what happens when we put it on a black background:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qA9Ng.png"" alt=""Logo after restoring white to opaque parts, black background""></p>

<p>Now the colors look opaque, but the background is still transparent and the edges are smooth.</p>

<p>Unfrotunately, you can also see some gray fringing around the letters, especially the ""B"".  I suspect this is mostly because the original JPEG image already suffered from chroma loss in those areas due to lossy compression, it just wasn't so apparent on a white background.  There are two ways (that I know of) to try to fix that: you can either manually adjust the mask color levels on the white layer to reduce the fringing, <em>or</em> you can try sampling the solid colors from the letters in the original image and replacing the white on the lower layer white those solid colors (Rectangle Select, Bucket Fill).  Or you can even try both.</p>

<p>However, <em>all</em> this is really something you should only try if you have no other choice.  A <em>much</em> better solution is to try and find the original vector (AI, SVG, EPS, PDF, etc.) files from which these logos were surely rendered &mdash; they should have full transparency information, be free of compression artifacts, and be scalable too!  Only if it's really impossible to obtain the originals should you even consider working from low-resolution JPEG files like these.</p>

<p>Also, even if you do end up using the bitmaps, you could still get a much cleaner result by redrawing some of the elements &mdash; in particular the text, which seems to be simple <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copperplate_Gothic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Copperplate</a>.</p>

I have to find the file and rename it before it will work. This is a major speed-bump.</p>
","<p>If you use slices in Illustrator, rather than artboards, you can specify exact file names for the export. Just set up a big single artboard and add all your elements as if you were building a sprite sheet, then use Save for Web to export everything in one pass.</p>

<p>Some other reasons to use slices over artboards:</p>

<li>Slices snap to the pixel grid. Artboards don't.</li>
<li>You can only have 100 artboards in a document. Slices don't have that limit.</li>

<p>For file renaming, I usually set up Automator workflows. You could even set up Automator workflows on a per project basis, so renaming and moving can happen with a single click, or even a folder action. In fact, you could probably add it as a build phase in Xcode?</p>

<p>I assume you'll need to rename your @2x files anyway, unless you have the artwork in Illustrator at both sizes?</p>

<p>Also, I'd be a little careful when using Illustrator for UI design work. Its shape antialiasing has some issues, and gradients can't be dithered. This means your artwork can be considerably lower standard than if you'd created it in Photoshop or Fireworks.</p>

"What is so good about Helvetica?","21747","","<p>For as long as I have known, a majority of designers have been beyond enamoured with Helvetica. While I can see that it's a nice typeface, I really don't understand the hype.</p>

<p>Some research into the matter yields some arguments: Helvetica is neutral, well-glyphed (as in: it has lots of glyphs and has been issued in eg. Cyrillic) and has been in use for long.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/01/the-simplicity-of-helvetica/"">this article</a>, Helvetica has become associated with business culture and is a 'safe' choice.</p>

<p>These arguments don't convince me of Helvetica's superiority. Why is Helvetica so good? Is it objectively better than any other neutral, well-glyphed and not too young a sans serif typeface? I know it's way better than Arial, but is it better than Futura, Frutiger or Myriad? And if so, why?</p>

<p>I understand that this question is at least partially opinion-based, so I'd like to point out that I'm looking for <em>objective</em> answers here. I'd like to be swayed with some proof, not with feels.</p>
","<p>Typefaces become popular for a number of reasons, partly technology (which often drives fashion -- ""Because I can"" is a more potent driver than most people realize), partly the cultural milieu within which they fit and become associated, partly the mood they invoke (or don't). The grotesks in general arrived on the typographic scene at a time when Western culture was rejecting the ornate styles of the late 19th Century across all fields of design, including architecture and fashion. If you wanted to look modern, simplicity was the watchword.</p>

<p>Helvetica is tremendously <em>precise</em>, as befits a Swiss-made typeface, and is in many ways the ultimate expression of the grotesk style. Precision is terrific in the context of corporate communications, word marks and logotypes, much in the way that Greek columns and massive stonework are useful in the context of bank and government architecture. -- It sends a message. Precision conveys dependability, a conservative culture, authority, control; so the association with corporate identities, in hindsight, was probably inevitable.</p>

<p>This precision is much of what designers love about Helvetica, and also much of what they hate, because with precision comes inflexibility. Helvetica doesn't take kindly to tweaking. </p>

<p>An example from a different era might help put things in context. Neo-classical architecture and design gained tremendous popularity 18th Century for its symmetry and serene harmony. It was also part of a cultural rejection of over-ornate design (Rococo), founded in the rediscovery of the proportionality and harmony of ancient Greek buildings. It eventually fell out of favor, ironically, for the same reason: a Robert Adam dining room was so exactly proportioned and symmetrical that there was no way to modify it without ""breaking"" it. You couldn't change a chair, a rug, or the position of a table, without things looking uncomfortably out of place.</p>

<p>Another chapter in the Helvetica story came with the first Apple laser printer and Adobe Postscript. Helvetica and Times Roman were the very first licensed, digitized typefaces. Postscript hinting made them look good at the low 300 dpi resolution available at the time. They were ""free,"" since they came with the hardware, which conventional type certainly was not. Designers took to DTP like ducks to water, and brought Helvetica with them.</p>

<p>In pre-DTP days, other large sans-serif type families such as Univers were just as popular as Helvetica for corporate work. Once DTP took off, however, Helvetica had a definite edge.</p>

<p>The size of the family -- the number of available weights and widths -- is also a factor in the choice of a typeface for a corporate identity, because it allows text to speak with many voices without breaking harmony. As a designer, I always try to err on the side of too large a family rather than too small when I'm choosing a typeface, if it's one that will be used in a large range of contexts over a long period of time. Myriad and Futura are also large families, and I use both, but the mega-families are even larger.</p>

<p>@bemdesign's answer is spot on. Whether Helvetica is good or bad for a particular project depends on the project. It is dry, passionless and, in most weights, severe. It's notable that Apple's corporate face is Myriad, for all that they liberally sprinkle Helvetica across their product line.</p>

"Why doesn't size/resolution in InDesign match the PDF?","21706","","<p>I am working in InDesign and I need to create a PDF file. The problem is that if I have a 200x200px box in InDesign and when I save it as PDF the box appears larger.</p>

<p>I am a bit confused about InDesign because it has no resolution settings, I am saving the PDF with 96ppi and my Adobe Reader has the same view settings (96ppi).</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
","<p>The key to understanding InDesign's pixel-based RGB document modes is that ID ""thinks"" 1px=1pt. Acrobat, it turns out, wouldn't know a pixel if it met one at a birthday party; it only understands points, inches, millimeters, etc. So you can get into quite a tangle with it.</p>

<p>Be aware that the ""96ppi"" you're selecting in the Interactive PDF output applies ONLY to images within the document, <em>not</em> the document as a whole.</p>

<p>InDesign is locked into 72 points = 1 inch = 72 pixels. The only ways to get a target pixel dimension are to export at 72 ppi or do some math beforehand. Your 30px square in ID, exported at 96ppi, ends up at 96/72 x 30 (4/3 x 30) pixels. This applies to any raster (jpeg, swf) export: you will only get a 1:1 pixel correspondence if you export at 72 ppi.</p>

<p>Problem solved, right? Well, no. It turns out there's another strange dimension to this. Acrobat, as mentioned, doesn't know from pixels. It translates everything you throw at it into linear units. It throws away ""pixels per"" and retains only ""inch"" or ""mm."" But <em>then makes its own decision about how many pixels that is</em>. In other words, as I was somewhat chagrined to discover, it utterly ignores InDesign CS5's pixel dimensions. (The Acrobat engineering team seems to live in splendid isolation, paying no attention at all to anything else going on at Adobe. It's been an annoyance for years.)</p>

<p>So, either change your PDF document resolution to 72 ppi (in Acrobat, <code>Preferences &gt; Page Display</code> and set a Custom Resolution of 72 pixels/inch), or, if you don't want to do that, use this workaround:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Set up your InDesign document at the pixel width <code>A</code> you want to end up with.</p></li>
<li><p>Export to PDF and measure the result <code>B</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Divide A by B to give you a scaling factor <code>S</code>. (Copy to the clipboard, ideally.)</p></li>
<li><p>In InDesign, go to <code>File &gt; Document Setup</code> and in the width field, after what is already there, add <code>*0.65656565</code> (or whatever <code>S</code> was). Tab to the height field and do the same.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Your document will now export to PDF at your original target pixel dimensions, and the elements within it will also be correct. Be sure to change the document properties so that the Initial View is ""100%"".</p>

"What is the exact role/relationship of photoshop in web design?","21657","","<p>I'm confused about the relationship of Photoshop (and any other image processing software) in web designing. I can see countless tutorials anywhere teaching on how to make web layouts from scratch, and most of them include the whole contents of a real web page. But it <em>stops</em> there. No further instructions are included on how to implement the designs as a real web page/site (aside from those slice-n-dice approach which I know that you treat as a thing of the past.) </p>

<p>I'm sure my question isn't open-ended since I will list more definite questions here.</p>

<p>My assumptions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Photoshop is intended to be only used for logos, banners, etc. to be
export exactly to web pages.</li>
<li>Creating web layouts using Photoshop is used only as a <em>mock-up</em> of 
the real site (only a guide?)</li>
<li>After finishing constructing it, you should implement the design by
hand-coding them using CSS, HTML, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>If all of my assumptions are correct, my most important questions are: </p>

<p>Why are people fond of creating web layouts using Ps if they cannot build it into a real site (I'm referring to those who <em>can't</em> code.)? I can see that their designs are too detailed that it would seem impossible to make it using tools/frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap and JQuery UI (afaik).</p>

<p>PS:(<em>Post Scriptum</em> not the other one) 
I am originally a student of programming and have no idea about how you do web graphics design.
Also, I don't want to argue about using Illustrator or Frameworks(phased out by Adobe) instead. </p>
","<p>Anymore, Photoshop, Illustrator, et. al. are used for supporting web assets and not for full page/site mock ups.</p>

<p>Yes, there are some people who still build entire page mockup using Photoshop. And in reality if a site is very custom-image based then it may be necessary. But there's traditionally no slicing taking place anymore. </p>

<p>There are also developers who do not want designers doing <em>any</em> coding whatsoever. So they merely want a layered file so they can deconstruct it and build the code themselves. I do occasionally run into these types of developers, but they are becoming more rare in my work.</p>

<p>There's really no blanket answer for your question. In the end, it depends upon specific people and their desired workflow. All I can tell you is how I use image editing apps now compared to 10 years ago. </p>

<p>There was a time when one would build an entire page in Photoshop, slice it up, then export the slices in order to reconstruct them in HTML. This was before CSS2 (and especially CSS3) was widely supported. At that time, it was almost mandatory to do things this way because you often needed a gradient, a round corner, or a small shadow which could not easily be created otherwise. Before CSS2 was supported ANYTHING other than standard borders and background colors required an image, often a repeating image tile. There was simply no way to code a round corner without using images for the corners, same held true with gradients an shadows. If you look at web sites today, note how many gradients shadows and round corners are used. Those would have had to all be images 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Today, much of what used to be an image or slice can be handled via CSS. I no longer need round corners, gradients, or shadows for anything. Therefore I don't need to slice up a page to generate those tiny assets. I only need image editing software to create things which either can not be created via CSS such as logos, patterns, photographs, thumbnails, etc. or for assets which shouldn't feasibly be created with CSS in order to ensure proper display across browsers - things like some buttons or special image effects.</p>

<p>In reality there's very little one can't create with CSS3 anymore. The only hurdle becomes fallback for older browsers or actual photos/artwork. Images may still be required to support older browsers (mostly IE) but often you can allow CSS to degrade to a workable state.</p>

<p>10 years ago a web site design started with pen and paper for sketching ideas, moved to Photoshop/Illustrator for comps. Then stayed with Photohop/Illustrator for complete design approval, then moved to construction to mimic the image layout.</p>

<p>Today, my web site designs start with pen and paper for sketching, then move straight to HTML/CSS mock ups. I open logos or images in the appropriate app and export/save for web and apply the image to the HTML/CSS mockup. I will, at times, create patterns and some specific page areas in an image editing app merely to test some variations side by side. But these are more for my design exploration than actual construction. Mocking up directly in code offers <strong>many</strong> advantages. Text  is live HTML text no more clients with the ""That text looks different than the design I approved"" comments. Color variations can be created in seconds with well constructed CSS. Layout alterations take minutes compared to hours if going back to Photoshop, editing, then regenerating slices and code.</p>

<p>Image editing software has shifted from being a building tool to a supporting tool merely due to the advances in the markup languages - primarily with Cascading Style Sheets and browser support for them. HTML is still HTML in general. jQuery et. al. has added interactivity, but not really altered layout. It's CSS which has come a long, long, way and reduced the need for full image mock ups.</p>

<p>And for the record, I tend to jump to Illustrator first for assets. Then may use Photoshop if needed or for actual photographs.</p>

"How can I include a Photoshop file inside another Photoshop file?","21648","","<p>If one was designing a website where they laid out each page mock as a separate photoshop file but each one had the common elements of the site such as the header and footer, but also could have common elements like buttons—is it possible to design the button in one photoshop file in its own and then include it inside a page mock file.

<p><strong>How can this be achieved?</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/e31Kp.jpg"" alt=""long exposure light trails""> </p>
","<p>Per the asker's request, here's a solution that can be done in Illustrator:</p>

<p>First place the picture in Illustrator and lock that layer. Then, with the pen tool make paths that are similar in shape to what you are looking for.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/98BZw.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>After you've made a few, you can star picking the colors you need. Unlock the layer with the picture, lock and hide the layer with the stroked you made and choose a color on the light path. Save these colors to your swatches and relock the picture, unhide and unlock the paths.</p>

<p>Select the paths. Make sure you have stroke color selected and select gradient (the middle button underneath the stroke and fill selectors)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/K2qAB.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now, select each path individually and open your gradient tool. Make sure you put the color mode in RGB (I think it defaults to Greyscale) by clicking the dropdown in the upper right of the tool window and select RGB. Now select the fist color in the gradient tool and change it to the colors you saves to your swatches and start adjusting where they need to go on the slider. You may have to click the reverse button above it if your colors are backwards on the stroke.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cZ7UH.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Once you have as many as you want, you can thin out the stroke thickness if they seemed too much. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/97KkQ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You should have something similar which you can then copy into Photoshop and create some glow effects and shadowing or anything else that Illustrator doesn't do as well as Photoshop.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cCinu.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Keep in mind that the pen tool which I used in this tutorial has a steep learning curve so it will take a lot of practice to get the lines right if you've never used the tool before. I suggest watching a few tutorials on YouTube before starting, just as a primer.</p>

<p>You will propably want to adjust the dither options in case the palette you are using doesn't fully support the given image. Options are diffusion, pattern and noise. In the previous picture we were using Diffusion. Here is Pattern:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dYfvi.jpg"" alt=""Dither options picture 1 of 2.""></p>

<p>Here is the last option, Noise. I'll stick with this, just because the gradient pleases me the most. If you have a lot of pictures where obvious dithering happens, you might want to keep the same option for the same project for the sake of consistency, but that's up to you.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/apcad.jpg"" alt=""Dither options picture 2 of 2""></p>

<p>Ok, the crime has happened now. The decisions were made and here are the results.

<p>Similar to Joonas' comment...</p>

<p><strong><code>Layer &gt; New Adjustment Layer &gt; Channel Mixer</code></strong> Then simply pick a color channel from the Output Channel drop down and change it's values below with the fields/sliders.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0SsFr.png"" alt=""Mixer""></p>

<p>To swap red and green, set red to 0 and green to +100 for the red Output channel and set red to +100 and green to 0 for the Green Output Channel.</p>

<p>You can configure this then save the setting as an option for quick access in the future.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3LQ6m.jpg"" alt=""save settings""></p>

<p>This may seem more complicated, but it's really not. It is simply more versatile. If you want immediate jumps to channel swaps simply save the mixer presets and the immediate jumps are there. But if you want only slight alterations, that's possible as well.</p>

<p>Just as Joonas suggests... <strong><code>Layer &gt; New Adjustment layer &gt; Hue/Saturation</code></strong> You can then simply tick the ""Colorize"" option and then play with the Hue Slider.</p>

<p>Yes in general. Adding color to a greyscale image is always easier than trying to adjust color in a color image.</p>

"Stylus not working correctly on an Android tablet - typical for low price general purpose equipment?","21267","","<p>A while ago i bought an Android tablet, intending to use it as a web browser, ebook reader etc. I kinda liked the idea of being able to doodle on it for fun, so i bought a cheap stylus.</p>

<p>But here's my problem - the stylus ""skipps"". Its hard to start a start a line with it, and when i finnally do, it doesnt go smoothly, it leaves really big gaps. Its making the stylus totally useless, cause i dont need it for the typical usage of the tablet.</p>

<p>While testing the stylus on normal apps, i concluded that even tho sometimes it doesnt tap/drag the way i want to (enough to be very irritating!) it seems to work better than in SketchBook.</p>

<p>The sketchBook and tablet work absolutely fine when handled with a finger (its <strong>very</strong> rare for the tablet to not notice a tap, and all lines i draw go smooth) - but drawing whith my hands aint exactly accurate or comfortable. </p>

<p>Now, both the tablet were really cheap, the 4$ kind of stylus and 80$ tablet (Android 4.03, ~1Ghz, 512mb RAM) The tablet is [http://www.manta.com.pl/en/mid08/], the stylus is a noname from a company named 4World.</p>

<p>I searched the net, but didnt find anyone having similar problems with mid 08 tablets (probably thats because its a local-market product and theres hardly anything about it on the web)</p>

<p>In your experience, <strong>is this typical for low-price not graphic-design-intended equipment?</strong> Are there some typical solutions for such problems? </p>

<p>I checked better equipment and i found this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Compatibility    Compatible with all media tablets using capacitive
  touch technology</p>
  
  <p>Tested devices: </p>
  
  <p>iPad</p>

<p>so maybe this is a tablet issue, and buying a better stylus wont help, so i should just give up on drawing and doodling on my tablet?</p>

<p>Im <strong>not</strong> asking for technical or hardware advice per se. I would just like to know is there a technical issue that needs to be fixed, or is it normal for low price equipment and the hardware guys cant help me anyhow.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
Ive got my hands and stylus on a Nexus 7 tablet. Drawing worked perfectly fine with my stylus. Maybe not the cheapest equipment, but perfect for doodling and thumbnail work in Sketchook for Android on the bus. My problems must have had their root cause in the quality of my tablet. Ill probably get myself a better tablet</p>
","<p>Interpretting the question, based on the comments, as being:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can I make a cheap Android tablet work like a mobile, cheap wacom cintiq? I tried an $80 tablet with a capacitive stylus and it doesn't work very well. Is this how it should be or is this a defect?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We're not going to be qualified to tell you if your tablet is defective... but we can tell you that there is always going to be a world of difference between:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A stylus used on a touch screen designed for fingers (a '<strong>capacative stylus</strong>'). These are literally just sticks of plastic with a tip shaped to have a similar area to the fingertips that capacative touchscreens are designed for. If you pay extra for a premium one (e.g. the 'Wacom bamboo stylus', which is a plastic stick with a Wacom logo on it), you get a better weighted stick of plastic with a tip of a material that has a nice amount of friction. That's it. They're sticks, some of which are a bit nicer to hold than others.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>digitizer tablet</strong> that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacom#Technology"" rel=""nofollow"">works using an electromagnetic resonance field</a> to detect the exact position of a pen, even when it's not in contact with a screen, and communicates the exact amount of pressure applied when it does come into contact with the screen. </p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>""In send mode, the tablet generates a close-coupled electromagnetic field (also known as a B-field) at a frequency of 531 kHz. This close-coupled field stimulates oscillation in the pen's coil/capacitor (LC) circuit when brought into range of the B-field. Any excess resonant electromagnetic energy is reflected back to the tablet. In receive mode, the energy of the resonant circuit’s oscillations in the pen is detected by the tablet's grid. This information is analyzed by the computer to determine the pen's position, by interpolation and Fourier analysis of the signal intensity... up to 200 times per second""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's in a whole different league to a plastic stick with a finger-shaped tip. </p>

<p>Be aware that many people (including most technology ""journalists"") are unaware of this distinction between these two types of pen/stylus. </p>

<p>A few notes on digitizer tablets:</p>

<ul>
<li>Latest generation Wacom Cintiq and Intuous tablets also communicate data about the exact rotation and angle the pen is held at.</li>
<li>Older technology wacom digitizers, like Bamboo tablets, or wacom Tablet PC digitizers like those in the 'S-pen' of the Samsung Galaxy Note range* and those in a few Windows tablets (and probably a lot of upcoming Windows 8 tablets) work the same basic way, but don't have those advanced features and are very slightly less accurate. </li>
<li>Some tablet PCs, android tablets, etc use cheaper digitizer tablets by other companies. Look for side-by-side Youtube videos before buying, some of these are diabolically bad. I saw a video of an n-trig one and it was painful to watch. That said, Wacom's patent has now expired, which might mean that some of their competitors start getting good.</li>
</ul>

<p>And don't forget that, <em>within</em> the range of capactive ('finger-prodding') screens, there's a whole range of quality. The cheapest will be just about responsive enough to figure out what web link was prodded, the best will be carefully designed and tested to figure out smoothly where the middle of the fingertip is likely to be and to follow gestures and movements smoothly. But the specifics of where some specific $80 tablet lies on that spectrum is a whole different question and one that only Android / mobile device experts would be placed to answer.</p>

<hr>

<p>*<em>Galaxy Note range currently consists of: 1st gen giant phone, 1st gen tablet, 2nd gen giant phone. The 2nd gen galaxy notes are the only things I'm aware of in Android that (optionally) show the pen's position when it's not in contact with the screen, like Cintiqs and regular graphics tablets do. This is good for accuracy.</em></p>

<p>The client wants the final file to be ""a PDF at 300 dpi"".</p>

<p>I have an image (3300 x 2550 pixels @ 300 dpi) in Photoshop.  (11"" x 8.5"" canvas)</p>

<p>It seems that no matter which method or setting, my PDF is always saved at 72 dpi because the PDF ends up at 792 x 612 pixels every single time.</p>

<p>I even saved it as a TIFF (3300 x 2550 @ 300 dpi) and opened in GraphicConvertor, then saved as a PDF.  Same problem... the PDF is only 72 dpi (792 x 612 pixels).</p>

<p>So how can I get the final PDF size to be 3300 x 2550 pixels @ 300 dpi?</p>
","<p><strong>Original File:</strong>  3300 x 2550 pixels @ 300 dpi (11 x 8.5 inches)</p>

<p>Now I believe that my conclusions based on observations were incorrect.</p>

<p>1) In Mac OS X.4.11, ""Get Info"" on the PDF simply shows ""792 x 612"" without units.  (<em>In pixels, compared to my original, this would calculate to be 72 dpi</em>).</p>

<p>2) In Mac OS X.6.8, ""Get Info"" on the PDF shows no dimensions.  In the Preview App (Menu > Tools > Show Inspector), it shows 792 x 612 <strong>points</strong> and 11 x 8.5 inches.  There is nothing about ""dpi"" here.</p>

<p>So this is why I posted the question here.  It <em>appeared</em> as if all PDF were being converted to 72 dpi no matter how I saved them.</p>

<hr>

<p>Then I opened the suspect PDF in Acrobat Pro.</p>

<p><em>Menu > File > Properties > Description tab</em> shows a page size of 11 x 8.5 inches.  Nothing else listed there regarding pixel or point size.  Also, there is nothing there about dpi.  </p>

<p>However, there is a button labeled <em>""Additional Metadata""</em>.  Under the item called <em>""Camera Data 2""</em>, there it is: <code>Pixel Dimension X: 3300, Y: 2550</code>, <code>Resolution X: 300, Y:300</code>, and <code>Resolution Unit: Inch</code>.</p>

<p>So it appears that these PDF's are not 72 dpi after all.</p>

<p>Yes, I realize <strong>pixels</strong> are not the same as <strong>points</strong>.  My confusion was caused by how the information is presented by the Mac OS (Get Info, Preview, etc.) when inspecting the PDF files.  You'd think the pixel dimensions and dpi would be prominently displayed as it is for image files.</p>

"What's the point of converting RGB images to CMYK TIF/TIFF before placing them in InDesign?","21107","","<p>Currently we receive CMYK TIF/TIFF images of photographs from our design agency (who get them from the photographer). Our in-house designers then place them in InDesign for posters and magazines, or convert them to RGB to be used on the website or in newsletters or presentations.</p>

<p>I'm wondering what's the point of taking a photograph, then converting it to a CMYK TIF/TIFF (with HUGE filesize) before placing it in InDesign, and maybe converting it back to RGB for screen-use?
I mean, the photograph is RGB anyway, and InDesign can use colour profiles too. So, if InDesign is assigned the correct profile (from the printing press) why convert the images to CMYK beforehand? Wouldn't it be a much wiser choice to save the retouched images as PNG (which is lossless)? The print designer would then place the image in InDesign and then, when the document is done, export to CMYK using the correct profile. Whereas the web designer would take the image, resize it into the correct format and save it as a JPG.</p>

<p>Advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Immensely reduced file sizes</li>
<li>One conversion less</li>
<li>On-screen viewing can be done by anyone without them getting off colours because their viewer doesn't support CMYK</li>
<li>8-bit transparency</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I'm not entirely sure if our design agency actually uses the press profile our printers use because the agency is in a completely different country.</p>

<p>Am I missing something crucial here?</p>
","<p>No, you aren't missing something. There is no point at all in converting images to CMYK, and several good reasons NOT to. Converting images to flattened CMYK tiff is an old QuarkXpress workflow that is a complete waste of time today, especially with InDesign.</p>

<p>What is a good idea is to size images in Photoshop before final output, to reduce file size and for maximum control.</p>

<p>If you are placing CMYK images, be certain that InDesign preferences are set so embedded color profiles are retained, otherwise you can get undesirable color shifts on PDF export. Indesign handles conversion to the destination color space at export.</p>

","<p>I figured it out, so I am sharing...</p>

<p>First turn off ""Allow Document Pages to Shuffle"", and add as many pages together as you want (they will be aligning horizontally). Then go to the Page Tool and on the panel on top where there are some setting for this tool, click on ""Objects Move with Pages"" then drag the pages. It behaves like the artboards in Illustrator. You can move the pages apart so there is space between them, or you can move them on top of each other so you get pages aligning vertically. </p>

"What do I do when I quote a price for a design but the client keeps asking for revisions and redesigns?","21018","","<p>I'm a freelance graphic designer, so mostly, my pricing and what not is pretty casual and I don't work 24/7 as I have other things to take care of, so when I quote someone, I figure out how long it will take me roughly and also take into account how difficult it might be. I give them the price, get a deposit and start work. I usually tell them that the odd revision or two is included.</p>

<p>BUT...</p>

<p>In the situation that I'm asking about, I always seem to get people who are really specific on what they want, which is brilliant; it seems nice and simple and I know exactly what I'm doing. But then as the job progresses and I send them samples, they begin to change their mind, they request way more revisions/redesigns that I ever expected etc. Now, I'm fine with this, as obviously I'm happy to work with them until they are happy with their product but when I mention that it's been more work than they initially stated they almost always get angry and lash out (via email) at how I'm not holding up my end of the bargain. </p>

<p>I always feel awful asking for more money and I almost never get more/they cancel altogether and I'm left with nothing, usually not even the (tiny) deposit that I stated was non refundable (to protect myself from exactly this...)</p>

<p>What is the best way of wording something (<em>anything</em>) initially, whereby this might not happen as much. Or am I just being too polite?</p>
","<p>Stefan has several excellent points, which I'll echo and expand upon:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write up a contract. You don't start <em>anything</em> without a contract.
It took me over a week to write my first contract, but that baby is
as detailed and iron-clad as I could make it, and now I can
slice-and-dice and adapt it to future jobs. The AIGA has a ridiculously detailed sample contract you can use to start with: <a href=""http://www.aiga.org/standard-agreement/"">http://www.aiga.org/standard-agreement/</a></li>
<li>In that contract you spell out precisely what you are doing for the
client. Be repetitive to the point where you feel silly, because it
will save your butt later.</li>
<li>As part of that contract, you specify what amount of money is due
when: deposit of $X or Y%, $X or Y% upon Milepost 1, $X or Y% upon
Milepost 2, remaining $X or last 10% when client signs off on final
product. You want to leave a little at the end so that the client
feels like they can still command your attention, but not so much
that if you had to walk away it would ruin your bank account. I like
10% as my wiggle room.</li>
<li>You include N rounds of revisions. (I usually have three.) You
specify ""after N rounds of revisions, any additional revisions will
be billed at $X per hour."" That gives them warning right up front
that if they want to go 'round the mulberry bush, you'll be happy to
accommodate them, but they'll be paying for it.</li>
<li>As part of this process, when they send you the first revision, you     IMMEDIATELY respond with, ""Thank you, I am in receipt of your email     with blah blah revision. Per our contract, this is the first round of
revisions to this project."" Now, it's up to you what constitutes ""a round of revisions."" It can be ""one large design change,"" it can be     ""one hour of little revisions over and over,"" whatever. But have an     idea in mind BEFORE you open the file.</li>
<li>You do the same with the second round. At the third round, you
respond, ""I just want to remind you before I start that this is your
last round of revisions allotted in our contract. After this,
subsequent changes will be billed on a per-hour basis and invoiced
[weekly].""</li>
<li>Include a Kill Fee or a cancellation fee. The idea is that you always get paid for your time and effort, no matter where they stop in the process. You can pro-rate it to an hourly cost from the last pay milestone to the cancellation point. That will also give them pause.</li>
<li>Don't be shy about asking for money. If you're a professional, act
like one. Would your plumber be shy about sending you a bill? You are
a professional providing a service. It's not your fault if they don't
like the service; you still had to do the work. Of course you want
them to be happy, but you also need to pay your grocery bill.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, don't do more work than you agreed to before they agree to pay you for it. When you're reaching your estimate, STOP and tell them so. </p>

"How to attribute, give credit to creative commons/copyleft/public domain content for web/print?","20966","","<p><strong>Edit:</strong> </p>

<p>To be extremely succinct: <h3>How to credit imagery used on a business card or ballpoint pen?</h3></p>

<hr>

<hr>

<p>Inspired by <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/27395/is-it-necessary-to-attribute-creative-commons-licensed-art""><strong>this question,</strong></a> I started to think:</p>

<p><strong>How do you attribute and give credit, when you use images and resources that are Creative Commons, copyleft; are in the public domain or have variation of ""free"" licensing?</strong> </p>

<p>(Some of the answers to the above questions grazes that question but it is not really the main issue in that question).</p>

<p>How do you attribute - say -: </p>

<ul>
<li>a background tiled image for web?</li>
<li>a background tiled image for print?</li>
</ul>

<p>(the point here being tiny-weeny images)</p>

<ul>
<li>an icon set web?</li>
<li>an icon set print?</li>
<li>To make it more fiddly: tiny images you might use for t-shirts,
printed objects such as ballpoint pens, t-shirts, keyrings,
letterheads?</li>
</ul>

<p>For web; there seems to be divided between those who think that in the source code is fine and those who do not. For web you could make a link somewhere discreet that says ""credits"". This does not really work for print. If you enthusiastically stand on the shoulders of giants, and use what is legally yours to use, your printed leaflet would be bogged down in 6point text attributions. </p>

<p>(Yes, there are differences between countries; I am asking on a general note.)</p>

<p><hr>
<strong>Edit:</strong> I could add GNU licenses, but that is usually pretty straightforward, as it is mainly concerned with software, code, programming snippets, digital programmable objects etc. </p>
","<p>For a business card, my recommendation would be</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a URL-shortening service to create a short url for the webpage that is hosting the original graphic with full attribution.</li>
<li>Use small print on the card to give the short url with the credit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DqBQc.png"" alt=""Sample business card with fine-print attribution link""></p>

<p>If you have room, you might want to include the creator's name as well as the link.  You also might want to include the creative commons logo or CC-BY shorthand. It only adds a few characters and checks off another requirement of the licence.</p>

<p>More verbose example:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f1Nze.png"" alt=""Sample business card with more complete fine-print attribution""></p>

<p>As others have said, if you're not willing to put minimum credit on the printed product, don't use CC-BY content.</p>

<p>For an <em>extra</em> tiny printed product, like a pen, it of course gets extra tricky to find room for a credit line.  If the pen includes the URL of your <em>client's</em> website, and that website uses the same logo with clear and complete attribution and copyright information, I would probably consider that acceptable.  </p>

<p>That said, it is a waffle zone.  The example above on its own certainly doesn't meet the full requirements of ""attribution"" spelled out by the <a href=""http://wiki.creativecommons.org/License_Versions#Detailed_attribution_comparison_chart"">CC-BY licence</a>.  However, the CC licences specify that <strong>attribution should be ""reasonable to the means, medium, and context of use"",</strong> and so when space is at a premium a link to a page with the full copyright information would probably be considered reasonable.  <em>(But I'm not a copyright lawyer!)</em></p>

<p>In that way, CC is a more flexible than other licences which were drafted specifically for software and which therefore make assumptions about the medium by which something will be copied.  For example, the icon above* is <a href=""http://codepen.io/AmeliaBR/full/xkynl"">available as part of a public CodePen ""pen""</a>, and is therefore <a href=""http://blog.codepen.io/legal/licensing/"">released under the MIT software license</a>.  The MIT licence requires all ""copies"" to include the copyright and licensing information, with no stipulations about reasonableness to the medium.  </p>

"Best Adobe product for web designing?","20839","","<p>I've been using Photoshop for the last 2 years to create mockups for my sites, but the biggest problem I find with Photoshop is its terrible way of rendering text in a <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/7909/how-can-i-make-my-photoshop-fonts-appear-like-they-do-on-the-web"">web-realistic way</a>.</p>

<p>Is there an Adobe product that is better suited for web designing (i.e. creating mockups of sites)?</p>
","<p>It depends on your own personal style / processes more than anything, and what you're going to do with the designs afterwards. A lot of people need photoshop because they cut slices out of it afterwards, other people who hand code every piece of css and don't use slices, images, sprites etc might find a piece of paper and a pencil just as suitable. Personally, I've long used Adobe Illustrator to create all of my web designs as I hand code everything from scratch once a clients accepted a visual proof, but with the new CSS output function in Illustrator it's even more useful! There are a lot of different tools you can use but I'll list a few of Adobe's best below:</p>

<p><strong>Illustrator:</strong> As stated above, Illustrator is my personal choice and it's becoming more and more popular amongst web designers for it's rapid design style and it's outstanding new web design based features. Adobe has a great article with a video guide and some sample files <a href=""https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/export-css.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> that show's you some of Illustrators best web design features.</p>

<p><strong>Photoshop:</strong> Photoshop's been the Web Designers software of choice for longer than I can remember, and although it's finally started to fall behind some of it's siblings as web design has evolved over recent years, it's still got some great features and can be very useful to web designers who know how to use it. Another great article from Adobe with some of Photoshop's latest web design features can be found <a href=""http://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/copy-css-shape-or-text.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Dreamweaver / Muse / Edge:</strong> I'm lumping these one's together because they make up the suite of WYSIWIG / Rapid Development software that's filling up Adobe's lineup of late. Edge itself is actually a combination of several software items like Edge Animate for creating web based motion graphics out of HTML/CSS/Javascript/SVG elements and Edge Reflow for creating responsive web designs on the fly. Muse is more and more becoming Adobe's flagship web design software and a lot of the key features are listed <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/nz/products/muse.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, where as Dreamweaver is starting to be viewed as a bit heavy handed and clunky but still massively feature rich and a lot of people really love features like its built in FTP functionality. All of these software have built in use of Adobe's ""<a href=""https://edgewebfonts.adobe.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Edge Web Fonts</a>"" service which allows you to bring in thousands of excellent fonts and have them served dynamically to anybody visiting sites you've created. Web Fonts alone is probably reason enough to choose any of these software tools, and it probably best solves your initial problem of type display.</p>

<p>Again, it depends more on your style and processes than anything (have I mentioned that already?) what features are going to appeal to you but hopefully this gives you some insight into the options available.</p>

"Applying Clipping Mask Function to Illustrator Lines","20777","","<p>I'm an architecture student looking to add more of an artsy touch to my floor plans. Traditionally, the plans are exported as vector lines from the arch program I use, which I take into Illustrator to clean up. I'd like to lend more texture to the lines and have a black watercolor wash that would look neat--like the floor plan was painted very cleanly. I often get this effect with text by converting the letters to outlines (cmd-shft-O) and then make a clipping mask out of the watercolor wash.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that ""make clipping mask"" doesn't do the trick, since the image is made of lines rather than shapes. Said another way, Illustrator wants to make a clipping mask out of the shape <em>defined</em> by the line, rather than <em>the lines themselves</em>. Is there a fast way to lend a clipping mask effect to just lines?</p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<hr>

<p><em>edit:</em> The ""outline stroke"" move <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/28069/cakey"">Cakey</a> suggested worked perfect to turn the lines into ""shapes"" that can act as clipping masks without bulking anything up. Unfortunately another problem arose.</p>

<p>I included an image to show the process. In 1 and 2 I have a before and after of text with the background wash applied as a clipping mask.</p>

<p>In 3 and 4 I have an example of random shapes that would be encountered in a floor plan and what happens when I try to set a clipping mask with all the shapes: only the last shape to be created acts as the mask. If I group the shapes to form a single masking element, Illustrator tells me the mask is too complex and everything disappears--no fill or lineweight. Ideas on how to simplify or bypass this warning? I'd like to avoid just taking all of this into Photoshop and losing image quality.</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience and encouragement. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3MkXC.jpg"" alt=""""></p>
","<p>Starting fresh.....</p>

<p>The basic steps are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select all your shapes (or text)</li>
<li>Choose <code>Object &gt; Expand Appearance</code> from the menu, <em>if it is
available</em></li>
<li>Choose <code>Object &gt; Expand</code> from the menu</li>
<li>Choose <code>Object &gt; Compound Path &gt; Make</code> from the menu</li>
<li>Select the objects and the background</li>
<li>Choose <code>Object &gt; Clipping Path &gt; Make</code> from the menu</li>
</ol>

<p>Step 2 may result in objects which can't easily be used for your purpose. This all depends on any complex appearance which has been added to any object. For what you want to work, it is best to keep shapes and objects as simple as possible -- with only a standard fill and/or stroke applied to them.</p>

<p>Step 4 may need some refinement to get the objects all seen correctly. It's possible counters or holes get filled in undesirably. This all depends upon the actual artwork and it can, at times, require further manual editing to ensure the compound path is correctly configured.</p>

"Is it possible to create 3D red/cyan anaglyphs in a hand drawing?","20668","","<p>There are plenty tutorials online on how to create 3D red/cyan anaglyphs from existing photos in Photoshop or similar software.
However, I'm wondering if it is possible to draw a 3D image by hand on for example a whiteboard using markers.</p>

<p>My plan is to tape together a red and blue marker and draw with it using the same rotation/inclination of the marker across the drawing.
Will this give a 3D effect when viewed through red/cyan glasses? Or is the 3D anaglyph method more complex than just offsetting red and cyan lines?</p>
","<p>As it may be possible in theory to draw an anaglyph stereoscopic image by hand this process is rather complicated.</p>

<h2><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_disparity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Binocular disparity</a> is Maths and Geometry</h2>

<p>Our brain will compute the third dimension from the two independent flat 2D projections of our world to the retina of our eyes. Both the right eye and the left eye will see the objects from a different angle. This will lead to a shift in the position of the objects in relation to each other. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yKPjf.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
<sup>Source: <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Binocular_disparity_2D.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikimedia</a></sup></p>

<p>To simulate this in stereoscopic images we therefore need two flat images viewed from a different angle. The horizontal shift of object positions will depend on their distance from the eye. Therefore simply drawing two separated lines (as was propsed by using a pen with a cyan and a red ink on a shifted position) will not lead to a stereoscopic effect. </p>

<p>Only if the shift of objects for the left and for the right eye was correct we will get a proper stereoscopic effect:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mxTVk.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
<sup>Source: <a href=""http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10127956/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scratch</a></sup></p>

<p>We will have to calculate the shift of each object in relation to its neigbours for each distance from the view point. This can be done with the help of computer algorithms but it is very hard to get that right manually.</p>

<h2><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Anaglyph</a> = get the colors right</h2>

<p>Initially the two different images needed for each eye were simply put next to them and were viewed with the cross-eye technique or using a stereoscope with two lenses. To also be able to view large scale images or prints the anaglyph 3D technology was developed as early as in  the 19th Century. This technique makes use of a a pair of glasse with two colored filters for each eye and the complemtary color used in the print. Hence a cyan (or green) line will show dark with a red glass, whereas a red line will become dark with a cyan glass.</p>

<p>By just copying the above simple anaglyph with a pen on paper we can easily easily see that the stereoscopic effect which had worked fine on our computer monitor is extremely hard to paint on white paper. We simply can not easily draw a coloured line in subtractive color mode to be invisible when looking through a filter of the same color.</p>

<p>If we do not get the color perfecty right we will see ghost shadows which may eventually even destroy the stereoscopic effect if too strong. This will also often be the case for anaglyphs which were great on the monitor but are disappointing when printed on paper.</p>

<h2>Possible approach on how to still generate hand drawn anaglyphs</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Get the angles right:</strong><br>
From what is said above we can see that the major issue is to calculate the binocular disparity of objects. We therefore may find it helpful to create a draft scene from different eye views be it with the help of a 3D application (e.g. <a href=""http://www.artofillusion.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Art of Illusion</a>, <a href=""http://www.blender.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blender</a>) or by using a pair of stereoscopic photographs.</li>
<li><strong>Draw from a template:</strong><br>
We can now draw from this template to make sure the angles, and object distances are correct.</li>
<li><strong>Draw right and left eye view separately:</strong><br>
As can nicely be seen in <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/a/22303/12941"">John's answer</a> is may also be needed to draw the right eye view (red) and the left eye view (cyan) separately. This will also ensure that grey colors on overlapping image parts are in the right place after we had later merged these two images to a red-cyan anaglyph.</li>
<li><strong>Use digital scans of your drawings:</strong><br>
This will ensure appropriate merging of the overlays, and it will also help to get the exact color needed for the anaglyph. We could even use a black and white drawing which we can later colorify to merge into an anaglyph.</li>
</ul>

"Losing transparency when placing or pasting items into InDesign CS5","20529","","<p>I know others have asked similar questions, but the answers don't seem to be working for me.</p>

<p>If I have an Illustrator file open and am also working in InDesign, I often copy/paste the vector image into a new layer in InDesign. Today, one of my vector images started showing up with a partially solid background. I can tell that it is behind the vector art, so I went back to the original thinking a fill colour of white must have been set. Not so. In fact, as demonstrated by the two images below, in InDesign there is a white box, and in Illustrator it is transparent (proven by the light blue box I drew behind it). The strangest part is that portions of text outside of the ""area"" that logo occupies ARE transparent.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EftHk.png"" alt=""InDesign with white filled box"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SW21e.png"" alt=""Illustrator with no fill, as proven by blue box drawn behind""></p>

<p>I've ticked the ""Show Import Options"" box in InDesign, but the ""Transparency"" tick box is not always available.</p>

<p>Some of these logos come from other companies as .eps, so I don't have access to the original .ai files. Regardless of whether they're placed or copy/pasted, the same thing is happening. </p>

<p>Some files aren't giving me an issue while others are. I thought maybe if one document's settings were RGB while the other's were CMYK it might cause a problem, but changing the document settings and saving isn't fixing the issue.</p>
","<p>EPS is a flat file format - something is either transparent or it is not - there's no in between. Blurs, shadows, and glows <strong>must</strong> be expanded and flattened when saved as EPS.  In that heart image, the shadow is what is generating the background because it has to be flattened for the EPS format.</p>

<p>You can try re-saving the as .ai then place into InDesign. However, if the original EPS files already contains that background, there's little you can do other than to reconstruct elements or request the original .ai file rather than the flat EPS format.</p>

<p>Do they imagine a design in their mind first, then draw it out on paper, then Photoshop? </p>

<p>Or do they just go on Photoshop and just play around until something nice comes out? Or what?</p>
","<p>If you're a programmer, you're already creative. Programming is one of the most creative of professions (else why would the word ""elegant"" be such a high term of praise?). So much for that.</p>

<p>So let's narrow this down. You want a route to channel your already-existing creativity into the VISUAL arts, rather than the unseen-by-all art of good coding.</p>

How far you go after that is up to you.</p>

<p>A general rule for learning any skill: you have to be able to duplicate (recreate exactly what others have done) before you can originate (create your own from-scratch design). This applies to art, music, programming, anything.</p>

This is probably the best and most succinct exposition on the Big Thing All UI Designers Must Know.</p>

<p>As you are already doing, and once you have done some of the study above, search out great UI designs and figure out how they did it. Recreate them exactly. In the process three things will happen: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>You will associate the design fundamentals you've been studying with real-world examples. When principle and application come together, the principle buries itself so deeply in your mind that you no longer have to remember it; it becomes something you think with automatically.</p></li>
<li><p>You will be building a vocabulary of techniques, just like the programming vocabulary of algorithms and programming shortcuts you work with every day in coding.</p></li>
<li><p>You'll start to gain confidence in your own ideas. I guarantee you'll have at least one ""aha!"" moment, when you look at some successful UI design and realize, ""Hey! I could do better than that!"" Your own designs will come alive, and you'll be on your way.</p></li>

"Adding More Materials for Photoshop 3D","20490","","<p>I have been using the 3d features in Photoshop CS6 Extended and I love all of the materials that are included and that you can download from Adobe's website. However, I have been trying to find some additional materials and I'm wondering if anyone has created some, or if someone out there knows where I could find some. I have searched online for them but so far no cigar. Thanks</p>
","<p>@daveMac:  I'm glad you like them.  I made the 36 materials, as well as the 100+ at Photoshop.com for Adobe's CS 5 release. During the CS 6 build was was tasked with redesigning the UX (User eXperience) and we did not get time to make or release new materials.  We may in the future, so watch <a href=""http://www.photoshop.com/products/photoshop/3d"" rel=""nofollow"">Photoshop.com's 3D content page</a> for an update, is all I can say...</p>

<p>The materials that we shipped with are nice examples of simple materials (not very many texture maps) but many of the additional 100+ materials that you can download at Photoshop.com are even more interesting once you start to look at them.  Basically I created the texture maps as smart objects, so if you open them you'll see that there are several layers; fill, adjustment, smart filter/smart objects, etc...  The best part is, they are all fully editable—I made them with a non-destructive thought in mind. (^_^)</p>

<p>Here is a blog article I wrote as an <a href=""http://blog.ablepear.com/2010/06/photoshop-cs5-introduction-to-materials.html"" rel=""nofollow"">introduction to materials in Photoshop</a>—created in Photoshop CS 5 Extended.  (You'll see that I was going to write more, articles, but I have not had the chance.)</p>

<p>So, open those materials, and look inside.  Almost all Smart Filters/Smart Object you can just double click and inspect/edit the Filter Gallery effects, hit okay, and switch back to your 3D Scene and it will update—render and see what you made.  Check out the Fabric, Tiles, Stone and Wood, as I believe those will provide you with the best insight on how to start easily creating your own.</p>

<p>Lastly, in <a href=""http://www.photoshopdimensions.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Photoshop Dimensions</a>, each issue talks about Materials and deconstructs them, and the magazine will continue to do article(s) on materials in each issue—I know, as I'm the editor-in-chief... and I love materials.  The first issue is free and provides an overview of all that is new in Photoshop CS 6 Extended's 3D user experience.  There's an overview of the Material's properties, but I did not dive into texture maps in issue 1; Issue 2 started the material studies but is not free.</p>

<p>I hope this helps and if I can remember, I'll come back here and post when new materials go up on Photohop.com.  Also, let us know if you make some funky new materials.  I always love to see what we, the community, can create.  Cheers!</p>

"For mobile apps, what's the best graphic design software I should use (Mac)?","20415","","<p>I am an experienced programmer but new to graphic design.</p>

<p>I am making mobile apps for both iOS &amp; Android, and I am wondering what graphic design tools/software I should use (in Mac) would be the best fit for a starter and for designing graphics for mobile apps?</p>

<p>Any advice will be appreciated. Thanks.</p>
","<p>If you have the device you're designing for, you want something that can pitch out the image you're working on, straight to the device, so you can see what you're editing on the actual intended screen.</p>

<p>This sounds so logical you'd imagine it's easy to achieve and that someone had thoroughly setup a situation that did this live, easily.</p>

<p>Not true. </p>

<p>Let's deal with Apple first, because you should always design for this platform first. If you need this explained as to why this generalisation is true, you probably still believe in a benign Microsoft and the ""virtues"" of laissez-faire economics. So use an iPad or iPhone to begin with. Android devices compound the fiddliness of doing this.</p>

<p>The best rig is either iDisplay or AirDisplay. //both also work for Android</p>

<p>I prefer iDisplay but do use both, and at $20 a shot, it's not like you're breaking the bank to try each.  There's minor differences between them, both developers are responsive, but iDisplay is the little guy, and he's super cool with his email responses. So gets my nod:</p>

<p>iDisplay
<a href=""http://www.getidisplay.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getidisplay.com</a></p>

<p>Air Display is here:
<a href=""http://www.avatron.com/apps/air-display/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avatron.com/apps/air-display/</a></p>

<p>// BOTH of these apps are designed for extending your display, so their benefits don't end with your testing of app interfaces dynamically. They're generally very helpful. iDisplay's touch screen responsiveness is (to me) a little better. So yes, you can operate your apps and draw on screen in Photoshop with these things. Amongst other benefits over things like Skala View etc.</p>

<p>Now for the hard bit. You need to get your work view over to the screen without borders and chrome etc.</p>

<p>Some apps are good at this, some are near impossible to get right.</p>

<p>Indesign is good at this. It has a full window preview mode that you can push out to the iDevice, as a duplicate of the open document, so you continue working in Indesign on the computer and see live updates on the iDevice screen.</p>

<p>I prefer a more powerful vector app for editing than Indesign, so I embed an Illustrator document into that Indesign document with live linking and then draw in Illustrator...hit a key combo that updates everything in Indesign and see it all update on the iPad/iPhone.</p>

<p>Adobe Bridge can do similarly, more directly, but is so prone to ""losing its connection"" that it's only stable for a few updates to the original file.</p>

<p>Photoshop is rather painful to work in for interface design, because it's not really suited to the job, and Fireworks, which was excellent for UI design is now a thing of the past.  BUT, Photoshop can also do second screen, full screen previews with a duplicate of the current document, so you get live updates on the device, without chrome and other nonsense obscuring your full screen viewing.</p>

<p>I've spent a lot of time testing these sorts of setups to do LIVE editing on the device, and this can be much more fiddly and unreliable than it should be, so please don't be shy about asking more questions. It may well be annoying to setup. But it's very much worth it for the ability to live edit and preview onscreen.</p>

<p>It would be completely remiss of me to not point out that this app does this ""automagically"", apparently:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/</a></p>

<p>I haven't tried it. But it's worth considering.  </p>

<p>Sorry, while I'm handing out free advice, one more thing. If you're a competent programmer I think you should focus on becoming a great programmer. They're very rare. And in so doing, partner with a designer for design. Design might look like anyone can do it, that all you need do is learn the tools. But there's a magic ingredient to design, and that's an intuitive understanding of humanity's desires and opinions, feelings, sentiments and the zeitgeist of now. This is something that can't really be taught or learned. You either have sufficient empathy to be a designer and will push through learning the tools to express that, or you're a programmer. </p>

<p>If you're a programmer, and can communicate with a designer, that will ultimately be a 1+1=3 type of equation. You'll both benefit massively from the others talents, and be able to more deeply focus on your own talents and improving in that area.</p>

<p>So, in deeper answer to your question, the best design software for you to use is a designer.  </p>

"Horizontal and Vertical Scaling of One Character in AI","20401","","<p>In Photoshop, I've got in my character menu Horizontal and Vertical scaling. In Illustrator I don't have it, but I need it.

<ul><li>How do I scale one character horizontally or vertically (but not both) in text in Illustrator, without separating the text out?</li>
<li>Also, how do I stretch text vertically when it's typed along a path?</li></ul>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I do realize that to stretch an individual character, the text can be outlined, and the character can then be transformed; however, I'd say this should be a last resort, since it's irreversible, and changing the text afterward requires a complete redesign.</p>
","<p>Illustrator has horizontal and vertical scale options just like Photoshop. But because Adobe are... <em>special</em>... they thought it would be fun to hide a lot of their settings and leave no clue that they are there.</p>

<p>Open up the <strong>flyout menu</strong> with the button at the top right of the character settings window. Choose <strong>""Show options""</strong>, which is Adobe speak for ""Stop hiding the tools I need, you crazy people"". This shows the boxes for text scaling, as well as moving text up and down from the baseline, character rotation, language and things like superscript/subscript, underline, strikethrough, etc.</p>

","<p>The problem here is object ( or rather a layer style ) with a special blend mode and transparent bg. That just wont happen. Think about it: Because the blend modes generally react to what ever is behind them, with transparent bg there is nothing to react to, the blend mode is basically normalized.</p>

<p><strong>The solution</strong> <em>for your problem</em> would be just to use normal blend mode and lower the opacity of your drop shadow (This would give you nearly identical final result).  </p>

<p>Another way would be to include the background, or just the part of the background that is sitting under the element with blend mode.</p>

<p>For other similar situations, you could set blend mode to normal, lower the opacity and try to create the same effect without any blend modes.</p>

"Learning to draw: start in the pen and paper realm or the digital space?","20074","","<p>My question is should I start with paper to learn to draw or learn to digitally draw with Photoshop or Illustrator or any image manipulation application.</p>

<p>I am thinking of using a book or some other accompanying material (if you have any recommendations). I am thinking of this <a href=""http://www.drawright.com/"">book</a>.</p>

<p>If I do learn to draw digitally (or do graphic design to be more precise) does that translate or least help in drawing in the real world? </p>

<p>Also if I learn to draw with pen and paper does that improve your Photoshop or Illustrator skills?</p>

<p>Lastly if you have learned Photoshop and then started to draw in paper did you notice or feel a difference in your designs?</p>

<p>I am interested in practicing graphic design and feel that I should learn to draw as well. Not just for graphic design but for pleasure as well.</p>
","<p>I'm going to disagree with everyone else and say that, if you're serious about graphic design or digital illustration, <strong>you should get a tablet ASAP</strong>.</p>

<p>If you're the creative type, then it's unlikely that your first experience drawing is going to be in a digital media, as you were probably exposed to analog media in art classes likely as early as kindergarten or grade school. And I <em>do</em> think you should take traditional art classes to build your foundations, as those courses generally aren't taught using digital media. But that's more to do with tradition and practicality than anything else. (It's easier to furnish a class with pencil/paper than it is to provide each student with a digitizing tablet. And not all students will have a tablet to practice on at home.)</p>

<p>Yes, analog media has a lot of qualities that can't be replicated by digital media, but the reverse is also true. And if you're going to spend most of your career drawing digitally, then getting accustomed to the feel of a tablet as soon as possible is going to be much more beneficial than learning the nuances of physical media. And it does take some time to get used to drawing with a digitizer tablet.</p>

<p>And while a high end tablet may be quite expensive, a cheap entry-level tablet like the Bamboo may actually save you money. Art materials aren't cheap, and if you're drawing/painting all the time, it quickly adds up. So digital media lets you get in more practice without spending as much money.</p>

<p>Digital media is also more beginner-friendly in some ways. The biggest reason is that there's no undo button for your physical canvas. Sure, you can erase a pencil sketch, but you can only do that so much before it starts to wear down the paper. There are no such problems with digital media. You also don't have to worry about making one mistake and ruining an entire piece, or smearing, or having your paint dry prematurely, or not being able to match a color you used in your last session, etc. There's also less cleanup if you're doing a digital painting versus analog.</p>

<p>All of the above reasons might make one inclined to practice more using digital than if they only had access to physical media (I know it did for me). That isn't to say you shouldn't bother with physical media, just that you should have both options available early on. The most important thing is that you set yourself up so that you can, and are motivated to, practice as much as possible. If you have both a tablet and a sketch pad, you can draw on the media of your choice whenever the urge strikes you.</p>

"What tools can I use to create Fractal Art?","20068","","<p>There are many fractal generation softwares such as the free Xaos and Fractal Architect 2. I normally use Mathematica to generate fractals and process them later with editing tool but this time have to work with an <strong>art project</strong> where things must be perfect. </p>

<p>We are creating a large indoor print over the facade that will be up for a month. Our idea is to create a flower facade with fractals, orbifolds and other mathematical patterns -- we have so far worked with Mathematica but tools such as Fractal Architect 2 may speed up designing and crafting. For the print, we need apparently CMYK colors so have to be sure the software support it or other printing colors. And we need to make sure there is a way to export Mathematica things. So far, we don't know yet which softwares even support CMYK or similar. </p>

<p>Is there any superior fractal generation tool designed for graphic artists? </p>

<p>What kind of features should I look at in such tools?</p>
","<p>Adding as a different answer because it's a different program :)</p>

<p>You can do a ""fractal-inspired"" look in Gimp, which is open source and free, using the Fractal flames plugin. </p>

<p>Curious note: Fractal flames are a member of the iterated function system class of fractals created by Scott Draves in 1992. Draves’ seminal open-source code was later ported into Adobe After Effects graphics software and translated into the Apophysis fractal flame editor.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/O6TOT.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>To choose your type of flames, click on Edit and choose Random or Spherical, as Variation (also with Sinusoidal you can obtain something good). In Directions you can view the previews of some flames; if you don’t like anything, click on Randomise to generate other previews. When you find your best preview, click on it and click Ok twice (one for the Edit Flame window and one for the Flame window).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pJ5yJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Another possible plugin is IFS, or <a href=""http://registry.gimp.org/node/24563"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Iteration Function System</a>, that applies an iterated function system over an image, finitely, making it fractal-like. </p>

<p>You will need to install a plugin for <a href=""https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CMYK_support_in_The_GIMP"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CMYK support in Gimp</a>. It might not be the best program for printing, but you mentioned you were open to other alternatives, and this is an extra option. </p>

<p>And, final note, <a href=""http://flam3.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Flame Algorithm</a> is also an open source software that lets you create some nice effects. Ok, one more.

"Opening Adobe illustrator CS5 file in CorelDRAW X5","19945","","<p>I was totally new to graphic design and the best I could do was resize images in MS Paint or use Word 2010. Than I discovered Adobe Illustartor as I needed to make a logo and Letter Head. After breaking my head against my monitor (does not hurt any more) and learning it for 2 weeks, I became sufficiently good enough (if I can be excused to say that) and designed the logo and letterhead. Now it has to go to print.</p>

<p>The problem is that all the commercial printers and the people who use them, HERE use CorelDRAW and not only that but also older versions from 9 to 15. They refuse to take Adobe Illustrator files or even CorelDRAW files above version 12 such as v15 or X5. They refuse to work with PDF files also. No Word 2010 files either. Simply and Only CorelDRAW files of version 9 to 12.</p>

<p>The Adobe Illustrator CS5 does not have options of saving the files in "".cdr"" format. And when I import or open the "".ai"" file in CorelDRAW X5, many things happen. Color changes of text as well as objects. Some objects do not get displayed. Alignment and positioning gets changed, and many others.</p>

<p>I have taken some steps after reading on the net to make it easier for CorelDRAW X5 to import the "".ai"" files. And also tried many things. These include, but are not limited to..</p>

<ol>
<li>Uncheck/disable the ""compression"" when saving the file in AI-CS5.</li>
<li>Uncheck/disable the ""Embed ICC Prile"" when saving in AI-CS5.</li>
<li>Convert all text to outlines.</li>
<li>Saving in ""SVG"", ""PDF"" all different versions.    </li>
<li>Saving in older AI-CS5 Legacy versions.</li>
<li>Exporting the file from AI-CS5 in different file formats.</li>
<li>Importing the file from CD-X5.</li>
<li>Working in RGB Color Mode.</li>
</ol>

<p>... And many more.</p>

<p>Please note that I can not be expected to fresh learn CD-X5 and abandon AI-CS5 and design from the begining, if that is a ""sole"" answer. Also my design is simple enough. Attached are 2 pics. One of the logo and the other of the letterhead. Just 3 rounded rectangles filled with 2 color gradients and vectors of animals with styles applied to those animals and with text at the bottom. (can't post images, need 10+ rep for that)</p>

So Color Theroy or Font theroy have not made past me. And I wonder what's the point of having a standard of ""SVG"" If these so called ""Vector Editing Applications"" can not handle the files uniformly?</p>

<p>I guess my question is how to either</p>

<li>Import/Open/Open As/Place the file in CS-X5 from AI-CS5</li>

","<p>The problems you describe have been issues with Corel for years. I've run into it working with small specialty engraving shops that have equipment that only understands Corel files so they <em>have</em> to import to Corel.</p>

If that can import correctly into X5, you'll be okay, but I have to warn you that I've seen problems even from those legacy formats. Otherwise, you're left with exporting a high resolution TIFF for import into Corel, or learning Corel.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mC6ns.png"" alt=""page""></p>

<p>As I'm altering Bootstrap it occurred to me that 80% or more of my time was being spent learning what class or id was applied to something, then finding that in the CSS to adjust. It became clear that Bootstrap was not going to save me any time at all. In fact, Bootstrap would greatly increase production times due to the *overly templated CSS.</p>

<p>*(<em>by ""overly templated"" I mean there's a great deal of CSS I probably wouldn't use for any given web site. Not that there is unnecessary CSS on the whole.</em>)</p>

<p>I understand that if I were familiar with Bootstrap I would be familiar with class/id names and general location in the stylesheets. So, I'm willing to bend a bit on the time it was taking me, realizing that some of it was due to my own unfamiliarity.</p>

<p>However, I can't help but wonder if Bootstrap et. al. are merely crutches which are crippling designers by spoon feeding them their own brand of code. Thus locking in a consumer base which will rely entirely on a third party solution and it's functionality for everything, or at least the majority. It reminds me of those that can only design a web site if they can use Dreamweaver. And heaven forbid if they don't have access to Dreamweaver and a change is needed.</p>

<p>When I build a site I use my own set of standard class and ID names. I structure CSS how it's intuitive for me. I have my own set of pre-build templates for quick set up. Therefore any site I build I can edit fairly quickly. Using any of the pre-configured front-end packages simply means I need to learn <em>their</em> naming conventions and <em>their</em> structure rather than relying on my own.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Can anyone extoll upon me the great virtues of such templating systems as <a href=""http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/"">Bootstrap</a> or <a href=""http://html5boilerplate.com/"">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What makes them valuable to you?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Are you merely familiar with the system you use so you can navigate it easily or do you still have to hunt for items?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Could you build a site without them if you had to?</strong></li>
</ul>

"Fill enclosed path in Inkscape","19618","","<p>I'm having difficulties with a really basic concept in Inkscape. How do I fill an enclosed path that has a line going into it? I've combined the original two paths to form one path, but filling it doesn't actually fill it. The only way I can seem to get it to work are hacks like adding a background object filled with the right color. Here's an example of my issue: </p>

"How do you explain the value of native files to an uneducated client?","19616","","<p>If you design a piece for print. It gets reproduced several times over the course of a few years. Then the client doesn't return for any work for a few more years. And suddenly you are contacted asking for native files (Indesign, Illustrator, Photoshop). As the client puts it, ""We just want to be able to make minor changes, we aren't designers.""</p>

<p>Now, there is absolutely value in the native files. They are my ""secret recipe"" as a designer and anyone asking for that recipe should provide compensation for the ease of reusing, repurposing, and altering the recipe.</p>

<p><strong>How do you explain to this client that there is value in the native files?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How do you counter the ""But we already paid for the design."" argument?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note: I know I own the files. I know my contract states I own the files.</strong> Heck even without a contract, US Copyright law states I own the files.</p>

<p>What I'm seeking is an <strong>elegant, less argumentative, method of <em>explaining</em> the file ownership</strong> to the uneducated client. Reciting legal statutes and contract clauses doesn't often make for friendly client relations. My goal is to find a method of explaining so it is fully understood by the client <em>without</em> the appearance of a contract clause which <em>forces</em> them to do something against their will. I want the client to respect and not resent these types of contract clauses.</p>
","<p>To one of @SteveA points, no client of mine has ever cared that I need to make money from my work. To a one, they pulled and pulled and pulled to extract every penny they could out of me and my work. I could see the incessant revisions and last second changes the hour before delivery coming down the pike and would try to head them off at the pass based on the contract, (and here is my point) <strong>they will argue that they are helping me by paying <em>at all</em> and that their word of mouth will bring me more business.</strong> That, <em>somehow</em>, by trying to limit their abuse of my time, I am throwing away a great opportunity to expand my business. </p>

<p><sub><em>And since I'm kind of a hothead, I'd usually just take the hit and drop them as a client right there. 3 times in 10 years. But that's me.</em></sub></p>

<p>Therefore, I recommend staying away from the pity angle ""this is how I put food on the table"" kind of thing. They simply don't care.</p>

<h2>My Recommendation</h2>

<p>What you do is write a script. It's a common enough occurrence that you really should have a Marketing Call Center script memorized about how to deal with it. Something like this...</p>

<pre><code>Could you email those files? We just want to be able to make minor changes
but we aren't designers.
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that. (lol) That data was not covered as part of the original contract.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>But we already paid for the design.
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, yeah... exactly. You paid for the design; for the art. And you've seen value from the art. What you're paying for here is data and convenience. It's data, files, that I created, that will provide you with a level of convenience that has value beyond the contracted design.</p>
  
  <p>If we'd had this discussion at the onset of our relationship, I'd have said the same thing, and it would have been extra to provide the source files along with the art.</p>
  
  <p>Of course, it's a little more convenient than just having me make the changes, but at that point the data, the files, have nothing to do with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>You're just trying to hold us ransom because you think you have us over a barrel.
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>As I said, it wouldn't have mattered if we'd closed the contract yesterday. The data, source files, would have been a cost over and above the design, the art.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>That dude over there didn't charge us for the files that one time.
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, that's the price he requests for his data. <em>(<strong>BONUS ROUND!</strong> ...if you know that guy and how your work compares to his. But don't thrash on him, take the opportunity to promote your own work.)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Occasionally you'll hear a different complaint, and may have to think on the fly. I wish you luck, but it's something to work into the script.</p>

<h2>Last point</h2>

<p>The gorilla in the room: <strong>It's Contract Etiquette vs Human Nature.</strong> You don't want to be a Hat, but you want to be paid. If they insist, then they're being a Hat and your professional demeanor will serve you well.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The person that knows contracts won't even try to do this.</strong> They would probably just call you to make the changes and send over new copy. ""Thanks.""</li>
<li><strong>The person that called you likely already knows better</strong> and they're just trying to get something for nothing for whatever reason.  maybe getting purchase orders is a pita, or petty cash is low, or the design budget for the year is ripped.</li>
<li><strong>The person that doesn't know contracts will expect you to give them a one-off</strong> because they believe that they or their business was somehow special.</li>
<li><strong>Don't be afraid to talk about money.</strong> It's the crux of the entire conversation. They know it, you know it. They don't want to pay you, you want to be paid. How you go talking about it (techniques, words, phrases, etc) is an age-old argument that I'll let you research elsewhere.</li>

","<p>They are called conflation artifacts, if you want to see how different vector engines react see <a href=""http://w3.impa.br/~diego/projects/GanEtAl14/sample.html?contour"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. If you want to understand the technical reason for some discussion see <a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/q/1824/38"">here</a>. Basically conflation happens because we convert coverage to opacity, and that does not work. If you were to skip coverage based anti-aliasing then you wouldn't have any conflation problems*, for same reason super sampling has no problems.</p>

<p>To circumvent this problem one should always let the object behind overlap with the object above. Think of this like manually layering paper pieces on top of each other. If you cut a shape with scissors that exactly matches the hole of another shape odds are you get a gap, and aligning them is hard. On the computer due to a faulty assumption a perfect shared edge is a bad idea.</p>

<p><strong>Image 1</strong>: Prefer not to cut or share edges with the shape below.</p>

<p>This overlapping technique should be taken into account in the beginning of the process. And that means you should not use divide trim or merge in pathfinder, if you aim for web publication. The case has been discussed in <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/47342/space-between-2-paths-illustrator/47345#47345"">this answer</a>, that is near duplicate.</p>

<p>In your specific case the <em>quick fix</em> would be to apply a slight offset on each of the paths. So select all and choose <strong>Effect &rarr; Path &rarr; Offset Path...</strong> then type in a small value. Additionally you could arrange colors so that darkest color is in front.</p>

<p>* For this reason a printer wouldn't have a problem. In fact cutting up is important for the printing plate process.</p>

"Are there any tangible benefits to becoming an Adobe Certified Expert?","19509","","<p>I've been doing a little research into improving my skill set and I thought it could make sense to take the test, becoming an Adobe Certified Expert. </p>

<p>For those unfamiliar, The <a href=""https://www.adobe.com/uk/support/certification/ace.html"">Adobe Certified Expert</a> (ACE) tests are multiple choice tests you need pass in order to display a certification badge, have certification certificates emailed directly from Adobe to anyone you wish, and have your name displayed on Adobe's web site as an expert.</p>

<p>My question is, does being an Adobe Certified Expert hold value and have any tangible benefits in the real design world or is it merely a little eye candy for a prospective employer?</p>
","<p>I've been an Adobe Certified Expert for approximately 9 years as of this writing.</p>

<p>If <strong>working a 9 to 5</strong> employment position, the certification isn't going to be of any great benefit. In fact, as an employee there's practically zero benefit to any Adobe certification other than merely continued education for self fulfillment. Your employer may be able to advertise your certification to acquire new business, which may indirectly effect you. But that's about as far as the certification will take you in that type of scenario.</p>

<p>If <strong>applying for a 9 to 5</strong> position, it may edge you above an otherwise equally qualified competitor if the employer understands the certification. If the employer does not understand the certification, then it may be greatly beneficial when applying for a job. Those that do not understand the certification can often place more value on what it certifies than the actual merits of the tests. For example, Adobe certifications <strong>do not</strong> verify creativity or ability to design effectively in <em>any</em> way. However, a certification plus a strong portfolio can often edge out those with only a strong portfolio.</p>

<p>As a <strong>freelancer or independent contractor</strong>, the certification is a huge benefit to acquiring new clients and edging out competitors. The certification gives you instant authority in tools which many savvy clients know are going to be used. I have often gained and retained clients simply due to my certification. Granted, the work still must be up to the anticipated quality. However, the certification is a pseudo-guarantee to clients that there will be no technical issues due to software inexperience. [I recently overheard one of my clients somewhat smugly expressing over the phone: <em>""We work with an Adobe Certified Expert for these art files.""</em> My certification gave <em>them</em> a sense of pride in the work. That's intangible and could not be predicted.]</p>

<p>As an <strong>instructor</strong> it's almost mandatory in my opinion if you are teaching Adobe software. If you want to teach others, the best thing you can do is prove you know your stuff. Certification does just that.</p>

<p>I have never regretted my certification and it has paid for itself over and over and continues to. </p>

<p>The primary thing you should realize is that the test are <em>production oriented</em>. It is not a ""design"" or ""creativity"" test. So any situation where there is benefit to your <em>proving</em> you know how to use the application(s)  regarding production may be aided by the certification. It's a seal of approval from Adobe stating <em>""We've tested this user and they know our application(s) well.""</em> If you have no need or desire to acquire that direct Adobe testimonial, then you may have no need for the certification.</p>

<p>If contemplating certification, I'd suggest just going for it. That is not to imply you can simply wing it. Few (if any) can do that. However, study and take the test for the current version. Often the tests are 6 to 9 months behind application releases. So, the CS6 tests are sill the current test right now even though CC has been released. Testing for CS6 will be easier than testing for CC due to the simple fact that CS6 has less features than CC. The first test is the most difficult test to take. The longer you wait, the more features each application has and the more extensive your knowledge must be to pass. Pass the first test, then every subsequent recertification becomes much easier.</p>

"How to control word-spacing in justified text with CSS?","19247","","<p>I have 2 blocks of text that are pretty small (just under a paragraph each) and they really look better justified but the problem is that <code>text-align: justify;</code> sometimes adds really large spaces and makes the text somewhat ugly (the opposite effect, obviously).</p>

<p>Is it possible to more finely tune the word spacing with CSS so that this doesn't happen?</p>
","<h2>CSS TEXT-JUSTIFY</h2>

<p>This <strong>IE-only</strong> property offers a refinement on the “justify” value used in the <code>text-align</code> property. Indeed, the “justify” value must be set for that property for <code>text-justify</code> to have any effect.</p>

<p><code>text-justify</code> offers a fine level of justification control over the enclosed content, allowing for a variety of sophisticated justification models used in different language writing systems.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;""&gt;
    This is “Newspaper” justified content
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Possible Values</h2>

<pre><code>VALUE                   DESCRIPTION
----------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
auto                    The browser will determine the appropriate justification algorithm
                        to use

distribute              Justification is handled similarly to the “newspaper” value,
                        but this version is optimized for East Asian content
                        (especially the Thai language.)
                        In this justification method, the last line is not justified.

distribute-all-lines    Behavior and intent for this value is the same as with the
                        “distribute” value, but the last line is also justified.

inter-cluster           Justifies content that does not have any inter-word spacing
                        (such as with many East Asian languages.)

inter-ideograph         Used for justifying blocks of ideographic content.
                        Justification is achieved by increasing or decreasing spacing
                        between ideographic characters and words as well.

inter-word              Justification is achieved by increasing the spacing between words.
                        It is the quickest method of justification and does not justify
                        the last line of a content block.

newspaper               Spacing between letters and words are increased or decreased
                        as necessary.

"How can I change the center point of a irregular shapes/objects in Illustrator CS5?","19048","","<p>Let's say I have a square, rectangle, or circle. By default, the center point of will be positioned exactly in the middle. It is so because the binding box is same as the shape. It can be viewed by the Attributes Panel and clicking ""Show Center"".</p>

<p>I also have some shapes which are irregular. If I look at the center point, it is positioned in the middle but the middle is relative to the bounding box of that shape. How would I go about selecting and editing the center point in such a way that it sits exactly in the center, horizontal and vertical relative to the shape and not the bounding box.</p>

<p>In the below image, on the top there is a square, rectangle, and circle. The center point is exactly in the center.</p>

<p>Below that there is a chicken, cow, and fish. The center point are not in the middle.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZShwj.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>The center point is always in the center of the object. It is not associated with the bounding box. You can turn off the Bounding box and retain the center point.</p>

<p>The object's (shape's) outer width and outer height are used to draw the center point as well as its bounding box. What you see is the exact center of your shapes. Moving it would place it off-center.</p>

<p>With symmetrical shapes, such as the rectangles and circle, it appears to be centered more. However it's just as centered in the irregular shapes of the chicken, cow, and fish. The difference is that every associated path in the irregular shapes is not an equal distance from the center of the shape as it is in the symmetrical shapes.</p>

<p>To illustrate more... see the attached image. It clearly shows the center point is in equidistant from either side. Green rectangle is merely a copy of the red rectangle.</p>

<h2>Preview mode by layer</h2>

<p>Also keep in mind the fact that you can change between Preview mode and Outline mode in Illustrator at the layer level. This means, if you build your grid as shapes on a dedicated layer as described above you can switch to outline mode to make the objects more guide-like. Then you can switch back to a color coded or solid shape view just as easily. I often find this helpful on grids like the complicated example above.</p>

<p>It's one path but different segments of that path. For instance, there is the horizontal segment, and then a segment which is tilted at 120 degrees. <em>It doesn't matter if I select the horizontal segment or the tilted segment, it always cuts the horizontal segment.</em></p>
","<p>If the path involves curves (which a Celtic Knot will), snipping away from the intersection then stretching the path will pull the curves, distorting them slightly. For precision, you will need to know how to control the 'stacking' order <em>within</em> a path.</p>

<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Use the pen tool to select the path endpoint on the segment of the path you <strong><em>don't</em></strong> want to be snipped. Then snip the exact intersection point.</p>

I remember it by imagining illustrator sewing the paths into the canvas, carefully sowing the thread underneath earlier stitches (that works for me but probably no-one else...).</p>

<p>If it's a complex case (which any good Celtic knot will be...) and you need to see which direction paths are pointing (i.e. which end point is the start and which is the finish) add an ""add arrowheads"" effect, then remove the effect when you're done. </p>

<p>So why the pen tool? You can <strong>switch which way round an open line is pointing</strong> by using the pen tool to select the point that is currently the start point, as if you were going to continue drawing from there. This instantly turns it from start point into end point, reversing the path. If you've added arrowheads, you'll see this - the direction of the arrow will reverse. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MngFP.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In the above image, a curved path with an arrowhead on the finish point and its copy with the direction reversed were snipped at the exact point they intersect. You can see from the arrowhead on the newly created 'cut off bit' which segment of the path was snipped: it was the one closest to the arrow's start point.</p>

"How to keep the text in vector in Photoshop without rasterizing it or flattening the layers when exporting to PDF?","18809","","<p>After many tests in all kind of PDF presets, I couldn't figure out how to keep the text layers as vector and still have the quality of  InDesign without using it. Everything I tried was rasterizing the texts. It seems like PDF/x rasterizes the layers too.</p>

<p>The layout needs to be created in Adobe Photoshop unfortunately, and all I have on hand is a Photoshop file with layers.</p>

<p>Is it possible to keep the vector quality of Photoshop text layers and objects when exporting to PDF, and get the quality of an Illustrator or InDesign file easily? </p>
","<p><strong>Yes.</strong></p>

<p>A simple trick is to prepare your Photoshop as you always do, and save a .psd file.</p>

<p>Then open this file in Adobe Illustrator.</p>

<p>You will be asked if you want to convert the layers to objects or to flatten them in a single layer. Select ""convert objects"".</p>

<p>If it doesn't work, verify if the .psd file is in 8bits.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Kkvq.jpg"" alt=""How to convert a Photoshop to PDF with vector texts""></p>

<p>Your text is now editable in Illustrator and appears as vectors. You can now simply do a ""create outline"" to make sure the fonts don't move for your print-ready or save it as a standard .PDF that you can easily optmize.</p>

<p>(<a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/45148/changing-file-sizes-in-a-pdf/55343#55343"">see how to optimize PDF here</a>)</p>

<p>With this trick, even you get files from a friend who can only afford the Photography Plan from Adobe (Photoshop and Lightroom), you can still open the .PSD files without losing too much quality. Don't forget to ask for the fonts if the text layers are not using fonts from the TypeKit!</p>

"How to remove a green/blue screen background using Photoshop CS5?","18771","","<p>Using <code>Photoshop CS5</code>, i'm trying to fully remove background of a picture being shot behind a <code>blue screen</code>. To do this, i am using <code>Color Range</code> method (from <code>Menu &gt; Selection</code>). It works ok for most parts of the picture but other for some having <code>transparency</code> (like hairs), there is still some glowing blue around it.</p>

<p>Here is the original image :</p>

<p>Here is what i get, using <code>Color Range</code>. If i increase the <code>Fuzziness</code>, the hairs tends to disappear completely, which is not what i want.</p>

<p>Here is what I want to achieve :</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QyiFA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Is there other techniques to remove that blue background ? (and thus avoiding the blue glow around the image ?)</p>
","<p>I usually use an <code>Alpha Channel</code> to remove backgrounds in images like these.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a rough example, but if you take care to be detail specific, the results will be spot on.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Step 1</h1>

<p>If your image is a background layer, double click the layer and name it whatever.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FhLWP.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h1>Step 2</h1>

<p>Go to the <code>Channels</code> panel (<code>Window &gt; Channels</code>) and select the layer with a high contrast. I chose the Blue layer in this example. </p>

<p><strong>Duplicate</strong> this layer by dragging it to the <code>Create New Channel</code> icon, or right clicking and select <code>Duplicate Channel...</code> You can name this whatever, but this will be your <code>Alpha Channel</code>.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0J0an.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h1>Step 3</h1>

<p>With the new channel selected, go to <code>Image &gt; Apply Image</code>. Make sure the blending mode is set to <strong>Multiply</strong> and adjust the opacity to 75 - 100% whatever looks ok.</p>

<h1>Step 4</h1>

<p>Break out the brush tool [<code>B</code>], select black as your color, and paint the areas that are definitely going to show through at 100% opacity. For instance the fingers, hand and head at the right side of the photo.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zTrjJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h1>Step 5</h1>

<p>Change your brush <code>Blending Mode</code> to <strong>Overlay</strong>, and brush the light &amp; fine hair areas. With Overlay as the mode, you'll be able to darken the fine areas without getting the background too.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rSmEy.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Switch the color to white, to brighten the gray background without affecting the black strokes.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BAoLo.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h1>Step 6</h1>

<p>When you are happy with the masking, <code>Inverse</code> the selection (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>) to make the mask white.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6IVw.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h1>Step 7</h1>

<p><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + click to Select the alpha channel mask as a selection. Then go to your layer panel and create the mask.</p>

"How would I create this spotlight projection effect in Photoshop?","18738","","<p>I would like to create a similar effect to this image in Photoshop. The aim is that the background and the effect colours can be changed as needed.</p>

<p>I only need the projection part of it, I don't need the cirlce at the bottom.</p>

<p>I mostly use vector programs and I'm not really good at Photoshop. I've tried to use the mesh fill tool in Corel draw X7 and the trace tools, but the result looks a little artificial.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SbUeV.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>You can do this fairly easily with two gradients and some masks.</p>

<ol>
<li>Black background</li>
<li>New Layer</li>
<li>Add white (reflected) gradient (Or whatever color you want)</li>
<li>Use <code>Edit Free Transform</code> to ""pinch"" one end to a point (Hold down
<kbd>Command/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Option/Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd> while you drag a top corner handle.)</li>
<li>Duplicate the gradient layer</li>
<li>Add a layer Mask to the duplicate</li>
<li>On the <strong>mask</strong> choose <code>Filter &gt; Render &gt; Fibers</code> (use whatever settings you want. more dark areas make the ""lasers"" seem spaced out more.)</li>
<li>Free Transform the masked layer the same way</li>
<li>Reduce the opacity of the ""fibers"" layer until you are happy</li>
<li>Add both gradients to a new Layer Group</li>
<li>Add a mask to the group</li>
<li>Add a gradient on the group mask to hide the bottom portion.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MnjGN.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You could refine further by motion blurring the fiber mask vertically, or using Levels/Curves to increase/reduce contrast of the mask, or applying separate masks to the gradient layers to control how much is hidden at the bottom.</p>

"How do I rename multiple selected layers in Photoshop CC?","18702","","<p>I was searching this for a while, but didn't find a proper answer.  Does anybody know how to rename multiple selected layers at the same time?  Any help will be appreciated.  Thanx!</p>
","<p>There is no native feature for renaming multiple layers, at least yet.</p>

<p>You can however start renaming a layer and use <kbd>TAB</kbd> to move to rename the next layer or <kbd>Shift+TAB</kbd> to rename the previous layer. This can be handy for smaller amount of layer renaming.</p>

<hr>

<p>Pro tip regarding, I would guess all of these exentions and scripts:</p>

<p>In the bottom of <a href=""http://blog.kam88.com/en/group-layer-renaming-script.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Group Layer Renaming script website</a> Matthew Rose mentions how you should use <kbd>cmd (in mac)</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl (in windows)</kbd> to select multiple groups instead of using <kbd>Shift</kbd>.</p>

<p>If you don't, you'll accidentally rename layers within the groups. This happens due to the way photoshop selects multiple layers when you hold down shift  <kbd>Shift</kbd>.</p>

<p>You can however get around it. </p>

<ol>
<li>Use <kbd>Shift</kbd> to select multiple groups</li>
<li>Then hold <kbd>cmd (in mac)</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl (in windows)</kbd> and click one of the arrows on the left side of those groups. This expands every selected groups.

<ul>
<li>At  this point you can see that all the layers in between the groups are selected.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Click again ( while still holding cmd ). This closes the selected groups.

<ul>
<li>At this point, if you click again you can see that only the first level of selected groups are selected.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Now you're ready to rename just the first level of groups you've selected.</li>
</ol>

<p><sub>At step #2, you can actually double click the <strong>first selected groups arrow</strong> and jump to step #4.</sub></p>

"Does InDesign have an Edit Artboard-like tool, like Illustrator has?","18696","","<p>The size of the poster I am making in InDesign keeps getting adjusted as I work on it. </p>

<p>When I changed its width from 60 inches wide to 55 inches wide using Document Setup, it made that change but also scrunched the contents of my poster together, maintaining my margins (I guess). </p>

<p>Is there a way to mimic Illustrator's Edit Artboard tool in InDesign where I easily modify the document size without it messing up my content?</p>
","<p>As of CS5, yes. It's called the Page tool, and you can read more about it <a href=""http://indesignsecrets.com/resizing-document-pages.php"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

"How to ensure that paint bucket tool fills region with EXACT color in Photoshop?","18574","","<p>I have selected the paint bucket tool in Photoshop, with a carefully selected foreground color, a tolerance of 8, and ""anti-alias"" and ""contiguous"" boxes UNchecked.</p>

<p>However, Photoshop nonetheless paints over the desired region of the image with some sort of ""gradient"" fill - the fill color is not EXACTLY my foreground color choice.</p>

<p>How can I ensure that the paint bucket tool fills the region with the EXACT foreground color in Photoshop?</p>

<p>ADDENDUM:</p>

<p>Here are before-and-after screenshots:</p>

<p>I'm not sure why you're experiencing that, if you post a screenshot of the result that would be helpful</p>

<hr>

<h2>Edit: A more precise way to achieve what you're trying to do...</h2>

"Techniques for very large image","18565","","<p>I need to do a poster, 8m width by 3.7m height, consisting of photographic elements that will be seen from varying distances. I've talked to the printer and they can do it at 150ppi's.</p>

<p>The issue here is how to work it. Using <a href=""http://www.vesterkopi.dk/Default.aspx?ID=1523"" rel=""nofollow"">this calculator</a> I've came to:</p>

<p>You need as much RAM as a machine can hold and you can afford. 3GB is scraping the bottom anymore. Especially for large files.</p>

<p>A separate drive (not partition) to use for scratch space will also help speeds.</p>

<p>A good video card with 1GB of RAM on it. Photoshop utilizes the GPU a great deal anymore.</p>

<p>""Professionals"" tend to immediately add RAM to almost every system. An adequate minimum would be about 4GB anymore, but even that can quickly be chewed up.</p>

<p>Faster processors and multiple processors also help quite a bit. Generally professionals aren't buying the low-end model of any computer. If anything, more professionals buy the high-end models, especially if they are working on print, flexo, or media other than, or in addition to, web and screen delivery.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HP0bF.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>The ""mountains"" metaphor you use to describe the ups and downs makes perfect sense if you're doing this in 3D software, which is actually the ideal place to do this.</p>

<p>Photoshop could be used, but it will be painful, tedious and ultimately destructive.</p>

<p>Destructive in the sense that if you're not happy with the pattern you'll have to start again.</p>

<p>Tedious in the sense that it's a lot of shape creation and snapping together of those shapes, something that Photoshop isn't good at at the vertex level that's required for polygon triangulation like this.</p>

<p>Painful because you're using software to do something it wasn't intended to make easier.</p>

<p>Because triangles are the base primitive of doing anything in 3D, this might be the ideal initiative to start with a 3D design app. 3ds Max and Maya have 30 day trials with full functionality... give them a shot at this. Make a plane with the resolution of triangles you need, then apply a noise modifier until you get a result you like.</p>

<p>Then have buckets of fun with lighting, materials and rendering settings.</p>

<p>What do you call the printing process where the logo becomes part of the shirt itself, and is less susceptible to damage?</p>
","<p>I believe what you are referring to is heat transfers from off the shelf that use an iron on graphic which is designed for personal usage.</p>

<p>There is also sublimation printing which still uses heat to transfer and typically the graphic is digitally printed on a special film:</p>

"What's the best way to animate an illustration for the web?","18423","","<p>I have a couple of illustrations done in Illustrator and I am planing to animate it for a website that I am working on, I've heard of <a href=""http://www.createjs.com/#!/CreateJS"">Create.js</a> toolkit with flash, but is it the best way to go or is there another ""better"" way of doing it?</p>

<p>Here's an example of the kind of animations I am aiming for: 
<a href=""http://kontramax.com/wp-content/uploads/envato/demo/coming_soon_machine/dark/"">http://kontramax.com/wp-content/uploads/envato/demo/coming_soon_machine/dark/</a></p>
","<p>There are a lot of ways to animate things on the web. There are even more ways to create animations then export to web animations. </p>

<p>There are huge benefits to designing animations in something like AfterEffects or Animate CC (which can both import Illustrator and Photoshop files) for the obvious reasons of division of labor and use of a graphical editor.</p>

<p>With that being said, <strong>you should always, in the end, compile to one of the following</strong>:</p>

<p>Limited interaction capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>GIF</li>
<li>Sprite</li>
<li>Video</li>
</ul>

<p>More fully interactive: </p>

<ul>
<li>Canvas</li>
<li>SVG</li>
<li>CSS </li>
<li>DOM based animation</li>
<li>WebGL</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I'll go into each in a little more detail.</p>

<hr>

<h3>GIF</h3>

<p>A GIF is a good way to go when the animations don't require much interaction, doesn't need to be sized dynamically, and are relatively small. Well made GIFs can be as detailed as the illustration you linked without any performance worries. Even minor interaction using a transparent overlay placed over it (or just a part of it) is possible.</p>

<p>Side note: there is now a <code>.gifv</code> format <a href=""https://imgur.com/blog/2014/10/09/introducing-gifv/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">created by Imgur</a> which converts GIF files on the fly into the WebM or MP4 video formats. This increases performance by reducing the end file size greatly. You might consider doing the same.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Sprite</h3>

<p>Another way to keep a smooth but highly styled animation is to use a sprite. Google uses this approach for things like <a href=""https://www.google.com/logos/doodles/2015/ddl-5754944174948352.8-ani.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">logo animation</a>. Another great example is <a href=""http://foxblog.css-fox.com/alexander-engzell-portfolio/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Alexander Engzell's old website</a> which had a sick typography animation using this approach. This is optimal when a GIF would be too large but you don't need much interaction.</p>

<p>I've also seen a very interesting JavaScript animation that resembles a sprite or GIF <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/cleanup-tool/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">used by Google</a> (hover the Chrome image in the top left - it requires being in Chrome) but uses an animated mask instead. I'm guessing they used this approach to limit the total file size.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Video</h3>

<p>We've gained great capabilities regarding video in recent years. The <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element let's us customize the way we interact and use videos like never before. Now we can make use of <a href=""http://y.co/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">full-screen background videos</a> easily and do things like <a href=""http://codepen.io/ollieRogers/pen/lfeLc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">go frame by frame on scroll</a>. I also noticed that FaceBook uses video for <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wpvGk.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">some simple animations</a> when welcoming users on their feed around special events. The benefits are that it can be compressed to a pretty small file size and can do a more wide range of animations (anything that video editing software can do). As such, if someone can make a sick video then it's fairly easy to turn that into a fantastic addition to a webpage. </p>

<p>Obviously, video's aren't good for the majority of animations on the web (e.g. button transitions, etc.), so don't use them everywhere.</p>

<hr>

<p>With all this being said, if you want the animation to be dynamically generated, when you need more than really basic interaction, when you want to create 3D environments, and in many other cases, a GIF, sprite, or video simply won't cut it. Once this is decided, there are several other options, the best of which is dependent on your animation and needs.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Canvas</h3>

<p>I don't have statistics, but most web animations I've seen use <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Canvas</a>. Canvas is great to use because of its performance and flexibility in creation. It only uses one browser (DOM) element due to the fact that it just paints - like on a real canvas - things on top of each other. By keeping track of what's painted and where with JavaScript, we can create some pretty awesome animations and even games. </p>

<p>However, the primary drawback to using Canvas is its relative difficulty to scale. Often times, depending on the animation of course, it is more difficult to make a responsive Canvas animation than it is using other means. Another downside is that having much content on a Canvas is not very SEO friendly because canvas elements aren't crawlable (you can work around this by putting some visually hidden HTML of the content if applicable). On the same note, things like text selection for users is difficult with Canvas (especially without using a library like CreateJS).</p>

<p>A prime use of Canvas is Google's <a href=""http://www.google.com/doodles/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">doodles</a>, which are often done in Canvas. When they have a game or interactive animation, they use Canvas every time that I've looked. If there is no interaction, they'll use a GIF or sprite.</p>

<p>There are a lot of great libraries to help working with Canvas easier, though it's definitely not required depending on what needs to be done. Among the ones made just for Canvas are <a href=""http://www.createjs.com/#!/CreateJS"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CreateJS</a> (which you can export to from Animate CC), <a href=""http://www.pixijs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pixi.js</a>, <a href=""http://paperjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PaperJS</a>, <a href=""http://kineticjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">KineticJS</a>, and <a href=""http://fabricjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FabricJS</a> (placed in order of my impression of them). An After Effects plugin named <a href=""https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bodymovin</a> can also export to Canvas (or SVG<sup>[1]</sup>) and has a build in animation engine. </p>

<p>Of course, you can also pair larger animations libraries like GSAP with Canvas easily. For something as detailed as the illustration you linked I'd recommend using some type of framework, but for a lot of things they aren't really necessary, just useful - especially if you know how to use one of them already.</p>

<hr>

<h3>SVG</h3>

<p>Another incredibly powerful way to animate things on the web in an easily responsive way is to use an SVG (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics#Overview"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scalable Vector Graphics</a>). They fulfill their purpose - being <em>scalable vectors</em> - well. Many find using SVGs confusing at first, but most things like SVG's <a href=""http://sarasoueidan.com/blog/svg-coordinate-systems/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">coordinate system and transforms</a> have great articles explaining them.</p>

<p>One of the many lovely things about SVG is that it can be animated with JavaScript, pure CSS (including <code>:hover</code> states, <code>transform</code>s, <code>transition</code>s, and <code>animation</code>s), or <a href=""http://css-tricks.com/guide-svg-animations-smil/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SMIL animations</a> (the ""native"" way to animate things with SVG - but IE doesn't support it at all and it's <a href=""https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/5o0yiO440LM%5B126-150%5D"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">being gradually depreciated</a>). I recommend trying to use CSS first and then JavaScript whenever it's not (relatively) simple in CSS. For morphing SVG elements, it's practically necessary to use a tool like <a href=""http://greensock.com/morphSVG"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GSAP's MorphSVG plugin</a> unless you're okay with only partial support, in which case SMIL might be acceptable.</p>

<p>Since SVG elements can be in any shape, they can be used to create <a href=""http://codepen.io/Zeaklous/pen/kyGqm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">some cool effects</a>. Sarah Drasner made some helpful <a href=""http://css-tricks.com/weighing-svg-animation-techniques-benchmarks/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">performance benchmarks</a> regarding SVG animations that show which ways of animating SVG is best performance wise. </p>

<p>Depending on the animation (and need of browser support), a library like <a href=""http://snapsvg.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Snap.svg</a> or GSAP may be useful, but often times CSS and, if needed, a little custom JS is all that is required. With that being said, an After Effects plugin called <a href=""https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bodymovin</a> and a Flash extension called <a href=""https://github.com/TomByrne/Flash2Svg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Flash 2 SVG</a> can be really helpful for creating SVG animations.  </p>

<p>For more detail, take a look at <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/a/68322/23061"">this related post</a> specifically on animating SVG elements.</p>

<p><sub>P.S. It's best to use SVGs in an <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag or embedded directly in an <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> XML element if it's interactive and as a background image if its not interactive, but <a href=""http://www.sitepoint.com/add-svg-to-web-page/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">there are other ways</a> to do it as well.</sub></p>

<hr>

<h3>CSS</h3>

<p>In my experience, CSS animations and transitions should primarily be used for UI elements and other basic transitions and animations. Even then, sometimes using a JS animation library like <a href=""https://greensock.com/gsap"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GSAP</a> or <a href=""http://julian.com/research/velocity/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Velocity.js</a> for UI animations/transitions is appropriate. It really depends on the type of behavior you want and whether or not it's convenient to do in CSS.</p>

<p>While we can create <a href=""http://codepen.io/Zeaklous/pen/rsitf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">crazy</a> <a href=""http://codepen.io/Zeaklous/pen/akxqt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">things</a> with pure CSS, it's generally harder to create intricate illustrations like the one you provide as an example using CSS, even when manipulating images in addition. Complex CSS animations are often times more difficult to maintain than their JavaScript counterparts as well. The other downside is that CSS animations are <a href=""https://css-tricks.com/controlling-css-animations-transitions-javascript/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tough to change with JavaScript</a> and it doesn't play too well when mixed with JavaScript.</p>

<p>With that being said, simple interactions using transitions and animations should usually use CSS; you should default to it. To start learning how to animate using CSS, check out my <a href=""http://zachsaucier.com/blog/blog/2015/02/19/an-intro-to-web-animation/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">introduction to web animation</a>.</p>

<p>You can also find helpful animations and easing functions in libraries like <a href=""http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Animate.css</a> that you can pull from and add to your own projects. You'll almost never need the whole library, take only the parts you want.</p>

<hr>

<h3>DOM based JavaScript animation</h3>

<p>DOM based JavaScript animations are fairly straight forward. They have a bad rep because of terrible animation libraries like jQuery's <code>animate()</code>, but they can be particularly high performing, especially when using the web animations API (discussed below), or a specialized animation library like <a href=""https://greensock.com/gsap"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GSAP</a>, <a href=""http://julian.com/research/velocity/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Velocity.js</a>, or <a href=""http://mojs.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mo.js</a> (GSAP even has <a href=""https://greensock.com/jquery-gsap-plugin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a special plugin</a> to replace jQuery's <code>.animate</code> specifically). Using such a library, they can often outperform other types of animations for more intensive animations, such as animating a whole lot of elements.</p>

<p>The main reason why you'd need to use a DOM based animation is if you have a lot of user animation or complex timelines involving already-made DOM elements. Often times it's best to try and use something like Canvas over the DOM for reasons already specified. </p>

<p>Libraries like GSAP let us do crazy things like <a href=""http://codepen.io/Zeaklous/pen/sGbku"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">slow an animation on hover</a> by keeping track of the animation matrices. In this way, DOM based animations can be more customized and interactive than any other form of animating when done well. The only down side is that sometimes, depending on how it's built and what it needs to do, it won't perform well. </p>

<hr>

<h3>WebGL</h3>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WebGL</a> is a way to create primarily 3D works. It has some <a href=""http://www.chromeexperiments.com/webgl/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">awesome projects</a> that you should check out. It's not to be used on every web page, obviously, but it's important to mention.</p>

<p>It actually animates DOM elements to create 3D (and 2D) environments which is awesome because of the potential it has. When using a library, WebGL falls back to using Canvas but still doesn't have great support on mobile and can be performance heavy. Generally it's pretty clear when you need to use WebGL or not.</p>

<p>From my experience, using a WebGL library is practically necessary. Thankfully there are some good ones. <a href=""http://threejs.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ThreeJS</a> is by far the most common I've seen followed by <a href=""http://www.pixijs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PixiJS</a>. A WebGL framework like <a href=""https://aframe.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A-Frame</a> can also make picking it up and creating basic things pretty easy. </p>

<hr>

<h3>A note on the Web Animations API (WAAPI)</h3>

<p>The <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">web animations API</a> is an attempt to standardize how animations are implemented and maintained across browsers paired with performance improvements. It is meant to be used with DOM elements including SVG. It resembles how a CSS animations is structured (in a JS looking form) but adds capabilities such as a timeline and improved performance. </p>

<p>It improves performance by putting animations on the compositor thread (for more details check out <a href=""https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/08/animating-like-you-just-dont-care-with-element-animate/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this great post</a> on the subject). For an introduction to how to use it, check out the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mozilla docs</a> or <a href=""https://pawelgrzybek.com/intro-to-the-web-animations-api/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this introductory post</a>.</p>

<p>You may ask, ""<em>Will this replace JavaScript animation libraries?</em>"" The answer is ""<em>Hopefully some</em>"". It's beneficial for everyone for the native browser animation engines to improve and, as they do, some less powerful animation libraries will become useless. With that being said, more powerful animations libraries will still have additional benefits like <a href=""http://greensock.com/forums/topic/11247-web-animations-api-and-gsap/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the ones GSAP noted</a>. Whether or not you need a library once WAAPI is widely supported is still determined by yours needs.</p>

<p>WAAPI currently <a href=""http://caniuse.com/#feat=web-animation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">doesn't have good support</a> but can be used with <a href=""https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a polyfill</a> in production today. It looks like it'll continue to get better and get more support.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Some notes on performance</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Avoid using <a href=""http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">non-performant properties</a> or <a href=""http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2009/03/27/reflows-repaints-css-performance-making-your-javascript-slow/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">causing reflows/repaints</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid animating a bunch of elements on the page as they are more intensive and can also be a pain to change later on. </p></li>
<li><p>When using CSS, use a <code>transition</code> over an animation whenever possible (within reason). They perform better and are generally easier to work with. </p></li>
<li><p>Intelligently use the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/will-change"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>will-change</code></a> property on large elements that you're going to animate so the browser knows ahead of time. For more details and suggestions about it read something like <a href=""https://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-css-will-change-property/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this SitePoint article</a> on the subject.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid <code>setInterval</code> and opt for <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> when doing timings in JavaScript (good animation libraries like GSAP do this for you if you use their timelines).</p></li>
<li><p>When you can, use the web animations API because it has capabilities for animating with other methods in JavaScript don't have.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>A note on Flash</h3>

<p><strong>You should never run Flash in the final product</strong>. JavaScript animations perform better, are more dynamic, are more easily edited, don't require any downloads, work across more platforms (Flash doesn't work on most tablets/phones), and are more responsive than bulky old Flash ones. They also aren't very accessible and are not SEO friendly.</p>

<p>With that being said, Animate CC (a rebranding of Flash) is a useful way to create animations and can export to Canvas using <a href=""http://www.createjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Create.js</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h3>In conclusion</h3>

<p>There are usually multiple methods you can use to create an animation. The best one depends on what you want it to do, and sometimes there isn't a clear better method. Often times I find myself using multiple on the same project. The important thing is to <strong>think critically</strong>, to understand exactly how you want the animation to behave, and to decide on the method based on that. It also helps if you've worked in each a bit.</p>

"How to make object pasted into image look natural?","18167","","<p>Is there any Photoshop 101 / techniques  on how to properly move object so that object moved don't boldly scream ""Photoshop!"" at the viewer.</p>

<p>note: I am not asking about the video specifically, I am asking about moving people from probably different place in general</p>
","<p>After 5 hours of learning I have compiled these:</p>

<h2>Mindset</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Make sure the placed image ratio is good</strong> to make it more realistic. This can be attained by checking with the other object in the output picture, like trees, or other peoples' height. You are not going to place human with the size much smaller than the other human at the same picture. Similarly, you also must not place a person with the height higher than a tree.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get the right perspective</strong>. Sometimes, when an object is placed in an odd perspective, image is going to look very bold that it has been photoshopped or copy pasted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lighting</strong>. It is important to pay attention to light source, like the sun, and make sure our object is appropriate with output background light source. This can be done by adjusting the lighting of object and adding shadow with referencing other shadow in output image.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Tools (to make edges more realistic)</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Layer masking.</strong> If moving people, hair can look awful if just plainly moved. Masking allows us to further tweak our selection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Refine edge.</strong> <em>This tool allows you to control many aspect of the edge of your selection</em> (desired object to move), like Edge Detection (brushing the edges of object and let photoshop do its job, usually around dog fur), Feather (Soften the area of selection), Smooth (reduce pointiness of your selection), Contrast (somewhat opposite of smooth), and Shift Edge (moving feather far or nearer the selection, usually to remove excess background color near the edges). <em>REFERENCE: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lDr2Nd8Yl4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lDr2Nd8Yl4</a></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Layer Matting</strong>. Inside we have many sub-tools to work on, like Color Decontamination (spread out soft mask around the edge, usually for hair to catch other hair that accidentally masked or can be used similarly to Shift Edge), Remove Matte (soften edge of sharp graphic or pixalated, raster look). <em>REFERENCE: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6K_htNQPPA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6K_htNQPPA</a></em></p></li>

","<p>You have to be a little careful with the definitions.</p>

<h3>24 bit per pixel and 32 bit per pixel</h3>

<p>“24 bit” usually means 24 bits total per pixel, with 8 bits per channel for red, green and blue, or 16,777,216 total colours. This is sometimes referred to as 24 bit RGB.</p>

<p>“32 bit” also usually means 32 bits total per pixel, and 8 bits per channel, with an additional 8 bit alpha channel that’s used for transparency. 16,777,216 colours again. This is sometimes referred to as 32 bit RGBA.</p>

<p>24 bit and 32 bit can mean the same thing, in terms of possible colours. It’s also worth noting that transparency doesn’t need to be sent to your display, because displays are opaque (you can’t see through your display to what’s behind it, unless you’re Tony Stark).</p>

<h3>32 bit per channel</h3>

<p>Also, 32 bit occasionally means 32 bits per channel (128 bits total per pixel). And, a lot of the time 32 bit per channel uses floating point numbers, rather than integers. (I’m happy to add more detail on floating point vs integer, if you’d like.)</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://openexr.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">OpenEXR</a> format supports 32 bit float channels. That might sound excessive, but it’s often used for VFX and rendered material, where heavy processing or colour correction may be involved, and large files are less of a concern.</p>

<h3>16 bit per pixel or 16 bit per channel?</h3>

<p>“16 bit” can typically mean two different things: 16 bits per pixel <em>or</em> 16 bits per channel. 16 bits per pixel works out to be 65,536 possible colours, and it definitely looks worse than 24 bits per pixel. 16 bits per channel means 281,474,976,710,656 total colours — well beyond human perception, but handy for processing.</p>

<h3>RGB or CMYK?</h3>

<p>All the above information assumes you’re working with RGB or RGBA images. If an image is CMYK, it could be 8 bit per channel and 32 bit per pixel, with 8 bits for cyan, magenta, yellow and black channels.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am wondering if the human eye could tell the difference between 40-bit, 48-bit, etc. color depth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think 8 bit per channel (24 bit per pixel) is on the fringe of what the human eye can easily distinguish, but that’s only part of the story. Processing can cause rounding and clipping, so additional colour depth can push errors beyond the point where humans and display technology can see them.</p>

<p>That is one of the reasons why it’s common for RAW camera formats to be 10, 12 or even 14 bits per channel, which works out to be 30, 36 or 42 bits per pixel. It’s also common for those working on photos to import RAW to a 16 bit per channel document for further manipulation. Pro video recording can be 10 bits per channel or higher, too.</p>

<p>And, in cases where you might not think there’s any processing going on, there might be — colour management alone can introduce additional processing.</p>

<p>8 bits per channel means there’s only 256 levels of intensity, which really isn’t much. Common causes for rounding errors to be visible when using 8 bits per channel:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using gradients stacked on top of each other, where layers aren’t 100% opacity.</li>
<li>Gradients drawn without decent dithering.</li>
<li>Shadows with large blurs.</li>
<li>Blurred objects.</li>
<li>Blending modes and other compositing of two or more layers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>bpp vs bpc</h3>

<p>Now might be a good time to mention the shorthand that’s often used for <code>bits per pixel</code>, <code>bpp</code> and <code>bits per channel</code>, <code>bpc</code>. It’s common to write <code>32bpp</code> etc when talking about these things, to remove the ambiguity of saying <code>32 bit</code>.</p>

<h3>Dynamic range and gamma</h3>

<p>Dynamic range should also be factored in. It’s typical for displays to target sRGB (gamma of 2.2). Wider dynamic range means the number of possible values are stretched further, so more colour resolution is needed.</p>

<h3>Is 8 bits per channel enough for final asset delivery?</h3>

<p>Yes, most of the time, depending on the use.</p>

<h3>Is 8 bits per channel enough for creation?</h3>

<p>Sometimes. But, often it is not.</p>

"How to denote time?

But we all know that it's not that common. Maybe it is in engineering, but certainly not in design or everyday life.</p>

<p>I've seen quite a few ways to display time and one of those uses ' to denote minutes and '' to denote seconds. (Like in John Cage's 4′33″) I may be wrong but it seems obvious that this is ""inspired"" by notation for angles. Therefor I'm wondering wether it's ok to use ° (degree) symbol to denote hours. What do you think?</p>

<p>e.g. 1°35' (for one hour and thirty five minutes)</p>

<p>Additional information:<br>
I plan to use it to denote short time spans, durations. e.g. ""It will take about 2°15' to finish X."" </p>
","<p>The question asks about prime and double-prime symbols for minutes and seconds, which have been used for ages, and even feature in a piece of piano music (or what would be piano music, if there were a note played).</p>

<p>However it then veers off from the question title to ask about extending this to using degree &deg; for hours.</p>

<p><strong>Don't.</strong></p>

<p>Prime/Double prime &prime; and &Prime; can mean angular minutes and seconds or time minutes and seconds, or even feet and inches, but their variable meaning is context-dependent and easily grasped. The degree symbol universally means degrees: to force into a square-shaped hole for hours would be to make it unexpected and difficult to understand.</p>

<p>Do any tools exist to quickly estimate a specific, human readable term for a color given an explicit hex/other color value?</p>

<p>Quick human apraisals of what a color are usually result in uselessly vague terms like ""blue"" or ""red"" instead of ""Azure"" or ""Magenta"", so ""just eyeball it"" isn't enough IMO.</p>
","<p>Lauren's answer is correct. Color <em>names</em> are mostly arbitrary, even without taking into account what marketing departments come up with (not to mention cultural and language differences).</p>

<p>In the art world, there are names for certain paint colors that <em>are</em> pretty much standard, because their formulas are centuries old and because painters need to know that if they buy Cobalt Blue from Amazon, it will be the same as the Cobalt Blue they used to buy at Honest Joe's Burgers and Art Supplies (""Feeding starving artists since 1927"") before they went out of business. </p>

<p>There is also a subset of color names based on nature, but nature is notoriously fickle: ""rose pink"" covers a recognizable but very imprecise swath of hue, saturation and chroma.</p>

<p>So searching for <em>precision</em> outside of a color system such as Pantone or Munsell, or even W3C, is a lost cause. You're going to find the same names applied to different colors, and different names applied to the same colors, depending on where you look. Naming colors is subjective and imprecise. Worse, when it comes to the Internet, you have no control at all over the display settings of any given site visitor. Your ""Pale Gold"" becomes ""Mustard"" pretty easily.</p>

<p>There is an <a href=""http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/#6195ED"">online tool</a> that will give you a usable name (not <em>the</em> name) for any given RGB hex value. The names are accurate enough, and according to the site were picked by editing together various lists (including Crayola's). You can also download the javascript. Don't take this as some kind of absolute or ""Standard""; it's one person's synthesis from several sources that were in conflict often enough that he mentions the fact specifically. And keep in mind that the actual on-screen rendering for a given hex value is a wild variable over which you have no control.</p>

"Reduce image size in photoshop without compromising text readability","17966","","<p>I found a similar thread that gave <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/8602/reduce-file-size-without-losing-quality"">some great pointers</a>, but still doesn't solve my issue.</p>

<p>My boss asked me to create a corporate presentation, and I had the unfortunate idea of doing it all in photoshop (I figured it would allow greater flexibility than the usual powerpoint).</p>

<p>I created 24 slides at 3000x2000px and 300dpi, for a total size of 69Mb.</p>

<p>Now obviously this is not ok for a presentation that must be sent via email to multiple clients, so i decided to reduce its size using the technique described in the thread above.</p>

<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eydhU.png"" alt=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/93652605/before.png""></p>

<p>It all worked great and the file size is now down to 4Mb, only problem is that the text is starting to blur. Since it appears that text makes up for only about 3% of the total file size (it's the images that are bloating up the Mb count), I was wondering if it's possible to reduce the image quality without ""touching"" the text layers.</p>

<p>In powerpoint you can have a bad quality background image and write perfectly sharp text on in. Even at 640x480 text looks good in powerpoint. On the contrary, if I lower the res in photoshop, the text turns crappy.</p>

<p>So is there a way to add hi res text to a low res ""background"" image in photoshop?</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE: after a long afternoon of work, and thanks to John's help, my presentation is now perfect, so I thought I'd give back to the community an share a couple more things I've learned working on this project. </p>

<p>This is what the text looks like after the PDF conversion when faux styles is applied <a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/93652605/PDF.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PDF with faux</a> and this is what it looks like when you strip off all styles from it <a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/93652605/PDF%20no%20faux.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PDF no faux</a>.</p>

<p>As you can see, like John said, if you have faux styles applied, the text is automatically rasterized and this creates a lot of artifacts during the conversion. On the contrary, if there are no faux styles, the text stays in its vector form and, even when you reduce the image quality a lot (see the picture on the right side of the image), the characters remain tack sharp.</p>

<p>So I went ahead and re-formatted all the text boxes in my presentation. Again something went wrong <a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/93652605/error.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">see here</a>. As you can see, sometimes the PDF version screws up your text. As silly as this may sound, I found that this only happens when you write too much text in a single box. All text longer than 6 or 7 lines got screwed up. Splitting it into two different text boxes with 3 lines each fixed this. The same problem happened on multiple slides, and the same solution worked to correct the problem on all of them.</p>

<p>Last but not least, I managed to decrease the total file size some more by going to file->Automate->PDF presentation (not sure about the exact translation cause my photoshop is in italian) instead of the usual file->Save As->Photoshop PDF. Try for yourself, with the same compression values the first option yields smaller files (some 30-50% smaller!!). So I guess there's some hidden parameter that the ""Automate"" command sets somewhere that the ""Save As"" does not.</p>

<p>I now have a 2,8Mb presentation with razor sharp text and low-res images (still looking good ad 100% zoom, artifacts start showing only at 120%). Thank you stackexchange! :)</p>
","<p>For something like this with lots of text, you can greatly reduce the file size of a PDF saved in Photoshop by making sure that the text is exported as vector.</p>

<p>The reason your text is <em>not</em> being exported as vector is because you've got some of Photoshop's ""Faux Styles"" applied to your text. Any time you have one of these (Faux Bold, Faux Italic, Small Caps), the text will get rasterized in the PDF.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1QN3u.png"" alt=""Faux Styles""></p>

<p>Avoid these whenever possible. Use a heavier weight font from the same family if it exists.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for you this means you'll have to do a lot of re-formatting; it's up to you to decide if the filesize vs. quality is worth the commitment of time</p>

<p>I've never used Expression myself, but generally when downsizing images, on all programs there will be blurriness as the program has to recalculate the pixels. If you have to resize an image, a tip is to always do it by half, if not quarter. This makes the recalculation easier for the program and gives crisper results.</p>

<p>Alternative answer: Consider using Adobe Fireworks. Fireworks is so much easier to use once you get the hang of it for producing web graphics. </p>

<p>Long boring lecture answer:</p>

<p>The ""Slice-n-Dice"" method is a bit dated. It was popular a decade ago but these days it's really not the recommended approach. I'd suggest:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use whatever app (AI/PSD) to 'sketch' the site. Feel free to go high fidelity, but treat it merely as a mock-up.</p></li>
<li><p>once you have that established, start building the site. Dive into the HTML/CSS/JS.</p></li>
<li><p>as needed, jump into PhotoShop to create the individual graphical elements that you need. </p></li>

<p>Why? Well, designing in photoshop doesn't account for the medium you're working in. It's a fixed canvas and the web is not a fixed canvas, nor is it even standard canvas. It leads the team towards a pixel-perfect idea and the web simply isn't pixel perfect.</p>

","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NdUrG.png"" alt=""Target Path in Photoshop""></p>

<p>The outline you're seeing is called the <code>Target Path</code>. There's a few behaviours that cause it to appear.</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating a shape layer.</li>
<li>Selecting a shape layer.</li>

</ul>

<p>It can be turned off when it appears, but it can not be disabled completely. It seems like there's a chance the behaviour may be altered in a future update, due to the feedback Adobe have received since the Photoshop CS6 beta release — those who design for screen seem to find it fairly annoying (myself included).</p>

<p>It existed in Photoshop CS5 and older versions, but when it appeared has changed.</p>

<p>You can turn it off from the View menu.</p>

<p>I use the command to turn it off so often that I changed my keyboard shortcut to just Command-H, but the default is Command-shift-H (this can be changed via <code>Keyboard Shortcuts</code> under the <code>Edit</code> menu.</p>

<p>If you have the <code>Path Selection Tool</code> or the <code>Direct Selection Tool</code>, you can press return to hide the Target path.</p>

<p>In the Paths panel, clicking on the space below the path items will also hide the Target Path, as will shift-clicking the item itself.</p>

<blockquote>Command-shift-H hides the Target Path, making it far easier to edit effects like inner shadow, that are near the edge of a vector shape. Hiding the Target Path works almost all of the time, even when the Color Picker or Gradient Fill window is open (but surprisingly, not when the Gradient Editor window is open).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Making a vector layer visible or clicking on the canvas with the Path Selection or Direct Selection tool will bring back the path outline, as will hitting Command-shift-H a second time. Being able to hide the path outline was possible in Photoshop CS5, but it’s so handy it deserves to be mentioned again here.</blockquote>

"How to resize icon sets in Photoshop?","17761","","<p>When looking online for icons to use on my websites, I often find very well designed free icon sets.</p>

<p>However, often these icon sets are only available on a single size - for instance the icon set <a href=""http://designdeck.co.uk/a/1245"">http://designdeck.co.uk/a/1245</a>) only comes in a 48x48px size.</p>

<p>What would be the best approach to resize this icon set to 24x24px or 32x32px in Photoshop?</p>

<p>I haven't been able to find any good tutorial for newbies online. Thanks</p>
","<p>This particular set is composed of shapes and text, so resizing is not going to impact quality, but you can't just downsize these icons. An icon is a special kind of infographic. Its purpose is to communicate easily-recognized information at any given size, so your first step, before you start scaling anything, is to identify what parts of the icon carry the information. These must remain legible, the rest is disposable. </p>

<p>In this case, the circle <em>shapes</em> don't carry any information, but in several cases their <em>colors</em> do, so you can't eliminate them. You <em>can</em> scale them freely, though. The graphical elements in the circles carry the vital information, so you must treat them more carefully.</p>

<p>Here's how to scale this set from 48 px to 24 px, working from the PSD:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Open the layer set for one of the icons. Let's pick the Google+ icon.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the circle and choose <code>Edit &gt; Transform &gt; Scale</code>. Be sure that the center point in the Transform control proxy is selected, and toggle the link between the W and H fields so your scaling is proportional.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BAjFX.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ul>
<li>Enter 50 in the W or H field and press Enter/Return.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, your circle is 24 px in diameter, but the ""g"" and the ""+"" are too large.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Select <em>both</em> the ""g"" shape layer and the ""+"" text layer, and choose <code>Edit &gt; Transform &gt; Scale</code> as before, but this time, enter 80 in the W or H field and press Enter/Return.</p></li>
<li><p>Nudge the ""g+"" layers to center them in the circle.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This reduced icon still conveys the same information clearly, but is the size you need and will be consistent with the rest of the set when you have scaled them.</p>

<p>Treat the rest of the icons similarly. The circles define the boundaries, so they are all scaled 50%. The amount that you scale each graphic will vary (the Skype icon works better at 75% than 80%), so you'll have to experiment a bit. Experience will teach you as you go.</p>

<p>Different sizes will need different proportions and appropriate scaling amounts. The important thing is to differentiate what is information and what is decoration. You can scale or throw away decoration; you must keep information legible.</p>

<p>Pictorial ""icons"" and icons that have a lot of detail can't simply be scaled. They must be <em>simplified</em> when reduced in size so that the information remains clear, so you must create a different icon for smaller sizes. The same principle is followed in designing logos -- what works well on a poster may need to be greatly simplified for a business card -- and in type design.</p>

"Does Photoshop Elements fully support PSD files from ""full"" Photoshop?","17756","","<p>I'm a web developer and on a regular basis I need to work with <code>.psd</code> files that have been provided by a designer. My needs are low - mostly I just toggle layer visibility and then save as <code>.png</code>, which I further slice and dice with Paint.NET (my tool of choice because I'm more proficient with it).</p>

<p>Now, so far I've been using a... <em>borrowed</em>... Photoshop, but I'd like to finally purchase a copy of my own. Unfortunately it's pretty expensive, so I'm wondering if the cheaper Photoshop Elements can do the trick, too? Will it support all the layer blending effects and other tricks that artists are so fond of using? If I turn off a layer will I still get the same picture as I would in the full Photoshop?</p>
","<p>From <a href=""http://forums.adobe.com/message/4829764"" rel=""nofollow"">adobe forums</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...if the file is a CMYK file you won't work well with that in PSE, and
  if the file contains composite layers or layer sets/groups you will
  need an add-on to be able to view the folder contents in PSE...</p>

<p>and also</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...PSE will let you save as a pdf, but it's a very basic kind of pdf,
  lacking much of the info that a print shop would expect to find in the
  file...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the answer would be - no Adobe Photoshop Elements does not fully support all .psd files created with Adobe Photoshop.</p>

<p>But in your case it might work since you do mostly really basic work with it, but as soon as the designer uses some advanced feature, you might not see it in Elements or have problems working with that layer (and judging by the .psd files I get lately they fancy using all possible combinations of different features).</p>

"Will changing image resolution from 300 to 72 without resampling reduce the quality?","17669","","<p>This is a rather stupid question so I apologise in advance but I just wanted to be 100% sure! I have a set of photos at 300 ppi that are 800 pixels by 800 pixels and need to convert them in Photoshop to 72 ppi for web use (at the same size: 800px by 800px).</p>

<p>In Photoshop if I use the 'Resize Image' option and uncheck 'Resample Image' and then change the resolution to 72 obviously the pixel size will stay the same (but the physical dimensions in cm/inches will change). Presumably this will cause no quality loss at all compared to the original as all pixels will be retained there will just be less pixels per inch (as many as are required for web)?</p>

<p>I just wanted to make sure as one of my designers told me it would degrade the image quality but I don't think that's right?</p>

<p>The final image file used on the web will be a jpg but presumably in this same scenario TIFs would be the best source file type so as to not save to jpg twice (and suffer the associated image degradation)?</p>

  <p>800 pixels by 800 pixels and need to convert them in Photoshop to 72 ppi for web use (at the same size: 800px by 800px).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no conversion to do. If they're 800 pixels by 800 pixels, that's it, they're the size you need. However, 300ppi at 800px by 800px is like a 2.3"" by 2.3"" picture, so are you sure the files are currently at 800pixels by 800pixels?</p>

<hr>

<p>There's really no 72 dpi for web. This is an estimated resolution.</p>

<p>The web, and any computer in general, displays pixels with different monitors fitting different amounts of pixels into different amounts of space. 72dpi was an average to go by. If your monitor has a resolution (I really mean size in pixels, which isn't quite the same as resolution) of 1920 x 1050, then there are 1920 pixels across horizontally and 1050 vertically. So if your monitor's this size, and the display is 19"" wider, then your screen displays about 100 pixels per inch.</p>

<p>Digital deviced just display the pixels. Physical size of those pixels will vary from device to device. DPI settings in files only affect the printed outcome.</p>

<hr>

<p>To further explain this: Pixels are the dots, and DPI only comes into play when we're talking about how big to make those dots on paper, or measuring a doc in physical units of distance, like inches.</p>

<p>An 800pixel by 800pixel document at 300dpi settings still has the same amount of information in it as as an 800pixel by 800pixel document at 72dpi settings. The only difference is that when printed, the document at 300dpi will be printed as a square about 2.6"" x 2.6"". The 72dpi document will be about 11.1"" x 11.1"". The difference is, th pixels, which are the dots, are stuffed into a physical space according to their DPI.</p>

<p>Now, if we're working with documents that are set up in inches, as in an 8"" by 8"" doc, things change a bit. All bitmap images have pixels, or dots if you'd like to think of them that way. Every image that's not a vector has a height and width in pixels, and a user setting up and viewing their document in measurement of inches is just a feature for human beings to think of their documents in measuring units they're familiar with. This is dependent on having a DPI, whether it's one, or three hundred.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An 8"" by 8"" document in 300dpi is equal to a 2400pixel by 2400pixel document, because f
or every inch, there are 300 pixels in it.</p></li>
<li><p>An 8"" by 8"" document in 72dpi is equal to a 576pixel by 576pixel document, because there are 72 pixels in every inch.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you were to set up an 8"" by 8"" document and draw on it, add rasterized text, etc, and the document was set up in inches, at 72dpi, then you converted it to 300dpi, now we're adding pixels by scaling the document up from 576pixels by 576pixels to 2400pixels by 2400pixels, and any non-vector images will lose some quality (on your screen mostly, but this is a whole other discussion), or at least not truly be the quality of a document originally designed at 300dpi.</p>

<p>But, if you're starting out by setting up the document in pixel measurements, then these wont change. At this point, the only affect changing the DPI settings will have is on the physical size of it when it's printed.</p>

"How to match my layout grid with my margins, columns and baseline grid in indesign","17639","","<p>Please forgive me if this questions sounds a little off, but I'm struggling to understand it let alone explain to you.</p>

<p>When setting up a document in InDesign, I want all of my columns and grids to be within relationship with one another. To do this I understand that everything should be based on my leading value. </p>

<p>For example my leading value is 12pt, so in relation to that I set up the gutters on my margins and lay out grid (guides) to be 12pt and also I do the same in the grid preferences. </p>

<p>After my Margins and columns are set and my baseline grid is turned on, I then create my layout grid and this is where my brain simply explodes because the layout grid never lines up with the baseline grid when working with a aspect ratio. </p>

<p>What I'm hoping to achieve from this answer is for me to be able to setup all of my grids and margins on any size page, set at any leading value at any aspect ratio. </p>

","<p>I'll start off by pointing out that fitting a 5x7 box into a 2x3 area (plus some gutters (which will only make the area thinner rather than fatter). You may find those horizontal guides very restrictive here. You can't even fit 7 into 5 anyway; they're both primes. </p>

<p>What we can do, however, is to at least get those horizontal guides to line up with the baseline. I'll show you my <em>fairly</em> visual way of creating simple grids like this. I'll write as if I'm making a grid from scratch:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start by looking at your leading. As you want to fit 1x1 and 2x2 boxes into your grid, you'll need the leading to be the same as the gutter width (or the square isn't going to line up perfectly when it is 2x2 or larger)... I'm going to use 10.8pt here (no particular reason).</li>
<li>Choose the number columns and set your gutter width the same as the leading chosen for the baseline grid. I'll use 5 columns too.</li>
<li>Experiment with squares, lining them up with the baseline grid (ignore the current columns width!). How many lines tall and wide your squares are will influence how much margin you end up with.</li>
<li>If we settle on 8 lines then the square is 30.48mm wide; this is the column width that we want. A4 page width is 210, we have 5 columns and 10.8pt (3.81mm) leading &amp; gutters so add up the width of all your 5 columns and 4 gutters (167.64mm in this case) and subtract that off your page width and divide by two so you get what a single margin would be ((210mm-167.64mm)/2 = 21.18mm). Insert this as your margins.</li>
<li>Repeat this for the height/top and bottom margins.</li>
</ol>

<p>You'll end up with something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/18POr.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>(I've nudged my grid up a bit too at the end)</p>

<p>This is a grid where the ratio between the squares and the gutters is 8:1. If you made squares that were 9 lines high then it'd be 9:1, etc. You can probably scale these squares up and down and measure the total width and space between the squares for new margin/leading values if you're happy with the ratio but want a bit less or more margin. If you want a different ratio of lines per square then you'll need to go back a few steps. If you want to change the leading without scaling everything then you'll need to start from scratch.</p>

<p><strong>If you have specific margin widths then you're going to have to come at it from a different angle.</strong> I found this post with linked, complicated, grid calculator that you may find useful: <a href=""http://font.is/grid-systems-calculate-grids-for-layouts-in-indesign-with-the-help-of-the-easy-grid-calculator/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://font.is/grid-systems-calculate-grids-for-layouts-in-indesign-with-the-help-of-the-easy-grid-calculator/</a></p>

"Using a Smart Object as a mask for another layer?","17540","","<p>Let's say I create a complex smart object containing layers, filters, effects, shapelayers, etc.</p>

<p>Then, in the main comp I want to use that smart object to mask another layer/smart object with.</p>

<p>However, I do not want to see the masking smart object itself.</p>

<p>Is there a configuration, such as blend mode, or similar, that lets me do this, without just adding a layer mask and copying over the visible parts?</p>

<p>Basically, I want to let the smart object (the mask) be fully editable, and make it automatically apply as a mask to another layer/smart object, with no manual steps other than editing the smart object.</p>

<p>Note, I am <em>specifically</em> not asking how to make a ""clipping mask"", by Alt-clicking on the separator line between two layers. I know about this function, but if the layer above (the one being clipped) is transparent, parts of the layer below (the one masking) will be visible. That's what I want to avoid.</p>

<p>Basically, to reproduce an example comp, create two layers by using the rectangular marquee tool, and creating two solid color layers, of different colors:</p>

<pre><code>+==============+
I              I
I              I

+======|            |
       |            |
       +------------+
</code></pre>

<p>Then I want to mask the topmost layer so that only that layer is visible, but only the parts masked by the bottom layer, without the bottom layer being visible, like this:</p>

<pre><code>       +-------+
       |       I
       |       I
       |       I
       +=======+
</code></pre>

<p>With a straight clipping mask, I would still see the underlying layer.</p>
","<p>What you're looking for is a clipping mask. That's done by placing your complex SO layer <em>under</em> the one you want to mask. From there you have three choices:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Target the layer you want to mask and choose <code>Create Clipping Mask</code> from the Layers Panel flyout menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd> (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Opt</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd> on Mac).</p></li>
<li><p>Hold down <kbd>Alt/Option</kbd>, hover on the line between the two layers until you see the cursor change and click once.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To remove the non-overlapping parts of the clipping layer, open the Blending Options dialog and uncheck <code>Blend Clipped Layers as Group</code>, then drag the white end of the top <code>Blend If</code> slider to the left until the bits you don't want disappear. You may also need to turn the fill down to <code>0</code>.</p>

  <p>Thanks. There is a real lack of support from straight men when it comes to attacks on and issues regarding the LGBT community. I'm glad that you remind me that there are men that care.</p>

<p>I'm not looking for a symbol that says ""Gay Pride,"" and I'm certainly not looking for completely alternative actions to take. I'm looking for a symbol that says or can be incorporated into a larger design to say, ""I'm straight but I support you."" and in doing so I hope it also shows other straight people that its okay to publicize their support as well.</p>
","<p>There's actually a flag already designed specifically for straight allies:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lDWNJ.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lDWNJ.jpg"" alt=""Straight ally flag""></a></p>

<p>The black and white stripes show that you're cisgender and heterosexual, and the rainbow in the ""A"" shape shows you're an ally.</p>

<p>The real question is whether or not you should use it. As other answers have pointed out, you could easily fly the simple rainbow flag as a symbol of your support. In fact, not caring if someone thinks you're gay or not is probably the best thing you can do to show the LGBTQIA+ community that you really are an ally. It's a small way to speak up and say ""I don't care if someone think's I'm gay, because there's nothing wrong with that."" If someone asks, just say ""oh, no, I'm just an ally.""</p>

<p>As a member of the LGBTQIA+ community myself, I find it a little disingenuine when a see an ally who's too concerned about being mistaken for being gay to fly a rainbow flag or wear a rainbow pin. While support is always appreciated, be careful that you're not inadvertently putting down the gay community by getting defensive about stressing you're not a part of it. </p>

<p><strong>PMS Colors</strong> - Absolutely brilliant when <strong>used as designed for pre-mixed spot color offset printing</strong>. You can be assured the color you saw in your Pantone book is very closely represented in your final printed piece.</p>

<p><em>The problem is, most people don't use PMS colors for actual extra-channel spot color printing. They abuse them in a ""Hey, this color looks nice"" way they were never intended for.</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>CMYK</strong> - If you specify CMYK values in your document, you get whatever you get when it is printed. <strong>CMYK is device dependent</strong>, so just about every CMYK device will give you it's own version of that recipe.</p>

<p><em>For example, give a master chef and your mechanic a recipe for Coq Au Vin. Make sure they have the identical ingredients too. The two results are going to be different... unless your mechanic is also a master chef.</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>RGB</strong> - Forget about it. <strong>You have ZERO control over the device that will display your color</strong> and the possibilities are endless.</p>

<p><em>Create a new RGB document and assign the sRGB color profile. Dump in your PMS color and convert it to RGB. Use those numbers and try and stop worrying because there is so little you can do about it</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Converting from PMS colors to CMYK</strong> - EVERYTHING IS A LIE. Every single conversion you find is at best an approximation. Even the official Pantone Color Bridge conversion numbers are all but useless for you, <em>unless you are printing on the same stock, using the same inks, under the same conditions...</em> As the Color Guide says on page ii:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The screen tint percentages supplied are based on the printing conditions under which this guide was produced, as defined on page iii, and are intended as guidelines. If your workflow varies from ours, adjustments may be made to optimize the match.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Page iii then goes on to list the very stringent environment that most jobs are likely never, ever be printed under.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>So, what do you do? Not much you can do. If you're printing spots, aka PMS colors, then your document shouldn't be combining PMS and CMYK versions of the same color.</p>

<p>If you're printing CMYK, then the extra spot color channels are never in play, and you're at the mercy of your printer / master chef / mechanic.</p>

<p>If you're displaying RGB, then you will never ever have actual printed PMS and CMYK colors in the same display.</p>

<p>My suggestion? Build your color guide for the branding package using Pantone's suggested numbers for RGB and CMYK. Even though they may not be correct for <strong>your</strong> specific output, at least you have the 800 pound Pantone gorilla to rely on. You used standards, and that's a good thing.</p>

<p>Finally, if your CMYK printer (people, not device) does ""Late Binding"" color management, you will likely get the best PMS color matches from their devices. Their RIP software will try to figure how to squeeze faux PMS colors out their CMYK gamut.</p>

<hr>

<p>Follow up to <strong>user1324925less</strong>' comment. There are likely one of two things going on:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Out of Gamut</strong> - In general, the majority of the Pantone Matching System colors are out of gamut of CMYK devices. That means, no matter how hard you try, you will never, ever make a reasonable match in CMYK (just look at the Color Bridge for hundreds of examples). The CYMK color space just <strong>does not contain those colors</strong>. <em>It's the equivalent of trying to count from 1 to potato.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>You versus Them</strong> - The conversions for you are good because they are '<strong>in gamut</strong>' and  happening in your particular environment with <strong>your</strong> display, input and output profiles, your calibrated monitor, etc. When you get someone else's converted PMS colors, that happened in their particular environment which is very likely different from yours. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Either way, there will be very little you can do about. If somebody specs a PMS color, then by all intents they should be expecting to print an actual extra channel spot color, or be ready to accept the limitations of PMS conversions to CMYK.</p>

<p>The Pantone Matching System has become the de facto standard for ""picking a color.""  Unfortunately, the vast majority of instances I see are abuses of PMS. People see this little booklet and think ""Oh, that's the color right there!"" Few realize that the color they picked is only going to happen under very tightly controlled circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>If the client wants a ""landing page""</strong>, single web page, or link he can direct people to then standard HTML/CSS markup is appropriate. Basically, it's just a web page. Create it how you would create any other web page.</p>

<p><strong>If the client wants an email</strong> to be sent out to perspective people, then using HTML tables is more appropriate. Yes I typed ""tables"". Email clients are still well behind many browsers. If you want email clients to see things properly using tables is still the best method. You should avoid all background images (some email providers strip them away like GMail) and make <em>all your CSS inline</em> rather than external or referenced in the header. In this case, I can not state emphatically enough that a <strong>video in the email is a very poor idea</strong>. You should try with all your might to discourage this. It will raise the spam rating of the email considerably. High spam level marks will get the client blacklisted from <em>many</em> email services. Once blacklisted, it can take quite some effort to get white listed again. There are some helpful services for email HTML files such as <a href=""http://premailer.dialect.ca/"">Premailer</a> which will move styles to inline and other things in preparation for emailing.</p>

"How do I keep my floating action button from blocking other components?","17096","","<p>The new Material Design of Google recommends to use floating action buttons to draw attention to the user for the main action on that screen. There are quite a lot of examples of this within a list view.</p>

<p>Now, suppose your list view has just enough items to fill the screen, making scrolling impossible. If your list items have a certain component that the user can interact with, for example a switch or a favorite star, its possible that the floating action button is blocking this component. How should we handle this case?</p>

<p>EDIT: This actually always happens with the last item of the list.
Here's an example where the 'favorite-star' can not be used properly. It's also blocking content, such as the time in this example.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IrmVZ.png"" alt=""example of floating action button blocking UI""></p>
","<p>There are some different ways you can handle this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Don't place vital content below the button</strong></p>

<p>This is the most obvious approach, and probably the most general. Whenever possible, structure your design to make sure that nothing vital is below the action button like other buttons, main content, etc. </p>

<p>You can add extra space by using padding or a blank entry, formatting the content so the not-as-important things are not where the button will be, or some other thing - it depends on the content and the design you want.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Relocate the button</strong></p>

<p>The action button doesn't have to be in the bottom right. Depending on your design, it may make more sense to place it in another location. I think the examples below do it pretty well.</p>

<p>Google just updated their material design guide and made a <a href=""http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons-floating-action-button.html#buttons-floating-action-button-floating-action-button"" rel=""noreferrer"">page just for the floating action button</a> which shows it being used in different locations and sizing in addition to an animation (talked about below).</p></li>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><p><strong>Don't show the button all the time</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes the action button isn't vital enough that it needs to be seen all the time. In cases like this, hiding it on scroll or while scrolling down may make sense. If and how you do so is dependent on the content and design, no one answer is true for all applications.</p>

"Who first discovered CMYK?","16993","","<p>It has been used for colour printing for many, many years, but who (and when) first discovered that a bright pink colour (magenta), a light blue (cyan), yellow and black can be mixed to create almost all colours? How did they discover this?</p>

<p>(Or more correctly ""CMY"" - the Black (K) isn't strictly necessary)</p>
","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.clubink.ca/blog/print/history-behind-cmyk-colour-model/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Joe Scout</a> the first company to use CMYK in printing was <em>Eagle Printing Ink Company</em> and the year was 1906. It was not until 1956 that it became a standard as a result of Pantone trying to streamline the workflow.[1] </p>

<p>This however does not really answer who really invented/discovered the choice of colors, the first scientific literature to mention this appears to be published in 1908. Going deeper it appears that we have a significant problem. It seems that there is a certain ambivalence in the naming of colors. In certain later sources we see that cyan and magenta refereed to as blue and red even as late as 1950's. So language no longer works quite well searching for earlier sources and it becomes hard to follow the lead. Secondly pigments fade so we can not compare easily what they mean. Certainly lot of work of finding the primaries has been done from 18ths century. [2]</p>

<p>It has been fairly long known that the human eye was sensitive to 3 color wavelengths (called tristimulus values in scientific lore). Some sources attribute this as far back as 1613 [3]. But certainly it was known and verified by mid 1800's see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%E2%80%93Helmholtz_theory"" rel=""noreferrer"">Young–Helmholtz theory</a>. So the sensory primaries were known for quite some time. RGB primaries are chosen to closely match the 3 sensors in our eye. However, a paper does not transmit light, it reflects light. So a paper is usually white, representing maximum reflection. Each ink then subtracts one color off the palette since you need to be able to independently manipulate each RGB channel. This fact was known since Newton [2]. So you need to find the inverse of RGB which simply is CMY. The black color is there mostly, and originally, to avoid registration problems as black is the most common body text color ink. Though black does make it easier to mix certain dark tones. </p>

<p>Of course CMYK printing predates RGB monitors by a comfortable margin of 60 years. CMYK is not derived from RGB but the intuition needed is the same. The authors must have known or indirectly inferred the inner workings of the eye's sensory apparatus. But its not nearly as simple as this as finding good pigments for the job is a journey on its own. Knowing what to look for is not the same as knowing what is there.</p>

"Will increasing the dpi of my image (without re-sampling) hurt print quality?","16984","","<p>I'd like to start making prints, but all of my work is set at a resolution of 72. Are there any negative effects to increasing the resolution to 300?
I'm very new to this, but from what I've read so far: higher res = nicer looking prints.</p>

<p>I apologize if a similar topic has been posted before, I just wanted to know if there was any pressing reason why I should <em>not</em> be doing this.</p>
","<p>The DPI of the image itself is not really that important. What is important is how big you will print the image and what kind of press/printer will be used to print it. This is why:</p>

<p><strong>DPI, dimensions and pixels</strong></p>

<p>The dimensions of an image can be specified in 2 different ways.</p>

<ul>
<li>Indicate DPI <strong>and</strong> dimensions in inches (or cm)</li>
<li>Indicate dimensions in pixels (or dots, which mean the same in the scope of this comment)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you just say ""this image is 72dpi"" you are just saying that for every inch of image there are 72 pixels, but you are not saying how many pixels the image actually has. It could be a 10px x 10px icon or a 3m x 3m poster. Both of these images, for example, are 72dpi. One is 0.3"" x 0.3"" while the other one is 3"" x 3"".</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/E9uFO.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>With DPI and dimension in inches you can always calculate the dimensions in pixels. And viceversa. Dimension in pixels = dimension in inches x dpi. The two previous images are, for example, 22px x 22px and 216px x 216px respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Why higher DPI by itself does not necessarily mean higher quality.</strong></p>

<p>Suppose you have an image that was originally prepared at 72dpi and suppose the image dimensions are 2"" x 2"". Think of the image as a matrix of dots (pixels). Your image is 2"" x 2"" at 72dpi. It means that, for every row of dots, it has 72 pixels in every inch of the row. Since 72 (the dpi) times 2 (the dimension in inches) is 144. It means your image is, in dots or pixels, 144 x 144.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/a59do.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now suppose you want to print your image using a regular offset press, which can print up to 300dpi images. Suppose you try to print it exactly at the original image dimension in inches. The press needs 300 dots for every inch to do a good job. The image you are supplying has only 72 dots for every inch, so the press (or more accurately, the software that prepares the plates for the press) has to make up the missing dots. The result will be blurry or noisy because there will be a lot of ""transitional"" dots that the software will creatively add to fill the missing gaps.</p>

<p>Now, suppose that you want to print the same image but not at its original size. You want to print it at a smaller size: 0.48"" x 0.48"". Your original image has 72 dots per inch. Your image was 2"" x 2"" and, as we saw, it means it was 144 dots x 144 dots. It means that it will have 144 dots to print every 0.48"". 0.48/144 = 300! The press will have 300 dots to print every inch. The result will be great. The press will have all the dots it needs.</p>

<p><strong>Optimal printable dimensions</strong></p>

<p>You can think of the Width and Height in inches as the optimal printable dimensions at a given DPI. If you notice, when you try to increase the DPI in PS without re-sampling, the printable dimensions of the image decrease. The dimensions in pixels (dots) stay always the same, though. The resulting image will have exactly the same number of pixels. The only difference would be that, in some corner of the file, it will read: ""hey, the creator of this file thinks this file will be used at 300dpi, so you know. If you need to show dimensions, please show them considering 300dpi"".</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/56t0A.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If you ask PS to do re-sampling, though, and increase the DPI, then the dimensions in pixels of the image will increase. When you click ""OK"" PS will add dots in between the ones the image already, the same way the press would have done (take a look at @joojaa's comment below). The resulting image will have more pixels. </p>

<p>So, the same image of 144 px x 144 px can be printed optimally either at 2""x 2"" on a 72dpi press or at 1.48"" x 148"" on a 300dpi press.</p>

<p>If you have huge images at 72dpi and you print them at a smaller size (more or less 1/4 of their optimal size at 72dpi) in press capable of 300dpi, then you are fine because the press will have enough dots to work with. On the other hand, if you have an image that is 300dpi but you want to print it at a dimension that is over its optimal dimensions, then the result will be bad because the press will make up the missing dots.</p>

<p><strong>DPI and LPI</strong></p>

<p>A little digression: We tend to think about presses in DPI terms but, as @Yorik clarified in his comment, this is inaccurate. If a press that can print images up to 300 dpi this does not mean that for every line of the final print, the press is capable of printing 300 dots in every inch of the line. Thanks @Yorik, I did not know that! So I went and researched about it...</p>

<p>The resolution of the presses is indicated in LPI (lines per inch). If you take a look at a printed image with a magnifier, you will see a set of different dots (one set per ink). By using different sizes of dots the press creates the illusion of tones. Bigger dots create the illusion of darker tones. Smaller dots create the illusion of lighter tones. This set of dots is called <em>the screen</em> and the process of turning an image into a screen of dots is called <em>halftone screening</em>. </p>

<p>The dots are usually arranged in a diagonal line (there are other methods out there, but enough digressions). The closer the lines can be packed (the finer the the screen) the greater the illusion of the tones. The resolution of a press is indicated by the number of lines it can pack in one inch. A 150LPI press can pack 150 lines in one inch of the halftone screen.</p>

<p>Here is a simulation of a B/W image printed in 3 different presses, each one with twice the LPI from the previous one, and then magnified. These are exaggerated. The actual halftone screens are way finer than this. I have highlighted the lines of dots in each of the simulations. There is only one screen in this case because the image only needs black ink. The screens are usually rotated an angle to confuse the eye.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sVhEa.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The top right simulation creates a better illusion of tones. The lines of dots on the screen are packed more closely. It has a higher LPI.</p>

<p>Now, if you are going to print an image in a press capable of 150LPI, the first impulse would be to prepare the image so there are 150 dots in every inch, hence prepare it as a 150DPI image. If you do that the press goes ahead and renders each one of your pixels as a dot. The dots are small, but not that small that the eye cannot notice them. This fact combined with the fact that the screens are rotated results in an image that reminds a bit of pixel art, where diagonal lines look jagged, sort of like stairs (this is called ""staircasing,"" the ""jaggies,"" or ""pixelation."")</p>

<p>If instead of that you provide an image that hast twice DPI than the LPI of the press, then each of the dots of the halftone screen will represent a tone from your image instead of a single pixel. The result is a smoother image.</p>

<p>This page has excellent examples: <a href=""http://the-print-guide.blogspot.ca/2009/04/image-resolution-for-printing-lpi-vs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://the-print-guide.blogspot.ca/2009/04/image-resolution-for-printing-lpi-vs.html</a></p>

<p>The general guideline is to provide images with a DPI that is 1.5x to 2 times the LPI of the press. That is why for presses that are 150LPI, the images should be 300DPI.</p>

","<p>Yes, you can make the outlined path thicker. Simplest way is to just apply a stroke on the outlines. This will then be added to your stroke (so remember it needs to be 1/2 the additional weight you need). Closed outlines may need this done to both sides.</p>

<p>A bit more cleaner way would be to offset the outline. I suggest using <strong>Effect &rarr; Path &rarr; Offset Path...</strong> as its nondestructive so you can change your mind later (as opposed to <em>Object &rarr; Path &rarr; Offset Path...</em>).

<p>Depends how you define ""use"". IANAL, but as far as I know, <em>using</em> a font you legally purchased (either separately or as a part of the OS) to create creative work, and redistributing the font as part of that work in a non-embedded form (i.e. as a bitmap or with the vectorized outlines of the letters) is always okay. Meaning that if you use a font to e.g. create a logo, the font's creator will <strong>usually</strong> have no rights to the logo. (See @e100's comment for an example that says otherwise. Be sure to always check the actual license.) </p>

<p>What is usually out of bounds, or limited, is <em>redistribution</em> of the original font ""software"" - including converting the font to another format, embedding it in a document, or in a web page using <code>@font-face</code>. </p>

<p>If in doubt, check out the font license that is supposed to be shipped with every font... Although I have no clue where that license is supposed to be e.g. in MS Windows. Maybe you'll have to contact Microsoft and explicitly request it.</p>

<p>Fonts shipped with Open Source OS's usually come with a less restrictive Open-Source license - see <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/280/what-are-good-sources-for-open-source-fonts"">this question</a> for a list. But note that the GPL <em>may</em> also inherently prohibit the redistribution in closed-source products under some conditions - check the license carefully before including the font in any product you sell.</p>

"How to Cut One Shape at the Stroke of Another in Illustrator CS5","16890","","<p>This would be quite simple but I can't see to do it.</p>

<p>I have a shape/object (shape 1) and another shape object (shape 2). </p>

<p>Shape one has fill and a stroke (1px black). Shape 2 has a fill but no stroke. </p>

<p>Shape 1 is bigger than shape 2 and shape 2 sits on top of shape 1 in such as way that some part of shape 2 is on shape 1 and the rest part of shape 2 is outside shape 1. </p>

<p>How would I go about ""cutting"" the shape 2 and delete that part of the shape 2 that is outside shape 1 and leave me only the part of shape 2 that is inside the shape 1 in such a way that the stoke of shape 1 is visible.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bZY0A.gif"" alt=""Photo""></p>

<li>Select both shapes</li>
<li>copy</li>
<li>Delete shape 2</li>
<li>Select Shape 1 and Object > Hide (this is just to make it easier and is not required)</li>
<li>Edit > paste in front</li>

<li>Select Both Shape 1 and Shape 2</li>

<li>Object > Show All (To unhide Shape 1 in step 4)</li>
</ol>

<p>Result : lower half of Shape 2 by itself trimmed to match edge of Shape 1.</p>

<p>What this does is expands Shape 1 then trims the size of the stroke from the shape allowing the Minus Back to only use the inner area of Shape 1.</p>

"Using stock images for logos","16888","","<p>What are the rules concerning incorporating stock image elements into a website branding or logo?  </p>

<p>From what I understand, IStockPhoto.com doesn't allow it.  Are there any stock images sites that do?  Is there a specific licensing option required?</p>

<p>Please note- I'm not talking about adopting a stock image as a logo straight up- just using it as an element in a larger logo or brand design.  What I want to know is if there's any leeway there, or if logos must always be original art from the ground up.</p>

<p>Thanks-</p>
","<p>Using a stock image as the entire logo, or even part of a logo requires proper permissions.</p>

<p>The permissions depend on the license that that image is licensed under. Which license is needed is wholly dependent on what you plan to do with the final product. There are websites that have one license applied to the entire website, and anyone uploading to that website agrees to those license terms, and other stock websites allow their users to set the license.</p>

<p>Commercial stock is typically the hardest to find if you're looking for free commercial resources, but there are still some pretty good resources scattered around.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.sxc.hu"">http://www.sxc.hu</a> is a great resource, I do believe every user can control their license. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

","<p>Branding collateral could also be written (with the same meaning) - Collateral <em>to</em> branding.
This is everything that supports the brand. Things like stationery, web-banners, posters, flyers etc.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.thefreedictionary.com/collateral"">Collateral</a> is officially defined as:</p>

<blockquote>

<li>Give paths in the top route layer a small line width and white.</li>
<li>Give paths in the bottom route layer a bigger width and contrasting color.</li>

<p><strong>Is it highly unethical</strong>? It depends, but probably not. A rounded rectangle with a thick black stroke isn't exactly groundbreaking design work. <strong>Is it at all unethical</strong>? Maybe a little. Mimicry is widespread in the design world.

  <p>In order for a work to have copyright protection, it must reach a requisite level of creativity. Many logos,
  however, do not. Since copyright can’t protect a name, colors or the
  design of the logo, most simple logos simply do not have the required
  level of creativity to be considered copyrightable. However, many
  ornate or artistic ones do.</p>

<p>What we have here is not particularly ornate or artistic. As long as your omitted logo is 100% yours, I think you're on the safe side of things.</p>

<p>I am the only one working on a PC at my work place, I've noticed that the text in my Fireworks looks a bit ragged on the edges, its not so crisp and clear as it is on my work mates computers...</p>

<p>Now I know this is an issue about text rendering, and <strong>it is because of something called anti aliasing</strong>, i know what that(antialiasing) does from games, it makes the edges smoother so that the whole shape looks crisper, its like a pixel splitter :P
(windows has something caller Clear Type that does that for text)... </p>

<p><strong>My problem:</strong></p>

<p>How can I make the text look better? How should I set up windows? How should I adjust Fireworks/Photoshop settings?</p>

I'm not looking for tips on how to use image editing tools, but assuming a basic grasp of those, which resources and advice will best help a new designer create professional looking designs?</p>
","<ul>
<li><strong>Stay Simple</strong> - Don't try to do anything too fancy or adventurous at first. Get the basics down first, then you can start experimenting. Don't try to emulate the Star Trek computer interface.</li>
<li><strong>Be Consistent</strong> - A consistent design is part of the foundation of a good design. Keep track of your margins, sizes, and placement and maintain them throughout the design.</li>
<li><strong>Remove Clutter</strong> - Only include the elements that are necessary to the design. Remove everything else.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize</strong> - What is the primary purpose of the design? Emphasize that purpose. Make it obvious.</li>
<li><strong>Use Whitespace</strong> - Allow for proper margins. Large blocks of text with little or no margins aren't very readable. Ditto for other design elements.</li>
<li><strong>Use A Color Palette</strong> - You shouldn't use more than 4-5 colors in total.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent Fonts</strong> - Stick to one or two fonts. Use them consistently, usually one for headings, one for paragraph text. Calculate and maintain consistent font-sizes, line-heights, and line-spacing. Do not use Comic Sans unless you can fend off rabid velociraptor zombies.</li>
<li><strong>Design First</strong> - Design shouldn't be an afterthought; it should be a first-class member of the planning stage. Design will be the way your users interact with your programming and they'll form their opinions first and largely based on your design. Give design its proper importance.</li>

<p>Command/Ctrl-Shift-Click each layer thumbnail for the shapes (Layer 2, Layer, 3, layer 4 copy 2, etc.)</p>

<p>This will load each layers transparency as a selection. The Shift key will add to the current selection. So, with each Command/Ctrl-Shift-Click on a layer thumbnail, you should see the current selection grow by that layer's shape.</p>

<p>Do this for all the layers containing the shapes.</p>

But things won't look quite right without a solid color (preferably white) background behind the gradient shape layers.</p>

<p>Another method for Photoshop could be to simply grab the <strong>Gradient Tool</strong>, set a <strong>color to transparent gradient</strong> and then <strong>drag from a corner</strong>. Repeat for each of the 4 colors. The problem with this method is that each time you drag, the length of the gradient will be different. So, you won't end up with 4 equal corner gradients. The Vector Layer/Shape Layer method ensures the gradients are all the same length.</p>

<p>Add a black layer below your feathered white layer, so that what you see is your white feathered object against a black background.</p>

<p>Right-click one of the RGB channels (they should all be the same) and choose ""Duplicate Channel"" to make an alpha channel that looks like your regular composite view.</p>

<p>Fill the selection with your new color, and hide the white layer.</p>

<p>(Note: In Photoshop, you add Shift to the keyboard shortcut for Fill -- the Backspace/Delete key plus Ctl/Cmd for background color or Alt/Option for foreground -- as the quick way to fill while preserving transparency.

<p>What is the meaning of all these options? I mean, how they influence the quality of the image?</p>
","<p>First, ask yourself why an EPS from Photoshop? Is EPS really needed? There was a time where EPS was mandatory if you needed to include clipping paths or other elements. That's not really true today. Many formats today now support what EPS was used for. PDF, PSD, TIFF can all include clipping paths and transparency. PDF and PSD can include spot color channels and vector data, etc. EPS isn't a bad format by any means, but where it was once the go-to for many images, it's needed far, far less today. EPS is a <em>flat-file</em> format, meaning it flattens transparency. Other formats such as PDF and PSD do not do any flattening. EPS files from Photoshop are generally larger in terms of KB and offer <em>less</em> inter-application options today.</p>

<p>Realize an EPS saved from Photoshop <strong>always</strong> includes raster data. It may or may not include vector data (based upon image content). There is <em>no way</em> to save a purely vector EPS files from Photoshop. None. At best, all Photoshop EPS files are a mix of raster and vector data. THis question may be helpful:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/7726/is-a-photoshop-eps-file-a-vector-format"">Is a Photoshop EPS file a vector format?</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>The <strong>Preview</strong> option sets how you want the low resolution preview image to be formatted. Most EPS files contain an embedded low resolution ""proxy"" image which is used to display the image as a whole when ""placed' or viewed from within some other application. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Choosing <strong>None</strong> obviously dumps the preview image entirely and you won't see it. In these cases you generally see text such as ""This image was created by XXXX and does not contain a preview.""</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TIFF (1 bit/pixel)</strong> is similar to a GIF or PNG8 images in that the <em>preview image</em> for the EPS will only have transparency on or off, there will be no subtle fades to transparent. Every transparent area will be a hard edge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TIFF (8 bits/pixel)</strong> is similar to PNG24 or PNG32 images. This preview format allows the <em>preview image</em> to have 8 bits for transparency which then allows for subtle transitions (fade) to transparent within the <em>preview</em> image.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The above options <strong>only effect the embedded preview image</strong> and do not actually alter the EPS data within the file. Upon output to a printing device, these preview setting are completely ignored and the internal EPS data is rendered.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>DCS</strong> (Document Color Separations) is a format based upon EPS. DCS was created by Quark, in the late 1980s/early 1990s, to allow EPS files to separate properly when placed into their QuarkXpress application.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>DCS 1.0</strong> was a format which generated 5 <em>separate files</em>. One for each color plate (CMYK) and a composite EPS file for placement purposes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DCS 2.0</strong>, as indicated, was an ""update"" the the DCS format which allowed the <em>option</em> of generating separate files or generating one single file containing all the separation data. DCS 2.0 also added the ability to include <em>additional</em> color plates. So, DCS 2.0 is not restricted to only CMYK colors. DCS 2.0 is still <em>required</em> today if you wish to use Spot Color channels in a Photoshop-generated EPS file which will be used in QuarkXpress.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In short, if you are <em>not</em> using QuarkXpress, there may be very little reason to <em>ever</em> use the DCS format. It's was specifically designed by Quark for Quark applications. </p>

<hr>

<p>As for the <strong>data encodings</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>ASCII/ASCII85</strong> are designed for Windows</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Binary</strong> was designed for Macintosh. Some applications may have issues reading binary data however.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>JPG</strong> uses a lossy data encoding which strips away some data. The amount of data removal depends upon the selection fro the JPG format. Here, JPG refers to <em>how</em> the data is <em>encoded</em> and <strong>not</strong> the image format specifically.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In today's world, simply leaving the encoding on the default ASCII85 is fine across platforms and for most applications. There's no real need to alter the encoding unless you <em>specifically</em> know <em>why</em> you need to (someone requests Binary or JPG encoding). It is not unheard of get a request for Binary data encoded EPS files.</p>

<hr>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Include Halftone Transfer</strong> allows Photoshop to dictate how halftones are created. The Halftone transfer controls how halftone dots are dispersed. This ""bakes in"" these setting internally within the EPS file. Often it is much wiser to allow the output device to control half-toning rather than setting it in stone within the file. This is generally something you do <strong>not</strong> want to include unless you are in a pre-press environment and know you need this function. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Include Transfer Function</strong> allows Photoshop to dictate the output levels of the file for a specific output device. Basically, what this does is adjust the image levels or curves <em>within the file itself</em> based upon the specified output device. This is <em>also</em> something you do <strong>not</strong> want checked in most situations. By leaving it unchecked you allow the image to be adjusted upon <em>output</em> by the output device rather than ""baking in"" these adjustments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Postscript Color Management</strong> is exactly that, color management. If you tick this box, color profiles are embedded into the EPS data. Postscript color management only works with Postscript Level 3. If in a postscript Level 2 environment, this box has no effect. Whether or not you want the EPS color managed within the file is your choice. By not checking this option, you allow the output application to color manage the EPS file. Often this is a more preferred method so in many cases it is suggested you <em>not</em> check this option either.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The above 3 options are really ""specialized"" options which should only ever be ""on"" unless you specifically understand <em>why</em> you've turned them on.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Include Vector Data</strong> does just that. If you have live type, or shape/vector layers, vector smart objects, etc. then you want this option checked. If you leave this option unchecked, then all vector data is rasterized within the EPS file. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Image Interpolation</strong> anti-aliases the <em>low resolution preview image</em> which is embedded within the EPS format. This low resolution preview image is what you see when you ""place"" the EPS file into other applications. Checking this option can often be helpful, especially if your EPS file contains a great deal of vector data. Whether or not this is checked has no real technical benefit beyond the preview that you, the user, sees when viewing the EPS in some other application digitally. </p></li>

"What is the difference between layout and design?","16370","","<p>I can't understand what is ""design"" and what is ""layout"" in terms of web design. I'm confused between layout and design. Can anybody can help me understand these matters? Thanks for reading my question.</p>
","<p>They are really closely related.</p>

<p><strong>Layout</strong> is defined as the arrangement of predetermined items on a page. Basically, you're given the pieces and they are arranged.</p>

<p><strong>Design</strong> is defined as the art or skill of combining text, images, and other items into a visually pleasing arrangement.</p>

<p>So, really they can be almost interchangeable. </p>

<p>The primary difference is that for <em>layout</em> you don't need to create anything. You just decide on placement, color, size, etc for items you already have. For <em>design</em> you typically create things or find things to use. Such as, you draw a series of icons to use in the <em>layout</em>. Or you find stock photos and edit them to fit your <em>layout</em>. </p>

<p>Most graphic design (web or print) encompasses layout. However, a layout does not necessarily encompass design. </p>

<p>Admittedly it's a fine line and this is really just my opinion. There are few, if any, hard rules on what constitutes layout vs design. They both take a skilled eye when dealing with things like balance, proximity, space, etc.</p>

<li>Bad light (because it's bed time)</li>

","<p>This is not a complete answer. But here it goes a generic one.</p>

<p>1) Memory matters. So look for at least 8Gb.</p>

<p>2) Probably the safest bet in brute force processor now is i7. Look for the biggest number of the series. For example a i7 3xxx is third generation. A 4xxx is fourth and so on. The newer the better and cooler working environment.</p>

<p>3) But some processes <strong>now are done with the GPU</strong> not CPU so look for a good graphic card. There are some 3D rendering processes optimized for CUDA, which is a Nvidia software, so I would stay on that brand. A good GeForce will do. </p>

"What is HSB really?","16006","","<p>Can any of my graphics designer friends explain <strong>HSB</strong> to me? I know it's <strong>hue/saturation/brightness</strong> and I know what those three do (for the most part)... </p>

<p>I understand the algorithm of creating colors behind <strong>RGB</strong>, but what about <strong>HSB</strong>? The hue is just the colors radial position on the color wheel right? But what do saturation and brightness do? (I know one washes the color out (towards grey) and the other lightens or darkens the color...) but what do they do on the color wheel? Hue is radial position? I'm assuming brightness says whether the color location is closer to the center of the wheel or closer to the edge of the wheel, but then where does saturation come into play? </p>

<p>Also, is black even on the color wheel? Or is it actually like a color cylinder where the center travels from white (on the bottom face) to black (on the top face) and saturation chooses the <code>z-position</code> of the color location?</p>

<p>What I'm really trying to understand is, in different lighting would my skin (assuming it's all almost the same color) always have about the same hue but different brightness, and on cameras with different exposure would my skin always have the same hue but different saturation?</p>
","<p>Great question! To take the last part first, your skin hue would be the same no matter the brightness of incident light, provided the <em>color</em> of the light didn't change. That's why ""Select skin tones"" works in Photoshop CS6 and later. In broadcast video work, there's a commonly-used tool called a vectorscope that will prove to you, if you ever test it out, that ALL human skin falls into the same very narrow hue range. There's a demonstration of this in an excellent video tutorial by Andrew Devis on <a href=""http://library.creativecow.net/devis_andrew/Premiere-Pro-CS6-Basics_49/1"" rel=""noreferrer"">Creative Cow</a>.</p>

<p>At base, all the different color models seem to me to fall into three categories: defining color as we <em>describe</em> it, as we <em>generate</em> it and as we <em>perceive</em> it.</p>

<p><strong>HSB</strong> (also HSV) is a way to define color based on how we <em>describe</em> it (e.g., ""dark reddish-brown""). This is the one that uses a color wheel -- not the same as the artists' color wheel, by the way. It came in when we got on-screen color, as a way to try to describe color more intuitively than with RGB numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Hue</strong> is the quality that we might describe as the ""basic color"" of something. It's given an angular value on the color wheel. </p>

<p><strong>Saturation</strong> is the ""purity"" of the color, also known as ""chromaticity,"" especially in TV and video work. A yellow that can't get any yellower is fully saturated. To desaturate a color you add grey (or you subtract color leaving grey behind -- pick whichever description seems more intuitive).</p>

<p><strong>Brightness</strong> is determined by how much black is mixed with the color. Colors are not all <em>perceived</em> as being the same brightness, even when they are at full saturation, so the term can be misleading. Brightness is best thought of as the z-axis of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSV_color_space"" rel=""noreferrer"">color cylinder</a>. <strong>Value</strong> is a better term, in my opinion, because it doesn't imply perceived lightness or darkness. A fully saturated yellow at full brightness (S 100%, B 100%) is brighter to the eye than a blue at the same S and B settings.</p>

","<p>Generally this happens to maintain appearance. If the text interacts with other objects it may be broken up. If the font embedded in the PDF for the text is a subset rather than the entire font it can be broken up in AI so that AI can insert the missing characters from the subset.</p>

<p>It's black right? so why are the CMYK Values so far away from black?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I know this sounds a stupid question, black is black right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. It all depends on colour model used, ambient light, substrate, and perception. Black is, by definition, no light hitting our eyes. This is very difficult to accomplish. :)</p>

<p>CMYK is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_color"">Subtractive Colour Model</a>. It is used in printing because the mixing of the different pigments of ink subtract (absorb) different wavelengths of light.</p>

<p>RGB is an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color"">Additive Colour Model</a>. Different wavelengths of light are emitted by whatever technology used by your monitor (nowadays, usually LCD crystals filtering an LED backlight). Technically, it's not additive because the colours do not overlap, but the pixels are small enough that optical mixing causes us to perceive different colours on the screen.</p>

<p>Theoretically, a mixture of pure Cyan, Magenta and Yellow would produce black on the paper, but an actual Black ink is added, basically for two reasons. Firstly, there are always impurities in the CMY colours and the substrate (paper) such that the mixture would be muddy (brownish) and inconsistent. Secondly, 100% of the three inks would be a lot of ink, and cause problems drying/covering in most printing processes.</p>

<p>So, your question boils down to: Why doesn't Photoshop just use 100% Black ink (K) when it converts from RGB values to CMYK values?</p>

<p>Even 0,0,0 RGB on your monitor isn't a ""pure"" black. In a dark room, you will see that your monitor still glows perceptibly. Likewise, in printing, even 100% Black doesn't absorb all the light hitting the page. So, if we want something to look ""really black"" we add a bit of Cyan/Magenta/Yellow ink to cover the page more and absorb even more light. In printing we call this Rich Black.</p>

<p>Depending on what colour profile you're using in Photoshop, it takes this into account, and converts the blackest thing it can show on screen to a ""richer"" printed black. The values of CMYK used are judged to be (by the profile) the most ink that can be used, without causing printing problems, that still looks black.</p>

What I need to turn them all into 600x600 (or 610x610 perhaps to add some reasonable padding) files placing the original pictures into centers of the new pictures (rather than scaling them or placing them near the edges). The only application I know capable of this is Paint.Net but it features (AFAIK) no automation facilities so processing hundreds images is nasty. Any way to do this in batch? Windows and Linux solutions welcome. An opportunity to specify the colour (including an option of PNG empty colour) to fill the canvas space added is highly desirable.</p>

","<p>You can do this with <a href=""http://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/actions-actions-panel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">actions</a> &amp; the batch automation feature within Photoshop. To accomplish a colored or transparent background with new size dimensions, you'd create an action set (folder icon) and create an action within that set for each color you're looking to batch.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Create the action</strong></p>

<p><em>Record yourself resizing the canvas for future automation</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Navigate to the actions panel or Alt+F9</li>
<li>Create a new action by clicking the layer icon on the actions panel</li>
<li>Do the actions you want automated</li>
<li>Click the stop icon on the actions panel
<br><br></li>
</ul>

<p>While recording your specific action: (with image open)</p>

<ul>
<li>Go to Image > Canvas Size and change to 610x610</li>
<li>Add a square shape for background</li>
<li>Change color of shape to desired color / make no background for transparent</li>
<li>Move beneath your image</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Repeat this, creating a new color action within your action set as desired</em><br>
<br></p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Setting up a batch automation</strong></p>

<p><em>Tell Photoshop which folder of images to apply your re-sizing action to</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Go to File > Automate > Batch</li>
<li>'Play' section, choose your newly created action</li>

<li>'Destination' section, choose a folder where the newly re-sized images should output.</li>
<li>Click Ok and your automation will begin immediately. </li>

<strong>Side Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Changing the canvas size will center image within the new dimensions.</li>
<li>Custom actions record the things you do in Photoshop, in this case re-sizing.</li>
<li>'Action Sets' in the batch dialog are folders or groups of actions in the actions panel.</li>

  <p>For me, the biggest change in CS6 is pixel snapping being moved from the individual vector tools to a global setting, with the catchy title of Snap Vector Tools and Transforms to Pixel Grid. It’s hidden under the general tab in preferences, but is actionable, so you can enable and disable it with a keyboard shortcut.</p>
  
  <p>With pixel snapping off, Photoshop’s nudging behaviour is similar to how it was previously — nudging is connected to the zoom level. If you’re zoomed to 100%, then nudging will move one pixel. If you’re zoomed to 200%, nudging will move 0.5px. Keep zooming in and the increments get smaller:</p>
  
  <p>100% — 1px.</p>
  
  <p>200% — 0.5px or half a pixel.</p>
  
  <p>300% — 0.33px or a third of a pixel.</p>
  
  <p>400% — 0.25px or a quarter of a pixel.</p>
  
  <p>500% — 0.2px or one fifth of a pixel.</p>
  
  <p>600% — 0.1667px or one sixth of a pixel.</p>
  
  <p>...and so on, all the way up to 3200%, which nudges 0.03125px.</p>
  
  <p>With pixel snapping turned on, nudging always moves one pixel. And by one pixel, I’m talking about one pixel, relative to the current position. A point that’s located at 50.5px will move it to 51.5px if nudged while pixel snapping is enabled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Photoshop CS6 also contains a feature called Align Edges, that's a little different, but related.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Align Edges, found in the options bar, ensures the edges of the layer are aligned to the pixel grid. The non-edge contents of the layer are scaled without snapping to the pixel grid (this is important to note). In some cases, sloppily drawn vectors can be fixed simply by turning on this single per-layer option.</p>

","<p>As you figured out, the useful representation for laying out a document is different than the requirements for printing the document. In your example, version 1 is called a <code>reader's spread</code> and version two generally called a <code>printer's spread</code>.</p>

<p>In typical parlance, the process of rearranging pages for press is called <code>imposition</code> and a limited imposition feature for booklets is available in indesign called ""print booklet"" under the file menu. AFAIK, it is version specific. I am fairly sure cs5 and above it is available.</p>

<p>For a simple booklet, the pages must be rearranged and adjusted slightly and incrementally based on the thickness of the paper: as one gets closer to the center of the document, more and more of the gutter margin is eaten up by the paper thickness.</p>

<p>More voluminous books are typically printed on larger sheets and then folded in an origami-like process.</p>

<p>There are also simple programs which can take a reader's spread PDF and create an imposed booklet PDF as well, so it is possible to do what you want without using indesign.</p>

<p>(see: <a href=""http://help.adobe.com/en_US/indesign/cs/using/WSa285fff53dea4f8617383751001ea8cb3f-704ba.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://help.adobe.com/en_US/indesign/cs/using/WSa285fff53dea4f8617383751001ea8cb3f-704ba.html</a> )</p>

<p>Note that in all my time doing books/booklets on the order of 40-150 pages, I have NEVER imposed my own documents: I leave that the the pre-press people at my printing supplier. I have only ever done it myself for <code>dummies</code> and hobby/home use.</p>

","<p>Initially when you draw a primitive (rectangle, ellipse) you get the properties for that primitive. These are called ""live shapes"" in Adobe terms. </p>

<p>If you transform the shape, via free transform, it get's ""baked in"" and it is no longer a primitive or ""Live Shape"". It gets expanded, for lack of a better term, into a standard shape which is no longer ""live"". Customarily there is a warning <em>telling you</em> that the shape will no longer be a live shape. Are you missing that warning?</p>

<p>Once the live shape is expanded, there is no way to revert it to a primitive other than to redraw the shape with the Shape Tool so it is a primitive again.</p>

<p>This will place a duplicate of the top left object. Now, the top-leftmost point in the <strong>copy</strong> is the exact center between the outer edges of the two objects.</p>

<p>And you can see below, eyeballing can get close, but the second method is much more exact.</p>

If you group layers together they have to stay together. There is no way to ungroup a layer between two grouped layers. You can do this with linked layers.</p>

<p>Here is one case I use linked layers for:
When I am creating an new website layout and want it to have some fixed parts and some parts, that are scrolling along the side, I can link the scrolling parts together.</p>

<p>Usually I organize my layout in groups to collapse the parts I don’t need and don’t get overwhelmed by hundreds of layers. The basic groups could be Header, Content, Navigation, Sidebar and Footer. Lets say I want the header, the navigation and the footer to stay fixed, while the sidebar scrolls along the content, without loosing its relative position.</p>

<p>To group those elements together I would have to reorder my layergroups, but I can link them no matter what the order is. Now I can scroll my content and the sidebar will keep its relative position to the footer.</p>

<p>Layergroups do have a whole range of other purposes, but to list all the functions of layergroups is not the topic here, I think.</p>

","<p>You need a <em>single</em> path to create a clipping mask. You can't use a group of objects or objects with effects etc (the effects would be disregarded anyway).</p>

<p>Simple fix: Select all of your circles and create a compound path (<strong>Object →  Compound Path → Make</strong> or <strong><kbd>Ctrl / cmd</kbd>+<kbd>8</kbd></strong>). Compound paths essentially treat a group of paths as one single path, allowing you to use that path for a clipping mask.</p>

<p>but every time I try to colour a half circle it colours the whole circle. </p>

<p><strong>So how can I colour segments of circle like the above?</strong></p>
","<p>Assuming that you've drawn the circles and lines using the Ellipse and Line Segment tools (or the Pen, etc.), the colouring is relatively simple using the <strong>Live Paint Bucket</strong> or the <strong>Live Paint Selection Tool</strong> (Illustrator CS4 and newer). These tools require that the shapes and lines are not grouped or placed in different layers (if they are grouped, ungroup them first: select, then press  Cmd-Shift-G).</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Select all</strong> shapes and lines that belong to the diagram using the normal Selection Tool, or press Cmd-A (Windows: CTRL-A).</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the <code>Live Paint Bucket</code> in the tool palette. (It might be 'hidden' under the 'Shape Builder tool' – click on it and hold the mouse button down to access the hidden items. You can also have the group of tools open in a separate  tool set.) </p></li>
<li><p>Then move the mouse over the selected group of elements and click once to turn it into a Live Paint Group object. The tool will then interactively highlight in red the area that it recognises as an individual painting area. </p></li>
<li><p>To select a colour, the Live Paint Bucket is connected to the Swatches palette. Use the arrow keys to navigate and choose a colour… Or mix your own colour in the Colour palette… When done, click in the area to fill it with the  colour. <br><br>It's also possible to use the <code>Live Paint Selection Tool</code> to just select an area within the elements by clicking it, and then paint it by clicking on the colour in the Swatches or Colour palette.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(Applying the Live Paint Bucket compounds the selected elements into one 'Live Paint Group'. Individual elements can still be selected using the Direct Selection tool, but to completely revert it into unpainted – e.g., to make structural changes – choose <code>Object &gt; Live Paint &gt; Release.</code>)</p>

<p>To address what is suitable for beginners is going to be a complicated discussion because it would depend on what you find to be an issue.  One would say that Illustrator would be the best suited because the amount of resources are available. </p>

<p>It would be hard pressed to find ""free"" courses because you are basically asking someone that has put in the effort to learn design to spend their hard earned time to teach you and that simply isn't logical.  Same rule applies to sign-making.  However, I would suggest possibly picking up a vector program like Inkscape, that is free, and learning how to do things.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What books should I read?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would probably depend on what program you are going to use.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any tips for the beginner?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Expect to only get in return the amount of effort you put in.  Try to come up with ways to practice in design.  Don't be afraid to take advanced designs experts have done and challenge yourself in understanding what they did and the ability to replicate it.  At this time you are your best client and by that I mean come up with an idea and learn how to consolidate your time and design.</p>

<p>Now some other points.  From experience in the sign world I would advise learning a vector program since you mentioned you will be doing signs.  So this tid-bit may help:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inkscape: Its a free vector program that has a robust community and focuses on vector.</li>
<li>CorelDraw: Is another popular alternative to Illustrator that a lot of sign companies use because it can aid in the design of lighted signs and its ability to scale.</li>
<li>Illustrator: One of the best vector programs that is very popular in the community and a lot of sign companies use it to develop signage and even vehicle wraps and digital prints.</li>
<li>InDesign: The best print production software for stationary or small jobs when typsetting is needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>As stated by Ryan be honest.  You didn't go in detail if this position needed experience but I would imagine that any company looking for someone to handle their signs would expect some design and software knowledge of some-sort unless its an internship in their sign shop if they have one.</p>

"Optimum line height in relation to font size","14932","","<p>Is there an agreement on what the optimum mathematical proportion of line height and the size of a text is? And if there is, is it the same for print and web?</p>
","<p>Short answer: ""No."" </p>

<p>Long answer: There are four factors involved in deciding the leading (nowadays meaning the distance from one baseline to the next, also called line height): the x-height of the characters, the measure (length of the line), the weight of the strokes of the characters themselves and the size of the type. In this answer, for simplicity, I'm going to use ""leading"" and ""line height"" interchangeably.</p>

<p>Of these, the one that dominates is the measure, followed by x-height and point size.</p>

<p>The wider the measure, in general, the more open the line height must be to maintain readability. If your measure is longer than about 70 characters of your chosen typeface and point size, you'll need to increase the line height so the reader doesn't skip or accidentally repeat a line while reading.</p>

<p>The size of the characters is never the same as the point size, which in the days of metal type was taken to be the total measurement from the bottom of the lowest descender (e.g., the tail of the lowercase ""y"") to the top of the highest ascender (such as the vertical stroke of the lowercase ""h""). The height of the lowercase ""x,"" from which ""x-height"" derives, might be tall (Arial) or very short (Bernhard Modern) in relation to the point size. Type set so that the line height is the same as the point size is ""set solid"" -- no extra lead between the lines. Arial or Helvetica look horrible set solid. Bernhard Modern doesn't.</p>

<p>To maintain readability, typefaces with a large x-height in relation to the cap and ascender height (e.g., Century Schoolbook or Helvetica) need more line height, relative to point size, than Garamond or Futura, which have smaller x-heights.</p>

<p>Sans serifs tend to have much thicker strokes, relative to their size, than serif typefaces. Setting them too tightly (small line height) makes paragraphs and pages look very heavy and dark, and can make them very hard to read. Opening up the leading, and sometimes the character spacing, improves the look of the text considerably. An serif face with a relatively small x-height, like Garamond, can be set with much less line height.</p>

<p>All of these considerations are modified by how the designer wants the page to look. Some subjects are enhanced by a more airy look to the page (e.g., romantic poetry, unicorn stories), calling for a delicate typeface and open leading. Others need more authority (textbooks, say) and benefit from a darker ""type color.""</p>

<p>Now let me dispense with the Golden Ratio (<em>phi</em>) idea. It would be wrong in almost all cases. Mathematics has nothing to do with it. Appearance does. </p>

<p>Contrary to what you might think, large text such as headlines requires tighter leading than paragraph text. Headlines are often set with ""negative leading"" -- the line height is <em>less</em> than the point size. This is especially true for headlines in all caps, which always require reduced leading. (Because of ascenders and descenders, it is common for multi-line headlines to have different leading on each line in order to make the line spacing <em>look</em> even.) Conversely, small sizes, such as for captions or footnotes, need more leading or they become hard to read. Type looks ""looser"" as it gets larger and ""tighter"" as it gets smaller, which requires adjustments to letterspacing below 8 pt and above about 24 pt for most typefaces.</p>

<p>You would go seriously astray if you tried to use phi (or <em>any</em> fixed ratio) to calculate line height, because you would be right only by accident.</p>

<p>For the web, use typefaces designed for low-resolution devices for at least the next few years, until moderate-resolution screens (250 - 400 ppi) become commonplace. Not all ""web fonts"" from providers such as Google, Extensis or Typekit are usable at text sizes on most displays. Web text tends to read better when spaced a little more openly than on a printed page, because of the coarse dot grid and OS manipulations that blur strokes and distort character shapes.</p>

"Align tool not working on Illustrator CC 2014","14891","","<p>It's kinda weird. I'm unable to figure out why 'Align' tool is not working on my Illustrator.</p>

<p>If it's of help; i'm on Yosemite with CC 2014 latest release.</p>

<p>PS: I'm using Mac for past 2 days only, so not much sure about things. Possibly i'm doing something wrong. Would really appreciate some quick help.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

","<p>Your question is <em>exceptionally</em> unclear. You have a single object selected, you do not offer <em>any</em> information as to how you are trying to align that single object nor any detail as to what exactly isn't working. However....</p>

<p>Align has three functions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Align to arbaord</li>
<li>Align to other objects (selection)</li>
<li>Align to a single key object</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/923nW.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Items 2 and 3 <strong>require</strong> more than one object be selected before they function. </p>

<p>The <strong>only</strong> time you can use the align functions on a single object is when <strong>Align to artboard</strong> is selected as the alignment method.</p>

<p>Based on your screen shot, with only one object selected, I would guess that you do not have the options set to Align to Artboard.</p>

"Resize Photoshop canvas to fit selected layer's (larger) dimensions","14884","","<p>I know how to crop, to fit a selected layer's dimensions that are smaller than my canvas, but is there an easy way to upsize my canvas to fit a selected object that is larger than it?

"Is there any service where you can check your designed logo against trademarked logos?","14879","","<p>Say if I design a logo, there is the chance that it may be to similar to that of a trademarked logo already out there. Are there any services that help with this?</p>

<p>This could be done through research, but this seems a bit too intensive, so I want to know if there is anything better.</p>
","<p>It is an intensive process, takes a while, and is expensive. There are companies that do little else, and will charge you handsomely. The USPTO (Patents and Trademark office) has search facilities on its <a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/process/search/"">website</a> that will allow you do search for yourself without a fee but considerable cost in time. I assume that similar facilities exist for other economic regions, but don't have experience with them.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that, like patent search, it takes care and time.</p>

<p>It's not all gloomy, though. The essence of trademark violation is that someone might confuse your brand with some already-registered competitor. In most cases, that means that you can narrow your search to companies in roughly the same line of business and (provided you don't do something egregious like using a nice curvy swoosh for your new line of athletic footwear) not have a problem.</p>

<p>For SMBs (small and medium businesses) with only a local presence, this is seldom much of an issue, but if you're a web startup or have national or international ambitions, it is <em>highly</em> recommended that you invest the time and money up front to avoid marketing embarrassment and/or legal expense later.</p>

"Photoshop Gradient Overlay requires a shape layer, not a regular layer?","14806","","<p>Today I was following a tutorial using PS CS6 on the internet and it asked that a layer be added and <code>Layer Style &gt; Gradient Overlay</code> be used, which would later become a background.  </p>

<p>I'm not a big user of the <code>fx</code> button in the layer panel, I admit. But, I didn't think it was so utterly confusing. </p>

<p>I simply created a new layer (transparent) and accessed the Gradient Overlay in Layer Styles and expected to see the new layer filled with the gradient I had configured and then I'd move on to the next step. There was no effect at all and no indication from Photoshop CS6 that I had just done something that would have no effect.  </p>

<p>To my great surprise I discovered that even after making a (marquee) selection, there was no gradient overlay appearing.  </p>

<p>Not until I used the shape tool (or text tool) would my gradient appear within it.  Of course, I thought the so-called 'layer' style would apply on a layer level basis and not require that a particular object be used for filling.  </p>

<p>Is my software not working correctly or does anyone else find this observed behavior counter-intuitive in the slightest? </p>

<p>Why does it only have effect on text or shape layers?</p>
","<p>The word ""<strong>Overlay</strong>"" by definition <strong>means to cover</strong>. </p>

<p>If your layer is transparent, there are no pixels for the Overlay to cover. </p>

<p>Fill the layer with something, anything, and the Gradient Overlay will be visible. If you do not want the actual layer contents to be visible, then reduce the <strong>Fill Opacity</strong> to 0%. </p>

"As a graphic designer, should I use my personal name or create a business name/branding?","14788","","<p>For a designer who begins doing freelance or start (or renaming) his/her own business, there's usually that critical decision that must be made: </p>

<p><strong>Should I use my own name or have a business name for my services?</strong> </p>

<p>In the past, I've been discouraged in using my own name so I chose a ""cool"" name instead for my business. But I'm about to move in another region where I need to either renew or change my business name if I want to.</p>

<p>In my case, my clients know me well and both names are already a bit everywhere online; in fact they often prefer to use my website domain name instead of my business name, so the business name needs to be changed anyway. I don't have the kind of John Smith name so I'm quite easy to find, and I like both my name and biz name!</p>

<p>Right now I offer all sort of graphic design services but mainly branding, packaging and marketing. I also started this year signing contracts as an agent for illustrators that I publish, and plan to sell more giant format digital art of my own as well. And that's what I plan to expand in the next 10 years and get a bit less ""technical"" and more artistic. That's a bit why I was wondering if my short business name could fit or if I should simply use my own name as branding.</p>

<p>I remember how ""the choice of name"" was a big topic among designer friends who were also starting their company 15 years ago, and I'm quite sure the question is still relevant for new designers today. The difference is that I was surrounded with designers who didn't have any experience themselves and I feel I would get very different feedback today from a community of designers like this one.</p>

<p>Some arguments I've heard against using personal name is:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's too ""ego"", artsy or self-centered</li>
<li>""What if you hire employees?""</li>
<li>You're not a popular designer yet</li>
<li>It's lame, not original</li>
</ul>

<p>And the pros for business names:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's more distinctive</li>
<li>It's better if you plan to work in team</li>
<li>It makes you look more like a serious business</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Is there any more benefits in using your personal name as a designer or a business name instead? Or a mix of both?</strong> </p>

<p>Since design is very close to art and craft, I wonder if I shouldn't have the ""Picasso"" mindset for this; if it wasn't design, I guess the decision wouldn't be as difficult.</p>
","<p>This question has TOP priority also in my mind and I made research for this a lot. Some other benefits:</p>

<p><strong>Using a Business name:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>It gives the opportunity to sell the business later if needed (of course if you know for 100% that you will not sell, then forget about this);</p></li>
<li><p>Better because if your business doesn't go as you planned, for example, you get some bad clients in a row and then they tell others that you work bad etc. - then your Business with it's unique name gets all the unfortunate stuff on it and at the worst situation, the Business with this name stops working. But, if you were working with your own name, then you would damage your reputation as a designer and it would be worse;</p></li>
<li><p>A chance to find a very unique name that fits the best for your provided services and would be as a little key to success better that personal name. (Here we need to keep in mind that every picked word can be the most successful if things go right).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Using your Personal name:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you have very good portfolio to show, you have knowledge and ability to make a great site for your own, I would suggest by starting with your name, because with really nice portfolio and being a nice person, you will gain success in any case.</p></li>
<li><p>If you feel better to work as individual and you are minded to work more alone.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Popular, well known designers work on their own, with big experience, high reputation, they decide to go with their names, because so many people know them by their names so it becomes a natural way.</p>

<p>Also need to understand the benefits from legal point of view. Is it better to work on your own as a freelancer or start your own business. The taxes, how it looks from this point. This aspect is pretty much important and often decisive. In every country laws are different.</p>

<p>This question is very complicated by finding the right solution for each of us, but I hope that searching information, brainstorming, talking with people, the answer will come.</p>

","<p>When generating a PDF for print production you should first use the PDF/X-1a setting. ""High Quality Print"" is okay, but PDF/X-1a is much better. It ensures the PDF will meet standard requirements for press in terms of color, flattening, etc.</p>

<p>It is also important to <em>always</em> select the <strong>Crop Marks</strong> option unless you're asked not to specifically. Crop marks tell the printer where the piece is to be cut. Or, in other words, where the bleed <em>starts</em>. Crop marks indicate the <em>final size</em> of the piece to be delivered from the printer. </p>

<p>The bleed marks aren't really a requirement in many cases. They simply indicate where the bleed area ends, but since the piece will be trimmed at the Crop Marks it's somewhat irrelevant where the bleed ends as long as it's enough of a bleed to allow proper trimming (at the crop marks).</p>

<p>I merely think you've confused what bleed marks and crop marks are. </p>

<p>Of course,  the final ink  lines will never match the pencil lines 100%. There will be deviations and additions all the time: </p>

<p>To get rid of the pencil lines, one would usually use an eraser before scanning. </p>

<p>Is there a clever generic digital method to get rid of the pencilled lines without touching the final lines?</p>

<p>Merely playing with contrast and brightness doesn't produce good results, as it will destroy or alter details of the final lines as well.  </p>

<p>I can use a very recent Photoshop (CS5.5 to be exact, but the more generic the advice, the better.) </p>
","<p>Lollero's suggestion is a good one. It doesn't help much if everything's gray and black, however.</p>

<p>Here is a technique that takes a little finesse and some practice, but is your best general approach without changing your initial workflow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scan in the usual way, and use a Levels adjustment layer to make the inking fully black (RGB 0,0,0) by dragging the left slider toward the center and the middle slider to the left. These aren't necessarily dramatic adjustments. You're just looking to make the inking black and the sketch lighter:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rcJw5.png"" alt=""use of Levels""></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make the canvas pure white by dragging the white slider in a bit (a value of 248 worked for this example).</p></li>
<li><p>Make the art layer (not the adjustment layer) active and switch to the Channels panel.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new Alpha channel by selecting the channel with the highest contrast (the Red channel in this case) and dragging it onto the new channel icon.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Juey0.png"" alt=""New channel""></p>

<ul>
<li>Choose the Dodge tool, set the Range to Highlights, and the Exposure to 25% or so. (For more aggressive work, use a higher setting; for delicate areas choose 15% or 10%.)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sj69k.png"" alt=""Dodge tool settings""> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Set the size large. I used 125 pixels for your example.</p></li>
<li><p>Brush over artwork to remove the sketch lines. The inked lines won't be affected because they're black. Watch your inked lines just to certain you don't accidentally wipe out some detail. Every pass will apply the dodge setting cumulatively.</p></li>
<li><p>Zoom in, and with a small, hard edge Dodge brush take care of any detailed areas that your broad strokes left behind. There won't be too many. Here's what your example looked like after less than a minute with the Dodge tool:</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/htS23.png"" alt=""After Dodge tool""></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Invert the channel (Ctl-I)</p></li>
<li><p>Use the Dodge tool to make any grey in your ink lines white.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pCmqJ.png"" alt=""After invert and cleanup""></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ctl/Cmd-click on the channel icon to make it a selection.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch to the Layers panel. Your artwork layer should still be targeted.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the Layer Mask icon at the bottom of the Layers panel. This creates a layer mask according to your selection, and deselects automatically.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o4oLy.png"" alt=""With layer mask applied""></p>

<p>At this point, you can tweak the Levels adjustment layer as needed, and you can fine-tune the mask by brushing with white to reveal part of the layer or black to hide. Tweaking the mask is where a Wacom tablet becomes almost a necessity.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ogvht.png"" alt=""Layer Mask icon""></p>

","<p>If you know of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opponent_process"" rel=""noreferrer"">opponent-process theory</a>, you will know that there are 6 'special' colours: Black, white, red, green, yellow and blue.</p>

<p>Although the receptor cones in the eye are sensitive to Red, Green, and Blue, prior to processing the brain encodes the information using 3 channels:</p>

<ul>
<li>Black:White</li>
<li>Red:Green</li>
<li>Yellow:Blue</li>
</ul>

<p>These 6 colours are thus termed <em>unique hues</em> as each represents an extreme in one of of the 3 channels.</p>

<p>When more than one colour is needed, using unique hues allows more colours to be used and easily distinguished. As using them reduces the need for the designer to consider various aspects of colour theory, such as luminance or chrominance contrast.</p>

<p>These 6 colours are also great for learnability - they are so distinguished from one another that it makes information coding easier compared to using non-unique hues.</p>

For example, if red is the background color and I select a part of an image with red in it, I want my selection to consider the the red to be transparent.</p>

<p>Or equivalently : How can I change a specific color inside a selection to transparent?</p>
","<h2>Transparent selection with GIMP</h2>

<p>Below are some possible approaches using default GIMP 2.8. without additional plugins.</p>

<h3>Color to Alpha:</h3>

<p>To make the background color in a selection transparent we may take the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cDNbn.png"" alt=""enter image description here""> <strong>Edit - Copy</strong> the selection</li>
<li><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/k2Q00.png"" alt=""enter image description here""> <strong>Edit - Paste</strong> the selection</li>
<li><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/g5c7y.png"" alt=""enter image description here""> <strong>Colors - Color to Alpha...</strong> choose background color</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that in the example above the color channel for red is completely made transparent leading to a ""transparency"" with color shift in the grey area too. Depending on our source this may not be what we wanted.</p>

<h3>Select By Color</h3>

<ol>
<li><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cDNbn.png"" alt=""""> <strong>Edit - Copy</strong> the selection</li>
<li><strong>Edit - Paste as - New Image</strong> to work on a new image</li>
<li><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UWUd4.png"" alt=""enter image description here""> <strong>Tools - Selection Tools - By Color Select</strong> selects all the background</li>

<li><strong>Edit - Copy</strong> the selection</li>
<li><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gujZY.png"" alt=""enter image description here""> <strong>Edit - Paste</strong> the selection to our source.</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, depending on the source image we may find it faster to apply the <strong>By Color Select</strong> tool directly on the image background, invert this selection, then copy &amp; paste it to the destiny (or as a new image for further processing).</p>

"How to change font size without changing the position of the text?","14536","","<p>I have to change the size of multiple text labels in a plot, but I want to keep the labels in exactly the same position. The vertical center of each label is now aligned with a tick in the plot. </p>

<p>If I just increase the font size, the size increases with respect to the baseline of the text.  This produces a misalignment of the vertical center of the text with respect to the ticks. </p>

<p>To solve the problem I could create outlines of each label, but I would like to preserve editability, so this is not the solution I'm looking for.</p>
","<p>It's slightly tricky if you didn't start with centered text (which <em>will</em> increase from the center point when you increase the point size). You can work around this, though.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Set the transform proxy on the control panel to the bottom, right or left center depending on how the scaling needs to go and which center you need to lock in.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase the width and height of one label to the size you need (be sure that W and H are locked so they transform together.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the W or H field value.</p></li>
<li><p>Select another label and paste into the W or H field, then repeat for the remaining labels.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It's a good idea when working with point text to set the paragraph alignment to correspond with the design requirement. If you'll be centering the text on some other object use center alignment, right-align inline labels, and so on. This makes the initial design slightly faster, but makes a big difference when you start tweaking.</p>

"How to add clickable hyperlinks for email id, website, telephone in mail signature designed using Illustrator?","14503","","<p>One of my colleague had created a signature for the company using Adobe Illustrator. Now the head of our company wants clickable links to be present in the signature so that one should be able to click on the links and forwarded to the desired destination like email id, website, telephone, etc. The signature presently created is an pdf and jpeg format. How can we add clickable links to the signature?</p>
","<p>An e-mail signature should not be just an image. Don't forget that lots of people have images turned off in their e-mails by default, unless they press a button (which most won't do). Moreover, having the contact info there as (copyable) text is a huge plus that an image lacks.</p>

<p>Technically, I guess it's possible to make an html signature with just your image and a heatmap for the actual links, but this is far from wise. Most e-mail clients will not be able to parse the heatmap, in addition to the copyability issue mentioned above.</p>

<p>I'd say convert it all to html -- the simplest kind possible. Keep only actual images as such, and type out text as, well, text. That way, it's easy to place an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag around it for a clickable link.</p>

<p>Lastly, I don't think a *.pdf as an e-mail signature is ever going to work: the contents of the *.pdf aren't visible when you open the e-mail, you'll have to open the *.pdf separately. Again, most users won't do this. Personally, I'd feel quite annoyed if all I got for my trouble of opening was your contact info - which should already be present in your actual mail without any extra effort.</p>

"Why do JPEG files blur red more than other colors?","14351","","<p>I am trying to figure out why JPEG compression causes noise in the red spectrum that is larger and fuzzier in regards to, say, the blue spectrum.

<p>This behavior is highly visible in 'political campaign' images (where the picture is rendered in red, blue, and some shade of tan), but is visible elsewhere too.  Here is an example:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/U90ef.png"" alt=""Image of Spock in red, light blue, and tan."">
Notice the border along the red side?</p>
","<p>Everything @Scott said is true but for better understanding of the WHY and even how come RED seems to look worse, I direct you to <a href=""http://www.ou.edu/class/digitalmedia/articles/CompressionMethods_Gif_Jpeg_PNG.html"">this information</a> (emphasis mine and edited for flow)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JPEG ... is designed for compressing either
  full-color or gray-scale images of natural, real-world scenes [and] is
  a lossy compression algorithm...</p>
  
  <p>JPEGs are <strong>best suited for continuous tone images like photographs or
  natural artwork; not so well on sharp-edged or flat-color art like
  lettering, simple cartoons, or line drawings</strong>. JPEGs support 24-bits of
  color depth or 16.7 million colors. </p>
  
  <p>JPEG is actually just a compression algorithm, not a file format. 
  JPEG is <strong>designed to exploit certain properties of our eyes, namely,
  that we are more sensitive to slow changes of brightness and color
  than we are to rapid changes over a short distance</strong>. </p>
  
  <p>While JPEGs are usually the best choice for photographs, <strong><em>on 8-bit
  monitors they are force-dithered into an 8-bit palette. JPEG
  compression is treated as 24 bit data (8 bit for gray), regardless of
  the colors in the original image. Therefore, if you reduce an image
  from 24-bit to 8-bit prior to JPEG compression, the compression ratio
  will actually worsen as will the overall quality</em></strong>. </p>
  
  <p>JPEG compression <strong>introduces noise into solid-color areas, which can
  distort and even blur flat-color graphics. This is why JPEGs are not
  well suited to flat-color sharp-edged art or type</strong>.  A JPEG can reduce
  a 900K 24-bit image to 45K (high quality) or 30K (medium quality), a
  factor of 20:1 to 30:1. With JPEGs, however, <strong>the more you compress,
  the more edge definition and sharpness you lose</strong>.  JPEGs do not support
  transparency, either.</p>
  
  <p>It is important to note that saving a graphic to JPEG format with
  compression should be a last step. Compression <strong>effects are cumulative.
  This means that every time you re-save a JPEG file, you are
  compressing it further, and thereby tossing away data (photographic
  detail) that you can't get back</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now for the super technical details that explain the prevalence of the RED (which is a trick on the eye actually) you might want to read <a href=""http://www.jpegcruncher.com/"">this information</a> (again emphasis is mine)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The starting point of the JPEG compression are the pixels in the
  primary colors <strong>red, green and blue</strong>, which are for a lossy compression
  is not optimally suited. Before the actual compression simply convert
  the RGB colors, for example, in the YCrCb model that the first channel
  stores the pure brightness information (Y), so the average of the
  brightness of the red, blue and green channel. Stores in the second
  channel is the <strong>deviation of the red channel of the average brightness</strong>,
  and in the third channel, the deviation of the blue channel. The value
  for the green channel can be calculated from this and does not need to
  be specially recorded. <strong>Once you have separated as components luminance
  (brightness) and chrominance (color), you can reduce the resolution of
  the two chrominance channels to half or a quarter, as they for the
  sharpness does not matter. The visual cortex of humans contains
  independent systems for the perception of colors and shapes, and the
  color-blind would ignore the former fine resolution color boundaries
  anyway</strong>, the color detection system works again with a three to four
  times as low resolution as the form of recognition.</p>

"Pressure-sensitive freehand drawing of vector paths that are editable with the Illustrator Width tool?","14306","","<p>In illustrator, you can do pressure-sensitive drawing with the Blob Brush tool (if you set Width to Pressure in the settings from double-clicking the icon). You can also fine-tune the widths of paths with the Width tool.</p>

<p>But you can't use both on the same sketch. The Blob Brush makes filled areas, and the Width Tool only works on paths with strokes.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KCr36.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This means, when doing freehand drawing in Illustrator, you have to choose between two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the best tool for natural freehand drawing (Blob Brush with a pressure-sensitive pen), but lose the best tool for conveniently fine-tuning a line drawing with variable width lines when tweaking it afterwards.</li>
<li>Trying to do natural freehand drawing with the pen tool or pencil tool, then laboriously add every twist, turn and flick manually after the event with the width tool.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Is there any way to get the best of both? Pressure-sensitive freehand drawing in Illustrator that can then be fine-tuned using the width tool?</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure there's nothing in Illustrator CS6 that does this by default, so I'll accept answers that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Involve things other than Illustrator. I don't mind, for example, sketching in Inkscape then copying it to Illustrator to do fine tuning (if there's a way to do so that is natural and works as above).</li>
<li>Involve paid plugins. On <a href=""http://forums.adobe.com/thread/979137"" rel=""noreferrer"">the closest thing to a discussion of this I can find</a>, someone mentions the paid plugin <a href=""http://www.astutegraphics.com/products/drawscribe/"" rel=""noreferrer"">DrawScribe</a>'s Dynamic Sketch feature. But, I can't see anything in the <a href=""http://www.astutegraphics.com/products/drawscribe/dynamic-sketch.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">promotion for that feature</a> that seems to do what I want. There's also the <a href=""http://www.astutegraphics.com/products/widthscribe/movies.html#brush"" rel=""noreferrer"">WidthScribe Width Brush</a> but it looks like a more convenient way to apply the Width tool to existing paths than something that can be used for the original drawing.</li>
<li>Require a script or a bit of Javascript hacking. The fact the Blob Brush exists proves Illustrator can turn pressure data into numerical widths and adjustments to point on a path, so in theory it should be possible to convert this into the nodes the Width tool adds to a path instead of the anchor points on an area shape. But I've got no idea where to start even thinking about making this work.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Right now the best option I can come up with is drawing with the blob brush, then manually tracing over those lines again with the pencil tool, then using the width tool to mimic and tweak the twists and turns of the original natural freehand drawing. </p>

<p>It doesn't loose initial freehand spontaneity like just using the pencil tool from the start, but it's really inconvenient and time-consuming. I'm sure there's got to be a better way.</p>
","<p>Reiterating a bit of what you've posted in your question.....</p>

<p>By far the best tool I know of for Illustrator where natural drawing is concerned is <strong><a href=""http://www.astutegraphics.com/products/drawscribe/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DrawScribe from www.astutegraphics.com</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Edit as of Jan 2014 DrawScribe has been folded into Astute's <a href=""http://www.astutegraphics.com/software/dynamicsketch/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DynamicSketch</a> plug in</em></strong>, same functionality shown here (plus more) but with a new name.</p>

<p>This does everything you've outlined, as well as remaining standard AI art. It merely provides a different method for creating that AI art.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/22FiS.gif"" alt=""sketch""></p>

<p><em>(Of course it's easier if you zoom in to select those finicky width points. ;) )</em></p>

<p>I realize this is a third-party, $$$, solution. But it's well worth it. There is a free demo I'd encourage you to try.</p>

<hr>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.astutegraphics.com/software/widthscribe/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WidthScribe</a> Tools from Astute Graphics are indeed an easy way to apply width profiles to paths. They can be used in conjunction with any path that will accept Width Tool input. They allow you to essentially brush on width variations and eliminate the need to manually add and pull width points.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/W9DLh.gif"" alt=""width brush""></p>

<hr>

<p>One additional note on the plug ins above. Its important to realize that they create <strong>standard Illustrator artwork</strong>. You don't need to have any of the plug ins installed to open a file which was created by using them. Open a file created using the Dynamic Sketch Tool in a copy of AI without DrawScribe installed, and you'd never know what was used to create the art. This is quite different than other plug ins in this respect.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you must stick with the standard install of AI, there really isn't a great tool for what you are after. A very simple Art Brush set to read pressure can get close. However, the pressure read doesn't tend to be as smooth as the Blob Brush tool.</p>

<p>Note: </p>

<p>If the selection of the background ends up breaking due to the ""grid pattern"", you can work around it, like I did, by duplicating the later and applying a blur filter to smooth it out, then applying the magic wand selection. Switch back to the other later and fine tune with the quick selection tool. </p>

","<p>Live Trace doesn't do gradients, so can only work with discrete colors (hence the banding).

","<p>Before you get into extruding your icon, it's worth considering that a) you only have a very small number of pixels to play with (3 at the most, really), and b) there are very, very few Android app icons that use (or fake) extrusion to create the illusion of depth.</p>

<p>If you have Extended, here are the steps:</p>

<li><p>From the 3D panel, choose <code>Repousse Object</code> and click <code>Create</code>. Adjust as needed.</p></li>

<p>If you don't have Extended, you can quickly create a simple faux extrusion by duplicating your icon layer twice and moving the copies below the original. Nudge the upper copy up and right one pixel, and the lower copy up and right two pixels, then merge the two layers. Darken the visible part of the merged layer with the Burn tool or use a Levels adjustment. (If you need more ""extrusion,"" make more than two layers, but I wouldn't go beyond three for an icon.)</p>

<p>I would recommend <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9CNsBCmrNg"" rel=""nofollow"">this video</a>. It's a video series where a guy builds a great machine for video editing. It's also nice because the parts he chose are compatible with OSX, meaning you can use a Windows or Apple operating system (or anything else) on the computer.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly he built his set-up (not including monitors/keyboard/mouse) for around $2,200. but it could be more/less expensive depending on where and when you buy the parts. I personally usually wait for Black Friday, here in the US, for buying all my electronics (or Cyber Monday). This usually saves me a couple hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the components he used:</p>

</ul>

<p>Things to note about this build are:</p>

<ul>
<li>You don't need 3 SSDs, it's just what he chose and you could omit one
or two and still have it function (though of course you'd want a
back-up/storage drive to accompany it).</li>
<li>You don't need a 1000W PSU, you could buy the bare-minimum needed to run the set-up and still have it function.</li>
<li>You can find a cheaper case.</li>

<p>Some options I'm aware of, all of which are a bit rubbish:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Replace them.</strong> Setting the fill for the labels to none, and just putting your own labels in, aligning and spacing them with the tools in the Align palette. This is a pain when you have lots of charts or need to update the charts frequently</li>
<li><strong>Bodge the Y-axis scale.</strong> Changing the Y axis scale of the chart, instead of scaling it. So in my example, I might under <code>Graph type &gt; Value Axis &gt; Override calculated values</code> set 'max' to 4,000, halving the height of the chart, and doubling the amount of divisions. Then with the direct selection tool, I'd drag the vertical axis line down to the 2000 mark, and set the fill of everything above 2000 to none. This works (and is my current favoured option), but it's a serious hack and scatters my files with invisible chart debris (and the direct selection tool work needs re-doing each time the data is updated).</li>
<li><strong>Abusing Illustrator's type tools to compensate.</strong> For example, if you scaled the text vertically to 50%, setting the 'Vertical Scale' option in the Character window to 200%, hoping the two distorting scalings will cancel each other out. Sounds like a recipe for horribly unclean type.</li>
<li><strong>Start again.</strong> Deleting the chart and creating a new one at the appropriate size. This is sometimes the easiest way, and results in no debris, but it's obviously not an ideal solution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any other / better ways?</p>

"Effective way to cut out clouds in photoshop","13888","","<p>I've had to use clouds in projects on more than one occasion, and I'd like to find a way to extract (select only) the clouds.</p>

<p>There are a lot of good brushes for this type of thing but often times they're too small, If I could figure out the process used to make something like this I would be able to make my own from stock images.</p>

<p>The brushes below are a good example of what I'm trying to achieve. They're cut very nicely and will look clean on any background</p>

<p><a href=""http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&amp;section=&amp;q=clouds+brush#/dkep1o"">http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&amp;section=&amp;q=clouds+brush#/dkep1o</a></p>

<p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>
","<p>To answer the question asked:</p>

<p>This is easiest to do if you start with images that have fairly good, clean cloud edges against a plain blue (or orange, or whatever) sky. Photoshop lets you get from any given Point A to some other Point B in a bunch of different ways, so here's a technique that will work in just about any version.</p>

<p>Photoshop creates brushes from grayscale values. Black parts of an image or selection become fully opaque in the new brush, white parts are fully transparent, and shades of gray translate to different levels of opacity, just like they do in a mask or an alpha channel, our clouds have to be BLACK, but so that we can see what we're doing we're going to keep them white until the very last step.</p>

<p>Step 1. Pick a good image with clear cloud shapes and good contrast as a starting point. Overall image quality isn't important, just the clouds. One like this will work well, but feel free to experiment!:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lHfJ3.jpg"" alt=""Clouds (Copyright 2002 Alan Gilbertson)""></p>

<p>Step 2. In the Channels palette, find the channel that has the best detail and highest contrast between the cloud and its background. (Hint: The red channel for daytime skies, blue channel for orange sunrise/sunset.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/47Jpg.jpg"" alt=""Pick the best contrast channel.""></p>

<p>Step 3. Now we're going to lighten the highlights, darken the sky <em>and</em> make a new document all in one shot, using a command most users have never touched and never wanted to get anywhere near: Calculations. (Was that a momentary frisson of terror I detected from the gallery? -- Have no fear, my friends! No images were harmed in the making of this tutorial.) Select Image > Calculations.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/m7iea.jpg"" alt=""The Calculations dialog""></p>

<p>In the dialog, select ""New Document"" in the ""Result"" drop-down (way down at the bottom), as shown.</p>

<p>3b. We're going to play the Red channel against itself, and the default blend mode of multiply may not give you the best results. This is a great place to experiment with different modes (and find out that Calculations, far from being intimidating, is actually way cool). With this example image it worked out that Hard Light, with an Opacity of about 70% gave a good result, but every image is different. Click OK.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XoZiU.jpg"" alt=""Hard Light at 69%""></p>

<p>Now we have a new document with only one channel, called ""Alpha 1"". We need to make the parts of the image that we don't want to be in the new brush completely black, without messing up the nice texture in the cloud:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eNtW4.jpg"" alt=""A new document with only one channel""></p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li>Press Ctrl-L or Cmd-L to bring up the Levels dialog. In this case we already have good blacks, but the whites benefit from a minor tweak to the highlight slider, bringing out a little more texture in the clouds.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Eyb62.jpg"" alt=""Levels adjustment""></p>

<ol start=""5"">
<li>Clean up any unwanted gray bits (the bottom left, in our example) using the Burn tool. Set the Range to Shadows and Exposure to about 25%. You want to darken the shadows to black, but without destroying the fluffy cloud edges, so take it gradually!</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LSBw8.jpg"" alt=""Unwanted areas are burned to total black with the Burn tool""></p>

<ol start=""6"">
<li><p>Invert the image (Ctrl/Cmd-I) and check the white areas to be sure they are entirely white. Use the Dodge tool set to ""Range: Highlights"" and ""Exposure: 50%"" to clean up any stray gray areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose Edit > Define Brush Preset, give your brush a name, click OK and you're done!</p></li>

"How can I reduce/smooth the colors of an image?","13871","","<p>I have an drawing that was created with colored markers.  I've scanned it and would like to use it as clip-art/icon style image.  </p>

<p>I'm wondering how I can smooth out the colors of the image such that the marker strokes are no longer visible.  I've tried posterizing, but this also ruins the edge of the image and ends up appearing too extreme. </p>

<p>Are there some other techniques I could use to make an acceptable-looking icon or clip art from a scan of a marker/crayon/colored-pencil drawing.  </p>
","<p>Here are two techniques you can use in Photoshop, commonly used for exactly this kind of situation. They give different results, so pick the one that achieves what you're looking for. </p>

<p>A basic thing to keep in mind is that marker strokes (including the texture of the paper than is usually visible) are really just a form of noise. In this type of situation, though, the ""noise"" pixel areas are usually beyond the scope of <code>Filter &gt; Noise &gt; Reduce Noise</code> or <code>Filter &gt; Noise &gt; Dust and Scratches</code>.</p>

<p>Here is a detail, zoomed to 250%, from a scan I received from a client. (The artist did a terrible job of the scan using some kind of homeowner-grade Mac imaging software, but the marker strokes, which is what we're interested in, are clearly visible.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HeIEN.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ul>
<li><code>Filter &gt; Noise &gt; Median</code> merges the colors in adjacent pixels. Isolate the drawing from the background first and keep it selected so that the filter doesn't blur the edges. Adjust the radius to get the effect you're looking for. It will be small -- 2-5 pixels, depending on the size of the image, is usually plenty. You can apply this more than once to build the effect gradually.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xopJA.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ul>
<li><code>Filter &gt; Blur &gt; Surface Blur</code> is often more useful. It blurs regions where the brightness differences among adjacent pixels are below a threshold setting. (No need to make a selection, because it doesn't affect hard edges.) It's a matter of playing with the values until you see the effect you want. The higher the threshold value, the more pixels will be affected. Again, you can apply this one more than once. Sometimes applying the Median filter first, then Surface Blur, gives the best result.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xQmDe.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Both of these can be applied to the composite RGB image or to individual channels. In some cases, changing the mode to Lab (Image > Mode > Lab), applying Surface Blur only to the Lightness (L) channel, then switching back to RGB and applying again to the RGB image will give you ""better"" (depending on the effect you want) results.</p>

<p>Sometimes one of these will get you all the way. Usually you'll still have to do a little bit of touch-up with the Spot Healing Brush, Patch Tool or Clone Stamp. Experiment a bit, and you'll soon get the hang of which one, or which combination, works best in different situations.</p>

"Are Macs preferable to PCs for handling graphics software?","13810","","<p>Excuse me for being totally uninformed, but it usually seems like creative types of people i.e. graphics designers prefer Macs over PCs for accomplishing their tasks. I was wondering, why is this? Is it because the software is designed specifically for Macs only?</p>
","<p>There's also the aesthetic side to it. I am and have always been a PC user. However, I still have to admit that OS X and Mac hardware have always been better designed from an aesthetic standpoint than Windows/PC.</p>

<p>Designers naturally gravitate towards beautiful designs. And since we all draw inspiration from our environment and absorb influences from the designs we come across, being surrounded by beautiful typography and stylish interfaces all the time can also make you a better designer.</p>

<p>The Mac culture and Apple brand are also very attractive to creative types (musicians, artists, writers, etc.) because of the way Apple has marketed themselves (e.g. the Think Different. campaign). Not all of this is marketing of course. Macs have deliberately catered to designers and artists, producing high-end DCC workstations and developing strategic partnerships in the multimedia production industries to make sure that leading tools were designed specifically for Macs.</p>

<p>In addition to preinstalled (high quality) creative software, Macs have also historically come standard with a better spread of fonts than PCs. It also didn't hurt that Macs came with high quality S-PVA or S-IPS displays instead of the common TN displays that most PCs come with (this is starting to change as Apple tries to cater more to the general public).</p>

<p>When you see Guitar Center selling Pro Tools + Macbook Pro bundles and your university media center is equipped entirely with Apple workstations and 30"" Apple Cinema displays, what are you liable to buy as a musician/graphic designer/animator/etc. when you decide to buy a workstation?</p>

<p>Between the aesthetics, their strategic positioning in digital media industries, their brand appeal, their momentum, and their ease of use, it's no wonder that most designers choose to just drop a couple of grand on a Mac instead of building their own PC for 20-30% less.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Littlemad's answer reminded me of a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>For cross-browser/platform testing, you probably should get a Mac since Macs can run Windows, OS X, and Linux easily &amp; legally, whereas the same cannot be said about PCs.</li>
<li>It should be noted that not all Apple LCD displays are S-IPS or S-PVA anymore. Though the high end Cinema displays still use S-IPS AFAIK, and as do the larger MBPs.</li>
<li>They have the same BS policy as most other LCD sellers&mdash;a display has to have more than <em>X</em> dead/stuck pixels/subpixels to be considered defective. So you still need to buy an ISO 13406-2 <strong>Class 1</strong> display to be sure your LCD isn't defective.</li>

<p>It is up to me to come up with these goals, but I have a hard time coming up with measurable goals in my job.

<p>Thanks so much!!</p>
","<p><strong>Preface:</strong> I do it sounds like the exact same work as you, but don't follow any sort of ""SMART"" protocol. My boss is also very understanding that some endeavors will work and some won't, if anything he is more inclined to take risks on some marketing ideas than I am.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm in charge of designing and developing our main web site, creating email templates, increasing social engagement and visitors, building web graphics, trade show collateral, product data sheets, webinar graphics, etc</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Social Engagement and Visitors</strong></p>

<p>Well this is easy enough. Did you see an increase in Likes, Visitors, etc? Did changing the design result in longer visits? If you have a ""Goal"" did the change see an increase in users reaching that goal? A lot of times websites will talk about setting Goals only around Checkout but as an example we only sell to Dealers. The ultimate Goal of our website is an End User sees it, uses our Dealer Locator, and then clicks through to the Dealer's website. That's our Goal. Design for that.</p>

<p><strong>Product Data Sheets and Trade Show Collateral</strong></p>

<p>How is it received by your target market? Being Data Sheets it sounds B2B, does your company have any long time loyal clients? Talk to them about it. What parts of the design do they like, what do they find confusing, what do they struggle with, etc. For example we sell items in 56 different color combinations and had a very confusing color matrix that my boss was originally adamant about. After talking to Dealers though none of them were using it because they, like me, found it very busy and confusing. On our new catalog I removed it entirely and instead show a small sample of actual products in different colors fanned out.</p>

<p>As far as making something like this measurable it is much more tricky. First you have to have historic data which you may not have. But let's say you do --- you can look at how many catalogs did you give out? How many leads did you generate? Or how many actual sales came through? Or all 3 even. Part of this depends on product and lifecycle. For us if we go to a show and gave out 30 catalogs last year, and go again the next year with a more targeted catalog and end up giving away 100 then that's a very real success. It's one we're currently experiencing as I continue to create different marketing materials depending on the audience it'll be given too.</p>

<p><strong>Website Graphics and Webinars</strong></p>

<p>This can get a bit tricky as well (really all of this is). We don't create webinars here but we do have a technical product that requires some advanced knowledge. One thing we look at is a Content Drilldown to see where visitors are spending their time, then I talk to my coworkers that generally field calls and see what people are asking about. As an example we have a ""Sticker"" page that talks about the Stickers construction and benefits. But it was receiving a disproportionately short time on page compared to other parts of our website. Talking to coworkers I found they're calling in and asking some key questions - how to order more stickers and how to customize the stickers just as an example. So I created new graphics, new copy, and laid the page out in a way that ""How to order"" was very prominent. Time on page increased, calls asking about it decreased.</p>

<p>While we don't do webinars I do develop videos for us. One of the most successful things is when a dealer calls to say how much he likes the video and used it in a presentation with a client to sell our product. Another time a Dealer gave the video to a client, the client put it on their facebook page and we saw our largest ever traffic spike. That video is clearly successful in delivering the message it was intended to. (It's about our product's security)</p>

<p><strong>More Specifics</strong></p>

<p>As far as specifics related to SMART goes I don't think I can answer that. For one thing Product Lifecycle will be key. Our product has a 10 year lifecycle generally. We don't go to tradeshows expecting to sell much. We just want them to know about us so when they do upgrade their system we'll be something they consider. So a realistic goal for us might be if we spend $10,000 on marketing to Universities (trade publications and conferences) that we see an increase in calls and/or quotes related to Universities over the next 3 years. I'm not even saying sales just calls/quotes. That tells me our marketing during that time period to the University industry was working. But this is just a very rough example and yours will be completely different.</p>

<p>Hope some of this helps you.</p>

"How do I combine PNGs into a PDF without losing quality?","13758","","<p>I have a few hundred high-res PNGs I'd like to combine into a 200+ page PDF using only lossless compression on the images that are becoming the pages of the PDF. </p>

<p>But when using Adobe Acrobat's 'Combine Files into a Single PDF' feature, Acrobat always noticeably degrades the quality of the images when converting them and assembling them into a PDF, even when I have all of Acrobat's PNG->PDF conversation preferences set to use lossless compression only.</p>

<p>I'm on Mac OS 10.11.1 and using Adobe Acrobat XI.</p>

<p>ETA: Each PNG is 1210 × 1450 pixels. Yes, I'm viewing the PDF at ""actual size."" The document properties on the resulting PDF says the page size is 16.81 x 20.14 in.</p>

<p>How can I assemble high-quality PNGs into a PDF without degrading image quality?</p>
","<p>The page size (16.81 x 20.14 in.) is exactly the number of pixels at 72 ppi. There's nothing abnormal there. </p>

<p>The question is: What page size do you expect? </p>

<p>Your PNG are low resolution and Adobe Acrobat simply take what you have and doesn't modify them. If you expect a different page size or would prefer a higher resolution and smaller size, you'll probably need to resave your PNG with a higher resolution or maybe have a look at the <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/57810/create-a-pdf-from-illustrator-without-being-able-to-see-the-individual-objects/57876#57876"">preflight functionality</a> of Acrobat Pro to modify the resolution quickly within the PDF.</p>

<hr>

<p>To come back on your issue of Acrobat lowering the quality of your PNG: <strong>One thing you might want to verify is the resolution of your Acrobat preferences.</strong> If you use the default setting, it might show your image bigger when viewing at 100%. If you use 72ppi then it should show you the images as they truly are. </p>

<p>It's possible this is what makes the images look lower resolution. So it's worth trying a different setting that fits your screen.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hQIGW.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hQIGW.jpg"" alt=""Adobe Acrobat Pro resolution""></a></p>

<p>You can also have a look at the PNG to PDF conversion preferences; by default they seem to be at medium quality. Maybe that's what you're referring to in your question and you already verified this.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xj4zk.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xj4zk.jpg"" alt=""convert PNG to PDF""></a></p>

<p>If you aren't sure if your Acrobat is doing a good job, simply open a few of these PDF in Photoshop at their native resolution. If the image is the same and you're happy with the results, then the issue was probably only the resolution preview in Acrobat. </p>

<p>Acrobat doesn't always show images, texts and vector in a perfect way, and there's a few settings in your preferences that don't affect the file but still display them differently than in a software like Photoshop.</p>

"Illustrator wont make a compound path from the full shape","13712","","<p>I have the following shape I have drawn with the pen tool. The bird head and eye are a compound path but releasing them both from this makes little difference.</p>

","<p>The trouble you were running into is because of how you are cutting out your paths. Because you are using a group of paths and one compound path to cut out, Illustrator has to make an assumption about what color you want your fill to be of the compound path. It chose the orange because it had two options to choose from on the compound path and changes the entire color of the compound path to match the background.</p>

<p>There is a better way to cut out your paths from the background and it is by using the <strong>Pathfinder Operations</strong>. Group your objects you would like to cut out and then use the option <strong>Minus Front</strong>. This will allow you to have editable paths while cutting out the symbol with all transparency.</p>

<p>Excuse the quick and ugly recreation of your object.

"Issues with creating a hi-res Large Icon for Android notifications in Jelly Bean","13657","","<p>I am attempting to create beautiful hi-res graphics for Android notifications, but am running into some issues. In Jelly Bean, there is a new place for large icons (<a href=""http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/notifications.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">see the notification design guidelines here</a>) on the left side of the notification banner (see below #2 Large icon):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/542RP.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>All of the stock Android icons are beautiful and hi-res, but unfortunately the icons I have been creating in illustrator/photoshop do not look as crisp on the hi-res display. </p>

<p>My files are 96 x 96px, but I am concerned that this isn't the right size for hi-res icons, and I haven't found any good info anywhere regarding the best sizing for these. </p>

<p>Any help is greatly appreciated! </p>
","<p>Android icons (and other UI elements, like drag lengths) are measured in <code>dp</code>. A <code>dp</code> is a <strong>device/density-independent pixel</strong>. <code>1 dp</code> is equivalent to <strong>1 px on a 160 dpi screen</strong>. But to convert to other screen densities, you need to multiply it by a density factor. So it's generally recommended that <a href=""http://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">multiple images are supplied for most icons</a>.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href=""http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html#notification"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">notification icons used in the <em>status bar</em></a> are specified as 24x24 dp, with a 1 dp margin (so the actual icon only takes up a 22x22 dp optical square, though some of the AA can bleed into that 1 dp margin/safeframe). To convert 24 dp to actual pixel sizes, these rough calculations are used:</p>

<pre><code>display density  dp units * scale = px units
ldpi   ~120 dpi   24x24 dp * .75   = 18x18 px
mdpi   ~160 dpi   24x24 dp * 1.0   = 24x24 px
hdpi   ~240 dpi   24x24 dp * 1.5   = 36x36 px
xhdpi  ~320 dpi   24x24 dp * 2.0   = 48x48 px
xxhdpi ~480 dpi   24x24 dp * 3.0   = 72x72 px
</code></pre>

<p>There's also an intermediate display density called <code>tvdpi</code> (~213 dpi) that sits between <code>mdpi</code> and <code>hdpi</code> and has a scale factor of <code>1.33</code>, but this is much less common. What the Android docs recommend is that you follow a <code>3:4:6:8:12</code> scaling ratio when providing prescaled bitmap images (usually PNGs) for the most common display densities.</p>

<p>I don't see anywhere where they specify the dp size for the large icons used in notifications, but the height of each notification in <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications.html#NormalNotify"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">normal inbox view</a> is <strong>64 dp</strong>. So that means the max size for icons/images shown there would be:</p>

<pre><code>ldpi:      48x48 px
mdpi:      64x64 px
hdpi:      96x96 px
xhdpi:   128x128 px
xxhpdi:  192x192 px
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to know exactly what image sizes Android's stock icons are, you should be able to find out from the <a href=""http://developer.android.com/shareables/icon_templates-v4.0.zip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Android Icon Templates Pack, v4.0</a>.</p>

"Number of pieces of work required in a Portfolio","13611","","<p>I completed my undergrad in Graphic design and I'm currently looking for a job. I'm aware that I need a portfolio to be considered for an interview. I would like to know ideally how many pieces of work should I submit? Also, while creating a portfolio piece is it ok to borrow content from websites or other work(posters, flyers etc). </p>
","<p>There is really no definitive answer to this question.</p>

<p><strong>It's generally best to shoot for around 10 give or take one or two.</strong> But, there is no rule.</p>

<p>While I don't really know what content you are referring to with <em>""is it ok to borrow content from websites or other work""</em> - it is generally unacceptable to ""borrow"" anything for a portfolio. The purpose of a portfolio is to show <em>your</em> work, nNot how well you ""borrow"" content.</p>

<p>That being posted, if by chance you mean something like <em>""I designed a poster for a band named XXXX and I used dates from their North American tour I found on some other poster.""</em> that is generally not an issue. But if you designed a web site for, say, ""Bob's Chokeburger"" a fast food chain, you could not ""borrow"" content from McDonald's web site to fill in text areas and the like.</p>

<p>In all cases ""borrowing"" images, logos, and other graphic elements is a very big mistake for a portfolio.</p>

"What should I do if a potential client claims my pricing is too high?","13601","","<p>I gave a possible client a price estimation for concept of a character, and making it 3D as well. 
Now I find out that my estimation is double what he is paying his current artists. He never mentioned a budget and I believe he was under the impression I was a college student that would work for $50.
He even mentions that he has an artist with 40 years of experience giving him concept work, for just $150. </p>

<p>I find it highly unlikely that this is true. With so many years of experience, an artist wouldn't sell their work for $150. Their work is worth so much more. 
I feel this client was trying to take advantage of me. 
Now I'm in a tough situation. Part of me wants to salvage the situation, apologize in some way and accept $150 for my work. Likely he won't give me that now, since I don't have the experience to be worth that.</p>

<p>Doing that however feels like I'm saying ""I'm sorry, I'm a cheap artist, I'm not worth more money but I dared ask for more. sorry about that, please still hire me."" </p>

<p>In this economy, every penny counts. Even if I did want to say ""just give me 150 bucks for something that clearly costs more"", how would I say that professionally?</p>
","<p>This is a bit of an opinion-based question, but I still think there's value in it. Also somewhat belongs on Freelance.SE, but may fit here as well.</p>

<p>To be honest, the most difficult part of freelancing is sticking to your guns during negotiations. This is compounded if you financially <em>need</em> the work. The best option is often to simply stick to your price <em>""Sorry, my prices are my prices. I understand if you need to seek other venues.""</em> I realize that is more easily typed than done in many situations. However, you'll gain far more client respect by quoting and sticking to it. After all, people don't haggle pricing with their electrician, or plumber, or doctor, or any other professional. And 8 out of 10 times, I've found that if I'm adamant about my pricing, the client pays it. They all <strong><em>want</em></strong> a better deal if you'll cave. That <strong>doesn't mean you have to</strong> give in to their ""<em>my brother can use Photoshop and he'll do it for $20 and a beer</em>."" argument.</p>

<p>Now, if you <strong>must</strong> accept <em>anything</em> the client offers, realize first that you are immediately setting the tone for the relationship. Lower your price once and the client will tend to expect it each and every time. Whether consciously or subconsciously clients pick up on your weakness in negotiations and will use the same tactics on their next project when discussing pricing. Be prepared for that the next time the client contacts you. If you lower your price a second time, you immediately loose all footing for future negotiations. A second price reduction will permanently set the client in a power position and that client will almost never be a profitable client. Once is a ""deal"" or ""special bargain"". More than once is just poor business practice.</p>

<p>If you <em>really</em> need the work at much less than you think it is worth, then I'd suggest something like, ""I'll offer you a one time discount of xx%. This will be for this project only since we haven't worked together previously. If you like my work, future projects will be priced at my traditional rates.""</p>

<p>One of the most difficult lessons I learned was to not waiver when a client (especially new client) argues pricing. They never stop arguing it. I don't mind the initial asking if they can get things done for less, but if I say ""No"", then that's the end of the conversation - either pay what I've bid/quoted or find someone else. My rates are set for a reason. That's what I <strong>need</strong> to make to pay my bills and live. If a client doesn't respect my rates, they won't ever respect my time or my work. And for every client that whines about pricing, there are 5 others that won't.</p>

<hr>

<p>Addendum:</p>

<p><strong>The following is more anecdotal than anything else</strong>, but I feel it shows a valuable exchange I dealt with a just a couple weeks ago. I've never had a conversation with a client that so <strong>clearly</strong> showed almost every possible red flag a client can send up for me. I've been freelancing for over a decade and still get approached by clients that prove themselves to be problematic. Experience doesn't prevent bad clients contacting you. But experience does help you spot them faster.</p>

<p>I've trimmed things down a bit, reading the email chain can be quite hilarious (to me) at times.....</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Client:</strong> How much for this?</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> For that project the price would be $X.</li>
<li><strong>Client:</strong> That's too high, can you do it for $X? </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>No harm here. His offer was about 2/3rds of my quote. There's absolutely nothing wrong with a client asking if they can get things cheaper. It's very common and almost expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> Sorry. I simply can't complete this project for that amount. My price is $X.</li>
<li><strong>Client:</strong> How about I pay you $X an hour? That's more than fair.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Red Flag #1:</strong> At this point, <strong>I pretty much know this clients is a loss and won't pay my pricing</strong>. Yes, it happens that fast. Any client who takes it upon themselves to price <em>my time</em> without fully understanding my experience or abilities, doesn't respect me. Not to mention, clients have <em>no way</em> of knowing my overhead and what I <em>must</em> make in order to survive. It's sheer arrogance for anyone to assume they can put a price on my time without first fully understanding my responsibilities. And to think it's ""fair"" that he does so is astounding to me. Realistically, his offer was lower than my rates, but it wasn't overly insultingly lower. Someone just starting out freelancing would have seen his offer as decent. But nonetheless, it was below my rates and below what I quoted. Noted, but giving him the benefit of the doubt, why, I'm not really certain. I should have left things here comfortable in the fact that I avoided a bad client. But, it was a slow day and I was a bit bored ....</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> That is fair, if that was what I priced my work at. Unfortunately it isn't. My price is $X. I have a great deal of work and it makes no business sense to cut my rates for a single client. I'm sorry but my pricing is my pricing. It is not going to change. I understand if you need to explore other avenues for design. Thank you. </li>
<li><strong>Client:</strong> We will have a lot of work in the future. We deal with XXXX marketers and will need designs to be updated and created regularly. If you give us a break here, we'll be sending you a lot more work.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Red Flag #2:</strong> The ""promise"" of ""tons of work"" in the future is also a common ploy used by bad clients. Anyone who truly has a lot of work to be done ""in the future"" will be more than willing to accept the <em>promise</em> of a <em>future</em> discount based on their <em>promise</em> of <em>future</em> work. I was pretty certain at this point I don't want this client. Even if he agrees to my pricing. And actually now, I'm thankful he never did.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Me:</strong> That's great. I would love to be able to assist. In the future I'd be happy to discuss discounts based on the quantity of projects when you're prepared to move forward with design. However, at this time, for this initial piece my pricing is $X.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Client:</strong> I have an in-house guy who says it's only a 3-4 hour job.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Red Flag #3</strong> Ahh... so factor the 3-4 hours his ""in-house guys"" say's it'll take plus the $X per hour offer... he's basically pushing to pay about <em>half</em> of what I quoted. Comparing my services to some random in-house person, who I know <em>absolutely nothing</em> about, shows a <em>complete</em> disregard for me and my abilities.  Why isn't his in-house guy doing the work if he has an in-house guy? Why is he even discussing pricing with me if he has someone on-staff capable of doing this? He's clearly coming to me for a specific reason. He's merely unwilling to pay me for that reason. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Red flag #4</strong> This is a very narrow-minded, solipsistic, view of things. He's not seeing me as a business or even as a person. He's only seeing me in terms of the money he needs to pay not in terms of my time, my skill, my responsibilities. Is he going to provide me with a 401k, vacation time, sick leave, paid holidays? Is he going to cover my electricity and other operating expenses the same way he does for his ""in-house guy""? Does this ""in-house guy"" have a proven track record of creating successful pieces over the past couple decades? If not, how can he logically reduce my work to what <em>he</em> thinks I need to make to pay my bills? And how on Earth could he possibly know how much time it would take <em>me</em> to complete this project?? The reality is the time his ""in-house guy"" suggested was inaccurate. Does he think I do what I do just for fun and don't need to pay a mortgage or support a family???</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> Great! I'm sure your in-house guy will do a wonderful job. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>I should have ended the conversation here. I've told him at least 3 times what my pricing is and that it <em>will not</em> change. Any further response from him trying to alter my pricing is clearly just an attempt to badger me into giving him what he wants. It was my fault for responding any further once I knew there was no way this client would <strong>ever</strong> be a respectful or happy client. At this point I was 100% certain I did not <strong><em>want</em></strong> to work with this guy, regardless of any pricing.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Things went like this for a couple more rounds with my explaining that he came to me initially because he liked the design I did on another piece and pricing reflected the design <em>not</em> just minutes of pushing around a mouse. </p></li>
<li><p>From here the client became increasingly insulting and <em>exceptionally</em>
condescending. Even going so far as to call my pricing ""retarded"" and me ""crazy"". It
was a clear attempt to <strong>bully me</strong> into lowering prices to what he
wanted.</p></li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> I've tried to remain polite throughout this entire exchange in spite of your repeated insults. I'm sorry but I'm not interested in <strong><em>any</em></strong> work from your company at this time. Thank you.</li>
<li><strong>Client:</strong> We feel the same way.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>One Month later</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Client:</strong> Hi. Sorry about the miscommunication before. I apologize if I insulted you. You were right. This is more difficult than we thought. Can we pay you $X <strong>(DOUBLE my quote)</strong> to do this? Would you be interested in completing it? I promise I'll be easy to deal with.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This <strong>surprised</strong> me. I figured he'd go off and have his in-house guy do whatever he was going to do and I'd never hear from him again. He'd then use a ""borrowed"" design based on the original piece he liked of mine. It may or may not have had a good return, but I wasn't holding out any hopes he'd contact me again in the future.</p>
  
  <p>There was a great deal of satisfaction in seeing that email, as I'm sure you can imagine. In the end he gave validity to my pricing and he's probably less argumentative when discussing pricing for conceptual work in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> Hi. I'm sorry you've had a difficult time creating the design. However, as I stated before I'm not interested in any work from your company at this time. Thank you.</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven't heard back, and don't expect to. I really didn't want to work with the guy for any reason.</p>

<p>Now, I could have easily accepted that final offer at <em>more</em> than what I originally quoted. However, the exchange with this client threw up red flags with every email. It's clear from the <strong>second</strong> he offered to pay me X per hour that he had absolutely no respect for me or my rates. The ""in-house guy"" comment then solidified that perception. Clients like this are destined to <strong>always</strong> be a problem, <strong>always</strong> take more of your time, <strong>always</strong> be slow to pay, and <strong>always</strong> have scope creep (wanting as much as you let them get away with). It would have been an ""abusive"" relationship at every turn with me being the one getting the short end of the stick. </p>

<p>If I were desperate for the money, I may have taken his initial, lower, offer. However, I'd have realized half-way through the project that his lower rate was making completing the work even more unpleasant and I'd be kicking myself for ever agreeing to less than what I thought the project was worth. In all likelihood, the scope of the project would have grown well beyond what I, myself, initially quoted. And again, I'd be left with an unpleasant conversation about scope and pricing and I'd be kicking myself then too. Bad clients cause nothing but stress. I don't like stress.</p>

<p>It is always unpleasant to deal with stuff like this. But it is an excellent harbinger to the type of client they are. I would <em>much rather</em> have an afternoon of unpleasant emails than to put in hours of work and <em>then</em> find out how difficult the client can be. The more you deal with clients the quicker you can spot the signs of a bad one. Those clients that see you as grunt labor, or just some person pushing a mouse around, will <strong>never</strong> respect you or your work. It's best to simply not deal with them if it can be avoided.</p>

<p>Side note, after a couple weeks I learned this particular client was working with a few vendors I also work with. Every single one of those vendors expressed to me how much they disliked working with this client and how they regretted ever agreeing to the work they were doing. </p>

"Looking for the best PDF editor or plugin for InDesign","13576","","<p><strong>Does anyone know about a good</strong>(free would be great) <strong>PDF editor?</strong> </p>

<p>I am trying to edit/translate an ""Instructions Manual"" PDF for a certain product. I need to edit the text in the PDF in order to translate it to another language.</p>

<p>The only workaround I found is to open the PDF in Illustrator(page by page). But I'm sure there is another way.</p>

<p>I am looking to purchase some software to do this if I cannot find a great free product.</p>

<p>I found a plugin for InDesign that allows me to import PDFs, </p>

<ul>
<li>do you know about it?</li>
<li>Have you tried it ?</li>
<li>Is it working for InDesign CS5?</li>
<li>Does it Import all the pages in the PDF ?</li>
<li>Is it free?</li>
<li>can you provide a link to it please.</li>
</ul>

<p>If not...</p>

<ul>
<li>Would Adobe Acrobat Pro do the job ?</li>
<li>What is the best PDF editor you know of ?</li>
</ul>
","<p>If you need to make anything more than a very minor change to a PDF, you need to go to the layouts that was used to create the PDF in the first place. PDFs don't work with objects in the layouts that page layout applications do.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if you need to edit a PDF, then Acrobat Professional is absolutely the way to go. It is designed specifically to edit PDFs. But, again, I cannot stress enough that doing so will take you only so far. You really need to get the layouts, edit there, and output a new PDF.</p>

"What is the difference between Glyph and Font?","13475","","<p>I was going through one document and I came across this term 'glyph'. The term was new to me so looked into wiki for its definition. I felt both glyph and font is same. Am I correct? Else please tell me what is the difference between this two.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I am newbie in this field. So feeling bit difficulty to picturise your answers. If you can add examples in your answers that will be very much helpful.  </p>
","<p>It can be confusing because often times you find out that people use the term ""font"" openly to refer to many things in typography. Here's a lively discussion on <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/12717/what-is-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface?rq=1"">fonts</a> and typefaces.  </p>

<p>Traditionally, <em>font</em> is a term used when discussing a set of characters of a certain typeface and in the same family. A font has also been used to describe a software used to produce a typeface in your design, which explains why we have our fonts licensed. </p>

<p>A <em>glyph</em> is the variety of designs of a certain character. If you have a collection of 3 different designs of the letter A, you have 3 glyphs. </p>

"How can I achieve the ""bent paper"" effect in photoshop?","13473","","<p>I've seen design elements on webpages that contain a ""bent paper"" effect. In other words, it looks like the paper is shaped in an arch, based on the visual perception of the shadow.</p>

<p>How do I achieve this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I found an image:</p>

","<p>Shadow gives the perception of how the paper is bent. 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dtHAB.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>In this screen shot, the two yellow rectangles are identical. To achieve the shadow effect, just duplicate the rectangle layer, fill it with black and blur 2-3px. then edit->transform->warp to bend the shadow shape. you want to move the shadow layers by a few pixels to the direction that's against the imagined light source. also play with the transparency too.</p>

"How can I easily create a shape with a specific pixel width and height in Photoshop?","13446","","<p>So this may sound like an easy question, but it is not.</p>

<p>In webdesign we often use rectangular or square shapes to represent backgrounds for sidebars etc. These need to be pixel perfect so that when it goes into HTML cut up the correct dimensions are preserved.</p>

<p>When drawing a rectangular shape it will often snap/move one or two pixels when the mouse is let go. I can see in the inspector pane that the dimensions are correct when I let go of the mouse, but I then witness Photoshop redistribute the dimensions as it sees fit.</p>

<p>Is there a way I can just enter a pixel height and width as numbers for shapes like with the rectangular marquee tool? Alternatively is there some way to stop this movement occurring?</p>
