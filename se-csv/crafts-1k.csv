"What kind of glue works for stones and shells?","38475","","<p>I have a collection of many small stones and shells of different shapes and sizes picked up from various beaches, and it'd be nice to glue some of them together to make some sort of arty model. But these are unusual materials and I'm not sure what type of glue would work best on them.</p>

<p><strong>What sort of adhesive works best for sticking together stones and shells?</strong></p>

<p>(I'm implicitly assuming the same sort will work for both stones and shells, but if not, I'd be grateful for an answer covering both materials.)</p>
","<p>As both material are kind of mineral, I think the same glue should work on both. The surface must be clean, in other words free of grease and dust. Ethanol or isopropanol work usually well. It will glue better on rough surface, so if it fits in your work sand paper the surface before cleaning and applying glue. For the shell, depending on the type, maybe some vinegar can make it rough (acidity will attack the calcium of the shell).</p>

<p>I am gluing small stones on substrate with cyanoacrylate (Superglue). It is a thin glue, so it won't fill the ""holes"" between the stones but will be almost invisible and should also stick if the contact surface is small. Time for the glue to set is extremely quick.</p>

<p>If you want to glue and fill the hole at the same time, 2 components epoxy such as Araldit should work and some are transparent. Those glues are usually quite ""thick"" but you can make them thinner by heating them (with a hair dryer for example) but they will also set faster with the heat.</p>

<p>I also had success gluing gravel on substrate using PVC glue (wood glue, or ""colle blanche"" in French), but I don't think it will do if the contact surface is small.</p>

"How do you bond clear acrylic to wood?","15796","","<p>I am trying to glue a piece of clear acrylic 2mm thick to a piece of plywood that is 5mm thick. They are both 76mm by 50mm and rectangular in shape. They have some cutouts in the middle. It's supposed to be a keychain. </p>

<p>Both are laser cut pieces, if that is important. They are cut exactly the same but I am sandwiching them together for aesthetics. </p>

<p>What adhesives can I use that will cure optically clear, i.e. does not discolor or remain noticeable in the acrylic-wood sandwich? Cheap and quick curing options would be great but I understand you can't have the best of them all.</p>
","<p>Consider a clear-drying epoxy. Note that not all epoxies are equal. In a general sense they can bond different materials together with ease.</p>

<p>Here is an earlier epoxy advertisement where <a href=""http://go-araldite.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">they glued a car to a billboard with an epoxy resin.</a> </p>

</blockquote>

<p>You can usually get 2 part epoxies in a dual syringe form and they are very economical. Depending how often you do this you might want to try a smaller one first as the shelf life of the product varies once used. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cheap and quick curing options would be great but I understand you can't have the best of them all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only part about this that does not meet your requirements is that they have a longer curing time then something like a craft glue. Setting inside an hour but fully curing over several days is needed in some cases. </p>

<p>The resin and hardener are kept separately as liquids, hence the dual syringe. In larger applications they would be two separate containers. I would suggest not applying directly to your project from the syringe but onto a disposable piece of cardboard or similar. That way you can manually mix the liquids together (usually 1:1 ratio) to ensure an effective reaction. Then use an applicator (craft sticks) to apply to the project.</p>

<p>You are going to want to clamp this down with decent pressure. There would be the issue of seepage while setting you need to be aware of. Depending on how intricate your cuts are the solution will come out of the wood acrylic sandwich. You want to try and wipe that off <em>before</em>  it sets. Epoxy resins dry really hard so if you have to cut part of it off it will no longer show clear on the cut. You can polish the edges once it cures with extra fine sand paper and / or a polishing compound.</p>

<hr>

<p>A long term issue is that set epoxies can yellow over time because of UV radiation. That is likely a moot point as you are making a key chain. </p>

"How do I cut the bottom off a glass wine bottle?","13275","","<p>Recently at a party, I saw empty wine bottles that had the base cut off so it could be placed over a candle. It made an elegant and interesting centerpiece, and I have some very pretty wine bottles that I'd love to convert to candle covers.</p>

<p>How do I cleanly and safely cut the base off a glass bottle? I'd like a reliable method so I don't risk destroying the bottles (I don't have many of them).</p>
","<p>There are certainly several methods to be found online however most of them can have mixed results where you edges are concerned. This can be done rather well with a scoring jig, regular glass cutter and water. Depending on how often you are going to be doing this will influence the tools and jig. </p>

<hr>

<h1>Scoring</h1>

<p>Cutting glass, so that it breaks predictably, can be done well with a glass cutter, or similar tool, and the right pressure. </p>

<p><strong>The jig</strong></p>

<p>You need to be able to move the bottle around and apply consistent pressure with the cutting tool. Again, you will find oodles of options for these jigs but a simple one involves some wood and casters. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KIH7km.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KIH7km.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The frame needs a base with a tool rest and a back where the bottle bottom will rest. At least four casters will help the bottle rotate while you score the outside (I also saw two mounted rolling pins for this). The jig picture above has a dedicated adjustable cutter. This is helpful but not required. Using the side of the jig as a tool rest you can rotate the bottle with one hand while using the other to set the cutting pressure. </p>

<p><strong>Commercial products</strong></p>

<p>There are several commercial products that can do this as well if you are more comfortable. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ji8qjm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ji8qjm.jpg"" alt=""Small apparatus that you can buy""></a></p>

<p>In use it would look like this. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0awGPm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0awGPm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I have glass cutting experience but have never used a product like that. Videos of them used look very promising though if you are willing to spend the money.</p>

<h1>Break</h1>

<p>Assuming you have a good score line then it is just a matter of encouraging the glass to break. This is surprisingly easy with some boiling water and cold tap water. You basically need to rapidly change the temperature of the glass near the score. You don't need extreme temperature for this though. </p>

<p>This likely has to be repeated a couple of times. Pour over boiling water slowly and rotate the bottle while pouring. After about 10 seconds of this you can take the bottle to the cold water from the tap. </p>

<p>The change in temperature should put enough stress on the bottle and it should fall apart. If you score line was good there is minimal clean up required and some light sanding would give you a smooth surface. </p>

<p>This also give you both ends of the bottle in a usable state. </p>

"Do certain markers work better on felt?","12147","","<p>I'm about to start on a project made of felt. I'm making caterpillar segments out of felt, and I need to mark alphabet letters on the back. </p>

<p>This project is for kids. They'll make their caterpillar by putting the alphabet in order or spelling words. </p>

<p>What type of marker will best show so that it will not fade and be clear enough for the kids? (For instance, fine tip won't work). I'm using light colored felt patterns. </p>

<p>I'm thinking fabric markers may be okay, but the color assortment is expensive. On the other hand, there are permanent markers (cheap and on hand) and paint markers. I'd test it out myself, but I'm on a budget. </p>
","<p>I tried an experiment on a square of random tan felt I had sitting around. I chose the letter <code>B</code> because it has a good mix of straight and curved lines, so I could also get an idea of how easy a particular marker was to use.</p>

<p>Clockwise, from top left:</p>

<ul>
<li>Permament Marker (Sharpie)</li>
<li>Washable Marker (Faber Castell)</li>
<li>Fabric Marker (Marvy)</li>
<li>Fabric Paint (Tulip)</li>

<hr>

<p><strong>Permanence:</strong> The washable marker easily transferred color from fabric to finger. To my surprise, even the permanent marker could be smeared if rubbed with a thumb. The fabric paint and fabric marker didn't transfer color to my fingers, though.</p>

<p>One additional note: Because of the nature of felt, the surface threads can be rubbed around in such a way that the letter looks smeared -- even the fabric marker version. The fabric paint, however, also ""glued"" the threads in place and so the letter couldn't be distorted.</p>

<p><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> This was sort of a tie. The fabric paint was the easiest, because I only needed one pass for each line I made. <em>However</em>, the felt really wicks up paint, and so it took a couple attempts to figure out how much to apply (a thin paint line expands and becomes thicker as it dries). See the purple blob to the left of the letter? That was attempt #1 :)</p>

<p><strong>Bleedthrough:</strong> Fabric paint and permanent marker showed through the most; all could be seen to some extent, though.</p>

"How can paper be glued to cardboard without creating wrinkles?","12046","","<p>In my projects, I often wish to affix a piece of paper to a more rigid material, like cardboard, and to do so using relatively large sheets of paper (say, around a square foot or two). However, I find that it is very difficult to get the paper to lay flat after placing glue on it.</p>

<p>Are there specific types of adhesives or techniques for applying glue that minimize the amount of wrinkling caused?</p>

<p>I understand that the wrinkles are caused by the paper expanding when it is exposed to moisture. Thus, I've tried to minimize the amount of glue I use, as well as tried letting the paper sit for a bit with the glue before placing in against the other surface to give an opportunity to expand beforehand, but still haven't gotten a good result. I've tried using wallpaper paste, PVA glue, and wood glue for this purpose, but the results seem very similar with each.</p>

<p>What I do now to try and stop the wrinkles is hang the paper from a line or string and use an acrylic spray to stiffen the paper. One light coat on both sides. </p>

"How to cut a tiny circle in paper?","9609","","<p>When papercutting, one often has to cut very small circles, like below. When I do that, I often break my blade. How should I cut small circles or other small holes? Think about ...</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I apply pressure or not?</li>
<li>Should I only turn the knife on its place or really move it?</li>
<li>Should I hold the knife vertically or diagonally on the paper?</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VkYIP.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<h1>Punch it</h1>

<p>Given the size of the holes you are doing this might not seem like useful advice but I would bet that this is what the artist in the picture did, as those are not perfect circles. Outside of this you could use a small punch to get a perfect circle.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ACxj.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ACxj.jpg"" alt=""small punches""></a></p>

<p>The way you get that to work is put a lot of paper (or some other thick material) underneath so that the ""work"" paper will be less likely to tear out.</p>

<hr>

<h1>For larger holes or if punches are not available</h1>

<p>Whatever you need to do that feels comfortable so that you can do <strong>one continuous cut</strong>. As with all cutting make sure you are using tools that are sharp!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I only turn the knife on its place or really move it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keeping the work stationary for me is a problem especially for circles, as you are moving your wrist and arm around more, which could put strain (cramping from repetition) on you faster (which in turn is asking for small mistakes). This can also reduce your control of the cut. I am in favour of moving both the work and your hand at the same time. I find this makes the motions easier and they take less time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I hold the knife vertically or diagonally on the paper?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the cut would naturally be at a slight angle with what I am describing, I would try to avoid doing so and try to cut as vertically as possible. Cutting on a diagonal can weaken the edges of the cuts making more susceptible to damage.</p>

<p>It is definitely important to try and do the cut in one pass. Hesitation or multiple cuts can create nibs or stray fibers. This is fixable of course but you have to remove more material which can affect the shape. However if done right corrections like that can be hidden as most people won't notice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I apply pressure or not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure of the best answer to this other than not too much. You want the knife to do the work. As long as your tool is sharp you should not have to put too much force into it.</p>

"How do I get a blur effect in pencil drawings?","8087","","<p>When drawing pictures with a pencil, I often want to create a more or less solid darker colour in some region. It's easy to shade an area so that it appears a solid dark colour from a distance, e.g. by hatching or cross-hatching, but I'd like to be able to blur the lines in a hatched or cross-hatched area so that the darkness is uniform even when looking at the picture close up.</p>

<p>In the past I achieved this using a special eraser I had. As an eraser it was very bad, since instead of rubbing out pencil marks it blurred them and made them spread darkly across a bigger region. This, however, made it perfect for creating uniformly dark areas in pencil drawings.</p>

<p>Now that I don't have that eraser any more (or at least, I don't know where it is to lay my hands on it), I'd like to know a better method.</p>

<p><strong>After shading an area with pencil strokes, how can I blur these strokes together to get a uniformly dark region?</strong></p>
","<p>The blurring you're talking about sounds like <em>blending</em>, which is the technique of evening out or gradating values and colors.</p>

<h2>Fingers</h2>

<p>Probably the simplest way of blending your regions together, whether matching values or values you want to merge together, is by rubbing it with your finger tip! You'll want to make sure your fingertip is clean, and oil-free, so that you don't smudge it with something else. Then, you simply rub. The direction you rub can have an effect. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you have two parallel lines and rub following their direction, you won't get much blending between them. Instead, you'll end up just blurring the lines, instead of having sharp edges. This technique is often used to blur the curved lines when shading spheres, on of the most common shading practice exercises for beginners.</p></li>
<li><p>Blending at angles away from the lines will great a smudge of sorts that causes a gradation from the lines value to a light grey. The closer the lines, the less likely you'll run into greys. You can see this by just drawing a dark area on a blank page and smearing away, to see how your pencil and pencil pressure have affected it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You need to avoid back-and-forth strokes if you want a gradation. Always start your stroke from the darkest value and move outward.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also blend in circles or back and forth, which may be the most helpful for trying to get a single area to be one value that's smoothed out, so the strokes don't show.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>Now, there's also tools made specifically for this, called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortillon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tortillons</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(drawing)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blending stumps</a>. </p>

<p>They're made of tightly-wound paper. Tortillons being less tight than stumps, likely hollow, and you can clearly see the layers of paper, like the tip of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_pencil"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">grease pencil</a>. Blending stumps are so tightly wound that the seem more like a solid chunk of the paper with a point sanded off.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ML2V0m.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ML2V0m.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iDpUkm.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iDpUkm.png"" alt=""Tortillon and stump""></a><br>
<sub>Left: Pic courtesy <a href=""http://rapidfireart.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rapidfireart.com</a>.<br>
Right: The top is the back end of the tortillon, where you you can see how it's layered and hollow. The back end of the stump is more stump!</sub></p>

<p>These give you much more precision over the blending. They come in many sizes, which makes them more adaptable than the five sizes of your fingers. </p>

<p>A plus to these is that as they blend, they tend to pick up more of the graphite dust in their fibers, evenly spreading it around the area and getting dust off so you don't need to use a brush or air. Your finger will end up absorbing the graphite or charcoal, but will layer it and compress it from the pressure. These can lead to you smudging dark areas of light ones accidentally if you forget to clean up.</p>

<p>The downside is that the tortillons don't really clean up, so if they get too much graphite built up, you'll only want to use them for matching values. To counter this, most tortillons you can purchase have the ability to peel away the outside layer. Failing that, you can use a sandpaper pad, similar to what you can use to sharpen a pencil, to rub off the rough edge.</p>

<p>In my experience, tortillons, both bought and homemade, tend to give a softer blend than stumps. I've made my own tortillons by wrapping up old drawing paper (possibly with a bad sketch on the inside) and taping the end seam. These homemade tortillons have given me the softest blends, as the dull point often frays.</p>

<p>Here's a comparison of the four tools I mentioned, using an HB pencil:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gzqy6.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gzqy6.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<ul>
<li>The first column is blending a solid area, mostly back and forth (not against the strokes, which would blend more evenly).

<ul>
<li>The stump and homemade tool hide the strokes the best, in this case.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The second column is a few tight lines, stroking along them. 

<ul>
<li>Notice the finger smudged well outside it (oops!), and the others were more precise. However, the homemade one had much ""fuzzier"" edges, which can be nice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The last column is gradating out from dark.

<ul>
<li>As you go down the column, you'll see each tool, in this case, was better and blending from the dark line, so there's not so much of a hard edge between the dark and light. </li>
<li>The other thing to notice is that the strokes are almost invisible on the finger patch, and much less visible on the homemade stick.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I didn't blend any two values together for this demo. You will probably not just lay down a single dark line and blend outward, like my last column. Instead, you'd create a gradation yourself by using pencil pressure and different hardness pencils, then blend those values together with your tool.</p>

"What's the difference between drawing paper and regular paper?","7535","","<p>Supply stores sell drawing paper, sketching paper, and all sorts of bound pads and books of the same.</p>

<p>What makes this paper different than regular notebook or printer paper? How is it better suited for drawing? </p>

<p>What makes the charcoal paper different than drawing paper, when both are used for drawing?</p>
","<h3>TL;DR:  Generally speaking, printer paper is not designed to last long, and is intended to hold ink rather than graphite, charcoal, paint, etc.  The same is more or less true of notebook paper.  Printer and notebook paper have very little <strong>tooth</strong> (roughness); lack <strong>weight</strong> (i.e., the sheets are thin); and have relatively high acid content, which means they will yellow and become brittle over time.</h3>

<hr>

<h1>Different Kinds of Drawing Paper:</h1>

<h2>The main differences:  Tooth and Weight</h2>

<h3>Weight:</h3>

<p>""Weight"" is basically (as the term implies) a measure of how thick and heavy each sheet of paper is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thicker or heavier papers can handle more water or paint without buckling, curling or falling apart. Traditionally, papers are measured by the weight in pounds of one ream, approximately 500 sheets. If a paper comes in different sizes, its weight will vary even though the thickness has not changed. Each paper type uses a certain size as its ""standard."" A ream of standard 22"" x 30"" watercolor paper (500 sheets) would weigh 300 lbs. The very same thickness paper in a 40"" x 60"" sheet would have a weight of 1,114 lbs. for the ream of paper. Its weight changed due to the size of the sheets, not the paper's thickness, but the paper is still designated as 300-lb. </p>
  
  <p>The inconsistency of this traditional method has led to the use of metric measurements or grams per square meter or gsm. When paper is measured in gsm, its weight will not change with the size of the sheet. The same 22"" x 30"" sheet of watercolor paper described above would weigh 640gsm, meaning that a square meter of this paper would weigh 640 grams. Larger size sheets of that same paper, like a 40"" x 60"" size sheet, also would weigh 640gsm. While different sizes, the square meter remains constant, as does the thickness of the paper.<br>
  -  <a href=""http://www.dickblick.com/productinfo/learn/paper/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dick Blick</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Weights (relating to thickness) of paper are standardized and defined by the International Organization for Standardization and are often listed in grams per square meter (gsm), or in pounds, the standard of measurement more familiar to most artists in the U.S.  Following are some of the most common weights of paper found in sketchbooks and drawing pads (all measurements are approximate):</p>
  
  <p>25 lb (approx 40 gsm):  tracing paper<br>
  30-35 lb (approx 45-50 gsm):  newsprint<br>
  50-60 lb (approx 75-90 gsm):  sketching or practice paper — thick enough to work on with pencils, charcoal, or pastels, but usually too thin for ink or most markers, which may bleed through.<br>
  70-80 lb (approx 100-130 gsm): drawing paper suitable for finished artwork in most media.  Paper any lighter than 70lb will usually be thin enough to see through to drawings or materials underneath.<br>
  90-110 lb (approx 180-260 gsm):  heavy-weight drawing paper, bristol, multi-media papers.  Weight in this range is similar to card stock or light poster board.<br>
  Heavier papers, up to 140 lb (approx 300 gsm) or more, are most often used for painting rather than drawing.  When found in sketchbooks, they are usually rougher papers intended as watercolor journals or to remove for painting on individual sheets.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sketch paper</strong> is the thinnest, lightest paper, varying from 30 to 60 lbs. It isn't meant be used for finished drawings, as most will discolor and degrade quickly. However, it's economical, and perfect for short studies, thumbnails, compositional sketches, and working out ideas.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Watercolor or printmaking paper</strong> has to be the thickest, heaviest paper because it must withstand the moisture from the water media applied to it. It usually weighs between 90 and 140 lbs. (The smoother, hot press watercolor papers can be great for drawing, also!)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Graphite or charcoal</strong> drawing paper doesn't need the durability of watercolor or printmaking paper, but is heavier than sketch paper. It usually weighs between 70 and 100 lbs. The weight you choose should depend on how you work with your medium.<br>

<hr>

<h3>Tooth:</h3>

<p>""Tooth"" is a measure of how rough or smooth the paper's surface texture is.  The more tooth a paper has, the rougher it is, and the better it will take soft art media like charcoal and pastels.  The less tooth it has, the smoother it is, and the better it will be for fine detail work, harder graphite, pen and ink, etc.  Wet media (ink, watercolors, etc) will be more likely to bleed on a toothier paper;  dry media (charcoal, pastels, etc) will be more likely to slough off of a paper with less tooth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Surfaces are described as having more or less “tooth,” or roughness in texture. The more toothy the paper, the rougher its surface. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Rougher surfaces</strong> are generally found more in thicker papers. <em>Thick, toothy surfaces hold on to more of the drawing or painting medium and are better for high contrast and lower detail works. Toothier papers are well suited to charcoal, crayon and pastels, ink washes and watercolor</em>, or any work that utilizes the texture of the paper for aesthetic effect. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Smoother surfaces</strong> take up less media and are better suited to more detailed work. Very lightweight papers like tissue paper, and lightweight sketch paper are usually smooth, but thicker papers like bristol and some painting paper are also smooth. <em>Smoother surfaces are ideal for graphite pencil, colored pencil, and ink pens</em>. Smoother papers are also more likely to be bleedproof, meaning that ink or color washes won’t spread and “feather” across the surface.<br>
  -  <a href=""http://www.museartanddesign.com/sketchbooks-surfaces-and-weights/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Muse Art and Design</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Rough paper</strong> is chosen for its definite texture. It is the natural result when a sheet is allowed to air dry without smoothing or pressing. Rough surface paper is a good choice for transparent watercolors used in a bold and immediate style, as it allows the pigment of color washes to settle into the hollows of the paper. Pastel artists also generally prefer a paper with ""tooth"" or texture to grab onto the pastel pigment.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Cold Press paper</strong>, which is the most popular and versatile, has a slight texture. Handmade papers achieve this by re-pressing a new wet sheet, which smoothes the surface to some degree. Machine-made papers get a similar effect by placing the wet sheets between cold metal rollers. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Not/Cold Press</strong>: A ""Not"" sheet means it is ""not hot press,"" and the term is often used instead of cold press.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Hot Press paper</strong> is very smooth. It is made by running a freshly formed sheet through heated metal rollers or plates. Much like a clothes iron, this smoothes out any texture left by the earlier stages and creates a flat, hard, featureless surface. A good choice for highly detailed illustrations, it is also used for printmaking, etching, drafting, sketching and drawing.<br>

<h2>Secondary coniderations:  Fiber and Sizing</h2>

<h3>Fiber (and acidity):</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paper is made from a variety of plant sources. Whether the fibers come from cotton or other plants such as linen, flax, jute, hemp, bamboo, rice straw or rattan, they all provide cellulose fibers or plant cells of varying dimensions. A sheet of paper is basically a thin layer of mingled cellulose fibers. Most commonly, three types of fibers are used to produce papers for drawing and painting: cotton, cellulose and a combination of fibers. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Cotton papers</strong>, made from the longest cotton fibers, are <em>generally considered the highest quality</em>. They are referred to as being 100% cotton rag and <em>can handle heavy erasing and working without tearing or showing wear</em>. High-quality 100% cotton paper can last more than 100 years. However, not all cotton papers are the same. Those made from the lesser-quality, shorter cotton fibers can get fuzzy with reworking. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Cellulose papers</strong> are usually made of wood pulp and <em>naturally have an acid content that will destroy the paper over time. The more acidic a paper is, the shorter its life expectancy</em>. Buffers can be added to make the paper neutral.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many papers are acid free. This designation means that the paper has a neutral pH (around 7). Acid-free papers should be selected for work intended to last for long periods of time because papers with higher acid content will deteriorate much faster. For most cellulose-based papers, acid-free also means that lignin and sulfur have been removed from the paper. These are the ingredients in wood-based papers that fade ink and turn paper yellow over time.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Cotton and cotton-rag paper</strong> do not contain cellulose and are naturally acid-free. Cotton-based papers are also stronger, often thicker, hold up better to a lot of erasing, and perform well for wet media such as watercolor or ink washes. Cotton is often blended with cellulose to add strength and durability to paper. Premium archival papers will often list a ratio of cotton and wood fiber.<br>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>pH neutral</strong> means that the paper had a neutral pH (7) at the time that it was made, but may still contain ingredients that can become acidic over time (for example, the size used to seal the paper).</p>
  
  <p><strong>Acid free</strong> means that nothing acidic (and nothing that can become acidic) was introduced to the paper at any point in the paper-making process. </p>
  
  <p>Some manufacturers (such as Strathmore) take further precautions and make paper at a slightly basic pH of 7.2 to 7.5.  This provides an alkaline buffer to help counter anything acidic that it may come into contact with.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>And:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rate and severity of deterioration result from internal and external factors: most importantly, the composition of the paper and the conditions under which the paper is stored.</p>
  
  <p>Paper is made of cellulose -- a repeating chain of glucose molecules -- derived from plant cell walls. One measure of paper quality is how long the cellulose chains, and subsequently the paper fibers, are: long-fibered paper is stronger and more flexible and durable than short-fibered paper.</p>
  
  <p>In the presence of moisture, acids from the environment (e.g., air pollution, poor-quality enclosures), or from within the paper (e.g., from the raw materials, manufacturing process, deterioration products), repeatedly cut the glucose chains into shorter lengths. This acid hydrolysis reaction produces more acids, feeding further, continued degradation.</p>
  
  <p>Mechanical pulping produces paper with the shortest fiber length and does not remove lignin from the wood, which promotes acid hydrolysis. Newspapers are printed on mechanically pulped paper. Chemical pulping removes lignin and does not cut up the cellulose chains as thoroughly as mechanical pulping, yielding a comparatively stronger paper, but which is still not as durable as rag paper.</p>
  
  <p>Wood pulp paper from before the 1980's also tends to be acidic from alum-rosin sizing (added to the paper to reduce absorbency and minimize bleeding of inks), which, in the presence of moisture, generates sulfuric acid.</p>
  
  <p>Acids also form in paper by the absorption of pollutants -- mainly sulfur and nitrogen oxides. Book leaves that are more brown and brittle along the edges than in the center clearly illustrate this absorption of pollutants from the air.</p>
  
  <p>Research by the Library of Congress has demonstrated that cellulose itself generates acids as it ages, including formic, acetic, lactic, and oxalic acids. Measurable quantities of these acids were observed to form under ambient conditions within weeks of the paper's manufacture. Moreover, paper does not readily release these acids due to strong inter-molecular bonding. This explains why pH neutral papers become increasingly acidic as they age.<br>

<h3>Sizing/Absorbency:</h3>

<p>""Sizing"" is an additive that makes the paper more resistant to moisture.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Papers intended for wet media (paints or inks) are made with sizing, a starch or gelatin that is either included in the paper pulp during the paper-making process, or is applied to the surface of the paper.  Sizing prevents liquid from absorbing too quickly into the paper, allowing some working time to lift, lighten, or move paints or inks by applying more water.  Sizing also helps protect the paper from getting too soggy, which can result in tearing and wrinkling.  Sizing can also help prevent finer ink or paint lines from spreading and feathering.  Sketchbooks intended for wet media should indicate on the cover that the paper is sized.<br>
  -  <a href=""http://www.museartanddesign.com/sketchbooks-surfaces-and-weights/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Muse Art and Design</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sizing is added to make paper more water-resistant. It keeps the paper from absorbing too much moisture or pigment and helps to keep watercolors or inks brilliant. It also keeps lines and edges looking crisp. It is less important for papers used for dry media. Sizing also can factor into a paper's archival qualities - whether it will sustain or deteriorate over time. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Internal sizing</strong> is added while the paper pulp is still in a liquid state and is maintained in the matter of the paper. </p>
  
  <p><strong>External, Surface or Tub sizing</strong> is applied to the surface of the paper after the sheet is formed and dried. Some paper is both internally and surface-sized.<br>

<h2>Other considerations:</h2>

<h3>Binding:</h3>

<p>Sometimes a matter of mere personal preference, sometimes a matter of necessity, ""binding"" refers to how - and whether - the sheets of paper are connected to one another:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hard-bound</strong> sketchbooks have a hard cover and a sewn joint, just like a hard-bound book. These sketchbooks generally contain medium weight paper, about 70 lb. Hard-bound sketchbooks are the toughest and sometimes the expensive. They take more wear and tear, and generally survive longer than spiral or tape-bound books. Depending on the quality and method of binding, hard-bound sketchbooks often do not lay flat when opened all the way, so they can be difficult to use for larger drawings or for writing. Hard-bound sketchbooks are also less likely to have perforated pages, so they’re better thought of as real archival sketchbooks.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Spiral-bound</strong> sketchbooks sometimes have hard covers but their covers often consist of a hard back cover and a thick paper front. Because of this construction, spiral-bound books are a little less hardy than hard-bound sketchbooks. Spiral-bound sketchbooks open flat when put on a surface, so they can be good for ink and paint washes. Spiral-bound sketchbooks often have perforated pages, so pages are easy to remove and have a clean edge for presentation, duplication, mounting, or framing</p>
  
  <p><strong>Tape-bound</strong> sketchbooks generally have fewer pages than hard-bound and spiral-bound sketchbooks and do not have substantial covers. Tape-bound sketchbooks are not rugged, long lasting sketchbooks. Sketchbooks bound in this manner come in a wide variety of surface types and weights, ranging from very thin tissue and tracing paper to heavy bristol and vellum papers. Sometimes, tape-bound sketchbook pages are perforated, but often the pages are held in by a line of adhesive so it is not difficult to pull them out.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Single sheets</strong> are a great way to experiment with a limited quantity of paper. They will often require stretching and taping to remain flat if wet media is being used. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Blocks</strong> are a stack of paper glued or bound together on all four sides and mounted on a backing board. A block keeps the paper stretched as you paint. Once the painting is dry, the sheet is removed by inserting a knife between the sheets and gently breaking the binding. Blocks are a good choice for working wet, outdoors or while traveling. The disadvantage is that you can only use one sheet at a time.<br>

<h1>Printer Paper:</h1>

<p>Compared to drawing paper, printer paper is cheaper, lower weight, more acidic, has less tooth, can't handle wet media, doesn't take much dry media, can't handle wet media, and is generally crappy in every important respect.  It works for doodling, but if you want to make something really beautiful and long-lived, you need quality paper.</p>

"How can I avoid smudging my pencil drawings?","7161","","<p>I'm very new at drawing. I'm not very good at pencil types yet, but it seems like whichever pencil I use (I have a set of 12 ranging from 6B to 5H), I end up with smudges. </p>

<p>Is there a way to reduce the number of smudges I make? Or should I resign myself to them and just try to not make really awful ones?</p>
","<p>One of the most common techniques to avoid this problem is using an extra sheet of paper. </p>

<p>Place the paper so it's under your drawing hand and on top of the part of your drawing you're not working on. Be careful not to move it around too much, using masking tape to stick it to your desk if necessary. If you use tracing paper, you'll still be able to see where you're headed through the sheet, instead of blocking off your view of the piece as a whole. </p>

<p>You can also start to build up your hand control. The smudging happens, generally, because your drawing hand is resting completely on the paper. On a horizontal desk, this in natural, but leads to smudging. Instead of resting your hand on its whole side, try using one of your pinky knuckles as a the only place your hand touches the page. This will minimize contact with the paper and reduce the chance of smearing. </p>

<p>If you're on an inclined desk or easel, you can change to an alternative drawing grip. The underhand grip, for instance, should keep your hand completely off the page. </p>

<p>Other than that, I'd suggest just being careful about watching your hands. Making sure your drawing hand isn't making contact with the paper where you've already drawn while you're drawing, and that your free hand isn't gripping the page on the penciled parts. Change your paper or hand angle as necessary to do this. </p>

<p>A note, pencils in the B range are softer and will smudge more and more obviously, so be extra careful with them. 4H and higher shouldn't smear very much at all, but they give you much lighter values. </p>

<hr>

<p>If you meant the smudge after you finish them, I would recommend you purchase some fixative spray. It can be used for graphite, charcoal and pastel. Essentially, it adds a protective layer over the piece. There's also fixatives to use while working on them. I have no idea about these, but <a href=""https://crafts.stackexchange.com/a/380/24"">John Cavan does</a>.</p>

<p>Aerosol hair spray does the same in a pinch, but will damage your work over the long term. However, if you're just going to scan it or take a picture of it, you may not care. The only time I've done it has been for keeping things from smudging long enough to get a digital copy for. </p>

"Will putting an oil painting under glass cause damage?","6652","","<p>I inherited a painting from a relative. It has some cracks so I assume it's oil, not acrylic or watercolor. I also do not know the age, but it is not new.</p>

<p>When I bought a frame to fit it (since it didn't have one), the frame came with a pane of glass.</p>

<p>Will I damage the painting if I place it in the frame behind the glass? (Because I already did. <em>It's been there for a couple of years</em>.) If so, what can I do to mitigate the damage? </p>

<p>There is no visible damage to the painting, I'm just concerned.</p>
","<p>As long as the Painting isn’t recently painted, within 6-12 months, then there isn’t a general consensus and the answer is: It depends.</p>

<p>The reason for the delay after the painting is finished is that it can take this long for the painting to fully 'dry'. In your case, this isn't a consideration.</p>

<p>One of the biggest threats to your oil painting is the environment: dust, air pollution, UV rays, smoke, pet hair, kids with crayons, red wine splashes. The list is endless. Canvas is porous and if left open to room air, it actually acts like a filter for that air, absorbing chemical and particulate pollution.</p>

<p>Advice from the <a href=""http://www.conservationregister.com/PIcon-careoilpainting.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">British Conservation Register</a> on cleaning without glass:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dust can be removed using a very soft brush with metal elements protected so that they cannot be a cause of damage. Avoid feather dusters, sheep skin dusters, however soft, as they catch. You must be careful to check that there is no paint flaking before dusting. Do not attempt any dusting if the surface appears unstable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Below is an example of flaking:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HNvws.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HNvws.jpg"" alt=""Example of flaking""></a></p>

<p>Further examples of flaking can be found on the <a href=""http://www.paintingconservationstudio.co.uk/images/flaking-paint.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Painting Conservation Studio</a> website, from where the above image came.</p>

<p>It is much easier to clean the glass or acrylic than to pay for an expert conservator to restore your painting.</p>

<p>If you choose to keep the glass, make sure that the glass is spaced so it does not touch the artwork. A professional picture framer can advise you in this regard, as well as recommend a quality UV protecting glass that will preserve the clarity of the painting.</p>

<p>Further advice from the British Conservation Register on cleaning the glass:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Always spray glass cleaner onto the cloth, not the glass. Spray well away from your painting. The use of backboards is recommended as a preventive conservation measure to protect against the accumulation of dust and dirt, as well as against knocks and accidental damage. A conservator can fit backboards to your paintings for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When deciding what to do, ask yourself these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does this canvas artwork hold great sentimental value to me?</li>
<li>Am I keeping the artwork to enjoy for a long time?</li>
<li>Will I eventually want to resell the artwork?</li>
</ul>

<p>If the answer is yes to any of these questions, and the work is older than 1 year, then keeping glass will probably be a good long term choice.</p>

"How can I cut popsicle craft sticks without splitting them?","6014","","<p>We often use craft sticks in kids projects, but I have issues whenever I need to cut them. They'll often split down the grain, all the way through the stick, making it useless. This happens no matter which direction I'm cutting, but it's only useful if I'm trying to split them lengthwise.</p>

<p>Is there a way I can cut these sticks reliably, without tossing every other one out?</p>
","<p>Craft sticks and Popsicle sticks are not known for their quality when it comes to grain and warping. So when you are cutting them, the stress is released in the easiest way possible which is along the grain. This is especially true because of how thin they are. </p>

<p>One of the following methods should work. They are both related in that I am suggesting multiple cuts.  </p>

<h1>Scoring</h1>

<p>Instead of trying to do one cut you should try and score your sticks first. Scoring will help guide the break and prevent it from going through the rest of the stick. So, score it once then do the rest of the cut. </p>

<h1>Multiple shallow cuts</h1>

<p>Essentially scoring all the way though. The slower safer method is cut though the sticks in several successive cuts. Use a ruler to help cut straight so you can focus more on your depth of cut. Put more sticks under the ruler to help keep it flat. </p>

<hr>

<p>Either way you need a thin and sharp blade. You want to <em>cut</em> the fibres of the sticks and not <em>push</em> them apart. So something like standard scissors would be a bad choice. </p>

"Differences between HB pencils","5698","","<p>Pencils seem to have different types:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/btzCQ.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/btzCQ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>From what I've seen, there's a few types:</p>

<ul>
<li>HB</li>
<li>2HB</li>
<li>B</li>
</ul>

<p>and so on.</p>

<p>What's the difference between all the different pencils? When do I use one or the other?</p>
","<p>H and B relate to the hardness or softness of the pencil's graphite. ""H"" stands for ""hard"" and ""B"" stands for ""black"" with ""F"" right in the middle between HB and H... though, the source of the lettering seems to be debatable according to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil#Grading_and_classification"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> - H stands for ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koh-i-Noor_Hardtmuth"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hardtmuth</a>"" (the surname of the owner of an art supply company) and B stands for ""Budweis"", the town the pencil company was relocated to but ""hard"" and ""black"" are probably more useful to remember.</p>

<p>A ""number 2 pencil"" as we (in the US) are often told to use for filling out multiple choice answers on Scantron sheets, is right in the middle, the equivalent of ""HB""... though, according to <a href=""http://pencils.com/hb-graphite-grading-scale/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this site</a>, there's no ""industry standard"" so one company's HB may not be the same as another's. This is also explained in the Wikipedia article linked above, which notes that on some scales, the US equivalent of HB is a #2 pencil, while other manufacturers use the equivalent HB=2½.</p>

<p>As a general explanation of the differences between the grades, pencils.com shows the following image:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/c8J8T.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/c8J8T.jpg"" alt=""Lead hardness/softness""></a></p>

<p>As you can see in the image, the higher the H value, the lighter the result but the finer the point, while at the other end, the higher the B value, the darker the blackness of the graphite and wider the point.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.jetpens.com/blog/picking-the-perfect-pencil-hardness-grade/pt/475"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This site</a> has some great guidance on what the benefits of each are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>H leads are extremely smudge-resistant and give cleaner lines, making them useful for things such as outlines, technical drawings, light sketches, and even watercolors. Left-handed pencil users can also take advantage of smudge-resistant H leads. On the downside, hard leads tend to be scratchy, especially as you move up the scale. </p>
  
  <p>B leads are smooth to write and draw with. They smudge easily, but are readily erased. They're perfect for pencil drawings as artists can take advantage of the brush-like expressions, especially in the higher B grades. Animators in particular enjoy using 10B over animator paper because it writes like butter, creating nice, quick, heavy lines with no friction. </p>

"How do hard, soft, and medium charcoal pencils compare against their counterparts in graphite?","5515","","<p><strong><em>Example:</em></strong> For shading, I have <strong><em>soft</em></strong> charcoal pencil, and <strong><em>8B</em></strong> graphite pencil.  The charcoal pencil I have does not have a specific label except the word ""soft"" written on it.</p>

<p>Both of them are known for dark strokes. </p>

<p>What are the guidelines for deciding which one to prefer for shading a flower pot among the above?</p>

<p>Does types of paper also play a role in choosing between these two types? </p>
","<p>I have used both charcoal and graphite for art projects. I have personally never combined the two in a single project. </p>

<p><strong>Charcoal</strong></p>

<p>Charcoal is generally much darker, bolder and messier. It's easy to fade charcoal or wipe it off the paper entirely if you make mistakes. Charcoal, due to its brittle nature is also easy to smudge or gently wipe to assist in your shading efforts.</p>

<p>Charcoal artwork needs to be treated after you're finished with the work as the particles (essentially dust) will fall from the artwork over time and may either leave dark streaks on the artwork or just cause the art to fade as the particles fall over the art or off of it all together.</p>

<p><strong>Graphite</strong></p>

<p>Graphite is a slightly harder to shade with, and doesn't usually get as dark as charcoal. Some of the darker graphites, like an 8B, tend to look glossy and reflective when used over large areas. This is something charcoal does not do.</p>

<p>Graphite can be easily shaded with the help of tortilons, though, and varying pressure in combination with pencil grades can give you a very wide range of shades to work with. Graphite also lasts on the paper without particles falling off and can remain in-tact for years as long as its not being touched or rubbed.</p>

<p><strong>Paper</strong></p>

<p>The paper you use plays a big role on the art itself. Some papers, like newsprint are great for quick charcoal sketching and practice. Charcoal easily wipes from newsprint and it's cheap, while graphite is hardly visible. Higher quality papers are less forgiving of errors, but the finished product will look nicer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I sharpen my drawing pencils the ""proper"" way, with a knife.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is sharpening with a knife considered better than sharpening with a sharpener?</p>
","<p>Alright, full disclaimer. I wrote that original comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I sharpen my drawing pencils the ""proper"" way, with a knife.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was intending to be tongue-in-cheek, because you may find a lot of comments or tutorials online insisting that this is <em>the</em> right way to sharpen a pencil. </p>

<p>I don't think that it's the case, but I've now written a little tutorial about the ""proper"" way to sharpen a pencil, and also some pointers about sharpening pencils in general. </p>

<h2>Why use a knife?</h2>

<p>Using a knife to sharpen your pencil allows you to control the length and the shape of the exposed core. This, then, gives you more control over the types of strokes you'll be able to make. Longer points mean you can lay down wider lines.</p>

<p>A knife is very helpful for sharpening graphite, charcoal, and pastel pencils. These types of materials hold up to the process better, and wider lines are more likely to be sought from them. As <a href=""https://crafts.stackexchange.com/a/458/24"">John Cavan</a> pointed out, colored pencils don't really hold up to the process.</p>

<h2>What you'll need:</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sLbxHm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sLbxHm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<ul>
<li>A sandpaper pad or block </li>
<li>A pencil</li>
<li>A very sharp knife</li>
<li>A quick way to get rid of the shavings</li>
</ul>

<p>The knife needs to be very sharp, because you don't want to apply much pressure to the pencil at all. The more pressure you have to apply, the more likely you are to break the exposed core <em>or</em> cause internal stress fractures that don't show up until much later.</p>

<p>Since the knife is very sharp, please be careful. I prefer to use a utility knife, as shown, because the blades are sharp and easily replaceable when dull. I have used pocket knives before, but sharpening them is a whole other process. If you've never used a utility knife before, be aware that they generally come with spare blades inside them, so you don't have to buy extras right away.</p>

<p>If you've only just started sharpening pencils this way, <strong>please use cheap pencils</strong>. It's very common to break pencils until you get the hang of this. Practice the technique on something you're fine with throwing away. That said, be aware that some cheaper pencils use really cheap wood, which may be harder or more prone to splitting. You generally won't have that problem with actual art pencils.</p>

<p>I usually sharpen directly over a small trash can, but today I'm doing it over some scrap paper I can just pick up and shake out.</p>

<h2>1. Starting</h2>

<p><strong>Always hold the knife with the blade facing away from you. If you're concerned about the shavings flying into your eye, wear safety goggles.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/l291hm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/l291hm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Hold the knife at about a 90 degree angle to your pencil, with the blade laying nearly flat against the wood. With the hand holding the pencil, put your thumb against the back of the blade and apply a slight pressure. You will start sharpening by pushing against the knife with your thumb, but <strong>holding the knife completely still</strong>. The hand with the pencil will do all the work, adjusting the speed and pressure. </p>

<p>Do shallow but long strokes:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dpzrxm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dpzrxm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o5qhym.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o5qhym.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>You should end up with plenty of shavings, as you can see. </p>

<h2>2. Refining the tip</h2>

<p>As you start to expose the core, be careful not to nick it. At first you'll start with only a small bit exposed, but then slowly work your way to exposing the full length you want. Make sure you're not just taking wood off the very front, but going back further up the pencil.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bwIoLm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bwIoLm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jga5Im.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jga5Im.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As picture above, I started by exposing only a small amount, but then shaved portions away from the entire tip to have more lead exposed. If you only work towards the front, the cone of the wood will be too short and increase the likelihood of breakage.</p>

<p>Once I have what I feel is about the correct length, I test the angle of the wood against a flat surface.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7len7.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7len7.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>If I can't get the wood flush with the surface, that's no good. The purpose of this type of sharpening is to allow for strokes using the full flat of the lead. If the wood is curved inwards (as seen above) or too short, then trying to use the flat may cause breakage. If the slope doesn't flow well into your actual core, then trying to lay the flat of the pencil down may only yield strokes with part of the tip.</p>

<p>I wasn't happy with my slope, so I worked at it some more. At this point, I do small, quick shavings while rotating the pencil. I'll do this by using the knife to do the work, instead of pushing with my thumb, as it's much faster. However, I've practiced on a bunch of pencils and I'm confident I won't gouge my wood or break the lead.</p>

<p>I ended up with a much smoother slope. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/USIPY.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/USIPY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<h2>3. Perfecting the point</h2>

<p>As you may have noticed, my point is still blunt! You don't need to sharpen that with the knife, as that's where the sanding pad comes in.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uwCAvm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uwCAvm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Hold the pencil between your thumb and two fingers and roll it so that pencil rotates. You'll do this while rubbing the lead point along the sandpaper. Make steady, even strokes. Like before, <strong>only the pencil should move</strong>, and not the sandpaper. As you roll the pencil, the goal is to get a full 360 degree rotation, or close, in one full stroke.</p>

<p>The reason for this rotation is that it keeps the point centered in the core and keeps it conical. If you don't rotate enough, you may end up with more of a wedge or oblong shape. Those can be quite useful, if it's your goal, but generally you don't want those other shapes.</p>

<p>You can also sharpen the point by sanding with your strokes following the length of the pencil, instead of perpendicular to the pencil. (I think of it as ""up and down"" instead of ""side to side"").</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mbgqmm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mbgqmm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This lets you more easily match the point to the slope of the wood, if that's you're intent. You still need to rotate the pencil as you do this. I spent time making my slope nice, so I used a combination of strokes to get the point to match.</p>

<p>In the end, I made a nice, long point.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aSqZam.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aSqZam.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you practice, you may end up making short or longer points, depending on your preference (or skill). The longer the point, the wider the strokes you can make, but also the more likely you are to have breaks while sharpening, using or storing your pencils.</p>

<h2>4. Clean up</h2>

<p>Your sandpaper pad may look pretty grim after this. But if you bang it on your table or inside your bin, a fair amount of dust will come off. You can use one sheet for a considerable number of pencils, so don't throw it away too soon.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NDhVam.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NDhVam.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>

<sub>After</sub></p>

<p>Then, <strong>before actually using the pencil, you need to clean it off</strong>, too. I typically make a bunch of test strokes, and even rub just the wooden part on the paper. A lot of the dust from your core will laying on the surface, and if you don't wipe it off you may end up laying down some accidental, very dark lines.</p>

<p>You can use a cloth for this, but I usually just use scratch paper.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CUYKwm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CUYKwm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<h2>The proper way, in general</h2>

<p>The keys to a sharp pencil, without breakage, are generally the same whether you're using a knife or a hand sharpener:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have a sharp blade</li>
<li>Move the pencil, not the blade</li>
</ol>

<p>I have a handful of sharpeners just like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/73RVjm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/73RVjm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>They work great for me. I just keep it steady in my offhand, and turn the pencil with my other. The blades are replaceable, but I have so many sharpeners that I haven't had to do that, yet.</p>

<p>In fact, I only sharpen one set of by 9B - 9H range of pencils with a knife, and the rest get the hand sharpener treatment. </p>

<p>I avoid electric sharpeners for anything but writing pencils. They violate one of my guidelines, because the blade moves and not the pencil, so I already distrust them. Something about the process seems to increase the chance that the lead cracks internally, and I just end up sharpening them over and over.</p>

<p>They also get gummed up by colored pencils. Some companies make electric sharpeners just for colored pencils, but I haven't tried them so I can't comment.</p>

"How can I protect my pencil & charcoal drawings once complete?","4309","","<p>I have now built up a small portfolio of pencil/charcoal drawings. Most of the time they are kept in my folders, but sometimes they are viewed by friends and relatives. And on the odd occasion displayed at the local community hall.</p>

<p>I've started to notice finger marks and tiny smudges on the artwork. As none of pieces are permanently displayed I don't want to frame them.</p>

<p>What is the best way of preserving and protecting my pencil/charcoal art without having to put them behind glass?</p>

<p>One of my friends said that you could use hairspray? Is that the right way to go?</p>
","<p>If the pieces are likely to be handled and/or displayed then using fixative sprays is probably the best option. There are two purposely manufactured types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Workable</li>
<li>Final</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Workable Fixative</strong></p>

<p>As the name suggests, this allows you to add additional layers to your work after the spray has been used. </p>

<p>Workable Fixative is a thin solution and it sets up a new toothy (slightly rough) surface for more drawing. You can choose to spray the entire piece or isolated parts. To prevent other areas getting sprayed you can use paper, or frisket, to shield the areas that you don't want to spray. Once the fixative is dry you can continue working on the drawing.</p>

<p>The fact that it provides new tooth can be an advantage as heavily shaded/worked areas can become smooth making it harder to apply further layers of graphite/colour to the piece. So, you can use a workable fixative every few layers to keep a fresh tooth.</p>

<p><strong>Final Fixative</strong></p>

<p>This provides a more durable surface than a Workable Fixative, but this should only be applied once you are certain that you don't what to make any further adjustments.</p>

<p>However, a Final Fixative can cause the piece to darken so many artists do not apply the this layer and simply stop at a Workable Fixative.</p>

<p><strong>Hairspray</strong></p>

<p>Hair Spray has been mentioned as a cheaper alternative to fixative sprays. Below is a <em>summarisation from <a href=""http://www.dummies.com/how-to/music-creative-arts/Visual-Arts/Drawing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Drawing for Dummies</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hairspray does contain some of the materials of a Fixative but it only works for the short term, and ultimately damages the drawing - the hairspray yellows over time and ruins the drawing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Do not use hairspray.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Applying Fixative</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use proper ventilation. Fixatives smells and <em>is hazardous to your health</em>.</li>
<li>Shake the can before spraying and test on a scrap piece of paper away from your drawing. The nozzle can clog &amp; will deposit 'lumps' on your drawing</li>
<li>Directions on the generally say to spray 20-25cm (8-10 inches) from drawing. However, I spray 30-40cm (12-15 inches) from drawing. Make sure it is on a flat surface and not drafty.</li>
<li>Lightly spray first coat horizontally. Let dry for 15 minutes. Make sure the layer is even and smooth.</li>
<li>Lightly spray second coat vertically. Let dry for 15 minutes. Make sure the layer is even and smooth.</li>
<li>Subsequent layers may be added in alternating directions if needed.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The sprayed areas of your piece will become darker once you have sprayed it and it won't lighten once the fixative has dried.</em></p>

"How can I eliminate spray paint odor?","3746","","<p>A week or two ago, I repainted a mirror (about 2.5ftx3ft) with some less-than-stellar quality spray paint. The paint's smell is still hanging around, and I'd really like to get rid of it. What can I use to eliminate the paint odor without damaging the mirror?</p>

<p>I unfortunately can't leave it outside because I live in an apartment, and I'd prefer cheaper, natural options.</p>
","<p>The reason for the smell is because of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound"" rel=""noreferrer"">VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds)</a> content in paint.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best way to avoid breathing in paint fumes is to not have them to begin with. Most indoor and outdoor paints contain volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. These compounds are ingredients in the paint and are responsible for the odors emitted as the paint dries. Low-VOC paint is commonly available. It has less of an odor and is safer for both you and the environment. (<a href=""http://www.pridepainters.ca/article/3-natural-ways-to-get-rid-of-paint-fumes.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether there are low-VOC paints in spray cans I don't know.</p>

<p>There is a cheap and environmentally friendly way to remove the fumes provided by <a href=""http://greenopedia.com/absorb-paint-fumes/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Greenopedia</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Salt, lemon and vinegar all have the power to soak up paint smells pretty quickly. And because you’re absorbing the chemicals instead of <em>pushing them around</em> with a fan, they won’t linger in your air ducts or spread to other parts of the house.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another idea is using onions, as suggested in the link above.  Cut them in half and put the halves around the house or cut them into small pieces into bowls and add some vinegar.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Grab some bowls and fill them halfway with water.</p></li>
  <li><p>Add a few slices of lemon and/or a quarter cup of salt to each bowl<br>Or instead of lemon &amp; salt, fill a few bowls halfway with vinegar.</p></li>
  <li><p>Place the bowls around the room and let them sit overnight or until the paint smell is gone.</p></li>
  <li><p>Rinse the salt water or vinegar down the sink and discard lemons in the trash or compost.<br><strong>Do not eat or drink them</strong>.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason why you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> eat them is because they will become toxic.  They will contain paint solvents as the salt water, vinegar and lemons will have absorbed them.</p>

"How can I make a sketch under a watercolour painting and have it not be seen?","3509","","<p>I usually use a regular pencil to sketch what I would like to paint very faintly, but I find that no matter how light it is, it can still be seen under the painting. Once the paint is dry, I can't seem to erase the pencil marks. Usually I end up drawing outlines over my watercolour in black pen or markers to seem like it was supposed to be like that to cover the pencil. </p>

<p>Is there a better way to make the preliminary sketch under a water colour so I don't have to cover it later with black marker?
Are water colour pencils the better choice? And if I do use watercolour pencils, how do I make sure the colour evens out with the paint application (if the paint layer is thin and watery)?</p>
","<p>Watercolor is, by its very nature, a transparent medium and so it becomes really quite difficult to manage this. However, there are a couple of things you can do to help:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Draw very lightly and then use a kneaded eraser to lift the lines that you have left. The remaining lines will be much more faint than had you just drawn as light as you can.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw on normal drawing paper and then use a lightbox to show the drawing through to your watercolor paper. This way you don't even draw on your final painting.</p></li>
<li><p>Erase the area you're about to paint. So, do it first, rather than after the fact. If you keep it small enough, you should be able to remember. It's pretty similar to working with kneaded erasers, but you're not making the line fainter, you're removing it.</p></li>
<li><p>Go loose! Don't do an initial drawing at all, but use a reference and simply loosely paint it. That's one of the really neat things about this medium, it lends itself to a free style that's hard to do with other paints.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Watercolor pencils won't really work for your purpose in this situation. It's likely that the colors will be slightly different from your paints, so getting an exact match will extremely difficult, especially if you're blending your own colors. Marks from the pencils are hard to blend in a wash situation. However, you just go all watercolor pencil, then you can control your destiny as it were. I'm a fan of the medium.</p>

<p>Finally, line and wash with the right subjects look really great, so don't necessarily feel like you're making a sacrifice to use a liner pen. If you want it to look better, look at being a little less precise with the lines, break them up a bit, and maybe skip some areas. In other words, use the lines to create variance in the image to your advantage in those conditions.</p>

<p>This is about drawing. I intend to draw a shadow of an object on paper.<br>
You can assume a simple light source like a candle in your answer.<br>

","<p>This can be a somewhat complicated process, to <a href=""http://www.architecturerevived.com/shadow-in-perspective-drawing-art-technique/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">draw shadows in perspective</a>. There are many great resources, but I'll show a simple demo here.</p>

<p>This is using a single light source and a simple box form.</p>

<p>Here are the construction steps I used to create that final image:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lay down your horizon line and choose your vanishing points (VP). </li>
<li>Draw your shape (here the blue box) in perspective. Use standard perspective technique, connecting points on your shape to the relevant VP. Make sure you draw the hidden part of the object (the back), because that can affect the shadow shape.</li>
<li>Assign a place for your Light Source. This is up to up. The horizontal distance from your object will determine the rotation of the shadow. The vertical distance from the horizon will affect the length of the shadow, with greater distance shortening shadows (just like at high noon). </li>
<li>From your light source, draw Shadow Perspective Lines to the top vertex points of your shape.</li>
<li>From your Horizon Light Point (AKA light vanishing point) draw the Shadow Perspective Lines connecting to the bottom points corresponding to the points from step 4.</li>
<li>Find the intersection of the SPLs from vertexes connected by common edges.</li>
<li>Connect these SPL intersections. They are the boundaries of your shadow.</li>
<li>Connect the remaning SPL intersections to the ground-level vertex of the object by following your SPL to the horizon light vanishing point. (Usually, you don't have to think about it and just connected it to the logical corner.)</li>
<li>Shade in between those boundaries you just made.</li>
</ol>

<p>Things get more complicated as your shape gets more complicated, is not resting on the ground, or has curves. The guide I linked to earlier has information on casting shadows from the air, and onto other objects instead of the ground. </p>

<p>You can cast shadows of curved objects by creating a shadow map of the box you could draw around your perspective object. <a href=""http://thevirtualinstructor.com/how-to-draw-paint-cast-shadows.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Virtual Instructor</a> has some examples of shadows of circular and spherical objects.</p>

<p>For more information, you'll want to find resources regarding drawing in perspective, and especially shadows in perspective.</p>

<p>Multiple light sources and ambient light will further complicate your drawing. Getting this done correctly may be less a matter of calculation and more a case for studying how shadows work in the real world. Observation and reference will be your best friend there, especially as you learn about how light and shade works.</p>

"What can I do to stop my colored pencils from falling apart?","2638","","<p>I have an issue where the point and core of my colored pencils will fall out when using them or sharpening them. </p>

<p>But even new ones I've bought individually have done it, too. </p>

<p>What can I do? </p>
","<p>Prismacolor pencils are <em>notorious</em> for lead breakage, but the creamy lay down keeps folks coming back. However, there are some things you can do to moderate the problem, in general (I'm going to answer a bit beyond the question).</p>

<p><strong>Pencil Selection</strong></p>

<p>The pencils that tend to break more easily have off-center cores. If you're buying open stock, take a look at the bottom of the pencil and ensure that the core of it is in the center of the pencil body and not askew. None of mine are in this state, or I'd post a picture, but it's really obvious when you see it.</p>

<p><strong>Sharpening Technique</strong></p>

<p>A little counter-intuitive, but I've found that instead of rotating the pencil in the sharpener, going the other way works better. In this scenario, hold your pencil in your ""off"" hand and then using your normal hand, rotate a very sharp sharpener around. This should be <em>very</em> sharp, the wood should shave off in a long, continuous strip. If it doesn't then it's time to replace.</p>

<p>In addition, don't create a long point. Smaller amounts of exposed core tend to be less fragile and so don't break as often. Find a sharpener that lends itself to that or allows you to control the point.</p>

<p><strong>Fix It Up</strong></p>

<p>Prismas are wax based and can sometimes be fixed by heating the core to fuse it together again. Prismacolor doesn't recommend the microwave, rather a sunny window spot, but many use the microwave. Just keep it short, seconds at a time. After all, you're not looking to make it runny, just softened enough to fuse again.</p>

<p><strong>Handle With Care</strong></p>

<p>Since the lead is fragile, avoiding drops and bangs is a must. The problem, of course, is that transportation to your supplier probably banged and bashed them around, causing the odd one to break even before you got it. To that end, I really recommend going with open stock since you can check the pencils there and, as I noted above, you can confirm that it's not askew.</p>

<p><strong>Change 'em Up</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the day, the price of Prisma feel is the weakness of the lead. If you're reaching the point that it's too much, then there are alternatives. Faber-Castell and Caran d'Ache make great pencils and they don't have the breakage issue. That's partly because they're vegetable oil based rather than wax, but also the lead is bonded to the wood, so even if there is a break inside, all is not lost.</p>

<p>In any event, I have no familiarity with Caran d'Ache pencils to use, but the Faber-Castell Polychromos are really very good and also available in open stock. For me, open stock is a must. So, I have the full Polychromos set and a select bunch of Prismacolors (I generally prefer the white Prisma). They work together just fine.</p>

"How to erase pencil under ink?","2253","","<p>I use an HB pencil, very light, to sketch before drawing with ink.</p>

<p>I use Staedtler ink pen and Staedtler plastic eraser ( whit rectangular with blu paper around )</p>

<p>The problem is that when i erase the pencil under the ink, the ink seems to fade.</p>

<p>I'm using the wrong eraser or is the ink quality that fade?</p>
","<p>That's just how erasing works, for pencils. </p>

<p>Erasers don't really just pick up pencil marks. They work by abrading away a thin layer of the paper, to which the pencil medium (generally graphite) has adhered. The abrasion is a sort of side effect, as the real intent is to disturb the bonds of the graphite to the paper (or cellulose) and allow the erasers to bind instead. Cheaper erasers are less binding, so work more on abrasion. </p>

<p>If the pencil mark is below the ink mark, then removing such a layer of paper will remove a layer with ink on it, as well. The same activity that allows the graphite to bind to the eraser also picks up the ink particles. </p>

<p>The ink fades, but doesn't vanish, because the nature of the ink means it penetrates further into the paper, rather than just the topmost layer. </p>

<p>One solution would be to apply only a basic layer of ink above the pencil, leaving you the opportunity to reapply the ink after erasure. However, if you're not dealing with completely opaque inks then layering this way may affect your end color. </p>

<p>Another solution is to not erase at all, and instead use a light box start out your inked worked on a completely new sheet of paper. (There are also some transferring techniques, where you could convert the pencil sketch to and underlay in ink, but I'm not versed in them enough  to explain, and you could still run into opacity issues with non opaque inks). </p>

"How much acrylic paint do I need to fill a 2x2 meter canvas?","2237","","<p>It's my first time painting a large canvas.</p>

<p>I want to buy Golden paints but I am not sure how much to get, with some room for experimentation too.</p>
","<p>Get yourself a 10 x 10 centimetre square of your canvas and paint a test piece. Once you are happy with your painting measure the amount of paint that was used and then multiply it by 400. That is how much paint you will need to create the same image on a two by two meter square canvas.</p>

<p>2m = 200 cm</p>

<p>200 cm x 200 cm = 40 000 cm^2</p>

<p>10cm x 10 cm = 100 cm^2</p>

<p>40 000 cm^2 / 100 cm^2 = 400 </p>

<p>Your 10 cm^2 canvas is 400 times smaller than your 2 m^2 canvas.</p>

<p>Going the other way, you would have to scale the test piece by 400 times for it to be the same size as your desired canvas.</p>

<p>Oh, and you can determine the amount of paint used by weighing your canvas (the 10 x 10 cm) one before and after painting. The difference in weight is the amount of weight added by the paint. Multiply that by 400 and you will have a good estimate for the amount needed.</p>

<p>Experienced carpenters add 20% for wastage. Carpenters are smart, they know things will go wrong.</p>

<p>So a safe number would be 480 times the amount.</p>

<p>400 x 1.2 = 480</p>

<p>How much actual paint could this be?</p>

<p>Let's say, it takes the artist the equivalent of a quarter of a 2 fl. oz. tube of paint to cover the 10 cm^2 canvas. That's 0.5 fl. oz. of paint to do the painting with.</p>

<p>0.25 x 2 fl. oz = 0.5 fl. oz.</p>

<p>Since the 2 m^2 canvas is 400 times bigger than the 10 cm ^2 canvas you would need a total of 200 fl. oz. to do the same painting as your test piece on the larger size canvas.</p>

<p>0.5 fl. oz. x 400 = 200 fl. oz.</p>

<p>That means you would have to purchase 100 tubes of the 2 fl. oz. paint tubes.</p>

<p>100 x 2 fl. oz. = 200 fl. oz.</p>

<p>Now I did say you need to account for wastage. Assuming 20% of your paint gets wasted. then the number of tubes needs to grow by 20%. That's 120 tubes of paint.</p>

<p>100 * 1.2 = 120 tubes of 2 fl. oz paint tubes.</p>

<p>Now lets say those 2 fl. oz. paint tubes cost $10 USD each. To buy 120 tubes at $10 USD each would cost you a total of $1200 USD.</p>

<p>120 * $10 USD = $1200 USD.</p>

<p>That's $1200 in paint alone.</p>

<p>The next time you go to a gallery show and see all those large paintings hanging on the wall know that the artist had to shell out a hell of a lot of money out of their own pocket to get those paintings made.</p>

<p>The greatest investment artists make are in themselves.</p>

"Blackening steel with oil vs. vinegar - and others?","1869","","<p>I'd like to finish a lamp I made of brazed chain, and so far my reading has uncovered blackening with oil (linseed or motor), or with apple cider vinegar. What is the difference between these two? The vinegar seems to create a thin layer of Ferric Acetate on the steel piece, but how does the oil quench actually function as far as forming the protective layer?</p>

<p>For indoor use, are there any other finishes I can do at home worth looking into?</p>
","<p>Treating with vinegar (or other acids) tends to form a dark grey patina, depending on how it is applied it can also also show variations in shade. More viscous things like mustard and tomato sauce can be dabbled or stippled on to create a distinctly mottled effect. Acids also work well to strip off or at least dull bright zing plating and galvanising. </p>

<p>This finish needs to be dried and sealed with wax, oil, lacquer etc fairly quickly (ie within minutes) or it will start to rust. Also because it is somewhat porous it can be a good base for tinted oils and waxes. </p>

<p>Oil blacking works by polymerising and partly burning the oil. Here the temperature is quite important as the metal needs to be hot enough to blacken the oil without burning it off completely. If you watch the oxide colours as it heats up the point when it goes from deep blue to grey is usually about right. This process is pretty similar to seasoning a cast iron pan. You can either dip the piece in a container of oil or paint it on with a rag (don't use a synthetic brush, it will just melt). </p>

<p>Oil blacking is reasonably stable and doesn't require any additional sealing, although a layer of hard wax, reapplied every so often will make it a bit more durable. </p>

<p>I would recommend using linseed oil or similar rather than motor oil as motor oil (especially used) will contain all sorts of additives that you don't really want to be handling or inhaling. I've found that a mixture of linseed oil and paraffin wax works well.</p>

<p>Another option is to allow the piece to rust and then treat it with a rust converter such as <a href=""http://www.fertan.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fertan</a>, these are generally phosphoric and/or tannic acid based and will turn the rust a deep blue/black which can then be sealed with wax, oil etc </p>

<p>Is there a more effective way of doing this <strong>whilst keeping the stump's point intact?</strong></p>
","<p>Using sandpaper and then tidying up with craft knife is the generally accepted way of cleaning tortillon. However, it's possible that you might be using sandpaper with a low grit level (under 120) for too long. This would be almost ripping the material.</p>

<p>I start with a 100 grit sandpaper to get rid of the graphite\charcoal staining, then use a craft knife to clean up the really rough bits and shape. Finally I use a 180 grit, or greater, sandpaper to smooth out. I find it much easier to have the sandpaper on the work surface and move the tortillon on the sandpaper. It provides much better control and helps maintain the shape.</p>

Then clamping the workpiece down would be a good idea. </p>

"How do I keep my ink from smudging when I draw?","1628","","<p>When I try to make sketches with a fountain pen on printer paper, it keeps smudging, so I have to restart.  What do I do to prevent smudging?</p>

<p>If this helps, I'm ambidextrous.</p>
","<p>There are four things I can think of which will help you avoid smudging your inks are: how you hold your hands over your working surface, controlling the amount of ink on your paper, helping the ink dry quicker, and being present at all times in the drawing process.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Keep away from wet areas. </p>

<p>Always keep your hand above the surface of the paper, never resetting the edge of the palm on the paper. Only the tip of the pen is allowed to make contact with the paper. If you do need to stabilize your hand, for some fine detail work, you either stabilize your hand using the tip of your pinky balanced in an area free of ink or you use something like a painter's <strong><em>maulstick</em></strong> which gives you a stable surface that is balanced from the outer edges of your working area.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove any excess ink helps speed drying time. </p>

<p>Fountain pens can place generous amounts of ink onto the surface of your paper. This pooled ink takes a long time to dry. To help the drying process you can use something called an <strong><em>""ink blotter""</em></strong>. An ink blotter is a special pad of paper used to soak up excess ink from the surface of the paper. Helps to dry the remaining ink faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaporate the moisture.</p>

<p>Use heat to help the ink dry quicker. A <strong><em>heat gun</em></strong>, or blow dryer, passed gently over the surface of your working surface will help remove the moisture from the ink.</p></li>
<li><p>Stop and think. </p>

<p>It's easy to get lost in a drawing and forget what areas you have recently gone over. It's those recently drawn areas which have the greatest change of being accidentally smudged. <strong><em>Be present in the moment</em></strong>, slow down your drawing and pay attention where your pen has been recently and where you want to go to next. Knowing what you have drawn and when it was drawn will help you avoid inadvertently running into still wet ink.</p></li>

  <p>Silhouette can refer to the art of cutting outlines or portraits out

<blockquote>
  <p>""[L]ong before the paper was invented... people used thin materials,
  like leaves, silver foil, silk and even leather, to carve hollowed
  patterns for beauty. Later, when paper was invented, people realized
  that this material was easy to cut, store and discard. Thus paper
  became the major material for them to use, and people habitually
  called this artistry paper-cutting, or Jianzhi in Chinese.""</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I am actually not sure why you had issues. That being said I don't know what you consider obscene and what glues you used and your specific paper.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Forward</strong></p>

<p>While not a comprehensive experiment as I was testing with products and materials that I had available. I do think between the two of these you should have a good basis for choice though. My breakage tests also are slightly flawed as I don't have the tools to measure pressure exerted nor the ability to make each break with the exact same circumstances. There are other glues that I could have used, however, given my findings, I think the issues would have been the same. </p>

<p><strong>Glues not tested</strong></p>

<p>There are things that I could not test with and choose not use.</p>

<p>I don't think a glue stick or glue dots would be good for this. Hot glue gun could work and even double sided tape. In the case of the latter you might have an aesthetics issue. Gorilla glue or PVA's would also work. Gorilla Glue is an expands while it dries, which I know from experience, so it might not be what you want to use here as it might warp the work. </p>

<p><strong>Test materials and setup</strong></p>

<p>I tested with 3 different paper stocks. Canvas paper, thin cardstock and printer paper. For glues I used carpenters glue (Yellow) and white craft glue. These glues can be considered kid safe and non-toxic. Consult product labels to be sure.</p>

<p>I used brand-less macaroni that I purchased specifically to do macaroni art. The glue was applied with different consistencies to see if the amount of glue was important. </p>

<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>

<p>For each piece of paper I logically divided it into 8 parts. Each glue was given an indicator box and 3 spots where the glue was applied lightly, heavy and an in-between consistency. The white glue had nozzle so I was able to apply it easily. My yellow glue nozzle broke ages ago so I used a craft stick to apply it. The two below pictures show how much of each glue was applied. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kBjk3.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kBjk3.png"" alt=""Glue samples""></a></p>

<p>I then proceeded to add one piece of macaroni to each glue site. I made sure that the macaroni was lying flat to the paper to increase the gluing surface area. This picture shows the tests in a completed a drying state. The glue is still wet as this point. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZIs0Z.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZIs0Z.jpg"" alt=""Glue samples""></a></p>

<p>The drying times for each glue was 30-35 minutes. The carpenters glue recommended 24 to allow a full cure. I waited 12 hours before I tested and I think that is fair. </p>

<p><strong>Strength test</strong></p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that this needs to be taken with a grain of salt so I don't suggest using this as a thesis source. This also doesn't cover long term durability<sup>1</sup>. Here is a picture of the macaronis after I put in effort to remove them all.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lEYwr.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lEYwr.png"" alt=""Noodle massacre""></a></p>

<p>From left to right: printer paper, light cardstock, canvas paper</p>

<p>To remove the noodles I used my thumb and pushed from the side of the noodles. There were some that I could not remove like that an had to grab from the end. If the end was not glue I was able to grab under it and pull. If the end were completely glued I would not have been able to do that and it should have been harder to pull off. </p>

<p><strong>Findings</strong></p>

<p>I found the yellow caprenters glue to be better than the white craft glue but not by much. In all cases the glue held and the <em>paper</em> failed. As you can see in some pictures the noodles actually broke. I found the canvas paper to hold onto the noodles better. Likely that is because it was thicker and had a textured surface. The printer paper failed easier. In the printer paper's defense the glue still help to the paper rather well. Still, it was the weakest as I expected it to be. </p>

<p>The glues warped the printer paper significantly and the cardstock somewhat. While I do notice that the other side of the canvas was wet the overall shape was not change i.e. it remained flat.</p>

<p>In short if I was to choose, based on best results, my option would be yellow glue with the canvas paper. I would use enough glue to cover the entire noodle and have enough to sightly pool around it (My heavy option pictured above). The cardstock I used was perfectly fine though.</p>

<hr>

<p>1: I do have a tangential case I can refer to for this though. 3 years previous to this post I made a anniversary gift for my wife that was macaroni art. I used the exact same macaroni (from the same box) and yellow carpenters glue. This was applied to a small section of wood. My wife displays this in our living room as she thinks its funny. After 3 years none of the pieces have fallen off (This has not been in direct sunlight the entire time).

<p>And <a href=""https://crafts.stackexchange.com/a/1783/44"">another answer</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Believe it or not, oil paintings actually take years to fully dry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was also mentioned that there is no consensus about putting it behind glass <em>while</em> it is drying. Waiting until it is dried could be a safe bet.</p>

<p>Of course there are factors beyond time that would affect this e.g. environmental factors, thickness of paint used etc. If the painting being dry is important for whatever reason (like storage) it would be useful to know when the painting is free of moisture. </p>

<p>How can I tell if an oil painting is dry? Or perhaps it does not really matter. </p>
","<p>Before providing a way to test the oil painting is dry, it's useful to know how the <em>drying</em> process works and why it is important.</p>

<p><strong>How does oil paint dry (cure)?</strong></p>

<p>Oil Paint doesn’t really dry, rather it cures. The pigment is dispersed in oil (typically linseed) and generally contains a solvent (methylated/white spirit). The solvent evaporates away leaving the oil and the pigment.</p>

<p>Then over a period of time the oil &amp; pigment slowly become less malleable through a process of oxidisation. The oil hasn’t evaporated away (<em>dried</em>) it has become hard (<em>cured</em>).</p>

<p><strong>What can cause differences in the drying time?</strong></p>

<p>As you have mentioned in your question there are several things that can affect the curing time of the paint.</p>

<ul>
<li>Application thickness of the paint</li>
<li>Pigment colour:

<ul>
<li>Earth colours require less oil (ochre etc.), so cure quicker
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rZhsS.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rZhsS.png"" alt=""Earth Colours""></a></li>
<li>Primary colours require more oil (crimson etc.), so cure slower
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KFLZr.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KFLZr.png"" alt=""Primary Colours""></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Brand/type of paint</li>
<li>Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, airflow &amp; sunlight</li>
</ul>

<p>Most paint suppliers offer good advice on how long their paints take to dry. But some general guidelines are that most paints will be <em>touch dry after 10-14 days</em> and should be <em>fully cured within 6 months</em>. However, for those pieces where the artist has used a liberal impasto technique, then upto 2 years is possible!</p>

<p><strong>Why wait?</strong></p>

<p>If the artist intends to <em>varnish</em>, and there are several reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Protection</li>
<li>Bring richness &amp; vibrancy to colour</li>
<li>Ease of cleaning</li>
</ul>

<p>Doing so before the paint has cured could lead to cracking and also it might not allow the paint to fully cure, and this can lead to weakness between layers. And, therefore, flaking.</p>

<p>When framing it is less important that the painting is fully cured. But there are risks as the piece could be knocked during the process and cause indenting, or squashing, of the paint. Also, it can slow down the curing process.</p>

<p>So to answer the actual question: </p>

<p><strong>How do you know that the oil painting is dry?</strong></p>

<p>There is a very simple test.</p>

<p>Take a lint-free rag and dip it into white spirit. Pick an inconspicuous area and gently rub. If any colour shows on the rag, it requires further drying time before varnishing or framing.</p>

<p>But I wouldn’t suggest doing this on your newly acquired Gerhard Richter.</p>

"What material can I use for hardcover book panels when binding?","1470","","<p>I am getting into book binding, and want to try binding something with faux leather. However, I want to bump up the quality of the binding, and don't want to use cardboard as a backbone in holding the faux together. </p>

<p>I was wondering about a material that I could use in its place. I was thinking possibly Solid Bleach Board, or chipboard. I do like the look of chipboard, though i'm worried it may be <em>too</em> rigid. </p>

<p>Are there any types of cardboard that are simply loosely compressed, and uncorrugated?</p>
","<p>I would strongly consider what is usually used for covers in these types of books. Hardboard or millboard. They are both similar materials that I would suggest for this. Unfortunately their names are sometimes used interchangeably so I would like to clarify a little what they are. Then you should be able to make a informed choice. </p>

<p><strong>Millboard</strong> is what you would find if you were to take a simple binder or traditional hardcover book apart. It is also heavier than millboard so keep that in mind. Side Note: Doing just that is a great way to get perfectly sized materials!</p>

<p><strong>Hardboard</strong> is, like its name suggests, a very hard rigid and dense board. It is similar to both MDF and particle board. These come in thin sheets that would be perfect for binding. I talk about hardboard a <em>little</em> more over at <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1528/how-can-i-identify-some-of-the-common-engineered-boards-panels/1529#1529"">Woodworking.SE</a></p>

<p>I would lean towards millboard as it is more forgiving to bending than hardboard. Hardboard will hardly move at all. Both are perfectly adequate for binding leather. I have made 5 books that were leather bound. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, I want to bump up the quality of the binding</p>

<p>If you wanted to do something else to bump up your game I would suggest using actual leather for you book covers. It is <em>really</em> easy to come by if you are no picky about colours. Local secondhand stores are usually where I source my leathers. Jackets might be tempting for their size but they are usually too expensive. Skirts are the best best at being both cheap and containing large enough swatches to cover your book panels. </p>

"What is an easy way to waterproof large pieces of cardboard?","1440","","<p>I am building sets and props for an outdoor performance. We must use recycled materials as much as possible, and will thus use cardboard a lot since it is readily available. We plan on painting or sticking on some decor to build the props, where they will then be mounted on frames/sticks to stand or to be puppetted by stagehands.</p>

<p>As the performance is outdoors, the pieces will inevitably face the perils of water (tropical climate; high humidity and precipitation) repeatedly due to rehearsals and accidents. I am concerned about the cardboard pieces falling apart from water damage. Most of the cardboard is 1-ply, if that is important.</p>

<p><strong>How do you cost-effectively waterproof large pieces of cardboard with paint on them and protect them from getting soggy?</strong> They will be on the order of 0.25 to 16 m^2 in surface area per piece.</p>
","<h2>Waterproof paint for the flat parts, tape for the edges.</h2>

<p>Any kind of spreadable waterproof fluid will do for the large faces of the cardboard sheets. <strong>Paint</strong> or <strong>glue</strong> could both work, but paint is probably more cost-effective. There are many types of waterproof paint (acrylic, enamel, anything listed as exterior-grade).</p>

<p>The edges will be harder to deal with using paint. Even if you managed to paint the edge itself successfully, water could still trickle down the corrugated part to the inner parts where your paintbrush couldn't reach and destroy the cardboard from the inside out. But the edges can be covered using waterproof <strong>tape</strong>. Duct tape would be best for strength and durability, but if you don't want it to be visible and spoil the image of your painted props, you could use a strong clear tape instead.</p>

<p>See also <a href=""https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-make-cardboard-waterproof"" rel=""nofollow"">this Quora article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are various ways you could seal cardboard but basically you'll have to cover <em>every</em> part of it that would ever come in contact with water or even humidity, and do that <em>completely</em> and without even tiny gaps. </p>
  
  <p>So you could seal it with waterproof (or at least water-resistant) liquids, or with waterproof tapes (duct tape, clear packing tape, etc), or by using something like shrink-wrap plastic or other solid but flexible plastics, or with flexible metals like aluminum foil, or even just by enclosing it inside a waterproof acrylic or glass display box or dome.</p>
  
  <p>The most water""proof"" liquids would be permanent paints (acrylics, latex, enamels) or clear finishes like polyurethane and epoxy resins and even less waterproof ones like thinned-down PVA glues** and acrylic mediums, etc.
  (Many other pasty, etc, materials that are thicker or not intended as finishes/paints could work too but they wouldn't usually be as smooth or thin.)</p>

"Paint or glue porous floral Styrofoam?","1414","","<p>Floral Styrofoam comes in some shapes perfect for a craft I'm working on (colorful noodle dinosaurs), but I'm having a really difficult time getting anything to stick because it's so porous. </p>

<p>This type of foam:</p>

<p><img src=""https://factorydirectcraft.com/pimages/20050813095903-227599/small_styrofoam_cone_1.jpg"" alt=""enter link description here""></p>

<p>Is there a type of paint or primer I can apply, first, so they decorative paint and glue stick to that? </p>

<p>Is there a certain glue I should use? </p>
","<p>You need to create the initial surface coat that can both smooth the rough surface of the Styrofoam and create a surface for further material adhesion. There are actually a number of safe and simple approaches that you can do which all have a similar outcome. First though you need to be aware of what you should not do.</p>

<h1>Be wary of products that will dissolve styrofoam</h1>

<p>There are a number of products that react to Styrofoam on a chemical level and cause it to melt. Many spray paints can do this as well and products that contain paint thinner. Many product labels will mention what materials they are and are not designed for. If you are not sure sticking with one of the suggestion below would be advised or at least test in a controlled and well ventilated environment if you must. </p>

<h1>Initial coating options</h1>

<p>It does not need to be any sort of heavy coating but something that will try and provide a more uniform surface. In no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mod Podge / decoupage</strong>: Mod podge will work on its own with one or two layers built up. Some light sanding in between layers will help create a smoother surface. You don't need to use the glue alone. You can decoupage as well. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Paper mache</strong>: Using the foam as a base paper mache onto it. I would likely do the entire object (all sides) as this might not adhere to the foam well or at least not long term. Doing all sides would give it no where to go. Not my first choice but this is a fun option for kids. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Styrofoam safe paints</strong>: I don't have any specific suggestion here. You will have a hard time using a brush given the rough surface. You might need to use a cloth or something similar to work the paint into all the holes. Let it dry and repeat the process. It will get easier each time as it gets smoother. Water and Acrylic paints apparently work just fine here. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plaster of Paris / Geeso / Drywall compound</strong>: These should be easy to apply to the surface. Don't put it on too think. Much like other approaches Let dry and sand. Drywall compound would be the last choice of these options as it would be brittle. Should still work though. I am putting Geeso in this list as I think it works almost the same although I have no experience with it. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Commercial Options</strong>: There is a specific product called Foam Finish which is marketed for use with Styrofoam and related foam products. Likely there are similar products under different names.  Consulting a hobby store will help you get the variants. From the container you can see it would work well in this situation and you can read more at <a href=""https://www.bphobbies.com/view.asp?id=I2300465&amp;pid=I2300464&amp;img=l"" rel=""nofollow"">one supplier's site</a>. :</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Repairs dents &amp; nicks in all foam including Depron EPP, EPO, Styrofoam &amp; more.</li>
  <li>Helps make foam stronger with virtually no extra weight.</li>
  <li>Creates a smooth surface for decals or paint.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>In almost all cases the key is to keep your initial coats thin and build up to strength and uniformity you desire. </p>

<p>All of these should get you a good working surface that you can paint whatever you want. You should be able to glue object as well to the new surface of your foam. </p>

I use the color pencils with the parrot on the cover, currently.</p>

<p>P.S. Not referring to the artist grade colors.</p>
","<p>Student vs professional is usually a difference in pigment and pigment amounts, the binders are typically the same. So, from that respect, I wouldn't expect a lot of difference in the important aspect of their behavior.</p>

<p>So, watercolor pencils are designed to be used dry on dry or as a wet medium, so there's no inherent reason not to use them for dry coloring, they just have different characteristics versus more traditional colored pencil medium and you can learn to take advantage of those just as easily. This is true in ""normal"" options as well, the behavior of wax-based is different that oil-based, and you can use that to your advantage.</p>

<p>In terms of getting brighter, this is also true of wax/oil pencils when blended with a blender. You're dissolving the binder, leaving behind the pigment, and that usually results in a brighter look. Binder differences can result in a difference of brightness dry, but that doesn't necessarily mean the pigments are richer.</p>

<p>The biggest difference, in my still limited observation working with Polychromos and Albrecht Dürer pencils, is that the watercolors blend together much, much, easier and I need far less layering to achieve coverage once I activate with water. In fact, for a single color, one is generally enough. It's a different look though, as it's not opaque, but that's the fun part of watercolors.</p>

<p>So, sure, you can use the watercolor pencils for dry coloring. Just remember that if you want to use them wet, the paper matters. Normal dry paper is probably not going to hold up that well to applying water.</p>

"What are the different type of paint brush bristles?","1260","","<p>I've heard that the standard craft brushes, which you can buy cheaply for school supplies or children, are rather terrible for advanced art.</p>

<p>There are much more expensive brushes, but I don't know where to begin evaluating them outside of the price.</p>

<p>What are the different materials they use, and what benefits and issues do these materials have when it comes to painting?</p>
","<h2>Natural vs synthetic</h2>

<p>I did a bit of research into this and found that there are two main kinds of paintbrush bristles: <strong>natural</strong> (usually made from animal hair) and <strong>synthetic</strong> (usually made from some combination of nylon and polyester). Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages according to what kind of paint you're using. The TL;DR is that <strong>natural bristles are better for oil-based paint while synthetic bristles are better for water-based or latex paint</strong>. For more details, see <a href=""http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a7647/which-paintbrush-should-you-use/"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a>. As a bonus, it also gives some information on the <em>shape</em> as well as the material of paintbrush bristles:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Bristle Shape:</strong> Most paintbrushes available today are square-cut brushes. They're perfect for holding and laying paint onto virtually any surface. However, square-cut brushes don't provide as much control when painting into corners, up to adjacent surfaces, or along narrow edges or surfaces. For more precise control, use a sash brush, which has its bristles cut at a slight angle. Sash brushes are particularly well-suited for cutting in around the perimeter of a room.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bristle Tips:</strong> Better quality brushes have bristles with flagged, or split, ends. Flagged bristles hold more paint and spread paint more smoothly. Some brushes, especially sash brushes, have tipped ends, which should not be confused with flagged ends. Tipped brushes come to a point; they're not cut flat and straight, as is a standard brush.</p>
  
  <p>Professional painters favor tipped brushes because they provide greater control and allow you to apply paint more precisely.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>More details on different types</h2>

<p><a href=""http://www.dickblick.com/info/brushhair/"" rel=""nofollow"">This list</a> goes into more detail on the usages of synthetic and various types of natural bristles, although it doesn't distinguish between different types of synthetic material:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>Badger</strong></p>
  
  <p>For blending oil paint on canvas, Badger Hair is an age-old tradtion. It comes from various parts of the world and is more readily available than most animal hair, although the quality varies greatly. Badger hair is thickest at the point, and relatively thin at the root, so it has a distinctive ""bushy"" appearance.</p>
  
  <p>MEDIA: oil</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Camel Hair</strong></p>
  
  <p>Camel Hair does not come from camels at all. It is found in watercolor and lettering brushes and usually is made of squirrel, goat, ox, pony or a blend of several hairs, depending on the desired softness and intended cost of the brush.</p>
  
  <p>MEDIA: lettering, tempera, watercolor</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Hog Bristle</strong></p>
  
  <p>Hog Bristle is obtained from hogs in several parts of the world, the most sought after coming from China. Bristle is unlike any other natural filler in that it forms a V-shaped split or ""flag"" at the tip and tends to have a natural curve. A brush with ""interlocked"" bristles, with the curves formed inward to the ferrule, has a natural resistance to fraying and spreads medium to thick paints smoothly and evenly. A selection of pure hog bristle brushes is recommended for oil and acrylic painting, and is a far less expensive alternative to good-quality softer hairs.</p>

  <p>MEDIA: acrylic, oil</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Kolinsky Sable</strong></p>
  
  <p>Kolinsky Sable is not really from a sable at all, but comes from the tail of a species of mink that is a member of the weasel family found in Siberia and northeastern China. It is generally conceded to be the best material for oil and watercolor brushes due to its strength, spring and ability to retain its shape (""snap""). It holds a very fine point or edge. This is considered a professional grade of hair, and if properly cared for, Kolinsky will last for many years.</p>
  
  <p>MEDIA, oil, watercolor</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Ox Hair</strong></p>
  
  <p>The best quality comes from the ears of cattle or oxen. The Ox Hair has a very strong body with silken texture, is very resilient, has good ""snap"", but lacks a fine tip. Therefore, it is most useful in medium gradewash brushes, or flat shaped brushes. Frequently, ox hair is blended with other natural hair to increase the resiliency of a brush.</p>

  <li><p><strong>Pony Hair</strong></p>
  
  <p>Pony Hair is soft but strong, from mature animals at least 2 years of age. It is primarily used for scholastic grade brushes, but often blended with other hairs for inexpensive watercolor and touch-up brushes.</p>
  
  <p>MEDIA: acrylic, scholastic, tempera, watercolor</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Red Sable</strong></p>
  
  <p>Red Sable is obtained from any member of the weasel family with ""red"" hair, not at all from the animal known as the sable. It is found in a variety of brush styles for many varied mediums, with quality and characteristics varying greatly. A good quality pure Red Sable is a good alternative to the more expensive Kolinsky, with similar performance and durability. Often, weasel hair is blended with ox hair to make a more economical brush, but the fine point is sacrificed.</p>
  
  <p>MEDIA: oil, watercolor</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Sabeline</strong></p>
  
  <p>Sabeline is actually select, light-colored ox hair dyed to resembled red sable. Lettering and watercolor brushes often use Sabeline mixed with Sable to lower the cost of a brush.</p>
  
  <p>MEDIA: lettering, watercolor</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Squirrel</strong></p>
  
  <p>Gray Squirrel (Talayoutky), most highly in demand for lettering brushes and quills, is native to Russia and nearly always fell in short supply. Brown squirrel (Kazan) is more readily available, and is used mainly for medium quality and scholastic watercolor brushes. A very fine, thin hair, taken from squirrel tails, it points as well as Kolinsky, but has very little ""snap"" because the hair is not very resilient. It works best with liquid paints and inks.</p>
  
  <p>MEDIA: lettering, watercolor</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Synthetic</strong></p>
  
  <p>Synthetics are man-made of either nylon or polyester filaments. They can be tapered, tipped, flagged, abraded or etched to increase color carrying ability. Often, synthetic filaments are dyed and baked to make them softer and more absorbent. The common name for this filament is ""Taklon"". Advantages of synthetic brushes are: 1) They are less prone to damage from solvents, insects or paints. 2) They are easier to keep clean than animal hair brushes because the filaments don't have animal scale structures to trap paint. 3) They are less prone to breakage and are durable on many different surfaces. 4) They are better suited for painting with acrylics because a synthetic filament will withstand the caustic nature of acrylic paints with less damage.</p>

<p>What can I do to get the desired results?</p>
","<p>In the drawing of the hummingbird you posted, darker colored pencils are being used. Children's sets usually have bright, basic colors.</p>

<p>However, you may have some luck getting darker colors by layering what you have. Read up on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">color theory</a> and combine colors to give the illusion of overall darker hues. The section on tints &amp; shades from the wiki article is particularly helpful, and includes reasoning as to why you should avoid darkening colors with black or lightening them with white:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is common among some painters to darken a paint color by adding
  black paint—producing colors called shades—or lighten a color by
  adding white—producing colors called tints. However it is not always
  the best way for representational painting, as an unfortunate result
  is for colors to also shift in hue. [...] Lightening a
  color by adding white can cause a shift towards blue when mixed with
  reds and oranges. Another practice when darkening a color is to use
  its opposite, or complementary, color (e.g. purplish-red added to
  yellowish-green) in order to neutralize it without a shift in hue, and
  darken it if the additive color is darker than the parent color. </p>

"Is it possible to combine charcoal and graphite in one image?","1202","","<p>Im drawing an image with quite a large range of tones and I plan to draw the darker tones in charcoal. However I used a graphite pencil for the preparatory drawing. Is it still possible to draw with charcoal even on an area where graphite has been applied or do I have to prepare the area before adding the charcoal?</p>
","<p>Yes, you can mix medias. But you need to preserve some of the tooth of your paper's surface to successfully transition from working with graphite to charcoal.</p>

<p>The tooth of your paper determines how well things will catch and hold to the surface of the paper. </p>

<p>As you pass your pencil, or charcoal, across the paper's surface little bits of the drawing tool are abraded and deposited onto the drawing surface. Its the abraded pencil material sitting in the grooves of the paper that form the image. Unlike paint that gets absorbed and wicked into the fibres of the paper the abraded dust particles of your pencil are caught and held by the fibres of the paper. Not absorbed but held in place. This is why very smooth paper doesn't take to pencil very well. A smooth piece of paper won't abrade material off the pencil. No deposited material. No image.</p>

<p>Now the problem with pencils is they are made from a material that can fill and smooth the tooth of the paper quite well. The ""graphite"" in pencils is made from mixture of graphite and clay. Heavily working your pencil over the paper's surface will cause two things to happen: the tooth of the paper will be worn down and there will be a large deposit of graphite and clay filling the remaining voids in the paper. I have had it happen to me where I have overworked a pencil drawing and the surface of the paper has what almost looks like a mirror finish. The burninshing results in a perfectly smooth surface that nothing can grab onto, not charcoal or paint will stick to these burnished areas.</p>

<p>So in your case if you have been gentle with the application of graphite to the surface of the paper and retained some of the tooth then you should have no worries about working charcoal onto the surface as well.</p>

"How do I cut a perfect square out of paper for origami folding?","1165","","<p>We've all been there.  You think it's a square. It looks like a square. You fold it into a bird base, and well, it's that tiny bit off.

"How to frame a cross-stitch?","1164","","<p>I recently finished a cross-stitch for a gift, and would like to frame it in a way that will preserve it reasonably well. I was under time constraints to present it to the recipient and there was only one frame the right size, so it's currently sandwiched between two panes of glass. However, I have a cross stitch from my grandmother in a matted frame with no glass which seems to have held up well.</p>

<p>Is glass or no glass preferred for framing cross-stitches? What else should I consider for preservation?</p>
","<p>I don't recommend leaving your cross stitched projects sandwiched between glass. This compresses/flattens the stitches which can make them look odd.</p>

<p>Taking the piece to a reputable framing shop is probably the best idea unless you make a lot of projects and want to learn how to do it yourself or if the project is relatively small. A good shop should know how to properly block the cloth to keep it square but check with them to be certain they have experience with this.</p>

<p>The steps for framing yourself are generally laid out in an article <a href=""http://www.needlework-tips-and-techniques.com/framing-cross-stitch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and a similar one <a href=""http://www.artecy.com/framing-cross-stitch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. The basic process is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prepare the piece

<ul>
<li>Wash the piece to remove oils - be careful of running colors, particularly if you didn't prewash the thread.</li>
<li>Iron to remove wrinkles - from the back, on soft cloth to prevent flattening stitches.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mount the piece. 

<ul>
<li>Block it onto an acid-free foam core board using straight pins, keeping some tension as you go around to keep the piece flat - use the lines of the fabric to help keep things straight.</li>
<li>Fold the edges around the back of the foam and secure with pins or stitching.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, they simply recommend putting it in a frame either with or without glass... but I strongly encourage you to go a couple of steps further.</p>

<p>I highly recommend glass as it will prevent incidental dust and oils from getting on the piece. You just spent hours making it - protect it! The glass (if you get UV glass), can prevent the piece from fading, which is very important as the dyes used may not all fade at the same rates. Reds are well known to fade more quickly than other colors.</p>

<p>I also recommend adding at least one matting layer to put some space between the work and the glass, again, to prevent the stitches from being flattened.</p>

"What should I look for in a paper for a complex origami model?","1036","","<p>I'm thinking of stepping up to folding complex origami models, such as those by <a href=""http://www.folders.jp/"" rel=""nofollow"">KAMIYA Satoshi</a>, <a href=""http://origami.gr.jp/~hojyo/004phototop.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">HOJYO Takashi</a>, and <a href=""http://www.langorigami.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Robert Lang</a>, but obviously 10"" origami paper (kami) isn't going to cut it, as you typically need much larger paper (60cm x 60cm being not uncommon a requirement).  What should I look for (thickness, weight, fiber types, sizing) when hunting up paper sources for this kind of model?  I'm not interested in making my own  or other DIY solutions (e.g., methyl cellulose, foil tissue, etc.), or going super-expensive high end, like Origamido paper.</p>

<p>If I have to buy paper over the internet that I can't touch/feel, how can I judge if it's suitable for folding complex models?</p>
","<p>When rejecting DIY solutions, you are limiting your choice a lot. Methylcellulose (MC)-glued double and triple tissue and well as self-made tissue foil are very popular and relatively inexpensive materials for folding exactly the kind of models you describe.</p>

<p>The situation is not hopeless, however. There are ready-made papers which may suit your needs, but you will usually have to pay dearly for the benefit of not having to prepare paper yourself.</p>

<ul>
<li>For practice, Kraft paper is often very good. It is widely available, strong, and you can get it in a range of thicknesses, including thin (e.g. 40 gsm). It does not look too good, but its folding properties are quite nice and it is inexpensive. You can usually get some variant in a local art supply store and save on shipping fees. This kind of paper often comes in rolls in which case you can get large formats, even above 1 m, easily (you have to cut the square yourself in such case, though).</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.origami-shop.com/en/origamipapertissuefoil60x60greenscrapbookingorigamishopcom-xml-219_346_349-1510.html"">Nicolas Terry Tissue Foil</a> is a ready-to-use replacement for self-made tissue foil and seems to be thinner than what you can make yourself.</li>
<li>Various mulberry papers can be good for this sort of models. They are available online and sometimes in art supply stores (depending on where you live).</li>
<li>A broad range of Washi papers are suitable for complex models. Be careful, however as Washi can mean a lot of different things, from very thin to rather thick. Be sure to check the weight / thickness of the paper.</li>
<li>A number of hand made papers may be suitable but since they are all unique, and often do not even have an official weight rating, it may be hard to find the right one without touching it or having a qualified seller who knows origami choose one for you.</li>
<li>And of course at the high end there's some <a href=""http://www.origami-shop.com/en/origamido-paper-xml-207_215_657_285-2000.html"">Origamido available online</a>. That's what Robert Lang often uses for his best models, though it comes with a price tag of €13 per sheet.</li>
</ul>

<p>These were some specific paper types which may (or may not) fit your model. Note that each particular model may have different requirements on thickness and stiffness of the paper. For example, <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/origami-artist-galen/23735114470/"">Shuki Kato's elephant</a> can certainly be considered a complex model (196 steps) but it can be, and very often is, folded from Elephant Hide paper (110 gsm) which is an absolute no go for most insect models.</p>

<p>So, think about a particular model. What you can do is search flickr or other places where lots of origami models are displayed for your model. People will often add the paper type and weight to the model's description and this can help you choose paper for your own folding. When you buy online at a specialist origami store, you can also ask the shop about particular paper's suitability for certain kinds of models. No one can guarantee you a good fold (it depends very much on your own work), but they can give you hints which paper may be good and which you should avoid.</p>

<p>Ilan Garibi has a series of <a href=""https://origamiusa.org/thefold/keywords/278"">paper reviews on OrigamiUSA</a> where he has reviewed a number of commercially available papers. I have found these reviews to be very helpful when I started to get interested in origami papers myself.</p>

<p>Finally, here are some properties of the paper you should look for. Generally, you want your paper to be thin, yet strong and crisp. In more detail, this means paying attention to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Paper weight, usually expressed in gsm (grams per square meter). These values are only approximate ratings but they give you an idea of how thick the paper is. 80 gsm is the weight of standard copy paper and is too much for many complex models, for which you should look for 40-60 gsm paper. Some very fine papers used for insects go as low as 20 gsm. Elephant Hide, a thick and stiff paper, is rated at 110 gsm. Papers around 160-300 gsm are suitable for wet folding but hardly foldable dry.</li>
<li>Fibre types: hand-made papers have long fibres which is usually a good thing. Longer fibres make the paper stronger and make it behave better when you need to wet fold some detail.</li>
<li>Crispness: it should be possible to make a sharp, well-defined crease at exactly the place you want it and paper should hold the crease well. This is especially important for complex folds like sinks where you precrease a line and then collapse along it. Soft paper has its benefits too, but too soft may make folding difficult.</li>
<li>Aging: one of the reasons I started using better papers was I noticed I had to throw away a number of old models which had faded and become very ugly. If you invest a lot of time into folding a complex model, you want it to stay looking fresh for a long time. Chlorine-free and acid-free papers are expected to last longer than those with the extra additives. Hand made papers often avoid these chemicals and age quite well.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href=""https://origamiusa.org/thefold/article/paper-review-1-elephant-hide"">first paper review by Ilan Garibi</a> describes these and many more properties which affect how origami paper behaves when you fold it and which make it suitable or not for particular model types.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.winsornewton.com/row/shop/graphic-markers/pigment-marker"" rel=""nofollow"">The Winsor &amp; Newton Pigment Marker page</a> only states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Can I use Pigment Marker with other media, like water colour or oil?</strong>
  This is not recommended. The binder used in the formula of any given paint will block the Pigment Marker nib. However, Pigment Marker works with graphite pencils, and further experimentation is always encouraged. 
  <strong>Will Winsor &amp; Newton Pigment Marker™ work on standard bleedproof marker paper?</strong>
  Bleedproof paper is designed for dye-alcohol markers, which are extremely fast-drying and bleed through paper. Pigment Marker does not bleed through and is slower-drying; therefore, performance will be compromised due the paper’s high absorbency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since you should not use the same paper than the alcohol based markers the point is inferred.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.dickblick.com/products/winsor-and-newton-pigment-markers/"" rel=""nofollow"">Blick seller of the W&amp;N markers </a> has definitive specs:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So, maybe you can try dual using the markers in non-essential works. </p>

<p>However, my advice would be not to do it. Even within the same medium it is often problematic to use different brands because of the myriad of proprietary chemicals that could potentially interact.</p>

<p>How do I go about deciding which type of adhesive, bonding agent or sculpting material would be best suited for repairs? </p>
","<p>It depends what you want out of the repairs.</p>

<p>If you're looking for longevity and quality of repair, an <strong>epoxy</strong> (resin) is your best bet. They tend to create the best seams and are difficult to break. The downside of these is that you get one shot - getting it wrong quite often either gets the parts stuck in the wrong place, or you very messy. Some epoxy glues also require mixing of two ingredients, which is definitely messy.</p>

<p>For quick-and-dirty repairs, it can be better to use superglue (<strong>acrylate</strong>-based glues). This takes longer to set, in general, and won't last as long, but can be useful for repairs that won't see much stress or that don't matter too much. Be aware that you can't use superglue on all materials - notably, acrylic won't take well to it.</p>

  <p><strong>Removing overspray</strong>. Adhesive overspray is always better prevented than
  removed. But several common solvents can help clean it off, including
  mineral spirits, turpentine, citrus-based cleaners or 3M™ Adhesive
  Remover. Be sure to follow proper precautionary measures when using
  solvents!</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>On hands</strong>, apply baby oil, cooking or vegetable oil, followed by soap and water.</li>
  <li><strong>On furniture</strong>, use a furniture polish.</li>
  <li><strong>On fabrics and carpet</strong>, first remove as much glue as possible with masking tape. Then dab the surface with a cloth dampened with one of

<p>This will be purely decorative, and given to children, so it needs to have no sharp edges.</p>
","<p>It's worth noting, if you feel like taking a trip to your local hardware store, that they make specialty blades that fit boxcutters. Some of these are designed for laminate.
Most likely, the blades that came in your boxcutter are ok for opening boxes, plastic packagine etc. However, you can buy some designed for cutting laminate, PVC, etc. Look for blades that are thicker and may have a wavy pattern on the edge. These can be especially helpful in working with plastics. The sharper the blade, the less force needed to cut/saw. Like in the kitchen, this is safer than a dull knife that needs lots of force (that ends up slipping into your thumb - Ouch).</p>

<p>Similarly, rather than ""homebrew"" a solution, for under $10 you should be able to find a cutoff wheel for your dremel made for plastic. They often are serrated, and may have holes through the wheel that lighten in.</p>

<p>They are super helpful and will give a great, square cut (often without burrs).</p>

<p>Does holding the pencil in a particular way for particular types of shading result in better outputs? If yes, then please guide how to hold the pencil for different kinds of shading methods.</p>
","<p>Yes and no.</p>

<h2>Standard Tripod</h2>

<p>Assuming you're working on a horizontal plane, such as a flat desktop, you're probably using the standard grip (also known as the writing grip or tripod grip) for your pencil. This grip is good at doing fine detailed work and short strokes. <strong>That makes it very helpful for doing all the methods you mentioned, <em>when the scale is small</em></strong>. That is to say, when the strokes you're making are small and detailed. You can do very fine crosshatching on a very large piece, or do large crosshatching on the same piece. When drawing at an incline, such as on an easel or drafting table, this grip is generally only used for detail work.</p>

<h2>Paintbrush/brush Grip</h2>

<p>This grip has you hold the pencil further up the shaft and along your index finger (see pictures). This grip makes it easier to apply lighter strokes to your piece. <strong>If your shading method requires you to apply strokes of different pressure, this grip may help you more.</strong> Building up your values one ""layer"" of shading at a time is a very common method, used with or without the aid of blending. <strong>The standard grip makes it easy to press too hard, often making the brush grip a better choice for building up value.</strong></p>

<p>You can combine the pressure control with any of the methods you listed. </p>

<h2>Underhand grip</h2>

<p>I call this one underhand, but I've seen it called violin bow grip and also drumstick grip. Basically, you hold the pencil between the tips of your thumb and index finger, but your palm faces up (see picture). </p>

<p><a href=""http://chiseledrocks.com/main/musings/topics/how_to_hold_the_pencil"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The site I used for the picture</a> already has a great explanation of what kinds of shading this is used for:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This grip is <em>the</em> preferable basic drawing grip. It does not need a propped arm, and the motion range is limited only by your arm span; it produces flowing, economical sweeping line and is ideal for rough sketching, <strong>hatching and tonal work with the side of lead</strong>. It works best on big page and a near-vertical plane (paper pinned to board), and is the preferred grip in academic drawing. It enables working with the lead’s side, for darker flowing lines and shading. It cannot be used with Wacom stylus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This really is the best grip for using the side of the lead, especially when you're using a properly-sharpened pencil. <em>Using the side of the lead allows you to lay down varying widths of solid tone. That makes this grip ideal for certain types of blending.</em></p>

<p>This grip also allows you to make fairly detailed hatch/crosshatch marks, although not as detailed as the standard grip. Generally, when you use this grip you keep your wrist stiff and move the pencil with your shoulder and elbow. However, you can flick your wrist to get some consistent, finely detailed lines. </p>

<p>The downside of this grip hinted at in the quote: you can't use it when drawing on a horizontal surface. You need an incline and room for your elbow to move.</p>

<p>You'd find it pretty hard to do detailed work with this grip, or do any sort of stippling/dotting.</p>

"How can I cover a large posterboard with glitter?","744","","<p>I have a 22""x28"" posterboard that I'd like to cover in glitter. What can I use to get the glitter to stick to the posterboard?</p>
","<p>If you want the poster to be solid glitter, not simply speckled, I would use a <strong>spray adhesive</strong>, which is best with large surfaces. It also will not add additional weight or bow the the poster like a liquid or paste glue. </p>

<p>Spray adhesive and glitter are extremely messy. Work outside with plenty of ground cover (I suggest paper) and a large over-spray zone (don't spray near cars, etc.). </p>

<p>I recommend working the entire surface of the poster at once and not in sections. Previously glittered sections will get over-spray and you'll end up with sections of the poster with thicker layers of glitter than others.</p>

<p>The key to doing the whole poster will be to follow the directions on the spray glue can and to get a good solid covering of glue on the entire surface before applying glitter. </p>

<p>You'll need to literally dump a pile of glitter on the sticky poster, pick up the poster and shake the glitter around like you're shifting for gold. When the surface seems covered, turn the poster up facing you and tap the bottom edge a couple of times on the ground to release extra glitter. You should get a good view as to how well it's covered. </p>

<p><strong>Above all</strong>, test your technique! Get a second poster, cut it in quarters, and begin testing your technique until it works the way you want. </p>

"Cleanly extract homemade candle from glass or plastic mold?","737","","<p>I have a melted-crayon decorative candle idea, but I can't figure out the last step.</p>

<p>The concept is based on melting crayons using the sun &amp; foil, to create art or new crayons. </p>

<p>(I don't know if there are different ""types"" of wax. If there are, please advise what type crayons typically are.)</p>
","<p>Wax and Glass have very different rates of thermal expansion. Once the liquid wax has cooled and become solid, and you don't think the glass is at a risk of shattering, I would suggest putting the wax filled mold in the freezer. The wax should just pop loose.

"How can I pre-wash/dry bolts of fabric in a way that will prevent the cut ends from unraveling?","735","","<p>Given large pieces of freshly purchased fabric, how should I wash/dry them before using them to create things?</p>

<p>Every book, article, and other piece of advice I've heard is to always wash your fabric before cutting/sewing. I personally only use natural fabrics (usually cotton, rayon, linen), and look at what the care instructions are for the given fabrics online. </p>

<p>However, I've often had the cut ends of the fabric unravel and get tangled up to turn the large uncut piece into a ball of wet mess. The selvage is normally just fine. </p>

<p>How do I prevent this?  </p>
","<p>To prevent fraying, use a z-stitch (zig-zag stitch) with a standard sewing machine or serge the ends of the fabric before you wash it.</p>

<p>I've recently read a lot of guides about washing fabric before sewing and, while they often disagree about whether washing is necessary or not - generally depending on the type of fabric and the end use, the one thing they pretty much universally agree on if you <strong>are</strong> washing fabric, is that if you want to prevent fraying, stitch the cut ends. Some sites don't seem to be bothered by fraying and recommend simply cutting the strings off afterwards but this seems like a great way to get your fabric tied up in knots.</p>

<p>One <a href=""http://www.madeeveryday.com/2012/05/ask-dana-prewashing-fabrics-and-overwhelmed-with-projects.html"" rel=""nofollow"">guide notes</a> to consider the weave tightness:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, remember that fabrics will fray depending on how tightly they are woven.  Loosely woven fabrics like Linen and some cottons can fray a 1/2 inch or so.  But some cottons and polyesters with a tighter weave might only frizz out on the ends.  And knit fabrics won’t fray at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other common notes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>wash the fabric in large pieces rather than small ones as the small pieces can be sucked into the machine's agitator </li>
<li>wash the fabric in the same method you plan to wash the garment - so (as an example) if you're planning to dry clean your wool, dry clean the fabric rather than machine washing it.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>As a note, with all methods, your results may vary. This quilting site has a forum with a <a href=""http://www.quiltingboard.com/main-f1/prewashing-fraying-t140851.html"" rel=""nofollow"">topic</a> where many quilters are discussing preventing fraying and the results are mixed.</p>

<p>Different methods mentioned include clipping the corners, using pinking shears, sewing/serging, and simply not doing anything at all because fraying is inevitable... so the top suggestion is to always make sure you have extra fabric to allow for losing an inch or two to fraying.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the comments I thought seemed helpful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>auntpiggylpn</strong>: I also tried the ""Clip the Corners"" method and my fabrics still frayed, didn't seem to be any less or more than if I did nothing to the edges. This was also LQS type fabric. I tried the pinking shears trick and it didn't stop the fraying. I've also sewed along the edges prior to washing but it still frayed. Some fabrics don't fray at all and then some others I will loose at least an inch off the total cut. I ALWAYS was in cold on a delicate cycle and only put in the dryer until damp them iron. sorry, I don't have any positive answers for you!! </p>
  
  <p><strong>MaryAnnMc</strong>: I agree, everything I've tried still frays. But I've decided to stick with pinking: it does cut down on the fraying considerably, and I can always tell which fabrics in my stash have been washed. that alone is a good reason. </p>
  
  <p><strong>M.I.Late</strong>:I also just let it fray and just rip off the threads. When I wash fabric, I open it all the way up. I find that some manufacturers don't get it rolled on the bolt completely straight. So, I open it up completely, wash and dry it, refold it so there are no diagonal waves when held selvage to selvage, (I usually lose 1-2 inches here - but it has been as much as 3.) Then I trim it with the rotary cutter and iron it and it gets either used then or stashed for future use. </p>
  
  <p><strong>bearisgray</strong>: I finally learned to either serge the raw edge or overcast the raw edge with a long, narrow zigzag stitch before washing. I lose - at the most - about 1/8 inch of fabric when I zigzag the edges - none when I overcast if I remove the stitching.</p>

","<p>I am not an expert on this subject, by any means, but I can share the information that is available so that you can at least make a more informed decision yourself. Polymer clay, just like most other materials and chemicals, comes with an MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet). This sheet lists all the potential hazards and risks when using the material. All the different types of polymer clay will have their own; however, they are basically very similar. The principal risk associated with polymer clay is that it can release hazardous fumes if it is overheated (hydrogen chloride vapor is one of the vapors). These vapors are irritants and should be avoided. Mainly, you need to make sure you do not overbake or burn the clays. The clay itself is considered non-toxic. </p>

<li>They don't set super fast, which is a pro and con:

<ul>
<li>You can adjust your placement if you make a mistake, and have a fair amount of time to do this</li>
<li>You have to wait until it's 100% set, being careful not to push or slide it around </li>
</ul></li>
<li>They don't have the best sticking power, and items may fall off over time</li>
<li>You can apply it to either the board or the object you're placing very easily</li>
<li>It works best on flat, non-porous surfaces</li>
<li>It can be removed very easily if you accidentally put it somewhere, with a quick wipe of a dry or slighty-moist towel</li>
<li>It comes in colored varieties that dry clear, now, which helps you make sure you've applied it properly</li>
<li>It doesn't wrinkle thin paper as much as liquid glue, if at all</li>

<h2>Liquid glues</h2>

<li>If too much is used, they will bleed through the felt and make it stiff on the opposite side </li>

<li>They dry clear, generally</li>
<li>If you're applying thin materials, like tissue paper, magazine pages or printer paper, then it's very likely to cause some wrinkles</li>
</ul>

<p>Use liquid glues when you want your project to stay together longer, have some time and space to wait for it to dry, or want to use a variety of materials.</p>

<h2>Tape</h2>

<p>I'm assuming Scotch tape/cello tape, for this.</p>

<ul>
<li>It sets instantly! Apply it and you're done.</li>
<li>If you make a mistake placing your object, you have to risk tearing the paper to pull it off ad try again</li>
<li>The sticking power usually depends on the length of tape you apply</li>
<li>You can fold a strip onto itself to create a double-sided tape, so the strips don't show on the outside

<ul>
<li>This takes more time and material and makes the tape easier to remove (a good and bad thing, depending)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The object you're sticking needs to be flat and thin, if applying it from the outside, otherwise it may pull of or not stick at all</li>
<li>It works best on clean edges, and not the kind made with decorate edge scissors, such as zig zags</li>
<li>You can find a variety of similar products, such as <a href=""https://www.cutetape.com/creative/blog/2012/6/what-is-washi-tape"">washi tape</a>, to spruce up your project</li>
<li>It doesn't wrinkle your papers, but you have to avoid getting wrinkles in it</li>
</ul>

<p>Use plain tape when you want something up fast and are willing to risk some tearing (that might end up hidden) on parts of your project and don't mind the obvious appearance of tap when using it on the outside. On the other hand, if you want to add quick, decorative borders, you can use washi tape or other products.</p>

<p>Double-sided tape is available, if you're using it under the object your applying, but it doesn't necessarily have extra sticking power than rolled up regular tape. Yet, it tends to be more expensive. </p>

<p>Another alternative to tape is stickers.</p>

"How can I repair a plaster sculpture?","715","","<p>My current sculpture encountered an accident and the Giraffe lost a leg. </p>

<p>How can I repair the leg? I've got plenty of plaster mix and epoxy, but not sure if applying either will work. </p>

<p>The sculpture was unfinished. I'd prefer a method that allows me to continue finishing its details. </p>
","<p>I would make a slip, made from the same plaster as the model was made from, and use the slip to ""glue"" my two pieces together.</p>

<p>Scoring the inner surface slightly giving the slip a bit of a roughened surface to bind to.</p>

<p>When the two halves are brought together you want to see the slip forced out of the joint. Just wipe off the excess with a damp cloth. </p>

<p>If you don't see the slip being squeezed from the joint then you didn't use enough.</p>

<p>By using the same material to bind the pieces together as what the sculpture was made from you won't have to worry as much about discolouration.</p>

<p>Hard part will be holding the two pieces together while the slip dries.</p>

<p>Don't use masking tape! Masking tape will stain your material.</p>

<p>If you do go the tape route, use a good quality painters tape as you can leave it for hours, or days, and not worry about it leaving any residue behind.</p>

<p>Here's a quick sketch of the steps I would take.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Find a narrow headed screw (such as a flooring screw) and measure its length. We will call that length ""d"".</p></li>
<li><p>Drill a pockets slightly larger than the head of the screw into both halves of the plaster cast to a depth of 1/2 d.</p></li>
<li><p>Fill both drilled pockets with your slip compound.</p></li>
<li><p>Insert the screw into the pocket such that half the length of the screw is sticking out the top of the cast. The part that is sticking out will what will hold the other part of your cast.</p></li>
<li><p>Align and bring together both halves of the broken cast. And squeeze them together. You want to see the slip squeezing out of the joint. If you don't them you did not use enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the pieces are together you can use a damp cloth to wipe the excess slip from the surface.</p></li>
<li><p>Bind the two halves and allow to dry.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not sure how big of a piece we are talking about in your case. If it's a lot smaller then instead of the screw you could use a piece of aluminum wire to act as the screw. Remember to form the wire into a loop at both of its ends. Once the slip dries the loops will be anchored into the dried plaster and keep the two pieces from pulling apart.</p>

"Can air-drying clay projects be preserved?","670","","<p>My son loves making animals and monsters with Play Doh (an air-drying dough). However, his sculptures tend to crumble and deform and crack while drying, which annoys him.</p>

<p>Is there a technique to preserve Play Doh projects that we could try? Or should I help him switch to using different, more durable clays?</p>
","<p>If you're using Play-Doh specifically, Hasbro's FAQ tells you this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Play-Doh compound is designed to use over and over again. If allowed to harden (to preserve a creation) it will most likely crack.</p>
  
  <p>Look for oven curable clay at your local craft stores to make long lasting creations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which isn't helpful, since it essentially says ""you can't"".</p>

<p>However, you can attempt to bake and seal it. Drawing some information from <a href=""http://www.ehow.com/how_8601446_harden-play-dough.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this guide</a>, we can get started.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start by preheating your oven to 200°F or 90°C. Make sure your Play-Doh sculpture is stable, and place it on a sheet of aluminum foil on top of a cookie sheet or something comparable.</p></li>
<li><p>Bake the sculpture for 10&ndash;15 minutes. If you have thicker parts on the sculpture, you'll have to bake for longer.</p></li>
<li><p>I recommend making some test sculpture, like simple tubes, of different thicknesses. By baking these, you can test out how long it takes in your particular oven. You can test if the bake was long enough by breaking the test tube in half and making sure the moisture is gone from the center. </p></li>
<li><p>After it's baked, you'll need to apply a varnish to seal the sculpture. You'll want a product that's water proof, and most will do that. Avoid spray varnishes, because the propellant chemicals may affect the sculpture over time. There are varnishes specifically for sculptures, but some people have had success with sculpture by using clear wood finishes. </p>

<ul>
<li>When you apply the varnish, make sure you get every spot. Use a fine brush to get into crevices. After the first coat dries, go back over to get the bottom of the sculpture and wherever you held it. </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>And that should do it. Of course, I would test it with a lump, first, to make sure the varnish you're using doesn't result in a sticky texture or soften the Play-Doh as you apply it.</p>

","<p><strong><em>Maybe, but it's probably not a good idea.</em></strong></p>

<hr>

<p>For one thing, the package says not to do it. The manufacturer isn't just saying that because they want you to buy a toaster oven -- putting it in the microwave will result in burning.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because microwaves don’t heat evenly, parts of the mass will begin to
  cure and harden while others remain soft. Microwave ovens heat the
  inside of clay just as much as the outside, so as the cooking
  continues, parts of the mass will begin to superheat, melt, and
  actually bubble and boil while other parts of the polymer clay mass
  will merely begin to harden.<br>

<p>Not only will that ruin the project, it releases fumes which at best smell terrible, and at worst can cause respiratory distress and damage. For health and safety reasons, you shouldn't microwave polymer clay on its own.</p>

<p>Some crafters do say you can microwave polymer clay as long as it is completely submerged in water. Basically, this is boiling the item to heat it and cure it, but in a microwave rather than on a stovetop.<br>

<p>But, some crafters say you still shouldn't -- the quality of the final piece will suffer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some people advocate using a microwave to boil water which contains
  the polymer clay. The problem with this is that ... boiling water
  never heats above 212°F (100°C) ... [below] the proper curing
  temperatures of most brands of polymer clay. While you may find that
  the item is hard after boiling, it will be incompletely cured and will
  be weak and easily broken. (This is true for stove-top curing as
  well.) Some brands of polymer clay will get an icky white residue when
  boiled... I think there’s room for experimentation there, but it’s
  very difficult to control the amount of heat the items would be

<p>I am drawing it in one point perspective. </p>

<p>How do I determine exactly where to draw the back wall? As in, how far back.</p>

","<p>This solution will work any shape of room you have. Cubic, rectangular (as I demonstrate), and even rooms you aren't looking at from straight on (in which case you rotate the top elevation, a common perspective technique).</p>

<p>Click on any image for a larger view.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Layout the general lines. </p>

<ul>
<li>a) You need three horizontal lines: your horizon line, a ground line (somewhere below the horizon), and a vantage line. In this example, my vantage line is below the ground line. <strong>The vantage line represents the distance of the viewer from the horizon.</strong>  </li>
<li>b) You also need to choose a <strong>vanishing point</strong> somewhere on the horizon line.</li>
<li>c) You can pick a vantage point, but in this case its only purpose is to establish where to put vantage line</li>
<li>d) Draw the <strong>front elevation</strong> of your room, with the scale dimensions. The front elevation needs to rest its <em>bottom</em>-most line (or point, if rotated for 2-point perspective) on the Ground Line</li>
<li>e) Draw the <strong>top elevation</strong> of your room, with the scale dimensions. The top elevation needs to be under the Vantage Line, with its <em>top</em>-most line (or point, if rotated for 2-point perspective) on the Vantage Line.  </li>
<li>f) Draw the front view of your room, aligned with both the front and top elevations

</ul></li>
<li><p>The real trick to this technique is mapping the angles between corners to the <strong>Measuring Points</strong> on the Horizon Line.</p>

<ul>
<li>a) From a bottom corner of your top elevation, draw a line going through the <em>opposite</em> corner (such as bottom-left to top-right) and continue that line all the way to the Horizon Line</li>
<li>b) Where those lines intersect, mark that point as a Measuring Point</li>

<li><p>Draw your normal perspective lines on your room</p>

<li>a) Don't worry about the back wall quite yet, just make sure your perspective lines go either all the way to the vanishing point, or far enough that you can be reasonably sure you have room for your back wall<br>

</ul></li>
<li><p>Now the technique comes into play. You'll use the Measuring Points to map a <strong>projection</strong> to tell you where the back wall begins</p>

<ul>
<li>a) From a bottom corner of your perspective room, draw a line to the matching Measuring Point. So, if you pick the bottom-right corner, draw a line towards the Measuring Point that connects to the bottom-right corner of your top elevation. </li>
<li>b) Where this new line intersects your normal floor perspective lines represents the corner of your back wall.</li>
<li>c) You don't need to map the other bottom corner, unless you're drawing a room/shape that doesn't have parallel front and back walls</li>
<li>d) Draw a horizontal line from the back corner you measured to the other side of the floor<br>

"How to start a pencil portrait without using an outline of features?","610","","<p>I enjoy drawing head portraits in pencil, but I've found that sketching an outline of the prominent features often lead me astray. For example, due to shadows my eye is sometimes approximating the feature boundaries. This then impacts shading, and may lead to an amateurish feel and mean having to rework large portions of the piece.</p>

<p>Most of the best portraits I've seen are not necessarily precise but instantly identifiable as the person and also capture their 'look'.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to start the portrait than trying to capture the outline of the features? Should I be trying to plot the shadows/shapes or start in detail in one area and work out?</p>
","<p>I would begin by constructing the form and mass of the head, as often seen in figure drawing construction:</p>

<sup>Images from Andrew Loomis's ""Drawing the Head and Hands"". Loomis is a very well-known figure artist and illustrator with a variety of instructional books that are very helpful.</sup></p>

<p>This construction, in drawing from the mind, is usually done by understanding some sort of system of proportions and then altering features to add character. Proportions would compare head height to width, or divide head height into sections to place features (seen in the images above), but it can get much more complex.</p>

<p>By understanding these general relationships of constructing a figure, you begin to see how real heads and faces compare and vary. </p>

<p>One popular method of achieving this development of form is called <strong>blocking-in</strong>. You can see a quality example of <a href=""http://georgetownatelier.com/tutorials/introductory-tutorials/color-temperaturefigure-drawing-part-3/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blocking-in using the Atelier method</a> at <a href=""http://georgetownatelier.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GeorgetownAtelier.com</a>. <sub>Depiction of bust of bare derriere in spoiler block, from that website.</sub></p>

</blockquote>

<p>You can start your base block-in similar to drawing an initial outline. But, instead of just focusing on the silhouette, think about the form in 3D. The outline will guide you on the proportions to use as you develop your other planes and shapes.</p>

<p>Then slowly add details, keeping your sketch light. You can measure placements of features, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where is the top arch of the eyebrow compare to the ears?</li>
<li>If you draw a straight vertical line on the side of the nostril wing, how far is the corner of the eye? (Or vice-versa)</li>
<li>Compared to the length of the nose, what's the distance between the tip of the nose to the bottom of the chin?</li>
<li>What degree of angle is it from the outside corner of the eye to the tip of the nose?</li>
<li>If you draw a straight vertical line on corner of the mouth, how does it compare to the center of the eye?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are pretty limited examples. The key to getting an accurate portrait of a real person is by getting the proportions and placements correct for <em>their</em> anatomy.

"Keep yarn slack from developing in my work as I perform a basic knit stitch","608","","<p>I am a very novice knitter trying to do a small blanket with a basic knit stitch. I am working with 100% cotton yarn and I have 16 inch bamboo needles. I cast on fine and where I am getting stuck is on the knit stitch. I do the first stitch and as I pull the loop onto the second needle I develop this slack in my piece. between the two needles that worsens with each stitch. </p>

<p>How do I fix this? </p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong></p>

<p>Please see  the image below, I am developing slack after the first stitch that grows with each iteration. I have just pulled the loop off my non working needle. I make my loops fairly tight as well so I do not think the slack is coming from there. After I put my working needle through the leg in the knit direction I pull the thread through and I tighten the thread going towards my yarn ball. </p>

<p>I am beginner but this is preventing me from even getting a scrap knit together let alone a real project. </p>

<p>On the topic of yarn and needle size, I have really long needles and made the amateur move of just grabbing a set and throwing out the wrapping so I cannot give you a diameter either. The yarn brand is Sugar 'n Cream 100% cotton, it does not list a needle size on the package. </p>

<p>Thank you for the advice thus far... I am determined to get something going eventually. </p>

","<p>From the image you've shown it looks like you're on the first row of knitting after casting on, and it also looks like you've used a loop (a.k.a. backwards loop) cast-on method.</p>

<p>It's common to get an ever-increasing amount of slack on the first row when using this kind of cast-on. A loop cast-on is easy to do, but hard to do well because the tension used when casting on is fiddly. If you keep knitting this piece the knit stitches will even out, but they might not even out completely.</p>

<p>I recommend starting with a long tail cast-on. It will take a little longer to get the hang of, but you won't have the slack problem.</p>

","<p>These charcoal pencils are just a demonstration of the styles of pencil you might encounter.</p>

<p><strong>Wooden Coated Charcoal</strong></p>

<p>The first pencil, labeled ""soft"" is a softer charcoal pencil, coated in wood. Wooden charcoal pencils are generally cheaper and require a sharp blade (ex exacto knife) to sharpen them. They would not easily sharpen in a traditional pencil sharpener as the charcoal is so soft that a regular sharpener would grind and break the charcoal during the sharpening process.</p>

<p><strong>Paper Coated Charcoal</strong></p>

<p>The second pencil is coated in paper. Paper coated pencils are generally more expensive, but provide the ease of being able to reveal more of the charcoal by simply pulling the string and unraveling the paper rather than sharpening the pencil with a blade. The 600-H identification on the pencil is just Prang's model number for that pencil and means nothing with respect to the charcoal grade.</p>

<p><strong>White Charcoal</strong></p>

<p>The 558 is General's line of white charcoal pencil and, like the 600-H is proprietary to the company and has no real meaning with respect to the charcoal. </p>

<p>White charcoal is obviously different from black charcoal but is used in much the same way, but in reverse. White charcoal is a great way to come back after the work is finished to really bring out highlights and shines to be a ""whiter than white"" which brings contrast and boldness to an image.</p>

<p>White charcoal <a href=""http://vitruvianstudio.com/what-the-heck-is-white-charcoal/"" rel=""noreferrer"">really isn't charcoal at all</a>, but a type of pastel or Conté, often chalky and meant to be used with charcoal. It can be made from mixing white pigment with some type of binder, but the exact makings are generally proprietary and not disclosed. </p>

"Which glue should be used for adhering thin paper?","595","","<p>I frequently make cards for my friends and family instead of purchasing them, which I very much enjoy, but the bane of my existence is gluing all the pieces together. It is always a struggle to decide which glue to use.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> in this context, thin paper means sketching or drawing paper, construction paper and tissue paper.</p>

<h2>A synopsis of my glue usage:</h2>

<p>Glue sticks leave awkward bumps unless they go on perfectly smooth (which they never do) and they eventually dry up ad stop adhering, so I don't really like using them. </p>

<p>Basic white craft glue is what I use the most often and I spread it thin with a popsicle stick to eliminate big soggy patches. This works really well for thicker paper like cardstock, but cannot be used for anything lighter weight</p>

<p>Spray glue is something I love in concept, but hate in actual applications. I find that spraying for even a second longer than you should causes the glue to soak through the paper so both sides end up super sticky... which sucks. And there is a lot of prep work (laying down newspaper or standing outside in the  cold)</p>

<p>Hot glue does not work well when making cards because the card gets too lumpy and thick, so they don't fit well inside envelopes. </p>

<p><strong>The Question:</strong></p>

<p>Is there a glue that is best suited for thin paper so that it does not get soggy or lumpy?</p>
","<p>To be honest it sounds like you might be being a bit heavy handed with all of the adhesives you mention it is often the case with adhesives that less is more. </p>

<p>White glue : you will get the most control if you apply it with a brush, if you just squirt it onto the paper and then spread it around it will soak though. You could try getting some cheap nylon brushes (the flat type are best) and use the glue from a small pot rather then direct from the tube and keep a piece of scrap card to make a few strokes with the brush onto to make sure that the glue is evenly distributed on the brush and take off any excess. You only need a really thin film to get a good joint, ideally it should be thin enough to look  transparent rather than white. </p>

<p>Spray Mount : again you only need a very light mist for it to work, try spraying from further away and just use one quick pass over the paper. </p>

<p>Another option is double sided tape, this tends to be a very neat and clean solution although there is a bit more effort involved in cutting it to the right shape. Usually the best approach for complex shapes is to apply it to what you want to stick before you cut it out so you cut the cutout and the tape at the same time (obviously leave the backing on the reverse side while you do this. </p>

"What are other techniques to draw a circle besides using or mimicking a compass tool?","568","","<p>I would like to draw circles and ellipses more accurately without relying on a compass (or spinning my paper around). This seems like a simple google-searchable question, but most of the results are flooded with click-bait ""amazing circle drawing trick!"" results.</p>

<p>How do you draw a near-perfect circle without using or mimicking a compass?</p>
","<p>I do not know whether you see a pin and a bit of string as a compass mimicking method, it is likely a very old alternative.</p>

<p>You can do elipses by using two pins and a bit of string.</p>

<p>Or you an use circular items and draw a line around it, just like you draw a straight line along a ruler.<br>
There are special tools which have a series of circular holes to allow to make quickly draw several sizes of circles, if you search on -circle template ruler- you will see several different options. <a href=""https://i2.wp.com/www.draftingsuppliesdew.com/resize/images/RapidDesign/40R.jpg?lr=t&amp;bw=800&amp;bh=800"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Here is a link to a commercial site which shows one.)</a></p>

<p>The best method without any tools is training.<br>
The more you do it, the better you will become.<br>
Sit with a piece of paper in front of you and draw as many circles as you can, look critical and try to improve.</p>

<p>There are several methods of drawing which may work for you.<br>
One is one flowing line, no options to improve once started but a very strong result when done right.<br>
A second one is to build up the circle from tiny fragments. Like for a circle with 10 cm/4"" diameter you draw little lines about 1 cm/ 1/2"" long and overlap them at least one third, maybe two thirds. With this method you can stop and consider, re-adjust and change the shape while working on it. Even in the best outcome it will not show as strong as the single line approach but I find it an easier way to get near the perfect circle. (I never really get it right out of hand, I prefer the computer to make perfect circles for me.)<br>
Maybe it will help you to have a perfect circle of about the right size near while training yourself to draw one. This can be any simple item which is circular. Samples include coins, saucers, tops or bottoms of glasses or even the rings left by a wet glas and so on.</p>

<p>An other training exercise might be that you use a circle made by one of the mechanical ways (compass tool or drawn around an object, or again the ring left by a glass) and draw your training circle around or inside (or both and several on each 'side'.)</p>

<p>Some people will be able to draw almost perfect circles by hand, without much training, others will never learn it. You have to try to find out how good you are.</p>

"How can I smoothly flatten select parts of a wire design?","565","","<p>I have seen some simple jewelry designs made out of wire, which I'd like to replicate. These designs are made from a single piece of wire bent into a variety of shapes.</p>

<p>For portions of the design, the wire is still perfectly round. However, some parts are smoothly flatted. By smoothly, I mean that there are no creases or hammer marks.</p>

<p>Here's an example of what I'm describing:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dWfJSm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dWfJSm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>How can I achieve this effect? Can I use steel wire, or does it need to be something softer, such as aluminum wire?</p>
","<p>The flat parts of the wire are achieved by using a <em>curved face chasing hammer</em> and a <em>hammering block</em>. The chasing hammer has a slightly convex surface that makes those nice smooth transitions from the flat part of the wire to the regular rounded part of the wire. <em>If the hammer surface is too flat you'll see hammer marks on the wire</em>. Visually check the hammer face before buying to make sure that it is convex (slightly domed) and not fully flat or worse, concave.  </p>

<p>Here's what one looks like:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FHogvm.jpg""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FHogvm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> </p>

<p>The [my] hammering block is a smooth square of heavy steel about 4"" x 4"" square and quite heavy. The goal is to have a heavy and very smooth surface that's harder than the wire or metal being hammered so the surface doesn't get marked up opposite the side being hammered. </p>

<p>Steel wire is very hard to hammer and may be as hard or harder than the hammering block. Aluminum wire might be softer but I've heard it's brittle and might not take hammering well. Most of my experience has been with sterling silver, fine silver, brass, and copper. </p>

<p>The example photo is lovely but I was taught that it wasn't a good idea to hammer where wires cross as this makes weak spots in the finished piece. Maybe something has changed. </p>

"How should I store my nibs for long periods?","565","","<p>I'm looking to replace some nibs I ruined, and in the meantime I need to store what's left for a while. </p>

<p>How should I go about preparing them for storage? Is there a difference between storing cartridge pen and dip pen nibs I should know? </p>
","<p>There are a couple of things you need to consider <em>before</em> we look at storage options. </p>

<h1>Ensure your nibs are clean</h1>

<p>When you are done using your nibs you should ensure that you medium is removed and clean before you store it. Most people suggest just using <em>room temperature</em> water or more specifically distilled water (that would have less mineral build up that would being stuck inside the workings of the pen). Ink is obviously easier to clean before it has set.</p>

<p>More on this from <a href=""http://www.levenger.com/maintaining-a-fountain-pen-1216.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Levenger.com</a></p>

<h1>Rust and corrosion</h1>

<p>Remember that rust begets rust. You want to be sure that the nibs / cartridge nibs are free of rust before you go to store them. This is especially true if you intend to store your nibs together in close proximity. Enough rust will render the nib useless.</p>

<p><strong>Baking Soda Paste</strong> </p>

<p>For simple surface rust you can make a paste from baking soda and water and use a toothbrush to gently work the surface to remove the rust. Again, using water to clean the surface one done. </p>

<p>There are more tactics to removing rust, like vinegar or a molasses bath, but given that there are hard to restore if the rust is bad you should only have to worry about simple surface rust. </p>

<h1>Storage</h1>

<p>One area where people seem a little divided is on storage of nibs. Particularity when it comes to storing nibs together where they can touch or completely segregated from each other. </p>

<p>Storage options are numerous. Some styles worth mentioning</p>

<ul>
<li>Simple tins cans (think Altoids)</li>
<li>Small plastic containers. These are favoured as you can store the nibs vertically. This is done, in theory, to prevent ink build up on the split and tip. </li>
<li>Tackle box / craft box. Any partitioned storage box really. Multiple nibs that are related to each other are stored together. Since the partitions are configurable or at least different sizes your cartridges would fit in here as well as your pens. </li>
<li>Cardboard. If you like keeping the nibs separate then this would be a preferred method as each nib would get its own slot. As long as you can keep the board itself in a safe location this also prevents the nibs from moving around which could damage the tips.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other storage considerations</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Cut up small straw lengths that you can either feed down the split (If you have to force it don't do it.) or place on the tip for additional protection. </li>
<li>Silica gel packets: You save these right? If humidity is an issue for your storage then consider sticking in one or two of these in with your nibs. It will help keep a moisture, and therefore rust, free environment.</li>
<li>If your are fine with storing nibs together make sure at least they cannot come into contact with anything heavier or harder than themselves. </li>

"What is the difference between linen and cotton canvas?","561","","<p>I am painting in oils, and I normally paint on cotton canvas. I've often wondered what the difference is between cotton and linen canvases - linen canvases appear to have a slightly different texture, but is there anything else that differentiates them?</p>
","<p>From <a href=""http://www.winsornewton.com/na/discover/tips-and-techniques/other-tips-and-techniques/difference-between-canvas-and-linen"" rel=""nofollow"">Understanding the difference canvas and linen</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Canvas can mean different things to different people. In the context of painting, the word ‘canvas’ means a fabric used as a painting surface. The difference is that sometimes the canvas is made from cotton fibres and other times from linen fibres. Each material is worth looking at in more detail.</p>
  
  <h2>Cotton</h2>
  
  <p>Cotton is a soft, fluffy fibers that grows in a boll or protective capsule around the seeds of cotton plants. The plant is native to the Americas, Africa and India and is most often spun into yarn or thread to create a soft, breathable textile - the chances are you are wearing some cotton right now.</p>
  
  <p>The advantage of cotton to you as an artist is that it is affordable and it stretches very easily. A properly prepared cotton canvas will last a long time and is the most popular surface for oil and acrylic painting, especially for students, although it is considered too flexible for very large paintings. It is classified according to its weight and surface texture.</p>
  
  <p>When it comes to tightness, cotton comes out on top. It is possible to stretch cotton tighter than linen without straining the wooden support around the canvas, and a heavy-grade cotton can make up for its lack of strength and weight.</p>
  
  <h2>Linen</h2>
  
  <p>Linen is strong and durable, and remains the preferred surface for many artists but it is expensive. It is made from the fibers of the flax plant and top quality flax is harvested mainly in Western Europe. If you want your painting to last then a linen canvas is a sound investment. The threads that make up linen, known as the warp and weft threads, weigh the same, which means they are less prone to expansion or contraction due to moisture. </p>
  
  <p>Linen retains its natural oils, which helps to preserve the fibre’s flexibility and stops the canvas from going brittle. It is also regarded as having a more ‘natural’ weaved finish than cotton – a variety of textures and weights are available in both rough and smooth finishes.</p>
  
  <p>Because of its strength linen holds up to a heavy painting hand and does not become slack as easily as cotton canvas.""</p>

<p>Is there a tool I can use to easily make perforations instead?</p>
","<p>A sewing machine without thread does a great job at making a perforation in most paper. Depending on the settings it can be rather coarse, or quite fine. Much of this will depend on what stitch types your machine is capable of. I would not use your nicest needle however, as it will most likely wear prematurely.</p>

<p>With modern scanners, cameras and digital editors, do I still need to have a non-photo blue pencil in my artist's armory?</p>
","<p>Modern scanners, cameras, and digital editors pick up the non-photo blue pencil marks that earlier scanners did not. However, this color is still easily removed from the scanned image by switching to grey scale and altering the brightness and contrast. You could do this with another colored pencil pretty easily as well.</p>

<p>The answer to your question depends on what type of scanner and what type of digital art programs you use. If you have a modern scanner with a modern digital art program (Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.) you could likely achieve the same result with a normal colored pencil, as long as it was different from your final inking color. </p>

I then wind up having to glue them all back on all over again. I don't want to have to just glue a couple on then wait anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes or more before I can glue anymore on. Sometimes I have to sit and hold on one leaf at a time until it dries enough so that it doesn't slip out of place or come off all together. </p>

","<p>Given your time and store restraints, I would agree with your choice of a rattle-can/spray can of matte clear coat.  I don't know the brands well enough to recommend one over another.</p>

<p>There is the potential that the clear coat will reactivate the frosted coats, even if they are thoroughly dried and cured.  So apply very light coats from twice the recommended distance and allow each coat to dry before adding the next.  If the frosted coat does reactivate, it will mix with the clear coat and thus dilute or distort the frost.  The less of the clear coat you apply in each protective coat, the less chance of ruining your artwork.</p>

<p>It might be wise to frost up another piece of plastic and after it dries, test the clear coat on it before risking your art.</p>

<p>If you had more time, an art supply shop (or Hobby Lobby), and an airbrush, you would have more options.  Createx Airbrush paints has a product called Intercoat  which would be perfect for this situation.  It provides a non-reactivating layer to protect your existing artwork from the solvents in any paint or clear coat which you might apply over them.  Spraying a layer of Intercoat over your frost paint would lock it in place, allowing you to add a matte clear coat without any risk of reactivation.</p>

","<p>That was made by a triple needle chain stitch machine.  You can tell it was done in one pass with a triple needle machine because the holes align perfectly along the length of the stitch (making it very likely they were all formed at the same time).</p>

<p>You can tell it's a chain stitch (as opposed to a lock stitch, which a typical household sewing machine makes) by the way the stitches are formed on the back.  Another common place to see chain stitches in your house is on jeans.</p>

<p>The main advantage of chain stitching (and the reason it is used in commercial applications like this) is that it doesn't require a bobbin.  A home sewing machine is a <em>lock stitch</em> machine, which means the top thread is twisted around a bottom thread by passing over the bobbin on each stitch.  The bobbin is limited in size because the top thread has to go around it.  A chain stitch machine can sew much longer without interruption.</p>

<p>In particular, I think I see three threads on the back, which is a double chain stitch.  Those extra threads don't actually add any strength.  More the opposite -- chain stitches can easily be unraveled if the thread breaks, just like pulling apart a row of knitting.</p>

<p>If you want to recreate that seam, just sew three times with your home machine on straight stitch.  You won't be able to recreate the stitch length (your home machine just won't make stitches that long), which will cause a bit of extra puckering (shortening along the seam).</p>

<p>By far more important than exactly what stitch you use is to use a good bonded polyester thread or an outdoor item like a hammock will fall apart when the thread rots.</p>

<p>(If you want to see an industrial machine that could do this, Google something like ""triple needle six thread chain stitch"".  Six threads because it's a double chain stitch.)</p>

","<p>The thinness you are seeing is that your pen is dispensing more of the inks suspension medium than its pigment particles. Ink is made up of particles suspended in a medium. It's the separation of particles from medium that is causing the ""transparency"" of your inked line. Over time , as the ink sits stationary, the heavier particles settle to the bottom and the lighter elements float to the top. Think of it as a paint can that has been sitting for a long time and needs to be stirred before use. In your case it sounds like your pen has been sitting in the same position for long enough for your ink's components to have separated and settled. Before using your pen try shaking it for a few minutes. The shaking with help re-mix the components of your ink and the pen will dispense the right amount of pigment suspended in medium based on the pens design.</p>

","<p>There are green areas in the photo though they are not bold. </p>

<p>Maybe your solution would be not to fade but juxtapose bold colors.</p>

<p>Yet, if you want to fade, painting by layers will have a cleaner mix than impasto (glaze a very thin blue over the yellow). Also you could use dots of each color next to each other for a vibrant optical blending (like impressionism or pointism).</p>

<p>Else, first fade the colors toward grey before fading. </p>

<p>One of the ways to unsaturated the colors is going into non complementary biases, like fade from a Blue-green (Cyan, phtalo, Prussian), into a Blue-red (Ultramarine, Cobalt), fade that to a Yellow-Red (Azo, Cadmium) then a Yellow-Green (Lemon Yellow, Aureoline). The intermediary color will be greenish but muted. </p>

<p>Another way is to use ocres and earth tones (transitioning with a Venitian or Yellow Ocre, or muting the green color with Green-Earth or greenish brown paint), another way is to use opposite colors to mute the intermediary color (I.e. mute the green with a glaze of red).</p>

","<p>From my knitting experience, the empirical way to find out would be a swatch - make N stitches, then rip it out. Measure how much thread you used and divide by N to get a rough estimate of thread per stitch.</p>

<p>If you want to calculate it from first principles, you also need to take into account the fabric count. For example, 14-count Aida has 14 holes per inch. That means each ""X"" is made inside a block which is 1/14"" on each side. So the diagonal of the square is then <code>sqrt(2)/14</code> inches, so an X is <code>2 * sqrt(2)/14</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, you aren't just stitching the front of the ""X"". This is where the way you arrange stitches makes a difference. You may want to adjust this based on your method, but for contiguous areas I usually end up with a couple horizontal lines on the back. This corresponds to another 2/14"" of thread (edges of the square your ""X"" is stitched into).</p>

<p>Putting it all together, for a fabric count <code>C</code> and number points <code>N</code>:</p>

<pre><code>N * (2*sqrt(2)/C + 2/C)

"How can I block acrylic / wool blend yarn?","436","","<p>My understanding is that one should block 100% wool by soaking in hot water and reshaping to dry, which will felt the fibers enough to keep its shape. Acrylic, on the other hand, does not felt, so instead you steam-block it and/or ""kill"" the fibers (ever-so-slightly melt them together) by holding an iron at a distance, so that it does not <em>completely</em> melt the yarn.</p>

<p>What if I am knitting with a blend of wool and acrylic? Assume this is a wearable article that I would like to remain soft.</p>

<p>(Steam blocking for wool is another method I've seen, but since this is done by placing the iron directly on a sheet/towel on the yarn, rather than holding it at a distance as for acrylic, I'm assuming that would not be a good idea for a blend.)</p>

<p>Some sub-questions I have about this:</p>

<ul>
<li>How does the fiber content (say, 25% wool vs. 50/50 vs. 75% wool) affect what method(s) to use, and the result?</li>
<li>Is the acrylic method of steam blocking (from a distance) effective on wool?</li>
<li>Are there other blocking techniques that would work on both types?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Data point: I successfully blocked a mixed-fiber scarf by soaking in warm water! It was made of fingering weight yarn, content: 75% superwash merino / 25% nylon.</p>

<p>For an arbitrary mixture, the safest method would definitely be to make a test swatch and see how it responds... but since I don't always swatch, the next best thing is to try blocking in order of least to most potential for damage.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Block by soaking and letting dry</strong><br>
This will only be effective on the natural fibers in the yarn. This will <em>not</em> have any effect on the plastic fibers, but will not damage them either. In my case - 75% natural fiber - this was sufficient to retain the shape.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Steam block</strong><br>
This will affect both types of fibers, so it should be effective. The danger here is that you over-heat and melt the plastic fibers. This is permanent! So I would only use this if the previous step did not work, and on low heat. Wool and other natural fibers won't be damaged by that either.</p></li>

I'd like to leaf part of my phone case, which is a flexible matte plastic. Will the adhesive stick to it? I would test if I could, but I unfortunately only have the one case. </p>

  <li>high elasticity</li>
  <li>transparency</li>

  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I am using ArtMinds gold leaf.</p>
","<p>I've never tried to gild a phone case before, so take this with a grain of salt...</p>

<p>I would suggest using the same methods you'd use for exterior gilding: prime the surface with several layers of primer, sanding in between; apply an exterior-grade gold size (also called ""oil size"" or ""solvent-based size""); wait for the size to dry to the appropriate level of tackiness; apply the metal leaf; after a bit more drying, brush off any loose gold; after allowing the size to <em>fully</em> cure (could take a week or more), apply a sealer to prevent tarnishing.</p>

<p>If you don't want to go to such extremes (trying to buy oil size in quantities small enough for your purposes would probably be difficult), it might be sufficient to use primer + your existing gold adhesive (probably PVA-type) + leaf + varnish/sealer. For the primer, try to find a paint that's specifically meant for plastic: you want something that's guaranteed to stick to the plastic, and then your gold adhesive will stick to the paint (or at least it should), and then the metal leaf will stick to the gold adhesive, and then (after everything has cured as fully as it ever will, but before oxidation has set in) seal the metal leaf both to protect it from abrasion and to prevent tarnishing.</p>

<p>Regardless of what specific steps you follow, you may end up with a phone case that's noticeably thicker than it was before. Make sure to mask off any areas that shouldn't get thicker, i.e. any prongs/thingamabobs that make the case stay on the phone, the inside of the case, the holes for the camera/power cord/headphones/switches and buttons, etc.</p>

<p>The other caveat is that, unlike IKEA furniture, your phone case is probably not flat. This means that you will be gilding around a curve, which is more difficult than just covering a rectangular flat area. You <em>will</em> end up with gaps, and even after doing your best to fill them in, you'll see the seams, and some gaps will just be too small to fill but not small enough to be invisible. (This is where genuine gold leaf would make things easier: it will stick to itself, allowing you to fill in gaps totally invisibly.) Depending on the effect you want to achieve, choose your primer and/or adhesive color to either contrast with the gold (a red Armenian bole color is traditional for this) or blend in as much as possible (i.e. yellow).</p>

<li>For some models (mostly the organic-looking ones), wet folding can allow very smooth lines to be folded. This is sometimes combined with scoring the paper using your fingernails. Daniel Chang uses such a technique for folding his realistic human faces.</li>
<li>Robert J. Lang famously uses a laser tool to score the crease pattern into the paper. I was able to fold from such paper in one of his workshops and the scored line looks a row of tiny perforations which weaken the paper and guide your hand when you fold along the line.</li>

"What is a split primary palette?","417","","<p>I'm looking at building out a gouache palette and I came across the term ""split primary"" palette. What is that and why would I want to have that?</p>
","<p>A split primary color palette is a slight derivation of the artist primary color palette, which is composed of <strong>red, yellow and blue</strong>. The <em>split</em> comes from taking those three colors and splitting them into warm and cool versions. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.drawingandpaintinglessons.com/Painting-Lessons/Split-Primary-Colors.cfm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AKM9Zm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>
<sup>Click for source website</sup></p>

<p>As in the example above, the palette is often visualized with strong lines splitting the primary colors. The rest of the palette is developed by mixing the colors that are in the same divisional section. The ""formula"" comes out to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Warm Yellow + Warm Red -> Orange Secondary</li>
<li>Cool Yellow + Cool Blue -> Green Secondary</li>
<li><p>Warm Blue + Cool Red -> Purple Secondary</p>

<p>If you try mixing across these lines, such as Warm Red + Warm Blue, the pigment interaction can cause the colors to become washed out or muddy. The same is true with your Secondaries. Don't mix your Purple with your Cool Blue. Sticking to the formula above and only mixing colors in the same 1/3rd sections keeps colors looking bright and intense. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here's an example that shows how crossing the boundaries creates muddy colors (the center 3 colors):</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.huevaluechroma.com/062.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xhMiKm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>
<sup>Click for source website</sup></p>

<p>Aside from more vibrant colors, this type of palette allows you to more easily mix a full spectrum of colors. This is in part because the <strong>Cool Blue, Cool Red, and Cool Yellow are closer in value to Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow</strong>, the Subtractive Primaries (as seen in CMYK color standards). CMYK works better for mixing paint, because the paint gets its colors from pigment which ""absorbs"" light (and only reflects back the wavelength we perceive). The absorption is where the term subtractive comes into play. </p>

<p>From a physics standpoint, when you mix colors across your splits, you're mixing pigments that end up absorbing more wavelengths, instead of just more of the same wavelengths. For instance: </p>

<ul>
<li>Warm Red reflects back Red, which is Magenta + Yellow, meaning it absorbs Cyan.  </li>
<li>Warm Blue reflects back something closer to Cyan, which means it absorbs Magenta + Yellow. </li>
</ul>

<p>So, if you combine those two together you have a color that absorbs Cyan <em>and</em> Magenta <em>and</em> Yellow, which is why it leaves you with a muddy brown or black (depending on your paint). Here's a diagram I made that shows this a little more clearly by comparing it directly to CMYK:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yn6a9.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yn6a9.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Notice how the Cool Yellow and Cool Red mix to make something closer to Red? And then mixing that with the Cool Blue leads to brown (pretty dark here, but compare it to the black center in the CMY set).</p>

<p>The additional benefit to using this type of palette is that it helps train you to naturally understand how mixing RBY/CMY works as you practice, while helping you avoid those mixes that lead to dim, muddied colors. As a plus, it could also save you some money by avoiding wasted paint!</p>

"How can I cleanly cut the inside of a paper on a different angle?","410","","<p>Here's an issue that I've always faced when trying to cut something.</p>

<p>Generally, when cutting a piece of paper with scissors, it goes on well. I cut a straight line. When I have to change the direction of the line, it becomes difficult. Often, I'm not able to continue the line perfectly, as I now have this ""Y"" shaped cut with one that just finishes. Here's an image to demonstrate.</p>

<p>While cutting: I'm changing the direction of the cut here.</p>

<p>Is there a way to stop these ""Y""s? Any tips or techniques to prevent that, or stop it altogether? I'm hoping not to bend the paper just to get the end if I don't have to as well.</p>
","<p>Using scissors, as you have pictured, would be a contributing factor here. Using a craft knife or something similar would most certainly be the go-to tool. </p>

<p>It is important to try to do the cutting in one motion - to not lift the blade from the paper and, if possible, not change the pressure you are exerting on the scissors. So if you were cutting this on a mat (without scissors of course), when you need to change direction you can rotate the paper accordingly. Craft knives have fine points so turning it is not likely to damage too much. </p>

<p>In the case of the specific Y, using a craft knife, I would also consider the starting point of the cuts to be the intersection shown and then cut away from that point. That approach is more case-by-case and really is dependent on your overall design. </p>

<p>If you insist on using scissors, the only tip I have to offer is to try and keep cutting as you are turning the paper. Try and finish the whole cut in one motion of the scissors. That would help stop the start of a tear. Hands and the tool itself can make that hard.</p>

"How to keep scratch art paper clean and free of pencil and eraser marks?","400","","<p>I was introduced to scratch-art in high school and have loved it ever since. The problem I repeatedly encounter is in keeping the surface of the paper unmarked where I want it to remain black. I have tried a number of solutions as far as a storage is concerned, like keeping it between two pieces of paper and even buying a folder carrier for my projects to keep them protected. I don't wear jewellery when I work and that helps a lot.</p>

<p>I find though, that my faint pencil sketch I do before starting often shows up and is difficult to erase. the pencil is very shiny and reflects a lot more light than the paper does. The eraser makes more ugly marks than the pencil does. Further, I haven't figured out what to do if I do make a mistake. </p>

<p>Does anyone have tips for preventing ugly marks on scratchboard paper or fixing them once they've occurred?</p>

<p><strong>Use black colored pencil instead of regular pencil.</strong>— it isn't as reflective as regular pencil, so you will just barely be able to see it while you're working.</p>

<p><strong>Paint over the nicks/stray pencil marks</strong>— If you paint over the scratches and stray pencil marks with ink, it will probably cover it up and not show.  You should try this on a scrap piece of paper first, to be sure.</p>

","<p>The paint does make a difference in whether or not you can easily paint over the background.</p>

<p>Watercolor, for example, does not easily cover other art and you would need to use a different technique for the background if you used this medium. Most other paints (like acrylics or oil) are thick enough that you can easily paint over the background without any effort.</p>

<p><strong>Thicker paints</strong></p>

<p>With thicker paints you should paint the background of the image, get it as you like it, and then paint your subject over the top.</p>

<p>This has the down-side of not being very forgiving should you make mistakes to your main subject, fixing the background after touch-ups will be challenging.</p>

<p><strong>Thinner mediums</strong></p>

<p>With thinner mediums like Watercolor you would want to paint them independent of each other and not overlap them. I, personally, would paint the subject first and then follow with a watercolor background.</p>

<p>With watercolor you can use a common technique where you apply water to the paper before using any color. Carefully outline the dry subject with a wet brush and once the paper is wet, carefully apply your color.</p>

<p>The water will pull the color out of the brush and disperse it to the wet areas neatly without spillage. If you make a mistake with the wet brush, simply let it dry and try again before applying color.</p>

"What is the best way to attach backing on a quilt with irregular pattern?","393","","<p>I'd like to make a quilt with a design such as the one in the picture:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2SZ5n.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2SZ5n.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I understand that normally, when a quilt is just made up of squares or rectangles, you can just stitch a bunch of lines up and down and across it to attach the backing and it will still look good because the geometry doesn't get broken.</p>

<p>However, I'm not so sure that it will work with a design like this. The stray vertical and horizontal lines would look awkward here (I feel like) ... I know that another way is to just stitch again along where all the pieces connect. My question here would be as follows. If the backing is black, would it be better to use black thread to go over along the edges of all the pieces when connecting the backing? This way there wouldn't be an awkward design on the back of the quilt, but there would be ugly black thread on the front. Or, should i use the same color thread as on one of the neighboring pieces? This way the front would still look ok, but the back would have a strange colorful design...</p>

<p>Are there any other (better) ways to do this?
Is it possible to not attach the backing at all, other than around the perimeter or would that not work so well?</p>
","<p>This is a perfect example for 'depending on your taste'.
I agree with you that vertical and horizontal lines don't do justice to the pattern, but then again, others may disagree.<br>
That said, if I were to sew backing, I'd follow (some of) the contours of the cat.</p>

<p><em>If the backing is black, would it be better to use black thread to go over along the edges of all the pieces when connecting the backing? Or, should i use the same color thread as on one of the neighboring pieces?</em> <br>
If you're sewing with a sewing machine, you can use two different colours of yarn, one for the front, one for the back. When sewing by hand... I'd choose a colour matching the front side for that's the side you see most. And make sure the stitches at the back side are as small as possible so the cat shape would be more apparent than the colour of the thread.</p>

<p><em>Are there any other (better) ways to do this? Is it possible to not attach the backing at all, other than around the perimeter or would that not work so well?</em><br>
Depends on the size of the quilt. But since this is a free form quilt pattern, why not attach the backing free form as well? Either by random 'squiggles' or a more regular pattern. Do an internet search for 'quilt free form backing pattern' to get some inspiration. You could also just fill the black background with a free form pattern and follow the outlines of the pieces that form the cat itself. Or use a different (free form) pattern for the cat. The possibilities are endless</p>

","<p>The flocculent beauty of the work you show is not that the artists drew a single hair (that would never achieve the effect) the beauty came from the artists layering one drawn hair ""over"" another and repeating it until the desired depth was achieved.</p>

<p>I can think of two artists on Youtube who demonstrate this layering process (with explanations for their reasoning)
Darrel Tank <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEiMe3OiGo"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEiMe3OiGo</a>
Stan Prokopenko <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHewz3JbKrQ"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHewz3JbKrQ</a></p>

<p>Here's a simple example of the layering process. This is based on a presentation by Darrel Tank. If you wan to see the complete process in action then check out his video series.</p>

<p>For this example I will use an HB mechanical pencil, a kneaded eraser and brush. Paper is 400 series strachmore (60lb). I only have white paper and black pencils. Don't focus on the materials. Focus on the process.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DGSx5.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DGSx5.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>With a couple of simple strokes the first strands of the hair are stated.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4mSAP.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4mSAP.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The pencil strokes are softened using a brush by gently brushing across the surface. The harder the pencil the more difficult it will be to soften the pencil marks.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iwlg6.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iwlg6.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> </p>

<p>Next I take a kneaded eraser and form it into a sharp thin edge. Drawing the eraser cross the surface removes some of the pencil markings and leaves behind a negative space creating the illusion of overlapping strands of hair.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EUXmm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EUXmm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Next I go back and restate some of the lines with the pencil.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/h7CwG.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/h7CwG.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Again I use the brush to soften the marks.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uFWhO.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uFWhO.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The process is repeated until the desired layering effect is achieved.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yfuYx.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yfuYx.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Repeat the steps as many times as needed until the desired effect is achieved. Don't be as heavy handed as i was in laying down the layers. The harder you press the more difficult it will be to remove the pencil marks. A light touch is needed.</p>

<p>The above was just one example of how to create the layered effect you are looking to achieve. Masking and opaque paints can also be used but they too rely of the layering for the desired effect.</p>

<p>Because you're getting the entire label wet, it will evenly discolor but I haven't had major issues with the colors running or smearing.

<p>Of course, they want you to buy their labels, so they make it sound onerous to do the application process. We've done a full 5 gallon batch pretty easily, so don't be too concerned about it. And if you try it once and hate it, well... you could switch to sticker paper. Apparently a lot of people use Avery brand sticker labels (the ones you might use for mailing).</p>

<p>Based on their instructions, they have you dip the paper in the milk... we found it was much easier to use a basting brush (or a cheap 1-inch chip brush from the hardware store) than to try to dip the paper.</p>

"Does grid drawing help with drawing from imagination?","378","","<p>I've taken art classes in high/middle school where I did a couple of grid drawings and I've even done a couple on my own. I also had an art class in college last semester and everyone there loved my grid drawings and said they were highly detailed or had a photographic quality. </p>

<p>I don't know though if it actually helps, as I'm not sure if it's helping me improve on drawing from imagination. I want to try figure drawing and do concept and anime art, but my skills in that field are like a 50/50 hit or miss and I want to get into more dynamic poses that look good. </p>

<p>Would using grid drawing to draw people and poses help me achieve these goals?</p>
","<p>Perhaps the main benefit of grid drawing is the accuracy it lets you achieve, but it also helps train your eye to see what's actually there, as opposed to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">what your brain thinks is there</a>. </p>

<p>When you analyze the contents of each individual square, you're forced to focus more on the lines and spaces that make up the subject. It helps guides you through measuring those angles and proportions, like I mention in <a href=""https://crafts.stackexchange.com/questions/672/how-to-start-a-pencil-portrait-without-using-an-outline-of-features/686#686"">this answer about portrait drawing</a>. Instead of comparing lines simply to themselves, you can compare lengths and angles to your clear, consistent grid lines. </p>

<p>It also <a href=""http://www.howtodrawjourney.com/grid-drawing.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">helps you to get a better understanding of scale</a> and proportion, especially when dealing with perspective and foreshortening. Your brain may know that a leg is longer than an arm, but in 2D representation this is not always the case. </p>

<p>So, while drawing from imagination you may think ""I know the leg will be shorter than usual at this angle"", you may over/under-estimate how much to adjust the limb for foreshortening. However, drawing from the grid will give you experience to help you make a more accurate decision. </p>

<p>These skills will be applicable to <em>any</em> drawing you're doing from reference, but also help train your eye to see what's right/wrong about things you draw from imagination. It's just another way to build up your ability to critically analyze what's <em>actually</em> there. </p>

<p>However, it's just one component that will help you in your drawing from imagination. For figure drawing in particular, it's helpful to learn how to construct figures using some type of method, such as blocks-and-cylinders. Drawing from life, in general, is going to give you a better understanding how the world actually looks and works. For instance, you may be able to construct great mannequins, but without having a good mental repository of real facial features and body types, you'll likely have very stale figures.</p>

<p>Since your focus is drawing people and poses from imagination, I personally would pursue other forms of practice over grid drawing. If I were to compare drawing by grid to drawing from materials by artistic anatomy masters such Jenó Barcsay and Stephen Rogers Peck, I'd pick artistic anatomy as a clear winner. </p>

","<p>A 'finished' artwork is a piece that has been worked to a particular level of detail.    There are various levels of 'finish' from a basic outline to a 'finished' sketch, then from a basic drawing to a highly 'finished' piece of work.
To give an example, an artist might do a rough sketch of an idea and then a more detailed sketch or a colour sketch or even create a study for the whole piece or just a small section of the entire drawing/painting.  From that he/she might create a 'finished' piece for exhibition.  The sketches and studies might be made on cheap paper or canvas (sometimes on the back of an envelope)  but the 'finished' piece would be made on the best quality paper/canvas etc. So in the context of your Bristol board, it is a high quality paper that would be used for 'finished' artwork.

"How do I effectively blend with Artist's Loft colored pencils?","368","","<p>What is the most effective way to blend Artist's Loft colored pencils? I have tried using my fingers and also bathroom tissue, but my colors never look very smooth or well-blended.</p>
","<p>A common technique for pencil blending is to use either a colorless blender pencil (they make one for this brand) or to use solvents to blend, normally something like Mona Lisa odorless mineral spirits. </p>

<p>For blending pencils, I'm pretty sure the Artist's Loft line is wax based and so the blenders for Prismacolor should also work. The thing to remember with this technique is that you won't be able to layer more color after, so do it last.</p>

<p>If you try the solvent option, use it in <em>very small</em> amounts on a cheap, small, paint brush as you really do not need a lot. Make sure you have a few layers of pencil on first, that's how you'll get the best look. You can then layer more, when it's dry, and do more blending. It will dry very fast.</p>

<p>Paper also matters. Higher quality paper will allow for more pigment to be laid down and make blending easier. Some people even use 140lb <strong><em>hot press</em></strong> watercolor paper for this (check labeling to be sure), especially if they use solvent blending. You can only do so much with lower-end paper before you destroy the tooth of it or even rip through.</p>

<p>However, at the end of the day, these are low-end, student-grade, pencils and you're simply not going to get the same smooth blending that a professional grade pencil is going to get you.</p>

<p><strong>Quick edit note:</strong> You don't need to buy high-end watercolor paper if you want to try that route. Student grade should be fine, the main difference with student to professional is the sizing and cotton content which, in this use case, isn't as important. Just make sure it is acid free (should say so on packaging).</p>

","<p>It's likely caused by the friction of your inner thighs rubbing together causing the material to wear in that spot quicker (especially because there are a few seams right there).</p>

"How to protect & preserve water color paintings","347","","<p>Is there a particular coating that I should be using to protect a watercolor painting?</p>

<p>And what is the best storage option for preserving paintings?</p>
","<p>There are a couple of things that will definitely work to help preserve displayed paintings:</p>

<ol>
<li>Paint quality. If you want the paint to remain vibrant over time, then you get what you pay for. Artist/professional grade paints are substantially more lightfast than student or children's paints. So, if you want it to stick around better, get the good paint.</li>
<li>Ultraviolet light protection. If you're going to display your work, display under UV filtering glass. This helps to preserve the colors from damaging light and, as an added bonus, protects from the touch of errant fingers. :)</li>
</ol>

<p>You can also get UV archival fixative sprays that are suitable for watercolor work. It's not terribly common to do that, but becoming more prevalent amongst those that don't want glass in front of their painting. My general take is that if the paper gets dusty over time, dulling the color, it's harder to clean than glass... Mind you, for storage long term, it makes a lot of sense to consider.</p>

"What does it mean to ""push your values""?","347","","<p>When I used to frequent art-critique forums, I would often hear senior artists advise people to ""push values"", generally with little to no explanation beyond that.

<p>What does this phrase mean in a drawing/painting context?</p>
","<p>If there isn't enough separation in the levels of the values used in rendering an image then the image can look washed out or the shapes poorly defined.</p>

<p>Someone saying, you need to ""push the values"", means they think you need to add more separation in the value levels you used to define your shapes and areas in the image as a way to help build greater depth, contrast and image intensity.</p>

<p>For the image on the right I expanded the range and pulled from a broader overall range of the value scale. I pushed areas that were originally at N4 to now be at N1. At the other end where I had used N7 i pushed those areas to N10.</p>

<p>In both images N5 was used to render the table top. I used this value as my anchor point. Squeezing and pushing around it.</p>

<p>The result is the image on the right looks more intense and seems to be clearer than the image on the left. </p>

<p>I ask because I'm not sure if the glossiness of the shell would protect it from the dye.

"How can I remove CA glues (e.g. Super Glue) from a material?","332","","<p>I recently got some Super Glue on the sole of my shoe, while working on a craft. Luckily, my shoe wasn't on the ground long enough to be glued to the floor, but now, the entire bottle of superglue is stuck to my shoe (it's a small, 5 mL bottle).</p>

<p>How can I get the Super Glue (or CA glues) off my shoe (or other materials, like my hands)?</p>
","<p>Acetone is the well-rounded budget conscious option. <a href=""https://crafts.stackexchange.com/a/2097/44"">Zizouz212's answer generally covers this</a>. It is hardly the only option though. It largely depends on the material the glue is on well. </p>

<p>When it comes to skin (not a material but certainly somewhere glue ends up) warm soapy water is certainly effective. How long you scrub or immerse depends on the amount of glue. Getting it on your fingers is common and in some cases you can just let it harden and it will peel off. This is where I get CA glue stuck often and I just peel off what I can and wash the remainder. </p>

<p>Using acetone on plastics, with the intent to remove just the CA glue, is a very bad idea as it can dissolve/damange many of them. Acetone is one of the ingredients used in plastic welding applications if it puts that in perspective. </p>

<p>There are many commercial debonders that are made for this purpose. An example would be <a href=""http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__8458__Un_Cure_CA_Debonder_1_oz.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Un-Cure CA Debonder</a>. You should know the materials you are working with to best match your debonder. Depending on your project these can be more effective but, again, have a higher cost then on the shelf acetone/ nail polish remover. </p>

<p>Wood, especially end grain, will actually absorb CA glue. If you actually needed to remove the glue you would have to remove the affected wood. Depending on the project you could use plastic wood filler or glue in new wood. This advice is not specific to CA glue but most glues. </p>

<p>Clothing is a broad topic as well as there are a multitude of different materials so there is no guaranteed approach. Acetone is generally recommended here but try to test it in a non visible area to ensure that it would damage/stain the fabric. Letting the affected area sit in some water and laundry detergent can also help. Using a toothbrush to massage the area and try to get the glue to flake off. Some debonders also work on fabrics as well keeping in mind the same caveats for clothing.</p>

<p>In general CA glue should be easy enough to remove. If there is concern, wear protective clothing and be aware of the specific materials that could come into contact with CA glue so you know the best approach to deal with it. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The pencils can be used dry—like normal colored pencils—or they can be applied ""wet"" to get the desired watercolor effect. In wet application, the artist first lays down the dry pigment and then follows up with a damp paintbrush to intensify and spread the colors. This technique can also be used to blend colors together, and many artists will apply both techniques in one art piece. Artist-grade watercolor pencils typically come in 60 or 72 colors with a few 120 color assortments.</p>

<p>What makes watercolour paper better? Should I invest the money, and buy the watercolour paper, or save my money and take a chance on the cheaper option?</p>
","<p>Watercolor paper is, normally, quite a bit heavier and made from cotton. Basic watercolor paper, 140lb, is okay for practice and will tend to buckle unless stretched. The expensive 300lb paper is where professionals tend to land. In any case, the paint pools and absorbs differently than normal paper, and gives you options around blending, washes, etc. that you can't otherwise get.</p>

<p>Traditional paper, made from wood fibers, is much thinner and absorbs the pigment faster, will generally buckle and warp rapidly and is much more likely to rip and tear when wet. It's just not designed for that.</p>

<p>In any event, sheet watercolor paper can be had and you can always cut it into smaller sizes for practice, which is pretty common anyways. The cheaper option will only frustrate and disappoint, it's already a challenging medium, don't make it hard on yourself.</p>

"What kind of paints should I use to color / paint on bright wood material?","327","","<p>I bought a very small chest for holding small desk items, the chest itself being small enough to stand on a desk.</p>

<p>It is raw, unfinished wood, though it has been sanded smooth. I'm not sure what sort of wood it is, but it has a light color.</p>

<p>I'd like to paint it like a replica of one from a video game and would like to make it look old.</p>

<p>What's the best paint type to use on  this wood that will be long-lasting?<br>
Will I need to pre-treat the wood at all?<br>
How should I finish it to both make it look old <em>and</em> protect the paint?</p>

<p>Here's what the chest looks like:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dyv1Xm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dyv1Xm.jpg"" alt=""Small chest""></a></p>
","<p>For natural wood that you want to look like wood, think staining, not painting. </p>

<p>To make that chest look like an old, beaten-up treasure chest, get two colors of stain: one medium-toned one, such as maple or chestnut, and one darker one, like dark walnut or maybe even ebony. For such a small box, you won't need much stain, especially of the darker color, so see if you can get sample sizes. You'll also need some good varnish or polyurethane, not too glossy.</p>

<p>First, stain the whole box with your lighter stain, following the instructions on the package. </p>

<p>Once that's dry, add some realistic-looking damage or weathering: drop the box on its corners a few times to dent/round them off, get something hard and heavy and drop it on top of the box to add dents and gouges, etc.: get creative, but not <em>too</em> creative.</p>

<p>Now, use the dark stain to add ""dirt"": rub the stain over the box, then immediately wipe it off, but don't do too good a job. The dark stain will remain in the dents and gouges, but not on the surface. Leave more dark stain along the edges and around the hardware. Use a toothbrush to flick stain onto the box to imitate mildew spots. Look up some pictures of the type of old chest you're trying to imitate to figure out where the ""dirt"" should go.</p>

<p>Once the darker stain has dried as well, and you're reasonably satisfied with how it looks, finish the box with a varnish or polyurethane coating. This is what will make it durable; it will also deepen the colors of the stains. If the result starts looking unrealistic, wait for the varnish to dry, then basically sand it off (or mostly off), adjust the stain, let dry, and varnish again.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you want to reproduce the metal strapping of the classical ""treasure chest"", you have several options.</p>

<p>Option 1, you can get what's called ""<a href=""http://www.dickblick.com/products/pure-metal-tooling-foil/"" rel=""nofollow"">tooling foil</a>"" or ""embossing foil"" at the craft store. It's basically like aluminum foil, only much heavier than even the heavy-duty foil you can buy for culinary purposes. However, it's still light enough that it can be pretty easily cut with ordinary scissors (well, OK, so don't use your nice Gingher fabric scissors - steal the kids' craft scissors instead). To use it, cut out strips in the shape you want, and glue or nail them to your box. You can then use your wood stain to give the metal a more distressed finish. If the stain doesn't seem to be sticking, rub the metal with steel wool to remove the protective finish, and then try again.</p>

<p>Option 2, you can try doing the same thing as option 1, just using ordinary heavy-duty aluminum foil and glue. You can even spray-paint the foil with brass-colored paint. The advantage of this, besides being cheaper, is that the thickness of regular aluminum foil is more in proportion with your small box than the 36 gauge stuff, so you can go ahead and, say, wrap the edges of the opening in a realistic-looking manner, without danger of preventing the box from closing properly.</p>

<p>Option 3, you can get some brass-colored craft paint and paint on the strapping. Do this after staining but before varnishing, and then varnish everything once both the stain and the paint are dry.</p>

"How can I determine a yarn's weight?","326","","<p>I have a bag full of yarn from miscellaneous projects. In error, I never kept the labels for the yarn because ""Why would I need to keep those?"". If I am going to work on a project and need a yarn of a specific worsted weight, for example, how can I match the requirement to one of my balls or skeins of yarn?</p>

<p>After reading a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarn#Measurement"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">small Wiki article about yarn characteristics</a> I realize this might be hard to do and might just be a matter of guessing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of the names for the various weights of yarn from finest to thickest are called lace, fingering, sport, double-knit (or DK), worsted, aran (or heavy worsted), bulky, and super-bulky. This naming convention is more descriptive than precise; fibre artists disagree about where on the continuum each lies, and the precise relationships between the sizes.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>There are apparently several different methods for finding <strong>about</strong> what weight you're dealing with. All of these can have their own downsides but they're worth considering. </p>

<p>Note that, realistically, if you can't tell whether something is ""sport"" or ""DK"" but you know it's one of the two, it's probably not going to throw you off too badly.</p>

<p>Also note that the US and the UK have different terms for the same weights of yarn but that since stores sell yarn from around the world, you're likely to run into all of them regardless of where you live.</p>

<h3>Wrapping</h3>

<p><a href=""http://www.craftsy.com/blog/2013/11/determining-yarn-weights/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wrapping</a> is a method of testing the weight by seeing how many widths of yarn fit in an inch of space. It looks a bit like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MqbZB.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MqbZB.jpg"" alt=""Wrapping to measure yarn weight""></a></p>

<p>You can wrap around the ruler itself or around something else like a pencil. The fewer widths of yarn that fit in an inch, the heavier the yarn is. Note that for thicker yarns, you might want to wrap more than an inch and divide to get a better count.</p>

<p>The downside of this is that not everyone wraps the same and yarn is squishy. They yarn in the image is very neatly wrapped but you could easily squash it together and get another 3-4 wraps in that inch.</p>

<h3>Ply or strands</h3>

<p><em>Generally</em> heavier-weight yarns have more strands. This can be finicky with smaller weight yarns and it won't always give you the information you need because there's no real standard but if your yarn only has 2-3 strands, it's probably really light weight and if it's worsted it's probably 10 or 12 ply. So, if you use this in combination with wrapping (or some common sense) it will probably help you. There's a list of the ply to weight name chart on <a href=""http://www.ravelry.com/help/yarn/weights"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ravelry</a>.</p>

<h3>By Gauge</h3>

<p>You can determine whether an unknown ball of yarn will work for your project by making a gauge swatch. This requires that you are pretty comfortable with your stitching and are consistent but it should help. Use the recommended sized hook or needle for the project and follow the instructions for determining gauge for the project (if it includes those instructions) or use a base guide like the one <a href=""http://www.craftyarncouncil.com/weight.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. If the stitch count per four inch swatch is really off, then it won't work. If it's good and it looks the way you expect, then go for it.</p>

<p>In this case, you should adjust for your own stitch style. If you know that you normally need to crochet with a 5.5 mm hook when the recommended size is 6.5, then crochet the sample with the 5.5 mm hook rather than the recommended one.</p>

<h3>By Weight</h3>

<p>Some people have really good scales. If you measure how long your yarn is and then weigh it (in grams) you should be able to find out the weight... because everyone wants to spend hours measuring the length of their yarn. The better your scale is (and heavier the weight), the shorter the length of yarn you can weigh. </p>

<p>I'd recommend that you weigh at least 10-20 grams worth of yarn and then figure out the length. Note that you don't have to cut the yarn to do this, just let the remainder hang off the scale and mark the measurement stop point with a small slip knot. It shouldn't affect the measurement too much.</p>

<p>Now that you have your weight to length measurement, you should be able to compare it to other known yarns and get an idea of what the ""weight"" group is. Though, note that the material your yarn is made of can affect its density so if you don't know what it's made of (which is likely since you don't have the label any more), you might want to try to <a href=""https://crafts.stackexchange.com/questions/170/is-there-a-way-to-determine-the-fiber-content-of-a-yarn-if-ive-lost-the-label"">figure that out</a>, too.</p>

<hr>

<p>As an aside, labels are annoying to hold on to plus the cat probably ran off with them or ate them... but I recommend that you avoid getting into this situation by logging your yarn purchases somewhere. Either keep track of your receipts (if they give identifying info about the yarn) or, even better, track your purchases on a site like Ravelry. This is great because it often has everything uploaded already, so you don't have to manually enter any of the data except (if you want) color name and dye lot. The section you're looking for is called ""stash"" under ""my notebook"".</p>

I'm guessing that it may be due to a failure in the pattern maker - it is programmed to fill in all spaces - but I wanted to check.</p>

<p>What are the benefits of filling in all of the white space, if any? Is it even standard practice ever or is it actually more common to leave the space white.</p>

","<p>All of the cross stich projects I've done did <em>not</em> fill in the background with a solid color. This is typical in embroidery -- the design itself is stitched in, and the base fabric is used as the background. Not only is this faster and simpler for the crafter, it helps the design stand out from the background both texturally and visually.</p>

"How do I get my Envelopener to cut cleanly every time?","319","","<p>The Envelopener is a letter opener/paper cutter that's favored by origami folders because it cuts along folds precisely, there's no way you're gonna injure yourself, and it's highly portable. It's sold on multiple origami sites.  You can see <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPxcJ99N1Xo"" rel=""nofollow"">a video of it in action on Youtube</a>. There's no brand name on it, and you can apparently <a href=""http://www.nickrobinson.info/origami/wp_ori/the-origami-tool-you-can-use-and-yet-retain-your-credibility/"" rel=""nofollow"">get these things branded yourself</a>. It appears to be of European manufacture.</p>

<p>It works like a dream.  <em>Most</em> of the time.</p>

<p>Then there are the times it stubbornly sticks and won't cut at all. The cutter basically has a fixed exacto knife blade in it, and plastic guides that separate the layers of paper around the blade.  But sometimes, both layers can go through the same channel (so no cuts), or the paper binds up against something in the channels (so sticks).  Any ideas on fixes or techniques to get around these two issues?</p>
","<p>I use envelopeners a lot and indeed prefer them to any other means of cutting paper in almost all cases. Here are some tips from my experience:</p>

<p>Regarding the cutting tool itself:</p>

<ul>
<li>First of all, envelopeners are consumables: they will become blunt over time and there's not much you can do about it. Since they are cheap, simply replace them once in a while, especially if you start running into issues more often than you used to. Your mileage may vary depending on how often and what types of paper you cut, but mine last less than half a year.</li>
<li>The blade which sits inside the tool is pressed between two halves of the plastic case. You can open the case by inserting a fingernail or a screwdriver blade into the narrow gap between the two halves. This will allow you to:

<ul>
<li>Clean the blade from paper residue which gathers around it. Some envelopeners have a shaft which is supposed to allow the lint to escape from the blade but this does not always work perfectly.</li>
<li>When closing the case, press the two pieces of the case firmly together. Sometimes the two halves become a little loose, causing the blade to not be mounted in a fully symmetric manner, which can cause both parts of the paper to move around a single side of blade instead of getting the blade exactly in between them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>As for the cutting technique:</p>

<ul>
<li>The envelope opener works best if the crease along which you cut is perpendicular to the paper edge. So, it's good for cutting squares but much worse for cutting hexagons. Personally, I use a Swiss Army knife or scissors for cutting hexagons since the envelopener doesn't handle them well.</li>
<li>Sometimes you run into problems such as splitting the sheet into layers instead of cutting along the edge when trying to cut thick paper and the crease along which you cut is pressed too firmly (e.g. using a bone folder). So, sometimes it helps to either not make the crease that sharp, or to fold it in the reverse direction after folding, which also results in a somewhat less sharp fold.</li>
<li>As mentioned above, an envelope opener consists of two plastics casing parts with the blade fixed in the middle right between them. These two halves of the case do not always perfectly fit together and there may be a small gap between them. Sometimes when you start cutting, you may press the paper too deep inside the casing, which causes the creased part of the paper to get stuck in this narrow gap. The solution is to check that you are not inserting the paper too deep.</li>
</ul>

<p>While these tips do not guarantee a 100% success rate, and I still occasionally make a bad cut, I think that I have become better at using the envelopener over time, so I hope they are helpful for others, too.</p>

"What material can I use to dye paper to look older?","318","","<p>My son wants to have a treasure hunt themed birthday party (we'll be geocaching at a local park). For the invitations, he wants pirate treasure maps to tell guests where to go.</p>

<p>I'm going to be typing up the directions and information and map and printing multiple copies. What paper should I use (compatible with a printer or copier), and what dye could I apply (presumably after printing) to make these ""maps"" look aged, handled by many generations of pirates? </p>
","<p>tl;dr: tea!</p>

<p>Yup, that's right, good ole' Lipton (or whatever other type of black tea you happen to have on hand). Diluted coffee can also work, but will smell like, well, coffee-stained paper.</p>

<p>Note that this shouldn't be used on inkjet printouts, as inkjet ink isn't waterproof. So I would suggest printing out the master map (in black and white) and heading out to your local office supply store to make copies.</p>

<p>After applying the tea, you can hang up the maps to dry. The paper will get crinkly, but that's actually a good thing for this application. If they get <em>too</em> crinkly, apply a cool iron (barely above its lowest setting) to smooth them back out.</p>

<p>As a final step, go out to your garage (or a similar well-ventilated but sheltered spot) and use a candle or a lighter to burn away the edges of the maps. Keep a bucket of water handy, just in case. Don't go overboard - just do the corners and a little bit of a few edges. After blowing out the flames, break off most of the black stuff, leaving only a browned, ragged edge.</p>

<p>Note that the results will not be archival: tea is acidic. But for a prop for a birthday party, that shouldn't be an issue.</p>

"How to make stitches invisible","316","","<p>I'm working on a DIY kit of a plush doll. This is the first time I'm sewing. Per instructions, I'm using a back stitch to sew together two fleece pieces.
The problem is that the stitches are visible from the outside, and I think they should be invisible.
Did I sew it in a wrong way? Or is there something else I should have done?</p>

","<p>You get the least visibility when you use the same colour of yarn as your fabric.
But as a beginner, it will be easier when the yarn stands out from the fabric, which does make for the stitches to be seen a bit.</p>

<p>I guess the blue line in the picture is the line to sew on, if so, sew on that line and not near it. The better the stitches are in one line, the less visible they will be in the end.</p>

<p>Also remember to keep the stitching tight, not drawing the fabric together but many smallish stitches where the yarn is flat on the fabric, so that when you look between the layers of the fabric, the fabric will be close together and there is no space for it to move.</p>

"How can I clean a paintbrush used in acrylic paint?","312","","<p>When I try to look up videos or tips for painting with acrylic, I always see them dipping the paintbrush into water to clean.  But every time I paint with acrylic paint, it seems there is a never ending supply of paint in my brush. Am I worrying too much about over-cleaning it? I don't try to add too much paint and I dip my brush in water to make it a little thinner so it isn't so gloopy. At least that is what I have been told to do when working with acrylic. I've been told paint thinner isn't necessary. Is there a technique I can use to clean my paintbrushes fast and effectively?</p>

<p>One thing I should add, I don't mean after I'm done using them. What I really am aiming at is needing to use the same size brush but with a different color. For example, my whole background is red. Well, then I have to clean out all the red because I need to use that same paintbrush for another color like yellow. I want my red brush to clean quickly so that I can get into the yellow and paint a different area. But cleaning the red out seems to take FOREVER! I dip in water, try to clean, squeeze out into a paper towel, and then use some construction paper to see how clean it is.  Basically, it looks like I'm painting with just a slightly thinner coat of paint. I'd like to clean my brush without having to clean it several different times. This leads also into the fact that I would like to paint more than clean my brushes.</p>
","<p>Dipping your brush into water isn't going to do anything other than get your brush wet. To actually clean a brush, you need physical agitation, and I don't mean ""swish it around in the water jar a few times"" agitation, but ""mash it back and forth against your other hand while holding it under running water"" agitation. Use some paint brush soap (or plain old hand soap) and really work up a lather. Rinse and repeat until the lather bears no trace of the pigment you were using, then rinse thoroughly.</p>

<p>If this sounds like too much work when all you want to do is switch pigments, there are two things that will help. <strong>One</strong>, don't put so much paint on your brush: put the paint on just the tip, not the whole thing. Of course, that's not a terribly effective way to paint a large area such as a background, which brings me to: <strong>Two</strong>, get more brushes. Basically, use one brush per color, or at least per color family. If you're switching between, say, vermilion and cadmium red, you can get away with just swishing the brush around in the water jar and wiping on a paper towel. You still need to do the thorough washing as soon as possible after you're done, though, since acrylic paint can dry on a brush even if it's sitting in water (plus, sitting in water is itself a bad thing for a brush).</p>

","<p>Plaster that is thick enough to be reasonably strong and rigid will probably be too heavy. </p>

<p>Masks are often made from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">papier mache</a>, essentially building up strips of paper soaked in paste over a former which dried to a fairly strong but lightweight material. Other methods involve pressing paper pulp into a mould. </p>

<p>You could also use your plaster original as a former as long as you coat it with wax, Vaseline ect to act as a release agent and prevent the paper from sticking. </p>

<p>An quick internet search will find many tutorials on making masks in this way. </p>

<p>The big advantage of papier-mache is that you don't really need much in the way of tools and equipment to work with it and teh raw materials are cheap and easy to get hold of. </p>

<p>There are also many other options depending on your particular priorities, moulded leather, sheet metal or cast resin or composites would all potentially be pretty cool but there you are looking at either a substantial investment in time, practice and materials or engaging a specialist to work with you to make it. </p>

<p>Having said that you may find that if you reach out a bit you may find an artist of fabricator who is sufficiently interred in the project to give you a good deal. I would certainly be interested in something like this but equally if you want at a good deal based on collaboration you need to be prepared to give up some creative control of the project. So you need to make sure that you have a similar vision in mind. </p>

<p>Which one of these options will work better or are there any other solutions to consider?    </p>
","<p>I lack both the chemistry and botany knowledge to address you question directly.  @ChrisH's comment suggests that your phosphorus pigments won't wick up through the stems like the compounds in the referenced article do.</p>

<p>Have you considered applying the pigment directly to the flower petals using either a paintbrush or airbrush?</p>

<p>Since you are planning to encapsulate the flower in clear resin, you don't have to worry about the paint rubbing off of the petals.  How it gets to where you want it is less important that how it looks once it is in place.  To that end, I would recommend a very light (high-air) spray of a very dilute pigment using an airbrush with a high-number needle and nozzle (3 or above).  Mist the flower with the glowing paint and test the results in darkness after each coat.</p>

<p>Skipping that idea, there is an immersion technique at the end of the referenced article which might work even if the stem-based approach fails with the pigment you choose.</p>

"How can I trace a pattern from a top with darts?","292","","<p>I have a RTW (ready-to-wear, aka store-bought) dress which fits me well, and I'd like to sew a copy of it. I've done this before with loosely fitted tops, like t-shirts which only have minimal shaping, by doing a ""rubbing"" - lying the garment flat, tracing the seams on to tissue paper, and using that as a pattern base.</p>

<p>The bodice of this dress has darts on the side, so obviously lying it flat to trace will not work. I'm also concerned that the difference in stiffness between tissue paper and the dress fabric (a drapey knit) will cause inaccuracies if I try to e.g. make creases in the paper until it ""looks right"". I don't want to pick the seams of the dress and take it apart.</p>

<p>Is there a good technique to trace the piece with the dart? Or, how can I reverse-engineer how much of an angle was used for the dart? I do have a dress form, so answers which involve that are welcome!</p>
","<p>If the dress is ready for replacement, you can remove the seams. You don't have to remove all of them, just the ones so the fabric can be layed down flat. I wouldn't recommend removing seams if you still want to wear the dress.
<br><br>
Another option is measuring: draw the pieces of your dress on paper as good as you can. Cut them out. Then put on your dress and see if the pieces you've cut out of paper, cover your dress. If you've done well, you'll also have the dart on the right place. When the doesn't fit correctly yet, cut off what's too large and add paper where your pattern is too smal. You can just attach a strip of paper with some tape, no need to redo the whole piece.

So I'd like to submit this question to any/all established artists, what tips/advice do you have for ""new artists"" to overcome their fears of imperfection (which are, afterall, inevitable for any student)?</p>
","<p>There's a famous story about a ceramics professor who separated his class into two groups of students. The students in Group A were graded solely on a single pot they presented at the end of the semester, whereas the students in Group B were graded on how many pots they produced during the semester: quality vs. quantity.</p>

<p>During the course of the semester, the Group A students were agonizing over perfecting the minutest details of their pot, while Group B was furiously churning out pots left and right.</p>

<p>At the end, the professor examined everyone's pots, and Group B had higher quality work - even though they were only being graded on quantity! The Group A students, though they had been trying to achieve high quality, simply did not have the same amount of experience.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is, <strong>practice makes perfect</strong>.</p>

<p>The solution to your ""artist's block"" is not unlike writer's block. You can find prompts and assignments to force yourself to do something until inspiration strikes again. Most of all, you must accept that your early drafts will suck, and <em>make them anyways</em>.</p>

<p>I've found it very inspirational looking at re-makes or progression pictures from artists, to see how their technique and style have evolved over the years. To me, it underscores that making art is a learned skill, not some innate talent that you either have or don't have. Sadly too many people believe this, and simply give up on art because their skills are still grade school level and they haven't grown them since. But if you put in the work you will get better and better.</p>

These circles were drawn like the text of cursive handwriting where we do not pick up hand from the paper till the word is complete and all the alphabets are joined to each other.</p>

Then I repeated the procedure on the same area with the same color 4 times.</p>

","<p>I worked in a frame shop for several years and there are a few different ways to go about it, but some general guidelines...</p>

<p>You don't want prints to be touching the glass.  You should either mat them, or make sure to request that the framer put in spacers.  Spacers are just little pieces of plastic that sit between the glass and the picture.  They are completely invisible in the finished product and you won't even know they're there.</p>

<p>If you need to use backing on top of the board behind the prints or want to use mats, make sure you only use acid-free or archival quality materials.  Things like regular paper mats will give the print's edges a yellowish tint and make the paper more brittle.  Any frame shop you go to should sell acid-free materials, even the cheaper chain ones like Michael's and Hobby Lobby.</p>

<p>UV resistant glass is a good option.  Even if it's not in direct sunlight, if you really want to protect the prints (and have the option of moving them to other places in the future) it does help preserve the ink.</p>

<p>You should also steer clear of buying any premade frames.  They're typically made out of very cheap materials, most of which an actual frame shop would never even use.</p>

<p><strong>Cameo 3</strong></p>

<p>Plus:</p>

<ol>
<li>Quieter in operation, by a huge factor</li>
<li>Much less expensive</li>
<li>Easier to set up/calibrate initially</li>
<li>Can use common software such as Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw to create designs</li>

<ol>
<li>Slower in cutting </li>
<li>Single sheet capacity</li>
<li>Time consuming to attach material to cutting panel and to weed off cut pieces</li>
<li>Commercial grade cutters much more expensive, have tall profile (floor models) and larger footprint</li>

"Sharpener for Pastel and Charcoal Pencils","262","","<p>I'm having a big issue sharpening pastel and charcoal pencils. I've tried using a traditional pencil sharpener on pastel pencils but the lead keeps breaking.</p>

<p>I've also tried using a razorblade and exactoknife on the charcoal pencil but this leads to really uneven lead.</p>

<p>Is there a pencil sharpener made for pencils with brittle leads like these?</p>

<p>Note: I'm using Conte a Paris pastel pencils and general's charcoal pencils if that helps.</p>
","<p>You're on the right track using a craft knife or utility knife. They get you started, but you need to finish them off with another tool to make them smooth.</p>

<p>Make sure your blade is extra sharp. If you have to put too much pressure to cut down the point, you'll be stressing the insides of the pencil. It may not break charcoal <em>this</em> time, but stress fractures could make a future sharpening very frustrating. </p>

<p>Once you've got a suitable length of your charcoal/pastel/graphite, you finish it off with a lead pointer or sanding stone. The only difference between graphite and the more brittle materials, from what I found, is how lightly you need to sand them. </p>

<p>Here's a pointer that's almost identical to the one I have:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0JvW.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0JvW.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>You can make one yourself very easily if you have fine sandpaper lying around. It's just several sheets of sanding paper layered, so that you can peel them away when they get worn out. (Don't toss them just because they get dark/colored, as that can be tapped or blown out. I toss mine when they loose their grain.)</p>

<p>You can also buy small sanding stones, which is what they use in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxKsEJYthec"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this video about sharpening General's charcoal pencils</a>.</p>

<p>By sanding it, you'll be able to develop the exact tip you want. You can make it very pointed and conical, or you can sand it to be a sharp wedge, or whatever you need for your strokes.</p>

  <p>Is spray paint usable for this purpose, or is there a better tool?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I started reading this spray paint is what came to mind. It seems the best  way to get even coverage with minimal effort. Now that can be considered a broad suggestion given the many varieties of paints out there but most should be more than sufficient for this. </p>

<p>Spray paint allows you to reach all the surfaces, contours and crevasses of the model without having to handle it too much. Just sit it on some paper and spray the model from enough distance that you are not saturating it. This should help prevent beading and dripping of the paint. With something like a crane the points should keep it elevated enough to not need help keeping of the ground.  </p>

<p>There is still a possibly that this could warp the model. Since you are applying a liquid to one side of the paper it could cause the model to curl as it dries. This can happen with almost anything you would apply. Making multiple light coats can mitigate this.  </p>

<p>Always be sure to wear protective gear, like face masks and goggles, and work in an open and well circulated area.</p>

"What steps do I take to prepare a plaster block?","262","","<p>In school, I once made a subtractive sculpture from a plaster block. Actually, the block was in the shape of the large yogurt container it set up in (about 4 inches in diameter at the top, at least 4 inches tall).</p>

<p>I used knives and files to slowly make an abstract sculpture that I really loved, but the preparation for the plaster was done completely by the instructor.</p>

<p>I did some searching on plaster, but the mixing information was generally about creating plaster to put on something else to create a mold. It wasn't about simply creating a piece to carve from. I'm not sure of search terms to use to narrow it down.</p>

<p>Should I just mix the entire thing in the container I want to use for the block shape? Do I mix it in a larger container and then pour it into the final one? Do I add less water since I won't be pouring it over an object?</p>

<p>Here's an example of what I'd like to be able to do again. Although my block started quite large, I made this quite small piece:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rE7CLm.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rE7CLm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ipt26m.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ipt26m.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vtmN7m.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vtmN7m.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>
<sup>Eternity by CreationEdge 2005</sup></p>
","<p>The first thing to bear in mind is that different grades of plaster have different properties. They can broadly be divided into (harder) alpha plasters and (softer) beta plasters. Obviously for carving there is a compromise between how easy it will be to work and how strong the finished article will be. A softer plaster will obviously be easier to carve but a harder one will allow you to create finer detail and be stronger overall. </p>

<p>there is also a large rage of specific formulations in between hard and soft. Specifically <a href=""http://www.tomps.com/herculite-2-casting-plaster-1kg-to-25kg-bags-herculite-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">Herculite</a> may be a good compromise for carving. </p>

<p>It is important to use the correct ratio of water  to plaster, follow the manufacturers instructions and take the time to measure out the quantities accurately.  You can also get various polymer additives which strengthen the plaster further. </p>

<p>Be aware that mixing even quite small quantities of plaster can be a messy business. It's not especially hazardous, but as with any fine dust avoid breathing it in too much and prolonged exposure can dry out your skin a bit. </p>

<p>It is a good idea to keep a bucket of water handy for washing utensils as plaster in an excellent way to block a sink. Rubber mixing bowls can easily be cleaned by knocking the plaster out, rigid containers are much harder to clean. </p>

<p>If you sieve the plaster before you mix it that will help to prevent any lumps in the mix. It's usually easiest to mix moderate quantities by hand as this allows you to feel any lumps, wear rubber gloves if you wish. Hand mixing also tends to introduce less air. Make sure that your mixing bowl is thoroughly clean, any traces of set plaster in the mix can cause lumps and hard spots in your casting. </p>

<p>It is probably best to mix it in a separate container from  the one you mould it in as you will get a neater mould. Try to make up the correct amount as pouring a new batch onto setting plaster can cause problems. Once the mould is poured and before it sets gentry tap it a few times to help release any bubbles. </p>

<p>If you want to colour the plaster it's usually best to colour the water with a water soluble dye or pigment before you mix it, if you want to obtain an even colour. </p>

<p>As well as casting into a mould you can let the plaster set a bit and then mould it by hand like clay. A few minutes after mixing it goes from a fluid to something a bit like soft cheese. At this point it will hold a shape reasonably well and can be formed into shapes without needing a mould. You do need to work quickly as you will only have a few minutes before it sets. </p>

<p>The issue with this is that I've only heard of it being done on untreated veg-tanned leather, which your shoes almost certainly are not.</p>

<p>In order to successfully have the leather absorb the water, you'll first need to remove the covering. This can be done with a little soap and water, or (more drastically, and more likely to damage your shoes) with acetone or rubbing alcohol. </p>

<p>Once you've done that, stuff your shoes with something to keep their shape, and then soak + heat (a hairdryer or heat gun is the best option here). </p>

"Intentionally letting watercolor paints dry before using them?","244","","<p>My wife uses Van Gogh watercolor paints in what I think is a really strange way. She squeezes some paint from the tube, lets it dry on the palette for 48 hours, and then uses a wet brush to paint with it.</p>

<p>I've certainly seen lots of information about reusing dry watercolor paint, but I've never encountered anyone intentionally waiting or the paint to dry before starting to use it. She says this is the way to get the right consistency. Waiting two days sounds like a huge pain.</p>

<p>Has anyone else encountered this?</p>
","<p>It sounds like your wife learned to paint with watercolor paints in pans, and/or learned from someone who only really knew of these types of paints:<br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2HL6cm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2HL6cm.jpg"" alt=""van Gogh watercolor set of 12 pans""></a></p>

<p>These are in a sense the ancestors of the kiddie watercolors you may have struggled with as a child, and thus you might think that they're lower quality than tube paints, but that's not actually the case: they're exactly the same pigments and binders as tube watercolors, with possibly a little bit less glycerin, since they don't have to stay flexible in the tube.</p>

<p>The techniques used for painting with pans can be quite different than the techniques for using tube paints - with the latter, you basically dilute the paint to heavy cream consistency and use it that way, while with the former, you do what your wife (eventually) does, namely use a wet brush to pick up mostly-dry paint. By the end of a painting session, even the pan paints will be at least damp and softened, but you're unlikely to ever end up with the mythical heavy cream consistency. </p>

<p>With tube paints, if you diluted more paint than you could use (very, very likely unless you're painting huge landscapes or something), you let it dry in your palette, and then next time you either use it as if it were pan paint (maybe another possible root for your wife's, um, habit), or you go ahead and mix it with enough water to get back to heavy cream consistency, possibly adding a touch more gum arabic if you've gone through several cycles of wet-dry-wet. </p>

<p>Another possible root for your wife's method is that often, people will refill their pans from a tube, for instance if there's one particular color that they keep running out of, or if the price point happens to be better for tubes than pans. (It varies by paint manufacturer, pigment, what sales are happening, and various other arcane factors.) </p>

<p>Bottom line is, there are paints meant to be used as your wife does (wet brush on dry-ish paint), and there are some use cases which look a lot like your wife's initial preparation (i.e. somehow ending up with dried tube paint in a pan or palette), but doing it from the outset, with no pans to speak of, seems a bit... cargo-cultish.</p>

<p>Do you draw the hair in large chunks? What are some techniques I can use to make it look realistic e.g.: soft, reflecting the right amount of light, not too perfect, etc.?</p>
","<p>There is a natural temptation when drawing hair to think in terms of individual hairs and equate these to pencil lines. However this tends to get in the way as there is no reasonable way to draw every individual hair even in hyper-realistic styles. </p>

"How to find the contours of a 3D object?","235","","<p>In <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0891348689"">Drawing Realistic Textures in Pencil</a>, the author says that we should shade according to the contours of an object. As an example he has shown a cone shaped flat bottomed flower pot, which was quite easy to follow.</p>

<p>I want to understand how to find contours of other 3D objects like a leaf, an apple, or a human face?</p>

<p>How do I know where the contours are?</p>
","<p>When I think of ""shading with the contours"", I think of having your lines follow the perspective contours of the object. So, in a sphere your strokes or shadow edges will be curved, as the shadow wraps around the surface. On a cube, your strokes can be flat and straight.</p>

<p>If you think of your object in wire-frames, it may help to decide which way to place the shading. Keeping those contour lines in mind may help you to visualize when and how much to curve or straighten the strokes or edges of your shading.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I'm not able to demo this at the time, but I mainly use mental wire-framing as a visualization technique. It's something that came from me drawing box-and-cylinder mannequins for figure drawing.</p>

<p>You can practice visualizing these contours, without doing all the work of shading, with something called <strong>crossed-contour drawing</strong>. There's a great many search results crossed-contour drawing, so I'd use them! It's one of those things where you have to practice, in order to train both your eyes and your hands to understand what's going on. </p>

<p>If you're having too hard of a time figuring out how to make the contours, you can try finding images of wire-frame models, such as ""wire-frame face"". You can use these images to see how a wire-frame maps to a real object. One nice thing about this approach is that you can find 3D models for programs such as Maya. <a href=""http://3docean.net/item/green-apple-for-games/16390194"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">These models</a> are intended for sale, but the sample images generally show the fully rendered (colored &amp; shaded) object <em>plus</em> the wireframe of the object in the same position. That direct side-by-side may be very helpful for you.</p>

"It is easier to learn to use oil paint or acrylic paint?","235","","<p>Is it easier to use acrylic paint or oil paint? </p>

<p>I'm trying to get into painting and I want to know which one has the best consistency. </p>
","<p>Generally speaking, acrylic is a cheaper and more forgiving medium to start with. As mentioned by other respondents, acrylic is fast-drying and can be painted over. You can also use acrylic media, such as glosses, gels, pastes, etc., to adjust the consistency and texture of acrylic paint. I personally use acrylic paste and gels to thicken the paint such that it can be textured like oil paint. You can also use acrylic paint like watercolors by diluting with water if you are painting on a porous surface (like paper). If you're new to painting and haven't decided on a style yet, acrylic paint is a great paint to begin experimenting with because of how versatile it is.</p>

<p>Acrylic is also easier to start with because it doesn't require as much specialized material. Before drying, the paint is water-soluble, so you can clean brushes with water and mild soap. (But make sure you wash your brushes before the paint dries! Once acrylic paint dries, it forms a polymer finish, which is insoluble in water. This also means acrylic paints can work as fabric paint as well. ;]) But with oil paint, you need turpentine for cleaning brushes. And of course, oil for the paint. You also need to learn a proper order for applying paints (""fat over lean"") in order for the colors to show up properly in the end product.</p>

"Why is wearing a mask recommended when carving antler?","235","","<p>Why do people get so concerned over antler dust when knife carving. I wear a mask when I work with it. But what if you didn't wear a mask? What would the dangers be?</p>
","<p>I think @matt's response is exactly correct, but I wanted to add a bit more to it. There are two concerns about inhaling dust--the size of the dust particle and the chemical composition of the particle.  There are lots of articles on-line that talk about how dust inhalation causes problems, but I will summarize <a href=""http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/lungs_dust.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this one</a> from the Canadian Centre of Occupational Health and Safety.</p>

<p>In general, your body has lots of systems designed to move dust particles back out of your lungs when you breathe them in. The first line of defense is a layer of mucus--the dust gets caught in this mucus and then these teeny hairs called cilia all wave together (imagine a crowd doing ""The Wave,"" or someone crowd surfing at a punk music venue) to move that dusty mucus out of your lungs and into your throat where you can cough it out (or swallow it--blech).  </p>

<p>Some very small dust particles can get past the mucus and cilia and end up in the very tiny air sacs in your lungs called alveoli. When this happens, your body produces cells called macrophages that surround the dust particles, and physically move it to the cilia so that they can do their job and move the particle out of your lungs. The lungs also produce a protein that neutralizes the dust particles.</p>

<p>But, if you are inhaling a large amount of dust at one time, or over a long period of time, it can overwhelm your body's ability to produce microphages.  The dust particles accumulate in your lungs and reduce your ability to breath deeply--I imagine it something like a roof drain pipe clogged with leaves. </p>

<p>And some dust particles are composed of chemicals that interact with your body in nasty ways--apparently cigarette smoke actually paralyzes the cilia--so even if your microphages were working perfectly, it wouldn't matter. And there could be pathogens, bacteria or mold spores in the dust that could make you ill.</p>

<p>So, in general, if you are working on something that is likely to create small dust particles like woodworking, carving antlers, using dye powder to dye fabrics, working with ground glass for fusing, etc., you want to limit the amount of dust that you inhale into your lungs.  Each exposure may not be dangerous on its own, but combined exposures over the course of your life can really build up and cause problems. </p>

","<p>I would classify these images as <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_art"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">line art</a></strong>.</p>

<p>With line art you will see clear lines defining forms and shapes, and sometimes where color and light would be, but the color and shading won't be there.</p>

<p>Definition is enhanced in compositions such as the ones posted by varying the line weight and and stroke. The thicker lines make parts stand out, and also help define depth.</p>

<p>Since the line weights vary in these examples, they may have been drawn using some type of ink (presuming they weren't digitally produced). Pen and marker tips allow for more variation in line weight than a typical pencil, although it's possible to <a href=""https://crafts.stackexchange.com/a/469/24https://crafts.stackexchange.com/a/469/24"">sharpen a pencil</a> in such away to allow for more variation.</p>

<p>Line art itself isn't going to be subject to less rules of composition than other 2D visual arts. An understanding of composition in general is going to be helpful, although outside the scope of this answer. </p>

<p>However, certain techniques or media may be more helpful to practice with, if the end goal is this type of art: Drawing in general, inking or other practice to help with line weights, and making clean lines.</p>

"How can I knit faster?","227","","<p>Although I don't knit every day, I'd say my knitting level is intermediate to advanced. The results that I get are good, but I feel I can improve my knitting speed. (And that 'just practice more' won't help.)</p>

<p>So, what techniques are used by people who can knit very fast?<br>
I'd like to find out if there is something I can do as well, to improve my knitting speed.</p>

<p>I'm knitting continental style (and am right handed).</p>
","<p>I have a couple suggestions.  If you knit in the French Method, try the German Method. If you knit in the German Method, try the French Method.  Try a peg loom knitting.  Or even machine knit. Else Weave &amp; Sew, an entirely new topic.</p>

<p>Knitting with the yarn in the hand opposite the working needle (i.e. the left hand if the knitter is right-handed) is commonly referred to as Continental knitting, German knitting, European knitting, or left-hand knitting. The term 'left-hand knitting', however, is discouraged by left-handed knitters because it leads to misunderstandings. Unlike English knitting, the tip of the working needle is used to hook the yarn and bring it forward; the motion is thus sometimes known as picking. Continental knitting can be done at a greater rate than English knitting, as the stitches are formed closer to the needle points and the yarn has a shorter travel...</p>

<p>English knitting, also known as right-hand knitting or throwing, is a style of Western knitting where the yarn to be knit into the fabric is carried in the right hand. This style is prevalent throughout the English-speaking world, though it is by no means universal.</p>

<p>Other Western knitting styles include continental knitting (also known as ""left-hand knitting"") and combined knitting. Despite the names, choice of knitting style has little to do with the handedness of the knitter; plenty of left-handed individuals use the English style, and plenty of right-handed knitters use Continental. Various non-Western styles also exist, many of which are substantially similar to these, but which twist each stitch, making for a subtly different-looking fabric... but this can also be called French Knitting... </p>

","<p>When starting out I would try to get some of the bigger areas, so you have a bit of a body to anchor the rest of the work in. Like the red diagonal markers which are at the top third of your picture.<br>

<p>When you would that method you will see that you do not need as much parking, you will have more enbroidered space to use to move your working thread around to where you need it.
As in the other answer, move to where you need it if it costs less length than stopping and starting again.</p>

<p>A few parked threads can find a spot in a small portable loop.
If you need more than those, bring the thread outside the ring and pull it through the fabric and take the needle off. It might be needed to do that within and outside the loop to make it stick where you want it.</p>

"How to make a pom-pom?","222","","<p>Many years ago, I made some small model people and animals out of fabric, wool, old toilet roll tubes, etc. Their heads were usually made out of <strong>pom-poms</strong> perhaps 5-10 cm in diameter, as you can see in this model of a witch:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wrap the yarn around a common fork. Using more yarn (more loops) will give you a more uniform/spherical appearance. If possible leave a small space between the tines of the fork and body of the fork. This makes the next step easier. </li>
<li>Use a single strand of yarn and tie it around the loops. You can place it in-between the fork tines in order to get around the yarn loops. Make it tight. (You could also just use a pipe cleaner depending on how you plan to use them)</li>
<li>Cut <em>all</em> the loops out just the same. </li>
<li><p>You can fluff up the end of the pompom by using something <em>like</em> a wire brush. Using the brush all around the surface will fray the ends creating a more solid appearance. </p>

<h1>Cardboard Disc Method</h1>

<p>To make larger poms or to try and help make ones different sized ones consistently then you can try using a pair of cardboard discs</p>

<p>The following will consist of stills from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EULHNtikVxg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this video</a> that outlines this procedure nicely. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make two cardboard discs. They will be shaped like a doughnut with pie slice removed. </p>

<li><p>Place a small tail of yarn in between those discs. You will be using this to tie of later much in the same way as the other method above. This is a <em>very</em> important part as this will be used to hold the whole pom together. You need to always be aware of where this string is during the process and not lose in inside the yarn wraps.</p>

<p>If your yarn is weak and prone to snapping under tension you should use something stronger. Wire work here as well if these will be part of a larger project. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UlNFem.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UlNFem.png"" alt=""The center yarn""></a></p></li>
<li><p>Starting wrapping as much yarn as you deem necessary around the doughnut/circle. The more you use the tighter your pom will be. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/x2ARjm.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/x2ARjm.png"" alt=""Start wrapping""></a></p></li>
<li><p>Get scissors and cut the yarn in between the discs. Again, be aware of the location of the yarn tail so as to not cut it or lose it. You will have to hold the center of the discs to keep them together until you tie off. </p></li>
<li><p>Use the tail and tie around the cut yarn. You should be able to remove the disc now. </p></li>
<li><p>Beyond that the rest is the same. Fluff up the yarn to make your ball. Trim to get a more spherical shape. Use a brush if that effect is desired.  </p></li>

"To draw any thing, is it necessary to draw its wireframe first?","219","","<p>See the pitcher plant drawing <a href=""http://drawabox.com/lesson/3"">here</a>. They have actually drawn the wireframe first.</p>

<p>What will I gain by drawing the wireframe first? Why not draw directly the outer lines?</p>
","<p>The reason for drawing wire frames, or any construction method, is to properly develop the forms of the object. By laying out the underlying structure, you can get a better sense of volume, proportions and arrangement of the 3D object you're trying to map into a 2D art form. This lets you get the foundation ready before laying down time-consuming details that may be hard to fix later. </p>

<p>If you focus first on the outline, you might recognize the plant as a plant, but you'll lose out on the understanding of the curved blades that make the leaves, or the cylindrical shape of the pot. </p>

<p>Generally speaking, if you start from the edges, the following mistakes become common: </p>

<ul>
<li>Incorrect proportions, as the base layout wasn't developed first</li>
<li>Poor impression of depth, since outer lines become over emphasized compared to spatial relationships </li>
<li>Too much time spent on making the outline ""perfect"" leads to slow progression and hyper focus on small areas and not the larger image</li>
</ul>

<p>These problems can leave the drawing looking dimensionless and misshapen. </p>

<p>Additionally, as you practice construction of real objects, you develop your natural understanding of how objects work. This allows you to become increasingly capable of constructing objects from imagination, or filling in blanks of objects you can't fully see. This is a skill that only comes about with practice.</p>

<p>Now, there are methods of practice and application where you focus on drawing the outline. One exercise is <a href=""https://youtu.be/3rBbZDca-XA"">drawing the negative space</a> around an object, effectively leaving you with a silhouette or outline. In such a case, you focus strongly on the relationship of angles and distances between empty spaces. Here, you're also training your eye to interpret 3D objects as 2D forms. </p>

<p>This is also an essential skill. So to answer your question about whether it's always <em>necessary</em> to draw the wireframe first, I would say no. Specifically, learning to draw negative space is highly valuable, and can be combined with your understanding of construction to make believable objects. </p>

  <p>Are cosplay wigs generally handmade, or bought and then customized?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and Yes or a combination of both.</p>

<p>When you need to get a certain style of wig for a character it can be hard to find that perfect wig online or at a costume shop either due to availability or budget. So making your own could be a useful skill you have in your back pocket when cosplaying or costuming. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>but is this something we can expect to do ourselves? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like many crafts it is something that requires patience and skill. You can't expect to make a magical, handsome, mysterious, captivating, bagelrific etc. wig your first try.</p>

<p>The following is a <strong><em>really brief</em></strong> tutorial of what you can do for a basic wig.</p>

<p>You need hair off course (synthetic or otherwise). The hair will typically be assembled into wefts for the portion of the wig. Wefts are assembled ""rows"" of hair. The units can be sewn or glued together usually to some other material like. You might also know these as hair extensions (which coincidentally make good raw materials for custom wigs). You could make these yourself from existing wigs or ""raw"" hair or purchase them outright. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lwcEJ.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lwcEJ.jpg"" alt=""Simple wefts""></a></p>

<p><sup>Image from <a href=""http://beautybychristinelieu.com/2011/10/one-step-wefts/"" rel=""noreferrer"">beautybychristinelieu.com</a></sup></p>

<p>Depending on the overall design you might need to make other constructs, like a ball base for a pony tail or buns or something, but wefts would be a simple start. You could easily ask several questions about making wefts alone. I will move on assuming that your hair has been treated and /or processed so that it is now straightened (if you made your own wefts from fibre stock). </p>

<p>These wefts, and other parts, will typically be assembled on a cap e.g what you will actually be wearing on your head. Caps can be commercial products specifically designed for wigs or just material that can be used for a cap base like jersey etc. The caps are important as they need to be comfortable and allow your head to breath. That and something you can sew into. </p>

<p>Having a head model, preferably fake, is almost a necessity for assembly and getting a good idea of what the finished product will look like. Bear in mind, model heads are likely not the same shape and size as your own and that adjustments will need to be made to compensate for the size difference.</p>

<p>You then just need to sew the wefts to the cap. Examples of in progress wigs:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sPOUDm.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sPOUDm.png"" alt=""Example of sewing a weft on a cap""></a></p>

<p>As you progress you will likely need to use a combination of at least water and or heat to help form the wig into shape while also preventing damage to the hair while you work. One of the tips I read is that when sewing don't sew into the weft but into the hair as to not damage the weft. </p>

<p>Again this was a really simplified overview of a wig making process. Depending on you wig needs things can get pretty crazy but you will still be doing much of the above as your base in most cases. I hope this gives you a little incentive to consider wig making in the future. </p>

","<p>There are several characteristic for a paper that should influence your choice :</p>

<h2><strong>The weight</strong></h2>

<p>The higher this value will be the thicker and the studier the paper will be. It is usefull to have a rather high value, because you will be able to erase or burnishing, without completely destroying your paper. Personnaly I thing that having 200 gsm is enough, but maybe if you erase a lot and have hard pencils it would be a good idea to aim higher.</p>

<h2><strong>The tooth</strong></h2>

<p>It designs the microscopic grains on the paper that hold the pigments. Thus a paper with more tooth, will be able to receive more layers. But it is possible to apply several layers on paper with less tooth, but your first will have to be very light, otherwise the paper will saturate fast. On the other hand if the paper is very rough, you will have a different finish than on a smooth surface.<br>

<h2><strong>Products</strong></h2>

<p>You can try some hot press watercolor paper, and maybe cold press if you feel like you can't layer as much as you wish.

Know how many colors you want to include in the stenciled image.These factors will affect the amount of materials you need and the number of stencils you need to create.</li>
<li>Draw an initial sketch of the image- At this point, you are only trying to develop the image that will become the stencil. You can experiment with patterns or attempt to hone a design that you had intended from the start.</li>
<li>Choose the type of stencil material 
cardboard or foam board are good for large, simple stencils on flat surfaces.

<li>Paper works for a single-use stencil on either flat or rounded surfaces.</li>
<li>Poster board holds up better than paper and can be used on flat or slightly rounded surfaces.</li>

"What would happen if I machine laundered dry clean only fabric before making it into a garment?","200","","<p>Common wisdom is to wash your fabric before sewing in the same way you plan to wash the finished project. This way any shrinkage from machine washing will happen before cutting out your pieces, and it won't shrink more after you've sewn it up.</p>

<p>Along those lines, I recently read a sewing blog post about how the author was making a jacket from fabric marked ""dry clean only"", so she took the fabric to a dry cleaner before cutting out her pieces.</p>

<p>That got me thinking. What if I <em>didn't</em> want to take my jacket to a dry cleaner? Could I just pre-wash the fabric in a machine, sew the jacket, and it'd be safe to machine wash? What would the consequences be?</p>
","<p>I think it really depends on the fabric.</p>

<p>If the manufacturer of the fabric states that it should be dry cleaned, that's probably a signal that they're serious about it. Silk and wool can often be hand-washed in very gentle shampoo as a way of pre-shrinking the fabric... but some fabrics simply don't tolerate washing well. They lose their look or shape when soaked in water, so even pre-washing won't do much for you. Another consideration is colorfastness... apparently some brightly-colored silks can lose their color when washed.</p>

<p>From a <a href=""http://drycleanersatlanta.com/2013/10/what-fabrics-can-and-cant-be-dry-cleaned/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dry cleaner's website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first determination is whether or not the fabric can be submersed in water. Fabrics such as cashmere and wool are susceptible to losing shape in full submersion and will likely shrink, so typical washing should be avoided. Another gentle fabric is silk. An extremely delicate material, silk can be hand washed; however, it should never be complete submerged nor agitated in a washing machine.  [. . . ]</p>
  
  <p>While some fabrics may be washed, like certain chiffon, satin, and lace articles, additional care must be taken when ironing. A dry cleaning process offers a safer alternative to typical ironing, making it more effective for a wider variety of products.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're making a structured jacket and you want to retain the crisp lines and smooth drape, you probably don't want to machine wash your jacket as it may destroy the cut and the work you put into it. Now, if it's a casual jacket that doesn't need to look ""neat"" or ""sharp"", your washing regimen likely won't matter but keep that in mind.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""https://www.craftsy.com/blog/2014/01/how-to-wash-fabric-before-sewing/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">another quote</a> that sort of peeved me - it's tangentially related and I thought it might be valuable here... </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: I was wondering, does it mean all the Big Designer Labels pre-launder all their fabric before production?</strong></p>
  
  <p>Graceful Sewing<br>
  June 1st, 2015<br>
  No, they do not. That is often the only reason that garments purchased from them have to be dry cleaned. If they had preshrunk the fabric, we could toss it in the washer and it would do fine. But because they skip this step, we are left with huge dry cleaning bills so they could save a few dollars and make us think we are. Also, on clothing that is washable, you will often find the the seams are a just little gathered coming out of the dryer, or that the garment is not quite on grain like it was (that why our garments tend to look old quickly). The best way to handle these is to gently tug on each end of the seams (particularly in knit fabrics) and straighten it out while warm. The lay the garment out flat or neatly fold it without wrinkles and let it set until it cools completely. If the garment is twisted off grain, gently tug on the two shorter corners to pull it back into alignment and then proceed as above. Your clothing won’t have the advantage of custom-made (and preshrunk) does, but it will look better and last longer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, my interpretation here is that, yes, to a degree, if the fabric is pre-washed, it may affect the final outcome's washability... so it's not <em>only</em> the fabric type that determines the washing method on store-bought clothing.</p>

<p>Another interesting source is on <a href=""https://www.thelaundress.com/clean-talk-blog/which-dry-clean-only-items-actually-need-to-be-dry-cleaned.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Laundress</a> where they go through various fabric types and garment styles to hash out what can and can't be washed at home. The ones that relate to fabrics specifically include</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't wash viscose (it shrinks, often unevenly)</li>
<li>Don't wash polyamide blends (they grow)</li>
<li>Don't wash ""structured"" items - ties, blazers with shoulder pads</li>
<li>Don't wash suede &amp; leather - if marked ""not washable"" or ""Dryclean only""</li>
<li>Don't wash fur with skin</li>
</ul>

<p>There's actually not too much on this list, amusingly... so it seems that, provided you do some research on <strong>how</strong> to wash anything else properly (<strong>that does not mean you can toss everything in your washer, though</strong>), you should be able to avoid dry clean only clothes to a large extent.</p>

"How do I get my jewelry wire to be the right stiffness?","198","","<p>I would like to create wire and wire-wrapped jewelry. I know what gauge wire is appropriate for the size of the piece, but I keep buying wire that is too pliable and won't hold its shape like I would want for thin rings, ear wires, etc.</p>

<p>What factors can tell me if a type of wire will be the right stiffness (aside from actually testing it in a store)? Is there anything I can do to make my wire more or less pliable?</p>
","<p>There are three grades of hardness in jewellery wire:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Full-hard</strong>, which is tempered wire that is very stiff. It's rarely used, because it's just <em>too</em> stiff for most jewellery.</li>
<li><strong>Half-hard</strong>, which is hardened during manufacture but is not fully tempered and is not so hard. It's pliable by hand, but you need to use some force to do it and pliers are often easier. This is the stuff you want for most jewellery (excluding things that need to bend such as necklaces (though you should be looking at chain for those anyway)).</li>
<li><strong>Dead-soft</strong>, which is just plain wire that hasn't been at all hardened. This needs minimal force from your hands to bend. I suspect you've been buying this kind of stuff.</li>
</ul>

<p>The hardness also depends to an extent on the material - the cheaper stuff like copper and brass is generally manufactured at softer grades.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that you can also harden existing soft wire by either applying heat to it (i.e. a blow-torch or other high-intensity heat - a match won't do it) and then quenching it (drop it straight into cold water), or applying pressure to it (hammer it - just remember that this also reduces the diameter).</p>

<p>You can ask when you're buying the wire what grade it is, or look on whatever packaging it comes in to see if it's marked.</p>

<p>We found a cheap long sleeve black shirt to modify with a lace/pearl edging to emulate Anne's dress. However, it's a v-neck shirt, deep enough that it is inappropriate to wear to school (or really anywhere) if I simply cut a rectangle down to that length.</p>

<p>How can I modify the shirt to pull the point of the V higher and make a rectangle neck that matches the desired look?</p>
","<p>I recommend that you ignore the depth of the V in your v-neck shirt and cut the square where you want it to be (allowing for seams, obviously). Then, using the cut-out material, you can use it as a modesty panel to fill in the space where the tip of the V is to make a full square neck.</p>

<p>What you do with this notch is up to you. You can try to make it blend in by stitching it flat or you can use some of your embellishments to make it an accent to the center of the square.</p>

"Why can't you tool chrome-tanned leather?","194","","<p>It seems to be common knowledge in the leather working community that chrome tanned leather doesn't work for tooling, I.E. carving and debossing, but I've never seen any explanation as to why this is so.</p>

<p><strong>What properties does chrome tanned leather have that make it unsuitable for tooling, and how does the process of chrome tanning give it these properties when vegetable tanning does not?</strong></p>
","<p>So, I did some research, and although I never found anything that specifically said ""This is why you shouldn't tool chrome-tanned leather,"" the information that I did find suggests a reason.</p>

<p>Lots of resources describe the difference between chrome- and vegetable-tanning.  I think this quote (from the <a href=""http://www.goldbarkleather.com/selecting-the-right-leather-for-your-project"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GoldBark Leather site</a>) summarizes things pretty well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s a lot that goes into each of these tanning processes. What’s important to know is that one uses vegetal oils (from tree bark) to tan and another uses chemicals (chromium) to tan it. Vegetal tanned leather, generally referred to as veg tan, takes a longer amount of time to create, is considered higher quality, and therefore costs more. Chrome tanned leather has a quicker turn around time and therefore costs less.</p>
  
  <p>The end product of these two processes are drastically different. Veg tan is generally thicker, more firm, and more durable. It’s the kind of leather you see in a nice pair of leather shoes. Chrome tanned is thin, very stretchy, and less durable. It’s the kind of leather that you see in a car that has a leather interior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.carryology.com/insights/chrome-vs-vegetable-tanned-leather/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Carryology site</a> also has some interesting information about the actual chemical processes and how they differ. It explains that in vegetable tanning, tannin molecules displace the water molecules that are bound into the collagen within the leather. In chrome-tanning, chrome molecules replace the water molecules within the collagen. It goes on to explain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>chrome ions displacing the water and binding with the collagen are much smaller than vegetable tanning molecules. This generally makes chrome tanned leather thinner and softer than vegetable tanned leather.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because I don't know anything about tooling leather, I did some searching about that process, and ran across some good information on <a href=""https://www.thehighroad.org/index.php?threads/tooling-and-stamping-leather.752239/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this forum posting</a>. From the fourth entry:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You simply can't tool, carve, or stamp Latigo or oil softened leather
  like you tried to use.</p>
  
  <p>You need to start with Vegetable Tanned Tooling Leather. It's almost
  white, and almost hard when you buy it.</p>
  
  <p>Then wet it damp, but not soaking wet. Then wrap it in a towel and let
  it set for an hour or so to 'case' it. That allows the moisture to
  work through the leather fibers and prepare it for tooling.</p>
  
  <p>Once it reaches damp, but not dry enough to turn light color again.
  You can carve &amp; stamp it to your hearts content. It takes tooling,
  molding, and shaping around a gun almost like modeling clay!</p>
  
  <p>Then once dry and oiled, it will retaing the stamping &amp; shaping
  forever.</p>
  
  <p>Avoid belly and leg cuts as it is soft &amp; stretchy and will not retain
  its shape.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once I read this information, it seems obvious why chrome-tanned leather won't work well.  Chrome-tanning reduces exactly those elements that make a piece of leather appropriate for tooling--thickness and stiffness.  </p>

<p>However, I did locate one recipe specifically for gilding from an SCA member's website:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>1 part sugar water (the sticky part that allows the gold to adhere)</li>
  <li>4 parts liquitex acrylic gesso (adds the bulk to your gesso)</li>
  <li>5 parts liquitex gloss varnish medium (keeps the gesso together,    hardening with a smooth finish)</li>
  <li>Color to suit (red for work with gold and blue for silver)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It goes on to give instructions for the gilding process as well, including how to use the gesso:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Lay the Gesso</strong> – Start your area of gesso in the middle of your design
  and pull it outwards towards the edges*.  It is ideal to let this
  gesso dry for 6-8 hours. DO NOT to get air bubbles in your gesso when
  you stir. Gently fold your gesso to remix it.  If you do have air
  bubbles in your laid gesso there will be pits in the surface after it
  dries.  To remove the bubbles from gesso that you’ve just laid take a
  pin and gently pop them before it begins to dry.  It has been my
  experience that the key to beautiful raised gilding is an even surface
  tension to the ""bubble"" of gesso that you lay down.  To create an even
  surface tension to your gesso you should first drop a large puddle of
  the gesso into the space you will be gilding, then using your brush
  pull the edges of the puddle outwards to the fill your designed space.
  This gesso is not designed for flat gilding and your design should be
  filled in with puddles of the gesso that create small domes on your
  page.</p>

<p>Color pencils are not strong enough to hide the normal pencil. Example: Orange color pencil will not hide the underlying HB graphite pencil <em>outline</em>.</p>

<p>How to draw mandala when I intend to color it with pencil colors?</p>
","<p>I can only think of a few options.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don't worry about masking or hiding the sketch. Make bold, dark outlines on purpose. Sketch the pattern you want in graphite, then draw the lines very dark (in graphite, or even ink). This does give the final result something of a ""coloring book"" feel, which may not be what you're wanting.</p></li>
<li><p>Sketch outlines in the color of their section, or in some very light color (e.g. yellow, pale blue), instead of with graphite. This requires more planning of what colors will go in what part of the pattern.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw the outlines dark and bold, and put a second sheet of paper over top to trace those dark lines in the lighter colors of the final drawing. This is easier if you have a light board, but still possible even on a tabletop with sufficiently thin paper.</p></li>

"What can I do to make drawing this angle easier?","177","","<p>This here's the angle I mean:</p>

<p>The face-turned-down-eyes-looking-up angle. It makes for a wide variety of expressions, from innocent to intense to creepy. </p>

<p>It's something I'd like to master, but it never looks right to me when I draw it, especially from a full front perspective. </p>

<p>I think it's something about the neck\shoulders that I'm doing wrong, but I'm clueless how to adjust it. Here is one of my attempts.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Us4aL.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Us4aLm.jpg"" alt=""My attempt at drawing.""></a> </p>
","<p>Here are some key differences I noticed between the reference image and your drawing:</p>

<ul>
<li>The relative location of the pupils. If the subject is looking up at you, the pupils should be at the top of the eyeball, so there should be more white showing at the bottom of the eye.</li>
<li>The relative locations of the mouth/nose/chin. Since you are viewing the face from an oblique angle, the nose and mouth should be closely spaced and near the chin. The nose line will also seem longer than when faced head-on.</li>
<li>The position of the shoulders: in the image, her shoulders intersect at the level of her nose, about halfway up her face. In your drawing, the shoulders are at the level of the chin. Try moving them up.</li>
</ul>

<p>The hair line looks good to me! At this angle you will see a lot more hair than usual, since you're viewing most of the top of the head.</p>

<p>Now for techniques: When drawing poses like this, I find it very helpful to sketch out a ""wireframe"" of the head. I use a roughly spherical shape for the cranium (pinched a little where the chin goes, like a rounded teardrop), then place the eyes on the equator line and the nose about 1/3 up from the chin. There are more ""formulas"" for these and other facial feature proportions you can search for if you're interested, but since your character is already stylized you can probably just eyeball the rest. (Sometimes I even use a wireframe method on the eyeballs themselves, if they are detailed enough! It helps me place and shape the eyelids as well as shade accurately.)</p>

<p>The neck and shoulders are probably trickiest to place. Remember that the neck connects at the back of the head near your ears, so when you rotate the head downwards, it will be from that connection point. That is, you're <em>not</em> just rotating the head-sphere around its center (and keeping it in the same position relative to the shoulders), you're flopping it forward over the shoulders.</p>

<p>Here's a very rough example of what I mean (sorry for MS paint.. limited options on my lunch break!):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GqwBw.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GqwBw.png"" alt=""wireframe example""></a></p>

<p>The initial shape is black, guidelines are red, and features added afterwards are blue.</p>

<p>All that said, I strongly recommend finding reference photos as you have done here, and trying to copy them - not tracing, just studying as you recreate it. The suggestion in the comments to attempt the pose yourself is a very good one too! Many artists (<a href=""http://www.boredpanda.com/mirror-facial-expression-disney-animator/"" rel=""noreferrer"">animators, famously</a>) keep a mirror at hand so they can check how a particular expression or pose looks.</p>

<p>And as always, practice makes perfect - as you draw more faces in more poses, you'll develop a better intuition of where to place features without needing to think about it as much.</p>

"What is a good set of tools for a beginner in leather working?","176","","<p>I've always wanted to craft a small bag out of leather for myself, and I've seen <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=leather+tools&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH6fjg4tvVAhWCJCYKHSGRCJUQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=1855&amp;bih=953"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">so many different tools</a> to use for leather. </p>

<p>For a beginner, what types of tools would you recommend? </p>

<p>Are there any great beginner tool sets that you know of that aren't very expensive?</p>
","<p>The specific tools you need will depend on exactly what you want to do and the material you're working with; the list below covers both the tasks required to make a bag and the tools necessary to complete them, and assumes that you're using normal, veg-tanned, undyed leather.</p>

<h3>Task: Cutting</h3>

<p>You'll need some way of cutting the leather to shape. I like to use an <strong>ordinary scalpel</strong>, with a fresh blade, but a <strong>craft knife</strong> or <strong>Stanley knife</strong> will also do. You'll also need <strong>something to cut on</strong> and a <strong>steel ruler</strong> to keep your lines straight. For thin (&lt;2mm) leather, chunky fabric scissors will also work but won't leave as neat an edge.</p>

<h3>Shaping</h3>

<p>Veg tanned leather can be moulded by soaking it in <strong>water</strong> (which I assume you have access to) and forming it to the desired shape. No additional tools needed.</p>

<h3>Task: Sewing</h3>

<p>To attach your bits of leather you'll either need to sew or rivet it together. If you're sewing you'll need a <strong>pricking iron</strong>, <strong>awl</strong> or <strong>stitch punch</strong> to make holes in the leather (you can't just sew straight through with a needle like you can with fabric) and a thick <strong>needle</strong> and strong <strong>thread</strong>.</p>

<p>You may also want a <strong>stitch groover</strong> to make a groove for the stitching to sit in. This keeps it from sticking out above the surface of the leather, which helps protect the stitching from wear and tear (think the stitching on the soles of shoes, for example).</p>

<h3>Task: Riveting</h3>

<p>If instead you want to rivet the leather, you'll need an appropriately sized <strong>hole punch</strong> and a <strong>hammer</strong>, or a pair of <strong>punch pliers</strong> to make the holes for the rivets to go through. You'll then need <strong>rivets</strong> to go in these holes and a <strong>rivet setter</strong> or pair of <strong>rivet setting pliers</strong> to fix them in place.</p>

<p>The above tools are all that are strictly necessary for a functional item; those below will help make it look better and last longer</p>

<h3>Task: Finishing &amp; Dyeing</h3>

<p>There are lots of different ways of finishing leather, but most come down to some combination of <strong>dyes</strong> and <strong>oil based finish</strong>. For more information, see <a href=""https://crafts.stackexchange.com/questions/3100/how-can-i-treat-leather-with-dyes-and-keep-it-protected?rq=1"">this previous question</a></p>

<h3>Task: Edge Finishing</h3>

<p>It's normal to bevel and slick the edges of a piece of leather using <strong>edge bevellers</strong> and <strong>edge slickers</strong></p>

<h3>Task: Embossing &amp; Carving</h3>

<p>To emboss (technically deboss, as the design is lowered not raised) you'll need <strong>stamps</strong> and a <strong>hammer</strong>. Carving can be done with any kind of <strong>knife</strong>, but there are specialist knives specifically designed for it too.</p>

<h3>Task: Lining</h3>

<p>If you want to line your bag with a layer of fabric, then you'll need <strong>fabric scissors</strong> and a <strong>needle &amp; thread</strong> as a minimum.</p>

<p>I don't know where you live, so can't recommend any brands to you, but I personally buy from <a href=""http://www.leprevo.co.uk/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LeProvo</a> here in the UK. Their site also contains pictures of all the tools listed above, which should help you to match their names to their forms.</p>

"What kind of art style is this? (Close to precisionism...!)","176","","<p>this is sort of a follow-on question from the <a href=""https://crafts.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/321/where-can-i-get-advice-on-identifying-an-artist-or-style"">this question</a>, and after reading <a href=""https://crafts.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/212/what-guidelines-should-we-set-for-identification-style-questions"">this set of guidelines</a>, I'm still not entirely sure I'm in the right place or asking the right question. Still, nothing ventured...</p>

<p>I'm currently trying to find a particular methodology with which I can texture the environments in a computer game (stay with me here!). I'm drawn to the clean, low-frequency detailing from a game published in 1995, Delphine's <a href=""https://youtu.be/F6lSCQLgWqM?t=295"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fade to Black</a> (have skipped to the start of the game here). On the PC this mixed gourad-shaded polygons for objects and characters with stark, low-resolution textures for most of the game.</p>

<p>I've always been attracted to low-poly art in CG, and precisionist art in traditional mediums, as seen in the following examples...<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RaOPC.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RaOPC.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Note - hard shadows, distinct blocks of colour with gradients. There are a few games which have borrowed from this style - Ico, Team Fortress 2, Rime (among others) and I think it might work for the game I currently have in mind.</p>

<p>That said - the Fade to Black wall texturing seems to my eyes (despite being a low-res texture map) a little more impressionistic/abstract than Sheeler, Smart et al. Details and folds are hinted at with a simple block of dark green, rust is implied with a couple dabs of brown. In fact, there's a touch of the screaming pope to it, to my eyes...<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EnqJp.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EnqJp.jpg"" alt=""Francis Bacon, Screaming Pope""></a>
Obviously Bacon's work is wayy more detailed and frantic, but I can't help but think that the impressionistic, low frequency detail of the Fade To Black environment texturing has more in common with Bacon than the totally cool, remote Sheeler.</p>

<p>So my question is: Does anybody know of a particular style of art which combines precisionism with elements of impressionism, daubs of paint, implying detail etc.? Does anybody have any examples of this that I could investigate?</p>

<p>In truth, I'm a bit of a traditional art ignoramus, but I think this might be useful research for my project.</p>

<p>Tip of the hat to Catija for advice, hope this isn't too far off into the weeds.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance. =)</p>

<p>--Rev</p>

<p>PS: Sorry that the question rambles, I'm having a little trouble forming my thoughts on this.</p>
","<p>What you're talking about isn't just one style or school, but it sounds like you may like works coming from: scuola metafisica, surrealism, American modernism, American realism, expressionism, and symbolism. </p>

<p>Now, as I said, the characteristics you described don't define any school of fine art in particular, so within those schools there will be works that do and don't fit what you're looking for. </p>

<p>Definitely check out Egon Schiele and Giorgio de Chirico.</p>

"As a calligraphy beginner, what features should I look for in an ink?","172","","<p>I want to use a variety of pens, nibs and papers and want a general all-round ink I can use for all (or most) of these cases. From a beginners perspective—which calligraphy inks would be easiest to work with in this situation?</p>

<p>Ideally I am looking for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minimal or no preparation of the ink (no need to dilute the ink, for example).</li>
<li>Ink doesn't clot or dry too quickly (mid-use or in the bottle).</li>
<li>An even spread of ink on paper.</li>
<li>No excessive running or bleeding of ink on paper.</li>
<li>Easy to clean pens, nibs, spills etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>What I want is to be able to focus on the calligraphy, not if my ink is clogging up my pen, wether I need to dilute my bottle some more or if the ink is going to soak through my paper.</p>

<p>I know there are dye-based inks and pigment-based inks, apart from differences in specific brands what features should I look for?</p>
","<ul>
<li><p>All the liquid calligraphy inks I know of are ready to use, no dilution required.</p></li>
<li><p>Pigmented ink must be well mixed before use for the pigment to be uniformly dispersed.</p></li>
<li><p>I find acrylic ink sometimes hard to remove from the nibs if not immediately cleaned</p></li>
<li><p>Iron Gall ink flows well and is a pleasure to use but requires an acid free paper. The ink will look very clear at first but will darken when drying.</p></li>
<li><p>India Ink (what's called 'encre de chine' in French) is probably the easiest to find and to use. A good one size fits all.</p></li>
<li><p>Chinese calligraphy sometimes uses solid ink stock which is diluted in water on an ink stone. It's OK for brush painting but not easily usable in pens and nibs.</p></li>
<li><p>For pens the main factor is what can you put in them. If it's a cartridge system you're more or less limited to what is available in those. (I have seen refillable cartridges before, but they looked like a mess to fill.)</p></li>

"Calligraphy pens not laying ink evenly","172","","<p>I have a few calligraphy kits, with an assortment of some 20 nibs among them. I believe most are Manuscript brand. They all take the cartridges, and are not dip pens. </p>

<p>Out of the box, none of them are laying down ink evenly for the full width of the nib. They also stop and stutter often. </p>

<p>I've tried new inks, different types of paper, cleaning the nibs, and even attempting to bend the tips of my duplicate nibs. </p>

<p>How do I troubleshoot why the nibs don't work, and go about fixing the problem? </p>

<hr>

<p>As requested, here are some examples.</p>

<p>I have more success with perfect verticals, applying an even but firm pressure and keeping the nib perfectly level. But, even then I'll have swaths where there's 0 ink flow.</p>

<p>I haven't found a single nib yet that's working proper, and most are completely unused due to frustration.</p>

<p>If I set the pen down for a few minutes, it stops working completely until I spend a minute doing the flow techniques again.</p>
","<p>Inkflow with any liquid-ink pen has to do with capillary action and liquid/air exchange. If a pen is skipping, the flow is being interrupted. Check that there are no obstructions along the nib or nib slit(s), and then check the feed (the plastic bit against the nib) of the pen.  It could simply be an air gap that's fixed by flushing, or the feed may be too tight against the nib. Air has to get <em>into</em> the cartridge for the ink to get out.</p>

","<p>You need to start with a sketch frame and fill it in from there. You're not going to be able to freehand draw it (without a ton of practice).</p>

<p>Start with a circle, decide how many radials you want (in your last example there are 16) and then sketch them in using a protractor to get them even.</p>

<p>I'd start with two perpendicular lines, then do the 45 degree lines (that makes 8) and then split those in half every 22.5 degrees... that gets you the 16. Keep splitting them further in half if you want the sections smaller.</p>

<p>So, with 16, you'll have something like this (you could probably actually just use this image and trace it or work on a light table):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cYSpNm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cYSpNm.jpg"" alt=""Circle divided evenly into 16 sections through the center""></a></p>

<p>From there, sketch in a ring everywhere you want a main point to be, say every inch (~2.5 cm). There's no need for them to be equally spaced, though. You can always start with a smaller design 4-6 inch diameter and then add to it later.</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JjaXtm.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JjaXtm.png"" alt=""Circle with uneven concentric rings""></a></p>

<p>Once you have the frame, fill in one of the wedges (or two/three if you want the full mirror effect).</p>

<p>Once the wedge is done, mirror it for the wedge next door. Use the rings to keep the placement. At this point, it's just the matter of filling everything in properly. If you do it correctly, you should have a perfect mandala at the end.</p>

<p>It's going to end up being similar to the process of duplicating a photograph or drawing using a grid pattern and filling in the grid rather than trying to draw it from scratch. Here's an example:</p>

I am afraid that polishing again will remove the colour (is this correct?). What paint would be good for this job, provided that I want it to be</p>

<ul>
<li>Relatively transparent, to see the wood through the colour (i.e., no acrylic);</li>
<li>Relatively cheap (i.e. no varnish &ndash; I will use fully transparent varnish at the end, but don't have the budget to buy many different colours of varnish just for this);</li>

","<p>Not sure if you want to hear this but this is better handled <em>before</em> finishing as supposed to mitigating after the fact. Either way I think you need to sand the roughness out you have first then do something to prepare the edges for finishing. In your case finishing would be painting. </p>

<h2>Preparing Plywood Edges</h2>

<p>Plywood surfaces are usually finish ready. That is not the case with edges. For larger project you can use banding/veneer or solid wood edging. In your case those would not be ideal since you are working 3mm board. What I think you should do is apply some compound along the edges. You have choices here but you can use wood filler/putty or something simple like drywall mud/compound. Your workflow should be something like this</p>

<ol>
<li>Sand edges.</li>
<li>Liberally apply compound of choice. This will ensure you get gaps between the plies if they exist. </li>
<li>Sand again to get smooth finish.</li>
</ol>

<p>I spoke in the comments about the <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/6/whats-the-purpose-of-raising-the-grain-before-finishing-a-furniture-piece"">raised grain</a>. This is the wood swelling from moisture contact. This is a normal occurrence and <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1767/finish-raised-the-grain"">can similarly happen in engineered wood products</a>. This is more dealt with solid wood products. Plywood still contains solid wood though. Read some of those links to Woodworking.SE that cover those topics in more detail. </p>

<p>When you raise the grain and go to sand it again you are just trying to remove the raised grain and not sand the surface of the wood. Doing so will expose more grain and you likely will have the same problem. </p>

<p>I am not convinced that is your issue from the picture. The edges of your wood there really look like tear out or blow out from the saw. Even if I am wrong the following suggestions would still be useful for the future. </p>

<h2>Prevent Tear-Out</h2>

<p>When cutting wood like this you can try to prevent tearing of the wood fibers, on thin wood like this, by having tape on both sides. Something simple like masking or painters tape can help stop that. You still have to sand of course afterwards. </p>

<p>One other thing to keep in mind is that the family of saws used for this work (coping, fret and others) almost exclusively only work on the forward or back stroke. It depends how you have the blade mounted of course. Don't but force when the teeth are not going to cut. </p>

<h2>Paint</h2>

<p>Unfortunately I don't have any suggestions about the paint since I usually use acrylic for applications like this. However you could try thinning the paint with water if you want a more opaque effect.  </p>

"How can I attach a large satin applique to a skirt?","164","","<p>I'm making a skirt, and I'd like to attach an applique of a thin satiny fabric to the thicker base fabric. It's going to be in the shape of a city skyline, with the satiny stuff as the buildings. It's a circle skirt, like this:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XWUmq.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XWUmq.png"" alt=""Gotham city skyline skirt""></a>
except the buildings will go all the way around. I'm going to use a bias tape for the bottom hem of the skirt, and I have the waist all figured out too. but I don't know how to attach the top, cut-out edge of the black satin. </p>

<p>It won't be able to take much heat from ironing, and will probably need to be hemmed to keep fraying apart. If I try to glue it on, the glue will probably show through. </p>

<p>My original plan was to cut the black as one big round and jagged piece, fold over a hem along the top and sew it on with a sewing machine. I'm abandoning this idea due to not having really used a sewing machine in years and because of all the turning and narrow bits and detail required. The project is also too big to be able to keep flat and even in a sewing machine. Furthermore, I'm not sure if I can make a crisp hem with limited ability to iron the fabric.</p>

<p>Alternative ideas have been some kind of iron-on stuff to stick them together, or some kind of spray-on sticky stuff, but I don't have any experience with that kind of thing, so I don't know what to choose. Plus, they may require heats greater than what this fabric can stand.</p>

<p>The technique that would probably look best would be to hand sew the entire thing with a small blanket stitch, but that'd be a LOT of sewing- and I only have 2 weeks to finish it. </p>

<p>Finally, a last case idea was to abandon the satin altogether and use fabric markers or paint to make the buildings, but I would prefer the look of the fabric.  </p>
","<p>The ""iron-on stuff to stick them together"" that you'd heard about is called <strong>fusible interfacing.</strong> For satin, you will be looking for a ""lightweight"" or ""feather"" interfacing that has heat-activated adhesive.</p>

<p>It only needs a second or less of contact with an iron to melt to fabric, and  will not bleed through like glue. I recently used it to attach lace to satin, and it performed beatifully. Satin to a thicker base fabric should be similarly successful. Just make sure your iron isn't on the hottest setting -- neither the fabric nor the interfacing need that much heat :)</p>

"On what factors does choosing pencil shading technique depend?","162","","<p>There are different types of shading techniques like criss cross, straight lines, circular shading, blending, scribbling, and dot shading (drawing dots close to each other).</p>

<p>Of course there are not hard and fast rules in drawing, but there are guidelines. Hence the question - on what factors does choosing shading technique depend?</p>
","<p>The shading techniques you mentioned are generally used in pen and ink artwork. This is commonly visible in comic strips (printed in newspapers).</p>

<p>There is no need for these techniques in pencil, since graphite is easily smoothed into a steady transition from one color to another.</p>

<p>Ink does not smear the way graphite does and you cannot effectively shade an object in pen without the use of the various shading techniques you mentioned.</p>

<p>As far as which one you should use, it's all a matter of preference. Some artists choose to combine the different styles in a single work, while others pride themselves in completing an entire art project with a single style of shading (stippling is my favorite).</p>

<p>In short, you would be hard pressed to find this style of shading done in pencil, it's primarily for mediums which don't allow you to fade from one color to the other without some sort of illusion helping.</p>

"When mixing paint colours, what is a good technique for ensuring consistent ratios each time a new batch needs to be created?","162","","<p><strong>Some Background</strong></p>

<p>Back in 2014, I made a ""wand"" out of a wooden dowel, and some glue gun glue for the handle. The ""wand"" part was a single pre-made colour, but for the handle, I mixed together a few different colours to create a nice brown-ish colour. Once I was satisfied, I began to happily paint the handle, unaware that I had not mixed enough of the colour. Once I began to run out, I attempted to re-mix the colours in roughly the same ratio as best I could remember, but obviously it wasn't exact.</p>

<p>I ended up having to do this at least twice, as far as I remember. I managed to get the colour pretty close, almost indistinguishable, but by the third time, I simply mixed a massive amount and painted over what I had already done.</p>

<p>While this was not the end of the world, it dawned on me that there must be a better way than simply eyeballing amounts and relying on memory to determine ratios.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>How would a more experienced crafter/painter ensure that, if they needed to mix a new batch of a custom colour, they mixed colours in the proper ratios each time?</p>
","<p>It would be helpful to know the order of magnitude of your volumes.</p>

<p>I paint miniatures and so milliliters are often enough. In this case my paints are in dropper bottles and I count the droplets I add to the mix. </p>

<p>For bigger volumes I would use a transparent bottle and make a level mark for each colour I add. So next time the marks could be reused in the same bottle to get the same ratio.</p>

"Why have my paper crafts hung on the wall deformed and what can be done to prevent this?","160","","<p>I cut these butterflies, and hands out of paper, spread gum on them and sprinkled glitter.

the hands are deeply curved, so are the butterflies.</p>

<p>Sticking them to the wall has the demerit that it makes the craft immobile (I live in a 
rented house).</p>

<p><strong>Why did they deform? What all choices do I have now for such future projects?</strong></p>
","<p>I can think of a couple reasons why your paper curled like that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Vertically displayed paper has a tendency to curl more in my experience, especially when it has no support. </li>
<li>The gum/glue itself may be causing or aggravating the curling. Some adhesives and coatings draw, or shrink inward, as they dry. (You see this in nail polish, too, when some thicker top coats cause the color to pull away from the tips.)</li>
</ol>

<p>To counteract the curling, you could try a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Coat both sides of the paper with the gum/glue, or a varnish. The drawing affect would be lessened as it would be trying to curl in both directions at once.</li>
<li>Tape the paper down while working and allow to dry thoroughly, leaving it overnight to 'cure' before removing the tape.</li>
<li>Add a stiffer material as a backing. Thin sheets of metal or wood would be the most stable. But, chipboard or even a heavy cardstock would afford some further support.</li>

<p>Also, please mention the standard name for said paper type. (This will be helpful while purchasing the paper).</p>
","<p>There are many types of paper finishes and each have their own unique characteristics you, the artist, can decide which you want to use. With that in mind, there are some guidelines you can use to select the best paper for your project:</p>

<p><strong>Paper for Graphite</strong></p>

<p>Smooth Bristol (Strathmore) papers are ideal for graphite drawings. They provide a smooth surface ideal for pencil drawings. some others include <em>Stonehenge</em>, <em>Pastel Paper (Strathmore)</em>, and Strathmore 400 and 500 series drawing paper.</p>

<p><strong>Paper for Colored Pencils</strong></p>

<p>Colored pencils require a little texture to the paper to effectively draw and blend colored pencils. There is a much wider variety of viable papers in this category, but some include: <em>Stonehenge</em>, <em>Illustration Board</em>, <em>Suede</em> and <em>Artagian</em> paper (Strathmore).</p>

<p><strong>Paper for Charcoal</strong></p>

<p>Charcoal is a chalky and generally messy medium. It requires a porous or textured paper to effectively hold the charcoal particles on the paper. Simple quick charcoal sketches are often done on Newsprint paper due to its lightly porous nature, and its low cost (sketching can burn through paper).</p>

<p>For finished works using Charcoal there is <strong>Laid Paper</strong> which has an old ""hand made"" style and feel to it. This finish contains horizontal and vertical lines on the paper which create small grooves that are good at catching bits of charcoal and keeping charcoal on the page where it was placed.</p>

"What is yarn weight?","153","","<p>Fiber craft patterns always give a yarn weight. I've seen things like medium and light, but also ""worsted yarn"" or ""DK yarn"". </p>

<p>What does this mean?</p>
","<p>Yarn weight is basically the thickness of a given yarn. There are several ways to refer to yarn weight, but the category, the number of plies, the number of wraps per inch and the gauge range (for both knitting and crocheting) are the most commonly used. The weight of your yarn will affect the size of your finished product, and the size of the needles or hook you will have the most ease to work with. You will always it on your skein package.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LouGj.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LouGj.jpg"" alt=""Yarn label featuring category and gauge range""></a></p>

<p>There are 8 categories of yarn as defined by the <a href=""http://www.craftyarncouncil.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Craft Yarn Council</a>: Lace, Super Fine, Fine, Light, Medium, Bulky, Super Bulky and Jumbo. Each category refers to a specific range of the measurements methods. Some categories will sometimes be substituted for a type of yarn, like Worsted for Medium or DK (Double Knitting) for Light.</p>

<p>The number of plies is nowadays probably the least consistent way to talk about yarn weight. Back in the day when knitting was done with actual sheep wool, yarn was measured by the number of single wool yarns in the finished yarn, but with synthetic yarn, it's more difficult to be consistent. For example, a 5 ply yarn in Australia will be called a 6 ply yarn in Germany, but not be standardized in the UK. Yarns below 5 ply are generally pretty consistent though.</p>

<p>Wraps per inch (wpi) is the the number of times you can fit a yarn within an inch. The thicker the yarn is, the lower its wpi will be.</p>

<p>The gauge range is the number of stitches you can make in a 4 inch or 10 centimeter swatch. This measurement is always double, once for knitting and once for crocheting.</p>

<p>Here is a table I made:</p>

"Techniques for markers","152","","<p>I was gifted a small set of quality markers (think Copic, not Crayola). The last time I used markers to color was as a kid where I just scribbled in solid colors. The ink was always a little uneven and you could see where the strokes overlap. Since these are nice, I want to make sure I'm  using them properly!</p>

<p>I'm familiar with techniques for acrylic paints, watercolors, and colored pencil. I suspect watercolor techniques are the most similar to markers, as far as layering colors, but there's obviously quite a few differences.</p>

<p>What are some basic techniques for using markers?</p>
","<p>There are a lot of artists online who use Copic markers or a mix of Copic, other brands and even other media like pencils to create texture or white ink for highlights. Often a lot of cool images you see online are actually a mix media of markers and other materials.</p>

<p>Lets start at the beginning though... You mentioned markers you used to use had uneven coloring. Most basic markers or kids markers will do this. Markers like Copic, ProMarkers etc are alcohol based, they don't dry as quickly on the page, allowing you to create a nice block of color or to blend two colors together. </p>

<p>You need to be careful when coloring though, your color edge can dry and then you'll be left with a visible seam in your color block. Always follow the wet edge of color adding to it each time before it dries, and even go back over your colors so you get a solid block of ink down if that's what you're looking for, as the first pass might be a bit uneven depending on your paper type. 
This video will help explain what I mean if you're like me and like to learn visually: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpBpAdQliU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpBpAdQliU</a>.  That YouTube channel actually has a good amount of information on Copics that may help you get started.</p>

<p>So, a great way to start is to practice blending colours together if that's your style. I suggest diving in and using the markers to get a feel for them, I used promarkers for a long time and it took be a little while to get used to them at the beginning because they were very different from what I was used to (Faber Castell / Crayola etc).</p>

<p>Paper is always an important factor to me. Specifically designed marker paper (Daler&amp;Rowney, Letraset, Copic etc all make it) helps maintain control over the ink flow. For me anyway, drawing on regular paper or cardstock meant going too close to the edge of my ink outline risked it leaking beyond - Marker paper was amazing for this and reduced bleed a huge amount for me. It may all depend on your style and what kind of pieces you want to make. Don't just stick with one paper type, try a few and experiment, you'll probably find you prefer different papers for different styles and quickly choose a favorite.   </p>

<p>Aside from blending another great way to use these types of markers is by layering in blocks. Rather than constantly trying to blend seams together, you can make great pieces by being hard and direct with your strokes, or make pieces that feel dynamic and full of motion by being loose and rough. Terrance_Unchained on Instagram is a great example of this. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/terrance_unchained/?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.instagram.com/terrance_unchained/?hl=en</a>. He uses chisel tipped copics a lot of the time to layer down blocks of color. If you follow the link in his profile he does a tutorial on his style. He also uses other inks and pencils etc to highlight and texture areas like I mentioned at the start. One of my favorite techniques of his that gave me an ""omg that's genius moment"" is when he's finishing up a picture, he'll go over the whole thing with the one color to tie all the tones together - I've yet to try this myself but it looks really cool.</p>

<p>Hope this all this helps! Good luck with your Marker adventure!

"How do I cut a popsicle stick lengthwise?","151","","<p>Need to do this for my art project. I tried using a normal wire cutter but the wood just doesnt break</p>
","<p>Your question is limited by not having an indication of the resources available to you. One of the better tools would be a scroll saw, often called a jig saw. The tabletop versions are well suited to light duty cuts such as popsicle sticks.</p>

<p>Another suitable tool, somewhat unwieldy, is the rotary hobby tool, often called a dremel tool, from the brand name frequently associated with this type of item. There are various bits available for this device, but it would be challenging to handle safely for such small pieces.</p>

<p>Only recently, there appears on the 'net a number of videos showing people using either a rotary tool such as the dremel, or a hand drill and even a right-angle disc grinder. The latter is seriously overpowered for this application, but the key feature is that the cutting ""bit"" is a circle of paper. </p>

<p>Multiple circles of the same diameter are cut, glued together using ordinary adhesive and attached to the rotary device. The faster the speed one can manage, the better the results. Even wood as thick as 25 mm (1 inch) is shown being cut with a paper disc!</p>

<p>I used The YouTube, searched for ""cutting with paper"" and found a number of returns. One of them shows the rotary tool at the very start. I did not view the entire video, having seen others representative of this method.</p>

<p>EDIT: An additional method of attacking the sticks would be to use a box knife or similar sharp instrument. Place a solid straight edge on the stick and score repeatedly along the edge. Use as much force as necessary to cut into the surface, but not so much as to crack the stick along grain lines.</p>

<p>If you can ensure exact positioning, consider to score one side then the other before attempting to split the stick in two. It may be necessary to alternate sides when scoring in order to slice completely through the stick.</p>

","<p>When I took jewelry making classes, we used the saw method mentioned in Kellerra's answer section ""the slow way"". </p>

<p>You start by wrapping your desired wire around something round like a dowel to make a ""spring"" of circles and then you cut them apart with a saw.</p>

<p>The best setup I found was to have something... either a dowel or steel bar... with a notch cut in the end as a ""guide"" for your saw blade with the far end held in a giant clamp attached to a table. Here's an image I found that shows what I'm talking about:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/m4jBu.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/m4jBu.jpg"" alt=""Jump ring cutting rig""></a></p>

<p>Use tension in your off-hand to pull the rings towards the blade notch... note that as you cut through each ring, it will drop, so you want something to catch them unless you want to spend an hour finding where they rolled on the floor.</p>

<p>The saws are pretty easy to use once you get the hang of them... but you will probably break tons of blades when you first start out because you're going to have to figure out the right amount of pressure to use that will cut the metal without snapping the blade.</p>

<p>And, once you get used to the saw, this is actually pretty fast. Granted, it's not as fast as some of the machined methods which, if you're really that interested in speed and you can afford it, are a good option... as is simply buying the rings premade, which isn't as expensive as you might fear if you buy in bulk, though it is more expensive than buying the wire alone.</p>

<p>I think you'll find the cuts to be quite a bit cleaner with this method than with a lot of other methods around, particularly using wire cutters.</p>

<p>The tube is definitely made of wood, my guess would be either bent plies or straight barrel staves.  In any event it looks durable.</p>

<p>The covering looks like it is a woven fabric that is skillfully cut and glued to the barrel.  See how it is folded into the opening and reveals some unevenness at the edges where it has been cut to fit the smaller diameter of the inside as compared to the outside of the tube.</p>

<p>My recommendation for removal of the fabric is to use a heat gun that will soften the glue and allow you to peel off the fabric. Easier said than done because the fabric will quite likely tear and require the use of some sort of scraper. </p>

<p>If the glue becomes solid after cooling from the heat treatment you can sand it off.  If it remains tacky, you can use some sort of solvent as @matt suggests.  You definitely want to remove the glue because if not, you will have a rough, irregular surface that will be telegraphed through your shiny black paint - even if it's a thick layer.</p>

","<p><strong>What do you need?</strong><br>
You can make rings out of all metal that can be bend by hand and all that can be hammered into shape.<br>
Wire comes in many sizes. Unless you have a hobby involving metal wire, you will likely not stock it. But a good metal shop will have a few kinds and can often order more for you. </p>

<p><strong>No tools to bend:</strong><br>
The 'easy' way is to have wire which is very soft, the disadvantage is that it will not hold shape will when you have your ring.
Hammering and heat/cold treathment will improve that but it is an extra lot of work.</p>

<p><strong>Clamps needed.</strong>
For a cheap and easy ring, get metal that can not be bend easily, get a wooden dowel (or a round metal bar) and fix that into a clamp on a workbench.
Also clamp one end of the wire, it can be in the same clamp if you can get that working, but if needed you can do it with a second clamp.
Now take the long end of the wire and pull it round the bar, till you have a round turn and a bit, that is till the wire lays next to itself for at least a few mm and it does not spring open.<br>
That will make you a ring which will have an opening, which can be closed by soldering or left open, specially if the ends are made showy.</p>

<p>Now you can saw through the wire, close the ring into a circle and solder that shut. (Check with the supplier of the wire what you need to solder, as different metals need different kind of solder and chemicals to make them work.)<br>
If you are an experienced metal worker you can keep the ends longer than just touching and shape them with whatever you want. (Or you can introduce extra materials like beads or stones, or lumps of metal molten to the ends.)</p>

<p><strong>No thick wire?</strong><br>
With thinner wire you can do a series of full turns, solder them all together and have a ring that is wider than it is thick.
A more involved way to make a ring out of thin wire, not for beginner metal workers nor for beginner knot tyers if without an experienced coach, is a turks head knot. <a href=""http://www.surreyknots.org.uk/images/53_Turk%27s_Head_4_Bight_X_3_Lead_.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">Here you find instructions for string.</a> Search results for <a href=""https://www.google.nl/search?q=knot%20chart%2063%20IKGT&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz3OCblq_VAhWHJVAKHa0NCSsQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1299&amp;bih=702#tbm=isch&amp;q=turks%20head%20ring"" rel=""noreferrer"">rings, mmost in silver and gold.</a></p>

<p><strong>No wire?</strong><br>
Flat metal can be cut to size, hammered around the dowel and then soldered.</p>

<p><strong>Heat treathment (Warning, dangerous hot metal and fire danger):</strong><br>
Place your metal on stone that can take the heat and apply flame till the metal is red hot. Let if cool down naturally/slowly for a soft metal that will take further work.<br>
If you have a fire which is hot enough, like when you burn coal to heat your house, you can use that.<br>
Cool it down as fast as possible by let it drop in cold water, and it will get harder and less likely to bend.</p>

<p><strong>No heat?</strong>
Hammering will make metal harder but also more brittle and more likely to break if you do it too much.</p>

<p><strong>Which metal?</strong><br>
If you can afford it, silver will give you very nice results, also because the result will be real jewelry. I fear that gold will be out of reach for a while longer, it is rather expensive.<br>
I had nice results with coper to play with but it will colour your skin and you should be aware that it has health risks.</p>

<p>When you buy metal and solder and so on, discuss it with the staff in the shop (if they are knowledgable) or research on internet whether the metal can be used for day to day wear.</p>

","<p>White pens and colors are often used to lighten up the shade in art and crafts. Apart from that they have limited uses. As per your requirements, I would suggest you to either go for either a white gel pen or a marker. Unfortunately, ball point pens that have white ink are not easily available and they will not provide the results you are looking for. </p>

"How do I determine what size zig-zag stitch to use?","145","","<p>I have a standard sewing machine, not a serger, so I use a zig-zag stitch when sewing knits. Typically, I just use trial and error on scrap pieces to figure out a good size of zig-zag stitch for however stretchy I want the seams to be. This can take a few tries, and I'm never quite sure if I'm doing it ""right"".</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a better way? Are there any standard sizes or rules of thumb?</li>
<li>When would I want a wider or narrower stitch? What about longer vs. shorter?</li>
</ul>
","<p>This is indeed a matter of preferences, although some generic things can be said about it.<br></p>

<ul>
<li>The wider the stitch, the stretchier the result. Imagine a zig zag stitch of width 0 (which is actually a straight stitch of course), and the result will be as stretchy as the sewing thread.<br></li>
<li>As for the length, my advice is to make them not too small in order to avoid wobbly edges. Something else may help here: a wobbly edge is the result of the fabric being stretched while you're sewing. You could stick some tape on top of the fabric and sew right next to it. <br><strong>Beware: don't use duct tape or something with a very strong glue, as you want to remove the tape afterwards without damaging your project!</strong></li>

"How do I know I've got the right amount of moisture in the paper to wet-fold origami?","145","","<p>I've only had experience dry-folding. The one and only time I attempted to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-folding"" rel=""nofollow"">wet fold</a>, the paper disintegrated.  How do I know when the paper's absorbed the appropriate amount of moisture for wetfolding, where it won't tear along the folds, yet remain pliable long enough to get through the entire model?</p>

<p>Addendum: I've been using typing/printer paper, given that I knew I was liable to screw up a lot at the beginning.</p>
","<p>The amount of water to use will very much depend on the kind of paper you use. Thick watercolor paper can absorb a lot of water and still stay intact while copy paper will disintegrate or at least tear with even a little moisture. This behavior depends on the paper's thickness, fibre length and sizing. Most wet folding tips found on the web (e.g. about using a spray bottle) apply to thicker paper and not to copy paper. Personally, I have never been able to wet fold copy paper and be happy about the result - it comes apart with even very little water.</p>

<p>So, first of all, I suggest you get some watercolor paper, 160-300 gsm for a start. Such papers are widely available in artist supply stores and not terribly expensive. Canson Mi-Teintes is a popular brand that comes in many colors but others should do as well. Then, retry your folding sequence and you should see a huge difference compared to copy paper.</p>

<p>The exact amount of water to use is unfortunately a matter of practice, but when I started wet folding, I always used too much rather than too little. It is easier to re-moisten paper than to dry it quickly, so better start with a smaller amount. You have to remoisten as you fold anyway. For most models, your paper should be damp but not soaking. While 160 or 300 gsm paper feels very stiff and almost not foldable at all when dry, with the right amount of water added it should feel leathery and be able to roll along a smooth curve easily. For some models, you only moisten a certain area of the paper at a time rather than the whole sheet. Also note that moisture takes some time to penetrate the paper, so you should wait a few seconds before applying moisture and checking if the paper has the right properties.</p>

<p>The rest is a matter of experience, so start with thicker paper and give it a try once more.</p>

<h2>Plastisol / Screen Printed Transfers</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are transfers that are screen printed by an outside transfer company or by yourself with the use of screen printing equipment</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Durability</em></strong> – Very Good, often outlasts the life of the garment.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Look/Feel</em></strong> – Identical to screen printing</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Ideal For</em></strong> – Higher quantities, where a repetition of one design is to be printed</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Ease of use</em></strong> – Excellent, just order in transfers and then heat apply with a heat press for the specified time, temperature and pressure</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Advantages</em></strong> – Allows the user to create a screen printed look and feel with just a heat press.  Also will allow you to maintain a blank shirt inventory and apply transfers to size, style and color per order as opposed to the preprinted inventory that is associated with traditional screen printing.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Disadvantages</em></strong> – There is a turn time associated with your custom screen printed transfer order.  And if you decide to offer stock images, like many beach/boardwalk shops, you can potentially have a large transfer inventory.</p>

<h2>Inkjet/Laser Transfer Paper</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paper that can be printed through a desktop inkjet printer or laser printer/copier, then heat applied to your garment.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Durability</em></strong> – Average to Above Average.  For the money, this is one of the best options and is easy to maintain.  Remember to wash the item in cold water, inside out for the first few washes.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Look/Feel</em></strong> – This varies with the brand of paper.  Light color paper is traditionally a softer feel than opaque or dark color paper.  Each has a bit of a plastic like feel to it, right off the bat.  The “box effect” will surround your design with most papers unless you trim around your design with scissors or a vinyl cutter.  We recommend only buying Heat Press Heroes transfer paper, which is designed for our presses to have the best quality.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Ideal For</em></strong> – Lower quantities and personalization, photo realistic prints where durability is not in high demand (ie. tourist destinations, mall kiosks, fairs, flea markets, family reunions, 1 time wear – promotional).</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Ease of use</em></strong> – Average. When dealing with inks and transfer papers knowledge of color correction, dpi, drying time and proper application must be obtained.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Advantages</em></strong> – Quick, inexpensive photo quality prints can be created and transferred over to your garment in a matter of minutes.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Disadvantages</em></strong> – This process is not the most durable over the long term.  Also in most cases the paper needs to be trimmed around with scissors or an optic eye cutter after being printed to eliminate having a box/window around your design.</p>

<h2>Heat Transfer Vinyl</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vinyl material that can be reverse cut on a vinyl cutter, then weeded and heat applied to a garment.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Durability</em></strong> – Excellent, when properly applied the heat transfer vinyl will outlast the life of the garment without cracking, peeling, or fading.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Look/Feel</em></strong> – Ranges per material.  Some materials offer a very soft finish that is matte or dull, while other materials are thick and glossy on the garment.  Specialized materials such as flock have their own characteristics as well.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Ideal For</em></strong> – Lower quantities and personalization, used a lot for names and numbers on sports uniforms, some materials offer a real nice feel for use on fashionable apparel.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Ease of use</em></strong> – Good, the general process involves cutting, weeding and then heating.  The most detailed portion of this process is weeding.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Advantages</em></strong> – Excellent durability and a professional look, a garment can be created very quickly and the process can prove to be profitable on as little as one unique garment.  Can be heat applied virtually anywhere on the garment.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Disadvantages</em></strong> – No photo quality or color gradients can be achieved.  Doing more than 3 layered colors can become labor intensive.  Intricate detail can be labor intensive.</p>

<h2>Digital Print/Cut Media</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Media that can be printed and cut out on a solvent based printer/cutter, and then weeded and heat applied to your garment.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Durability</em></strong> – Very Good, when properly applied some print/cut medias will outlast the life of the garment without cracking, peeling, or fading.  The concern with this process is the ink.  However, when printed with the right type of solvent-based inks the durability can last for a life cycle of a garment.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Look/Feel</em></strong> – Ranges per material.  Some materials offer a very soft finish that is matte or dull, while other materials are thick and glossy on the garment.  Specialized materials such as glitters have their own characteristics as well.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Ideal For</em></strong> – Lower quantities and personalization, used a lot for full color graphics, some materials can be applied to practically any type of fabric.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Ease of use</em></strong> – Average, the general process involves printing, cutting, masking, weeding and then heating.  With proper training and the right equipment this process can be very easy to use.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Advantages</em></strong> – Very good durability and an extremely professional look, combines the durability of the heat transfer vinyl method with the photo-realism of a printer.  This process can offer an excellent solution for dark colored garments or tough to do fabrics, as well as basic t-shirts.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Disadvantages</em></strong> – Cost of equipment and the learning curve (some machines do come with training).</p>

<h2>Sublimation</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A process that involves the printing of a design with special type of sublimation ink and then heat application to a “compatible” garment.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Durability</em></strong> – Excellent, this process will often outlast the garment.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Look/Feel</em></strong> – Excellent, the process involves the dyeing of fabric, so there is virtually no feel to the transferred image.  Very high photo quality results and detail can be achieved.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Ideal For</em></strong> – Lower quantities and personalization, photo realistic prints where durability is in high demand.  Yields very professional results.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Ease of use</em></strong> – Below Average, when dealing with inks, especially sublimation inks, knowledge of color correction, dpi, and proper application are critical.  The very nature of the aftermarket inks being loaded into the recommended Epson printer can create problems with clogging if strict instruction isn’t followed.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Advantages</em></strong> – Highly detailed, photo quality prints can be created and transferred over to your garment in a matter of minutes.  The feel and durability are second to none.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Disadvantages</em></strong> – Cost of inks.  The process of sublimation is also restricted to application onto light colored garments.  Another disadvantages is that these garments must be comprised of at least 65% polyester in content.  Blanks can often be hard to find and/or expensive.</p>

"What is the name of this knit stitch?","142","","<p>I want to make the head band in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5khPDgYkAn8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this video</a>. It's not in English and I'm not familiar with that knitting style as I'm a beginner. Could somebody tell me the name of the knit stitch? </p>
","<p>This pattern is done in moss stitch/seed stitch, which are two names for the same stitch.  There are plenty of resources on line for learning it, but it is really very simple:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Cast on an odd number of stitches (the odd number is really
important) </li>
<li>Each row will be worked the same--start knit 1, purl 1, and repeat to the end of the row</li>
</ul>

<p>Because you cast on an odd number of stitches, each row ends with a knit 1.  When you turn it around to work in the other direction, you work a knit right on top of the last knit stitch, and a purl on top of a purl stitch.  This creates this bumpy texture.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zg9Fc.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zg9Fc.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Knit stitches make a sort of V-shape on the front of the fabric.  Purl stitches make a horizontal line on the front of the fabric.  If you look at the picture closely, you can see that this fabric is made up of horizontal lines with Vs sitting directly on top of the lines. It is actually much easier to see the line of knit ""V""s, if you look at a ribbed pattern*:   </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/i0uOp.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/i0uOp.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Ribbing is made the same way as moss stitch, but you start out by casting on an even number of stitches. In this case, when you finish a row, you end with a purl stitch, and when you go back in the other direction, you work a knit stitch on top of that purl stitch, and then a purl on top of a knit stitch, all the way across. </p>

<p>A ribbed piece has a lot of stretch to it, so it is often used for sweater cuffs, or the bottom of hats, etc. Moss/seed stitch does not stretch much, and will also make the fabric lay flat, rather than the curling you often get with stockinette stitch (all knit stitches in one direction, all purl in the other). </p>

<p>A quick hint I will add for newbies working moss/seed stitch.  When you get to the end of the row, and turn your work, your yarn will be in front of the work, in position for a purl stitch.  In order to work a knit stitch, you have to get the yarn to the back of the work, which you do by carrying the yarn underneath the needle to the back of the piece.  A problem that many new knitters run into is that they actually wrap the yarn over the top of the knitting needles to get it to the back of the work, and then when they work back to that end, they accidentally work this additional loop as if it was a stitch. This is also an issue when working the knit stitch in both directions (called garter stitch), and is the most common reason so many new knitters find that their pieces get wider as they work (and have holes at the edges). </p>

<hr>

<p>*Please note that the second picture actually shows a piece knit using brioche stitch, but it does such a good job of illustrating the ribbing pattern that I used it anyway.</p>

<p><strong>ETA:</strong>  As @jkadlubowska pointed out, the picture labeled Moss Stitch actually shows double moss stitch, meaning that you can actually see are two knit ""Vs"" and two purl bumps.  But just like the brioche stitch sample, I think it easier to see the knit Vs and purl bumps in this picture, so I am leaving it as is.</p>

"How do you properly install canvas keys?","141","","<p>As we discovered in <a href=""https://crafts.stackexchange.com/questions/47/what-are-the-little-pieces-of-wood-that-come-with-pre-made-canvas-for?rq=1"">What are the little pieces of wood that come with pre-made canvas for?</a> those wood pieces are called canvas keys. </p>

I don't get how they are working since it states I am supposed to put them in the mitre slots of the canvas. Would that not break the frame?</p>

<p>Information seems to suggest that canvas keys only have a place for cheaply manufactured frames. Is there something wrong using them on more expensive frames? Do they get used on larger frames as well (ones that are more than 20ft square)?</p>

<p>What are the conditions that would make you want to install canvas keys? How do you install canvas keys properly?</p>
","<p>Canvas keys work by expanding the mitre joints at the corners of stretcher bars (see sketch below). As the canvas keys are driven into their recessed slots on the stretcher bars the canvas, which is fastened to the stretcher bars, slowly tightens.</p>

<p>This action ""depends"" on the mitre joint of the stretcher bars not having been nailed or stapled together.</p>

<p>If the joint is glued, nailed, stapled or rigidly fastened then installing canvas keys will not be able to do their job. Actually, as you point out, driving canvas keys into stretcher bars that have been nailed will break the bars.</p>

<p>Note, once you nail the mitre joint closed you no longer have a stretch, you now have what is called a canvas strainer.</p>

<p>Large painting canvases, ones with cross members, are more the strainer then stretcher variety. </p>

<p>The benefit of a strainer is you have a large ridge frame onto which to fasten your canvas. Large canvases shrink quite a bit as you work with them. So a rigid strong support is required. </p>

"Why do artists use pigments instead of dyes in paintings?","140","","<p>Is there a reason why many famous paintings and artists use pigments instead of dyes as colorants? Some pigments are quite expensive and I am not sure why artists chose them over dyes, which are usually cheaper. </p>
","<p>While more historical artists likely didn't understand the chemical processes behind the behaviors of the two options, the biggest reason is permanence.</p>

<p>Dyes are organic substances that are either soluble in their medium or in their application. This means the structure of it breaks down as part of the application. The structural breakdown, coupled with the organic state is ultimately why dyes are less permanent.</p>

<p>Pigments may be organic or inorganic, but do not break down in their binder or application. Because the structure of the pigment remains intact after application, their application is more permanent assuming it continues to adhere to the surface of the support.</p>

<p>I'm sure that a fair number of artists initially tried dyes over pigments, but in time the knowledge of the behavior differences would have spread from teacher to student. For practice, many may have chosen dyes, but when it came to important works, not likely. Bearing in mind that the expense of many pigments was often born by patrons of a number of the artists, so quality was very likely more important than cost. </p>

<p>It's also worth noting that the extremely expensive pigments, such as lapis lazuli used to make ultramarine, were often reserved for the most important of subjects such as very wealthy nobility or religious works. Less expensive pigments would be mixed for close approximation in other cases.</p>

"How to cut gift cards in order to make a mosaic?","139","","<p>I have a box of ~1000 (void) gift cards of various colors from my old job because I expressed interest in making a mosaic from the colorful plastic bits. </p>

<p>My question is: how to cut them? I've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kitchen Shears: the dull edge is perfect for a plant stem, but it just chews up the tough plastic. It even gets a little opaque white where the cut stresses the material, which ruins the color.</li>
<li>Paper Cutter: good for one precise cut at a time. Takes a long time and dulls the blade rather quickly (and I don't know how to sharpen it).</li>
<li>Paper shredder with credit card attachment: Starts off pretty good, but the blades visibly dulled after a dozen and only cuts in one direction, which necessitates another method anyway.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there some kind of specialty cutter for plastic I could co-opt for my project?</p>
","<p>I have always found one of the appeals of mosaic to be creating non-uniform / random shapes for your art. Both of these options can help capture that.</p>

<h2>Score the card</h2>

<p>If you score one surface of the card, with something like a craft knife, you should be able to make it snap along the score line. In general straighter will be easier to snap off. By all means, you can do curve but if they are too extreme or change directions you will have a tougher time removing them. </p>

<p>Not sure if this will be faster than what you are already doing.</p>

<h2>Freeze the card</h2>

<p>I know that freezing the card and making it brittle will make it so that you can hit it and it should shatter into easy random shapes. I am not sure if a conventional freezer will get the card cold enough.</p>

<p>I just tried it with my old health card and it did work rather well. It snapped in my hands. However, I handled it too much so it warmed up fast and started to bend more then break. I would try keeping in the freezer longer. After some time wrap it in a cloth and quickly hit it again a hard surface. </p>

<p>One method to expidite this process would be to wrap the cards inside wet paper towel. Once the water on the towel freezes it should make it easier to process. Again, not sure if this is worth the effort or not. </p>

"What can I do to reduce pain while crocheting?","138","","<p>I understand that this will happen regardless with this kind of relative motion. Especially with smaller models where your hands are constantly trying to keep proper tension of the yarn.  </p>

<p>Still though, this is something that all crocheters must deal with. I suppose the easiest thing to do is take breaks but I wonder if there is more to it than that. </p>

<p>What, as a crocheter, can I do to help mitigate pain and cramping that I get while working? Perhaps this would apply to knitting as well. </p>
","<p>So I'm a big knitter and crocheter and a musician with tendinitis for the past 20 years. Aside from the standard advice (NSAIDs, massage, etc) there are a few things that you can do to mitigate the situation. </p>

<p>First, make sure that the amount of pressure you're using is the bare minimum amount possible. It may actually take some time to retrain your hands, but it's worth taking the time to do it. You may want to slow down a little bit, focus on using as little effort as possible, and then speed up gradually using the same amount of pressure. </p>

<p>Second, with knitting and crochet you can also mitigate repetitive strain by making your movements as small as possible. This of course has an added bonus of making your stitches a bit faster.</p>

<p>Third, you may want to experiment with different styles and materials of hooks/needles. I can barely use a standard boye aluminum hook, but I find that when the hook has a nice handle, it actually helps a lot. The lightness of the hook and the resistance of the material will also make a difference.</p>

<p>The last point of advice that I have for you is that if you start to feel any pain at all, stop, stretch, and give yourself a few minutes before you go back to it. It might be kind of tedious at first, but if you avoid damage while retraining your muscles to move lighter, smaller, and with less pressure, you should be able to retrain yourself so that long term you can crochet without any pain at all. It took for me about 3 months to really fully go through the retraining, but it's made a HUGE difference in my ability to do all of the things that I actually want to do. </p>

","<p>There are special paints for plastic. If there is nothing in the colour you want, you may use plastic paint as primer/undercoat and use acrylic paint on top of that.<br>

I would be able to have a plywood board painted one color, which is peeling to reveal another color of paint underneath.  What paints and techniques should I use to make this possible?</p>
","<p>The basics of this can be pretty easy if you want it to be. Getting the exact desired effect, much like anything in crafting, will take some experimentation. </p>

<p>In its simplest form put down you base paint i.e. the colour you want to see below the peeling, distress and etc. Then put down something to help prevent the next layer of paint from binding. White glue works well for this. You would not necessarily use glue on your entire surface but where you want the cracking / peeling to occur. In your case you can try and target it along a line to simulate broken wall or foundation or something. How long you let the glue dry before you put on the next layer of paint is subjective. Most seem to wait until it is tacky to the touch. </p>

<p>Next you would put on your top layer of paint. The choice of paint should not matter here to much either. A milk paint lends easier to distressing or chipping. You see milk paint used a lot in ""antiquing"" furniture. </p>

<p>Once that paint is dry it should have cracked on its own while drying. If that is not to your satisfaction you could use some tools to help it along. Utility knives, putty knives would be obvious tools of choice. Again, you would need to experiment to get your desired effect. </p>

<p>Aside from the above or possibly in conjunction I have also seen people accelerate the drying process with something like a heat gun / hair dryer. This will definitely help the peeling process via bubbling. Take caution as to not burn or melt the paint. </p>

"How to cut and remove sharp edges on aluminum sheet using a Dremel Rotary Tool or other tool?","130","","<p>I'm working on a project that uses rolled aluminum, the kind for repairing chimney flashing, eavestroughs, etc. It's 0.0125"" thick and has very sharp edges, especially after making sized cuts from the roll.</p>

<p>I've read in a few places that certain grinding/sanding accessories aren't a good idea for aluminum as it can clog the abrasive. I have a basic Dremel 100 which has a single speed of 35,000 rpm. I just got a bunch of accessories in a new kit but don't have access to it or the list of items in it at the moment.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me which Dremel accessory by number would work best to remove the sharp edges from the aluminum sheet, and for cutting it as well? If the rpm is too high, what other tools or methods are recommended? I have been using a utility knife to make my cuts so far, easy but tough to be accurate.</p>
","<p>For material that thin, even a set of heavy duty scissors will work well enough. Harbor Freight sells <a href=""https://www.harborfreight.com/7-inch-multipurpose-stainless-steel-scissors-97042.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">stainless steel multipurpose scissors</a> for six bucks US that should do well enough for 0.0125"" stock.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zENAX.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zENAX.jpg"" alt=""HF scissors""></a></p>

<p>For the sharp edges, especially in aluminum, a <a href=""https://www.mscdirect.com/browse/tnpla/33873548"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">deburring tool</a> should do well for your purposes. A quality tool will be somewhat expensive, but there's such a large price range in this item that you should be able to find something in your budget.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lEyq0.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lEyq0.jpg"" alt=""deburring tool""></a></p>

<p>I have a tool similar to that in the photo and use it frequently on aluminum and plastic sheets to chamfer the edges. In your case, such thin material will need support. It may be necessary to place the edge on a solid surface such as a countertop or sharp edged table to provide the necessary support. Deburr one edge, flip the piece over and deburr the other side. </p>

<p>In the above photo, it appears that the E200 bit would give the best results. Light pressure, drag the cutter along the edge and you would see a curl of aluminum from the cutter. Too much pressure and you'll create a new sharp edge.</p>

<p>Alternative solution involves a hand file and the aforementioned support table or countertop. Push the file downward over the material creating the chamfer as you progress along the length. Dremel-type rotary tools also have burr bits that would work, but with a single speed (high speed) tool such as yours, the possibility of removing too much material is quite high.</p>

<p>Now, my question is: what is that? is it possible to make one of those that prints the brand in the papel craft? Thanks!</p>
","<p>Simply put, that is a rubber stamp. That particular one appears to be professionally machine-made given the fine detail in the rendered image e.g. lines in the skull and the typography this would be expected. </p>

<p>That does not mean you are forced to have one made. You can get very good results making your own. Although I doubt you could make the one you pictured without specifically designed machining tools.</p>

<p>There are many options for this as well. A <em>very</em> simple one would be to cut a stamp from a potato. You only need a potato, ink/paint and a knife for the some simple like a star. If you are curious <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xhHCqigPpE"" rel=""noreferrer"">this YouTube video</a> would be a good primer. It even shows using cookie cutters to get more precise shapes. </p>

<p>A realistic option that is more in line with what you show in your question would be to carve your own rubber stamp. Lots of tutorials out there for this one as well. I found <a href=""https://dearhandmadelife.com/how-to-make-a-diy-carved-rubber-stamp/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this one from dearhandmadelife.com</a> to be well written and full of useful pictures of the process. I will provide a basic outline of the process here. </p>

<p>You need to following tools or variations thereof:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Carving rubber</strong>: this is what will become the stamp</li>
<li><strong>Carving edge Tools</strong>: Search for rubber carving tools will get you the basic idea. Minimum you are looking for V-groove or U-groove edge tools. These would be better at removing material then your basic craft knife</li>
<li><strong>Pencil and paper</strong>: Your initial design will be done in this medium</li>
<li><strong>Mounting block</strong>: Optionally a block of wood, or something similar, to mount the carved rubber to. This will make the stamping process easier and give a uniform appearance to the applied stamp.</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the paper and pencil to draw what you want the stamp to actually look like. No need to draw it mirrored or anything. Just exactly how you want it to appear. Fill in any space that you want to be stamped. White or blank areas will become the negative space of the stamp. </p>

<p>The graphite from the pencil should transfer easily to the carving rubber. After that it is just a matter of carving out the blank areas in your rubber deep enough to prevent ink from adhering to it during the stamping process. You will also need to carve away an area outside the stamp as well for the same reason. </p>

<p>If you wanted to mount it then cut off any excess rubber and glue it to the block. Stamp all the things! </p>

<p>Your choice of ink will depend on your applied medium. Experiment. Standard ink pads should do the trick though. Depending on your product and placement you may need to worry about things like UV and the like. </p>

"Why take a skein of yarn and make it into a ball?","130","","<p>I have noticed so many people take a brand new skein of yarn, and then they create a ball of yarn. What is the purpose of doing so?</p>
","<p>It's more important to rewind into a center-pull ball of yarn if you are buying some specialty yarns that are basically a loose oval of yarn twisted into a loose figure eight - this structure is called a ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_(textile)"" rel=""noreferrer"">hank</a>.""</p>

<p>There's no need to rewind a typical commercial center-pull skein.  The work of keeping the yarn from tangling has already been done for you.</p>

<p>Rewinding from a loose hank/oval of yarn is usually a two-person job: one person has both hands through the loose oval of yarn holding it open while another person rewinds the yarn into a ball. </p>

<p>If you do need to rewind, it's important not to stretch or pull on the yarn, the yarn should be soft and relaxed.</p>

","<p>This might seem like a cop-out answer, but... practice! Practice is the main way for you to improve your control and line quality. I've been using a drawing tablet for 10 years and I still make mistakes.</p>

<p>The key to drawing lines is to use long, quick strokes rather than trying to hold your hand steady while you trace your outline. Each stroke will likely take several tries, so don't feel bad if you don't get it right away!</p>

"What is the right method to practice origami? Is rote-memorization correct method?","128","","<p>I love to find and learn Origami toys, but I can't memorize the steps. </p>

<p>I often manage to learn models or just while playing with papers I discover a new model; if I stop practicing them for a few weeks, I forget them.</p>

<p><strong>So, how do artists memorize the origami steps? Do they repeat one model again and again and again?</strong> I can recall, once, quite accidentally I made (own, new) a butterfly which can be hung on wall-hook in 'wings open' formation. It can also be inserted at a slit as 'wing closed' formation. But just a few days later I had to almost completely re-discover the steps. To make it fluent, I had to repeatedly practice it again and again, on several (3 or 4) days; and I still need a revision at an interval of a few months. </p>

<p>I think I'm able to feel to-some-extent the symmetry, patterns and 'fit'-s. But when level of complication goes slightly up, I can't hold them at mind together, and I need to enter cramming or rote.</p>

<p>In contrast, I've seen, many people <strong>including cheerful tiny kids</strong>, can effortlessly memorize the fold sequences for long times. <strong>So I guess; I'm doing something wrong way</strong>. (And I've seen in any subject or fields I've to apply any rote memorization or cramming, I did very bad, accumulate some headache, and forget all informations within minutes). <strong>So I guess those peoples (including cheerful kids) not using rote memorization. Am I right?</strong></p>

<p>Or rote learning (cramming) is the way kids do? Could it be  method that artists uses?</p>

<p>P.S. </p>

<p>I have problems with mental arithmetic, and have a very lousy short term memory. I fail to hold multiple bits of information at the same time.</p>
","<p>It's because you are still at a stage of learning where you are simply memorizing a series of steps, without really understanding the more nuanced principles of and techniques of origami and how these forms are constructed. </p>

<p>In neuroscience, it's called <a href=""https://www.google.com/#q=what+is+chunking""><em>'chunking'</em></a>, and it's a crucial part of becoming proficient at any skill, and it only comes with repetition, study, and practice. With more nuanced learning, instead of memorizing the simple mechanics (""fold this, then this half way, flip over and tuck back""), you'll start thinking in the patterns and techniques that combine a relatively simple variety of folds to make increasingly intricate designs. </p>

<p>Think of it like cooking. You can follow (or memorize) a recipe and cook a chicken dish that you can prepare over and over without any real understanding or context. But once you learn the more intricate principles and science <em>behind</em> cooking, you start to understand <strong><em>why</em></strong> things are done that way &mdash; so now you are no longer blindly following a series of steps, but following the patterns and techniques you learned to achieve the desired result. Now when it comes time to ""memorize"" yet <em>another</em> recipe (or come up with a creation of your own), you'll already know about 90% of it before you even begin. That is how you build a repertoire of dozens, sometimes hundreds, of ""recipes"" without having to memorize each step of each individual creation without context.</p>

"Efficient cutting and preparation of fabric for sewing clothing","127","","<p><strong>My questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Is there an 'ideal' size to cut / store fabric for making clothes?</li>
<li>Do other sewers have an efficient system in place for cutting / preparing their fabric for future sewing projects?</li>
</ol>

<p>There are many resources online providing methods of storing fabric stashes in a small living space. The focus of my question is on <strong>cutting, preparation, and planning</strong>, rather than just storage. </p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>I am starting to build up a large fabric collection, which is a mix of different sizes/areas of material. I have large bolts of fabric (up to 4 metres long), smaller pieces like fat quarters, and also small off-cut scraps. </p>

<p>I started buying longer bolts of fabric when I realised that it can be tricky to follow patterns for clothing when you only have small scraps of fabric available. For example, when I want to follow a pattern for leggings, I need a length of fabric which is at least as long as the leg shape, plus extra length for hems etc. I purchased a few metres of fabric at a time in one continuous bolt for this reason, but have now realised that I am finding it difficult to store, wash, and cut. (One of the reasons I find the cutting difficult is because I have a small work space and the largest flat surface I have is just under 1m square. I have read about other sewers cutting out fabric on the floor, but the floor of my space is not suitable.)</p>

<p>I have considered cutting my large bolts of fabric into smaller pieces to help with storage, and this should also help me with cutting out, because I won't have long pieces of material drooping over the edge of my work space. However, I'm not sure if this is the correct solution, or if this will cause problems later on when I try to sew garments like leggings or trousers.</p>

<p><strong>Edited to add chosen solution:</strong></p>

<p>After receiving several great answers, I am going to use the following process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Plan which patterns are going to be used </li>
<li>Cut lengths of fabric to the size needed for those patterns (eg. 1m, 0.5m)</li>
<li><a href=""https://crafts.stackexchange.com/questions/391/how-can-i-pre-wash-dry-bolts-of-fabric-in-a-way-that-will-prevent-the-cut-ends-f"">Zig-zag stitch the cut ends of the fabric before washing</a></li>
<li>Wash the cut fabric pieces</li>
<li>Cut out the patterns carefully without letting fabric hang down over the edge of the cutting surface</li>
<li>Store the remainder of the fabric as before, unwashed</li>
</ol>
","<p>I <em>do</em> cut long lengths of fabric into shorter pieces for storage. </p>

<p>I know from experience what lengths will be good for how and what I typically sew, and for me 2 yard lengths cover just about anything I need.  For you, it may be 3 yard and/or 4 yard lengths.</p>

<p>I wash and dry my fabric before cutting, then iron, cut, and fold for storage. </p>

<p>I store my fabric by color family; I love having everything ready to go.</p>

<p>In the past, when I didn't have a cutting table, I used my bed.  But be sure not to cut your sheets or bed coverings.</p>

<p><strong>Two solutions for safely cutting on your bed are:</strong></p>

<p>Buy a thick <strong>plastic dining table protector</strong> from Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (for example).  They come in several sizes and are easy to trim if you need to.</p>

<p>These table covers are thick enough to protect your bedding and you can tightly tuck them around your bed to avoid wrinkles:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/vinyl-table-pad-in-white/100331?Keyword=table%20pad"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vinyl table pad/cloth example</a></p>

<p>Another method is to buy a thick <strong>folding cardboard cutting surface</strong> (Joanne's, etc.) that will fold open to a long length and the width of your fabric, and fold back up to easily store in your closet or under your bed.  This surface is stiffer and easier to work with than the table covers, but you may need to experiment to see which works best for you.</p>

"How to pick an embroidery machine","127","","<p>I'm looking at buying an embroidery machine (or more specifically my partner is). We only have one real hard requirement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The machine must be capable to accepting a pattern from our computer that we can make out of a photograph/image.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm sure we'll need some software to convert the images, but otherwise how should we pick a machine. What are good figures of merit for a sewing and embroidery machine (And why do the prices vary so vastly from around  £300 to £10,000)?</p>

<p>For example when choosing a processor for a computer a good figure of merit for scientific computing is the number of threads multiplied by the clock speed. It doesn't have to be any fancy combination of specification, but I can't really tell the difference between the low end and the high end so I'm missing something!</p>
","<p>It isn't the machine selection that matters so much as the software available for a particular machine and the ability of that software to digitize a photographic image into the the correct form.</p>

<p>My sister has a couple machines with which I've assisted in the software on multiple instances. One in particular was the conversion of a photograph of a fluffy dog to an embroidery file.</p>

<p>The software supplied with the machine varied depending on the price paid. She purchased a more-deluxe version and it had the image digitizing feature. </p>

<p>Be advised that photographs are quite complex and can result in thousands of stitches of various colors. For a single needle machine it will also result in that many changes of colors of threads. Obviously, the number of thread changes will be reduced by a factor directly associated by the needle count.</p>

<p>Resolution is going to impact your job size as well. The lower resolution image will ""print"" faster, with fewer color changes.</p>

<p>The aforementioned fluffy dog was reduced to black and white and became somewhat blocky, but was still recognizable as the dog of the person receiving the gift.</p>

<p>The price differences for one machine to the next will have to do with the capacity of the computer controlled hoop, the overall speed, the additional features (wifi, display size, etc) and the number of needles.</p>

<p>Our area (USA) has many sales representatives within retail shops who are frequently happy to sell machines and talk them up a good bit. You will also find it valuable to frequent the forums specific to a machine you are considering and view the problems, questions and solutions others have posted.</p>

"Why are the top layers of my oil painting cracking when it starts to dry?","126","","<p>As I'm painting with oils, I often layer new colors over older parts of the canvas. This generally works fine, but sometimes the upper layer can crack as it starts to dry. Why is this and what can I do to prevent it?</p>
","<p>So the golden rule when layering oil paint is to work <strong>lean to fat</strong> (or fat over lean).</p>

<p>What does this actually mean? Lean paint is paint that is diluted with white-spirit or turpentine. It is 'watery', and dries quickly. Typically underpaintings are done in this way, as it's quick and easy to correct mistakes. As you then build up subsequent layers, use less spirits and more medium (typically linseed oil) - the oil being the 'fat'. These layers dry more slowly as a result.</p>

<p>Doing this ensures that the lower layers dry more quickly than the upper layers. Cracking happens when the top layers dry first, then the lower layers.</p>

<p>Some other considerations: cheaper paint will have more varied drying time between different colours. If you notice some particular colours cracking this may be the cause. Information about drying times is usually available on the manufacturer's website.</p>

"How can I do the hatching shading technique properly?","119","","<p>I really like the hatching technique especially with pens, or 'calligraphy pens' but I cant seem to get the style correct, I try to hatch but it ends up not looking properly done. </p>

<p>Are there any techniques that could help me hatch correctly?</p>
","<h2>What are hatching and cross-hatching?</h2>

<p><a href=""http://www.asllinea.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Hatching_2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">This article</a> from the Drawing Magazine explains the basic idea of hatching and cross-hatching:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At its most basic, <em>hatching</em>, also called <em>hachure</em>, refers to setting down a pattern of short, rhythmic, parallel lines close together and evenly spaced in order to darken a passage or increase the sense of form in a drawing. The initial “screen” of hatching may be overlaid with subsequent series of lines drawn at contrasting angles, creating crosshatching
  and further darkening the value of the area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... as well as what they can be used for in art:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The basic illusion of hatching is that a sequence of separate lines will read as a solid value from a slight distance. With hachure a draftsman can evoke a middle tone, a core or cast shadow or the atmosphere around a figure, as well as provide a means by which disparate elements of a drawing are unified.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Objectives, techniques, and variations</h2>

<p><a href=""http://thevirtualinstructor.com/hatchingcrosshatching.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This online tutorial</a> with pictures and videos tells you some of the basic techniques and variations of the art of hatching and cross-hatching. I'll provide some of the most useful quotes for introductory guidance.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Hatching</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hatching is created when non-crossing lines are used to indicate the value on or around an object. The value added to the object is dependent on the location of a light source. <strong>More marks are added in the areas of core shadow and cast shadow, while less marks should exist in lighter areas.</strong></p>
  
  <p>When hatching is used, <strong>the lines drawn generally go in the same direction and are mostly parallel with each other</strong>. Sometimes, the lines may curve slightly or even a great bit depending on the contours of the object. Lines of this nature are referred to as cross contour lines.</p>
  
  <p>When used correctly, cross contour lines can further the illusion of form by giving the viewer information about the actual 3-dimensional qualities of the object.</p>
  
  <p>By changing the frequency of the use of line, and the amount of space between the lines, the artist can create a full range of value in the drawing. Assuming that an artist is working on white paper, <strong>more space between the lines (more paper showing) will lead to lighter values in the drawing. Less space between lines will naturally lead to darker values in the drawing.</strong></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Cross hatching</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When cross hatching is used, the artist may begin adding value as hatching, but then allow the lines to cross over each other. <strong>The more that the lines cross over each other, the darker the value becomes.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Many artists approach the addition of crossing lines as a science, following a <strong>specific order of vertical lines, followed by horizontal lines, followed by diagonal lines, and so on.</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>This method produces very deliberate and controlled marks that are very exact and precise. Others simply cross the lines at random leading to “looser” drawings.</strong> Neither way is better, per se. Some looser approaches work better for some subjects, while more rigid approaches are suitable for other subjects.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

I hoped the baking process turned the clay translucent or transparent, but no luck. I made some very small objects, baked them for approx. 30 minutes at probably slightly more than 100°C/212°F, and took them out of the oven when the 30 minutes passed.  </p>

<p>Should I have done something different to get the clay translucent (it was not much different from before it was baked)? Or is it simply not possible at all?</p>
","<p>Based on <a href=""https://thebluebottletree.com/which-is-the-clearest-translucent-polymer-clay/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this blog post</a> about comparing the various brands of translucent polymer clay, it sounds like the translucent is only apparent when the clay is incredibly thin. The author prepares the clay by running it through a pasta machine. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I compared every polymer clay brand’s translucent that I could find. I conditioned each clay, carefully avoiding the introduction of bubbles. I rolled sample sheets in the thickest setting (#1) on my Atlas pasta machine and the thinnest (#8) that I could make (the machine goes to a #9, but I’ve never had clay come through that alive). The thick setting is about 1/8″ (3mm) and the thinnest is about the thickness of a playing card.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thick setting, when baked, makes the clay barely translucent in all brands, so if your figures are more than 1/8"" (3mm) thick, you aren't going to notice the translucency at all. </p>

"How to color with an even darkness?","119","","<p>I want to draw a certain design from a stencil and fill it in evenly in black, but using any drawing utensil I know of, like markers, sharpies, colored pencils, paints, etc., I will inevitably be able to see the strokes. I want it to be uniformly dark and not see the strokes. Does anyone know of a special paint or other coloring utensil that I could use that can do this? </p>
","<p>The issue is half medium, half technique.</p>

<p>First, your medium. You need something with high opacity. In wet media, we're talking black ink, and probably a wet one. Examples of Black inks which can be easily manipulated to produce an even distribution are sharpie markers, India ink, the proprietary uni-ball brand's ink pens, and Copic markers of the darkest black. For dry media, you want something soft and easily blended, with a really dark color. You want charcoal, or the softest B graphite you can find. I have found that eyeliner pens also work, as weird as that sounds. I'll talk about watercolor pencils at the very end. In either case, even the best tool is not enough. A mark which shows no hand in its production is a very difficult thing to create in traditional drawing media. My own college level instructors told me it was so difficult, it wasn't even worth chasing. (I disagree with them. Mastery of material and technique is always worth pursuing.) It is much easier in painting and printmaking techniques. Doing it with drawing media just takes practice and patience, but using the right tools for the task will make it easier. Black is always the best choice in this regard, as it is usually the most opaque pigment on any palette. The more translucent the pigment is, the harder this becomes.</p>

<p><strong>The technique:</strong></p>

<p>Keep in mind, this technique takes a long time to practice and master. It requires a ton of patience and endurance. It is a meditative task, in that it is slow, repetitive, boring, and more than a little uncomfortable. It is a trial of tolerance, and demanding of a quieted but focused mind. I would not do this in a place where you are likely to be distracted. Learning this technique is how I learned what it means to meditate.</p>

<p><strong>1. Be gentle</strong>:<br>
Press just hard enough to apply the pigment, and absolutely no harder. The weight of the tool alone should be more than enough. Most of an artist's hand is exposed by the damage it does to the paper. By preserving the finish of the paper, you hide your mark. Love your paper: that original finish is why you are doing this in the first place, after all!</p>

<p><strong>2. Go slow</strong>:<br>
This is especially important with inks, but just as important with dry media. Go just fast enough to leave your mark. Going too fast will pull at the texture of the paper laterally, changing the way light reflects off of it. With ink, you still need to keep a decent pace; the slower you go, the more ink soaks into the page, and the more it bleeds outward. If you're using ink, draw from where you know your bled edge <em>will be</em>, not where the edge of your nib <em>is</em>. Having a really tightly packed paper, something machine-pressed, with poor absorption, is a good thing here, as more ink will sit on the surface, making the mark take longer to dry, and getting you a darker result. For dry media, you'll want something stiff and toothy, something that can carve out your marking tool like sand paper. You won't always get to choose the best paper for the job, but if you have the choice to use the best, then you should make the choice to use the best.</p>

<p><strong>3. Full length strokes</strong>:<br>
In even, straight lines, at a constant pace, scan from one edge of the shape to the other. Do not break this line until you arrive at the opposite edge. Be careful to make the ends of each mark flush with the edges of your shape. The ends of a mark have subtle differences due to minute changes in pressure and timing as your physical hand changes direction. You want to ""hide"" these subtle marks by putting them in the edges of your shape. If you make the mistake of coloring a large shape in ""blocks"", then the mark ends line up and the series of subtle marks become a visible line of their own. If you color at random, the many marks form a texture which telegraphs your hand to the audience. So, while it is painfully slow, color it one line at a time, scanning back and forth like a computer printer. Your hand <em>will</em> cramp. Adjust your grip slightly with each mark to delay and reduce discomfort. If you are using dry media, you can rest your hand every few marks, but ink is far, far less forgiving.</p>

<p><strong>4. Overlap</strong>:<br>
Each mark you make, make sure you overlap the previous mark by slightly more than 50%. The thicker your mark, the easier this is to do. This is <em>especially</em> important with ink, as the repeated overlap ensures maximum deposition of ink at the surface, helping to hide the effects of drying time differences from one mark to the next. This is why ink is so much less forgiving. You want to finish each mark before the previous one has finished drying. The faster the ink dries, the harder this becomes without damaging the paper. Slower drying inks, like dip inks, are often preferred. This urgency imposed by the drying time for inks makes this technique rather stressful if you are not comfortable with the ink and paper yet. Reactivating inks, (like copics) which begin bleeding again when exposed to their wet medium, are a very good option, because the overlapping marks will bleed together somewhat, reducing the need of good mark timing.</p>

<p><strong>5. Two coats</strong>:<br>
Go over the work a second time, angling the strokes of the second coat by about 30°. Be even more gentle than the first pass, as you have already weakened the paper's finish. Ink will have significantly altered the absorption rate of the paper, as the dried ink will have infused its binding agent into the fibers, and your technique will need to adjust accordingly. If you are working in a gloss-finishing medium, like metal point or graphite, the smooth deposit of material is effectively a new finish for the page, and it will change how the next layer is deposited, no matter how soft your pencil is. The main purpose of this step is to get maximum color at the surface. In dry media, because you are being so gentle, you likely won't produce a very dark surface. You'll need to go over it several times, possibly many, many times if the paper is very soft or thin, depositing pigment in many thin, even layers, until the surface is completely coated, blotting out the paper fully. In ink, you always lose some color to absorption. After the initial coat, the fibers are generally clogged with dried binding agent, so the second coat is usually almost perfectly the same color as the dry pigment alone, as most of the ink will dry on the surface, rather than as a stain in the paper. In both cases, with media which blend easily, (charcoal and copics) the second layer allows loose material to blend, obscuring your mark.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Why not some other angle, like 90°?</em> You want a slight angle for one purpose only: crushing any subtle damage your initial marks made. Provided your second coat is just as gentle, the slight angle will maximally wipe out variance from the first coat. Think of it as polishing the finish, only much more gentle. At the commonly proposed 90° angle, your second coat would create the same kind of damage as your first coat, but will intersect with the initial damage in highly concentrated points, arranged in an even pattern, forming a checkered texture. Using a slight angle spreads out the intersections, and creates a broader, less even pattern, making it much harder to see.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6. Blend it if you can</strong>: This only applies to media which can be blended and worked after application. (So, pretty much just dry media, with the special inclusion of Copic markers) Using a tortillion, makeup brush, finger, or other blending tool, gently swirl the pigment in a soft, ""fluffing"" gesture. This moves any loose material around, allowing you to carefully even out its distribution. (With copics, you need a 0 ink pen, that's the one containing nothing but binder and medium. Just make quick, feathery full-length strokes back and forth across the area at a slight angle to your last coat. After quite a bit of work, the marks will begin to bleed together even more. Not all reactivating inks are available in an unpigmented form- in fact, Copic is the only brand I've seen that does it.)</p>

<p><strong>Dry Media: The Other Method</strong></p>

<p>One of my classmates called it cottonballing. I think she just made that up herself, but it's appropriate. That's what it feels like while you're doing it: soft and fluffy. Using a soft, dark, dry material, such as charcoal, begin coloring in your shape with a very light, gentle mark. Be careful to preserve the finish. Do not lift your tool. Color the whole shape in one long, slow, gentle, ponderously meandering mark. It is, in essence, the most delicate form that scribbling can take. Make no sharp angles or straight paths, always be curving, and do not stop moving. Keep your whole shape in sight, watching for an even distribution, and take whatever arbitrary path leads you through the uneven spots most frequently. Don't watch your tool tip, allow your subconscious take care of that while you focus on the work as a whole. To quote Bob Ross, ""Think like water. Let it flow."" Eventually, you will have applied a thick enough layer that the surface is completely coated, and cannot possibly get any darker. As long as you avoided patterns like the plague, and preserved the paper's surface, no discernible hand will be visible. Head to an edge and feather it off, following the contour.</p>

<p><strong>Watercolor Pencils</strong></p>

<p>If you plan to use this tool, use appropriate paper that can stand up to localized moisture.</p>

<p>These tools are kind of a gray-area hybrid between watercolor painting and traditional drawing. They are pencils containing dried, brick-form watercolor paint as a lead, plus some additional ingredients to make them less brittle and a little stronger so they draw smoothly. Unfortunately, there is considerable variation in WC pencil hardness, and manufacturers have not thought to advertise their relative pencil hardness. Some brands actually have different hardness from one pencil to another depending on the pigment! Find a set with a very soft black. (Actually, in general, find a set with the softest pencils you can find; they react to water activation better, as they apply as a loose dust rather than a dense accretion.) Use one of the methods from above for dry media to color normally, as though it were just a pencil. Now get out the water and use a damp brush to carefully soak the surface. You want to activate the medium and take up as little as possible. A shorter-bristled brush with a wide surface works best here, as they have less of a belly for pigment. Work the surface until all of the paint has been evenly activated and blended while wet. Let it dry.</p>

<p><strong>If this sounds like it sucks:</strong> You could always do what my teachers suggested: take up printmaking. I wasn't satisfied with that answer. Other artists have their own techniques for hiding their hand. It's something of a technical mastery ""magic trick"" in the arts. These techniques are mostly found among hyper-realists and photo reproduction artists. If you know any of them, or meet one, and notice that they do a good job of obliterating their hand from the finished work, ask them how they do it in a polite way. Most artists are pretty down to chat about technique- especially if you buy a commission off of them.</p>

","<p>Knowing the anatomy of your subject will make you a better artist. Here's why...</p>

<p>I can think of four reasons why an artist studies the anatomy of what they intend render into a work of art:</p>

<p><strong>1) Structure</strong>
The human eye is very sensitive at identifying shapes and proportions. Get the structure wrong and the eye ""will"" see it. Knowing how something is put together will make it easier for you to reproduce it during the drawing process. You will also be able to critique your own work and know if the image is working or not.</p>

<p><strong>2) Invention</strong>
The artist may not have access to a reference photo of the exact pose they are looking to draw. In this case the artist will need to invent the pose by some means. Look up the stick figures of Terryl Whitlatch, or the maquettes of James Gurney. The stick figure and maquette are both tools available to the artist to help them draw better and be more inventive with the pose of their subject. It takes a solid understanding of anatomy to create a useable tools such as these artists use.</p>

<p><strong>3)Further Learning</strong>
When you know the anatomy of the subject it will be easier for you to communicate with others when discussing the subject. Being able to discuss the subject with others will make things clearer in your own mind. As new information comes up you will be better able to catalogue and integrate it with what you already know. Look up Richard Feynman's technique of how to learn anything. Feynman's approach to learning technique works for all subjects, even those subjects important to the artist. </p>

<p><strong>4) Spiritual Empathy</strong>
<em>... this gets into some artsy spiritual stuff ...</em>
Learning the anatomy of your subject brings you one step closer in developing your connection to what it is you want to draw. Artists look to put their energy into their works and combine it with the energy of their subject. To be able to detect that energy you need to develop a close relationship with your subject. It through this empathetic connection of understanding that you will be able to connect on a soulful level with the energy and spirit of your subject. Better understanding of your subject (anatomy, physiology, philosophy, behaviour, spirit) will make you a better artist of the subject.  </p>

<p>As far as I've come with the techniques is, after I sew it together (like my latest axe sheaths in the picture #1 below), I should take off edges with an edger tool (V cut on edges, picture #2) and then use the spinning wood (picture #3), but I didn't get the desired finish as I wanted.</p>

<p>Has anyone had any similar problems or it's own technique, which would work better?</p>

","<p>Looking great by the way so far!</p>

<p>Personally when finishing any leather edges, I find the tiniest bit of Eco-flow gum tragacanth (brand not specific but it's just the one I've used) with a quick 
hand burnish with a cloth gives the best finish. Yes, it's a lot harder and you need elbow grease, but I think it's worth it. I don't usually bother with edge colouring as I feel it doesn't much improve the look of the end item...</p>

<p>I'd also recommend spending some time burnishing the leather by hand just in general, using a cloth and light pressure but very quick movements over the edge you want to finish. Then try with different cloths, and dampen them a little, and then try with the tragacanth.</p>

<p>Hope this helps! Any other questions I'll try to be sure to come back and check if this helped. :D</p>

"Is there a way to determine the fiber content of a yarn if I've lost the label?","114","","<p>I try to keep the label that comes with the yarn I buy but I do have a few balls of yarn where the label has disappeared and I don't have an additional, unused ball (that would still have the label).</p>

<p>Is there a way to tell what fiber(s) a yarn has if I've lost all the documentation for it?</p>
","<p>According to Maggie Righetti in <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0312353537"" rel=""nofollow"">Knitting in Plain English</a><sup>1</sup>, there are a couple of methods you can use to narrow down the possibilities.</p>

<p><strong>The Burn Test</strong></p>

<p>Take a small length of the yarn and hold a flame to one end of it. Take safety precautions when doing this. Don't perform this test near anything else that's flammable and be prepared for the yarn to burn or melt.</p>

<p>Animal Fibers - These will burn slightly but will not sustain a fire once the source of the flame is removed. There will also be a smell.</p>

<p>Plant Fibers - These will sustain a fire once lit.</p>

<p>Man-made - These will melt when exposed to high heat or flame.</p>

<p><strong>The Rub Test</strong></p>

<p>Rub a few strands of the yarn between two fingers 8 - 10 times.</p>

<p>Cashmere and some acrylics - These fibers will start to pill or ball when rubbed together.</p>

<p><strong>The Resistance Test</strong></p>

<p>Hold 3 inches of a single strand of yarn between your hands. Pull the strand firmly, then quickly release the tension.</p>

<p>Good wool, some acrylics - Will ""stretch and snap back""</p>

<p>Cotton, linen, and silk - These have poor elasticity and will not snap back.</p>

<p><strong>Getting Mixed Results</strong></p>

<p>If you seem to get results that imply the yarn is multiple things, it probably is. Many yarns are a mixture of different fibers.</p>

"Can I cast a glow in the dark flower in resin?","113","","<p>This is my first time experimenting with resin. What <a href=""https://crafts.stackexchange.com/questions/2579/how-can-i-make-my-flowers-glow-in-the-dark?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1"">I want to create is a glow in the dark version of preserved flower</a> in resin. </p>

<p>Based on <a href=""http://chemistry.about.com/od/glowingprojects/a/Glowing-Flower.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this thread</a>, it's possible to create glow in the dark flowers. So, in order to keep it lasting a long time I am planned to make an ornament like this: </p>

<p>However I want to use a glow in the dark flower instead.</p>

<p>Sadly, given my condition, getting my hands on the materials such as resin and the glow in the dark paint is not easy, so waste (or do ""lets just try it first"") them is hardly an option Therefore, I want to make sure that every step that I'll take basically works as I can't afford to experiment.</p>

<p>Because this is a amateur resin casting project I want to do this with as basic items as I can. I've been exploring the internet, but it seems the most common item do cast a resin is a silicone mold. Can it be done with either of these containers?<br>

<p>Because so far the only limitation that I have found (based on my silly research) is ""dont use a wax container"".</p>
","<p>A few comments about the problem as a whole, before I address your specific question...</p>

<p>You are attempting to encapsulate something in a clear resin shell.  That shell lacks any distinct shape, being comprised of flat planes and soft organic curves.  It does not contain any sharply detailed features or surface textures.  In short, the shell probably does not contain any aspects which need to be captured by an advanced casting medium like silicon.</p>

<p>Consider <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIj_I6mW5QQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Casting a mold using a mixture of Gelatin/Glycerin</a>.  This avoids much of the cost of casting silicon.  Silicon is better in my experience for capturing details, but for your project, gelatin will probably work fine.</p>

<p>On a different subject, clear resins are notorious for capturing air bubbles which may detract from the look that you are pursuing.  There are techniques for reducing those bubbles but the only way to completely eliminate them is to use a vacuum chamber.  Here are some <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/make-a-manual-vacuum-pump-for-under-$20-by-convert/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">instructions on creating a cheap vacuum chamber</a>.</p>

<p>Now for your actual question...</p>

<p>The containers which you show are suitable for holding your mold.  I prefer the red Wall's container because it seems to widen near the top.  That will make removing the mold from the container easier and leave the container intact between castings.  That way, once you have cut your original out of the mold, you can return the empty mold to the container to support its original shape during the application and curing of the resin.</p>

"Creative embroidery technique to fix a damaged knitted sleeve","112","","<p><strong>What would be a good darning or embroidery technique for fixing the frayed/missing edges on the sleeves of a machine-knitted cardigan?</strong> The cardigan material is 100% wool (see picture below).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JKcIb.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JKcIb.jpg"" alt=""Detail of sleeve fraying damage on 100% wool cardigan ""></a></p>

<p>I'm aware that techniques exist for using knitting or crochet to fix holes in knitted garments, but I am not skilled in these techniques, whereas I do have experience with embroidery. I am looking for a type of stitch or technique that will:</p>

<ul>
<li>prevent the sleeves from fraying further</li>
<li>straighten out the edge of the sleeve so it looks less uneven / ragged</li>
<li>Be creative / aesthetically pleasing</li>
</ul>

<p>My first idea was to use something like a <a href=""http://www.embroidery.rocksea.org/stitch/blanket-stitch/blanket-stitch/"" rel=""noreferrer"">blanket stitch</a>, but I anticipate that this will preserve the ragged edge to the sleeve, as in the image below:</p>

<p>I am looking for a technique that would 'fill in' the missing material, similar to darning. However, most examples of darning I can find work with a hole that is surrounded by material, whereas I want to fill in a missing edge:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6oKLu.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6oKLu.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
","<p>I know this is not an embroidery solution per se, but what about binding the edges of the sleeve with something like a light weight felt (use real wool felt, not the kind you played with as a kid), and sewing the binding in place using a saddle stitch? </p>

<p>If you are concerned about losing the elasticity in the cuffs, you could also use knit bias tape, which should allow you to retain some of the stretch.  </p>

<p>I am still hunting for a picture that shows something similar to what I am imagining. If I find one, I will add it.</p>

<p>In the meantime, hunting for photos led to another possibility when I stumbled on this picture:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tX1pa.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tX1pa.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Obviously that is a lot more embroidery than you are talking about--but what if you did some sort of embroidered embellishment around the sleeve edges to disguise the uneven edges?  </p>

<p>Before starting either of these options, I suggest sewing a line of stay stitching about 1/2 inch from the cuff edges to help prevent additional raveling.  If you have access to a sewing machine, I would use that, as it will be more consistent, but you could also use a line of running stitches done by hand to accomplish the same thing. </p>

<p>ETA:  Still no pictures of a bound sleeve, but here is another idea.  What about using a beaded blanket stitch, something like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/a8tG7.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/a8tG7.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> </p>

<p>The beads will be irregular anyway, so the unevenness of the edge should be much less noticeable. I would use larger beads and a heavier thread/embroidery floss.   </p>

<p>Still not able to find a picture of exactly what I am talking about, but I did find a picture of a similar type of treatment that could also work.  This woman was sewing a boiled wool jacket (you can find her blog entry <a href=""http://fitforartpatterns.com/helpful-hints/boiled-wool-sweater-jacket/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>), and wanted to add some embellishment to the sleeve cuffs.  So, she cut a strip of fabric the correct length to go around the cuff and used decorative stitches to topstitch the new fabric to the outside of the jacket cuff. Because boiled wool/felt won't ravel, you don't have to worry about the edges of this additional piece.  You could do something similar with your sweater cuffs-creating an outer cuff of felt and attaching that to the outside of your sweater cuffs to hid the raveled edges.</p>

"What do you call ""negative"" paint?","112","","<p>Many months ago, I came across an art medium used by painters. I cannot remember the exact term for this medium. It is white, but is transparent once used, I believe... having the consistency and appearance very similar to white liquid Elmer's Glue.</p>

<p>In essence (referring to this medium as Medium A), a painter would first sketch their desired image in pencil onto paper... be it typography or any image, really. Any spaces they wanted to remain white in the finished work (like lettering or small details, for example), they would paint and fill in with Medium A. Once medium A has dried, they would paint all over the paper (including over Medium-A-covered areas) with watercolor, typically with multiple colors. After the painting has dried, the artist would peel off Medium A areas from the painting, being careful not to rip up the paper fibers themselves along with Medium A. In essence, it has a resistance effect similar to a white wax crayon drawn underneath watercoloring.</p>

<p>An example of what the result after using Medium A could look like: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1kMThm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1kMThm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>What is Medium A really referred to as?</p>
","<p>I think what you are looking for is called a <strong>masking fluid</strong>. It is sometimes also called <strong>liquid frisket</strong>.</p>

<p>Masking fluid can be treated like paint which wherever it is applied will protect what is underneath. A feature of most masking fluids is that they are removable once dry.</p>

<p>Some masking fluids are strongly hydrophobic (water repellent), and water will bead on its surface. This can make it tricky to tell when the whole canvas is dry. Trying to remove the masking fluid but having some undried paint pooling on the surface can cause heartbreaking smears.</p>

<p>Some masking liquids change colour after they dry. This makes it easier to see where you have applied it, and easier to tell if you have removed it all after the work is complete.</p>

<p>Masking fluid is great for creating negative visual effects, like you describe.</p>

"What's the easiest way to pin and sew leather binding?","110","","<p>I'm currently making a wool cape for the upcoming winter. The pattern recommends to finish the edges with a leather binding, and I have opted to do so. My main problem is that I know you're not supposed to use pins for leather as it leaves marks, and I don't have many bulldog clips. Plus, I did try one edge and it was the most stressful thing as once i took a clip off to sew a section, I would have to push the binding over the wool, resulting in some missed sections where I sewed the binding together without the wool. Are there any techniques that make this process any easier? </p>
","<p>IF your machine is capable, you can't buy the Wonder Clips -which i also recommend, and you haven't stocked up on these items already... Do so! It will all make a difference.. Figure out what clips work best for you.</p>

<ul>
<li>Leather Needles</li>
<li>Required thread</li>
<li>Double sided leather tape</li>
<li>Large Paper Clips</li>
<li>Clothespins (wooden or plastic - just make sure they are strong)</li>
<li>Research, research, research</li>
<li>ALWAYS Practice on scraps beforehand.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do your best not to stretch the leather as your sewing it. Also, you can pin in a few spots where you'll be sewing, if you must. Just hand feed very slowly while removing the pins. Apparently the leather tape causes less needle gum up. </p>

<h1>Modified Plan</h1>

<p>I will be removing and re-gluing/replacing some of these with primer and repainting but here is the big idea:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TBqyo.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TBqyo.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I swap these pieces. I make the opening pointing down. Then I drive <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-1-5-in-x-1-5-in-x-6-ft-Heavy-Duty-Steel-Green-Painted-Fence-T-Post-901176EB/204331916"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">these stakes</a> in the ground and position the slingshot so that the stakes poke up there into these holes. At least 2' of stake will go up the arms. This should be enough to reinforce while still keeping the look.</p>

<hr>

<h1>How it happened</h1>

<p>Key lesson learned: Leave time for testing. So my goal was to launch lightweight playground balls from the slingshot into boxes, using a colander as the thing to hold the balls and BigBands (like the kind used to secure the can  liner in a garbage can) for the power.</p>

<p>So because the launcher was being used in an already muddy area the homeowner (mother-in-law) did not want the stakes. So Me and another family member braced against the post. The glue may have held but the creaking sounds that the pipes gave, made me uneasy about the pipes surviving the tension. I will test with the stakes in my own yard.</p>

<p>Another problem was the colander with drawer handle was cracked and didn't survive the first three launches. The back up colander was a close fit to the balls so that when pulled on it ""ovaled"" enough to keep the balls from launching. </p>

<p>The thing was a success in the end because we added a hand towel over the top of the colander, which made the pocket more shallow. It was harder to keep the balls from rolling out but it worked! </p>

<p>Also instead of piggies we used real children to bring down the boxes on. It was their idea and all the boxes were empty. So no tears there.</p>

<p>I am marking the first answer as correct because, well it was true. And thank you for all your suggestions. If I had it to do over again I would start with something that looked more like a soccer goal launching the balls up and through the area where the ball would be kicked in soccer. It wouldn't look as ""Angry Birdy"" but when you can't anchor your base into the ground it's a better approach. Also it could be used indoors for church events ect. </p>
","<p>I hate to be the bearer of bad news but 2"" PVC will not handle the stress that a working slingshot goes through. The best fix for what you have would be under the comment Aloysius D mentioned about joining the top to the bottom with 45 degree braces. I think it would still want to roll backwards on you on the draw to use it. That's when it will fail at the joints where the vertical meets the base. The joint will be in tension as compared to rolling out of the tee connectors when there are no braces.</p>

<p>A good old fashioned tree limb in the shape you need bolted to a base and braced might be better, at least cheaper than one made of 2"" threaded metal pipe.</p>

"What is way to make the painting where it seems as if colors in it have been splashed on it?","106","","<p>Found this on the cover page of some book:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tdSB5.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tdSB5.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>It looks as if the colors have been splashed here. What is the way to  make such painting? </p>
","<p>The process is called working wet into wet.<br>
Wet into wet means the paint medium (be it water colour, acrylic paint, oil paint, ink) is applied to a surface still ""wet"" with solvent/medium. </p>

<p>The solvent used to apply the previous layer of paint is still present on the surface where the new layer is being applied. The solvent has not yet evaporated (or the oil oxidized). With the solvent still present on the surface any additional paint added to the surface will dissolve as it makes contact with the solvent. </p>

<p>Depending on the surface the paint is applied to different effects are achieved. Paper, wood panel and canvas are very different surfaces on which paint can be applied. If the solvent is infused into the painting surface (such as the fibre weave of a canvas or paper) then the paint will, through capillary action, be drawn into the surface. </p>

<p>Solvent that only sits on the surface (such as when applied to a hard panel board or onto dried paint surface) will only draw the applied paint to where the solvent is present. The wetter the surface (more solvent present) the paint will dissolve further into the surface. But since it's solvent the paint will be further diluted and thinned. </p>

<p>Controlling the wetness of the surface controls how far the applied paint is allowed to diffuse and expand from the point of application.</p>

"Are there markers, paints, pencils, etc that are known to not change color over time?","104","","<p>I have some printed material that I would like to touch up.  These are not collectables, per se, so I'm not worried about altering the value of an antique or similar.</p>

<p>I'm not asking about any specific pen/pencil/etc brand or product.  That will just get dated.  </p>

<p>I am asking how I can determine whether any given pen/paint/ink/etc will not change color over long times?  (e.g. many decades).</p>
","<p>The two keywords you need to look for are <strong>lightfast</strong> and <strong>archival</strong>. </p>

<p>For US manufacturers, <strong>lightfastness</strong> is usually given as an <a href=""http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/D01_MSkalkaVersion_Final.doc"" rel=""nofollow"">ASTM rating</a> (that's American Society for Testing and Materials), which is a roman numeral between I (highest lightfastness) and V (lowest). Generally, ratings of I and II are fine to use for most artworks; any lower than that should mostly only be used for temporary works (e.g. where you plan to scan the art into a computer and then discard the physical version), or for works that will spend most of their life covered (e.g. inside a book).</p>

<p>There's no governing body that defines or determines whether materials are <strong>archival</strong>, so you have to take claims with a grain of salt, but if you buy from reputable manufacturers, you should be OK. One requirement for being archival is another term you're likely to encounter: <strong>acid-free</strong>. The acidity of the paper is what makes old printed materials brown and brittle. (I know this sounds like a paper problem, not a paint/pencil problem, but it won't help you that the canvas is guaranteed acid-free if you then paint it with something highly acidic.<sup>1</sup>) Other requirements often come under the terms <strong>permanence</strong> or <strong>durability</strong>. What these terms <em>mean</em> depends on the manufacturer, but also on the intended purpose of the material: an artist's acrylic (latex) paint isn't going to stand up to the same degree of abrasion as a latex paint meant for walls, but that doesn't mean it's a bad paint. </p>

<p>A good introduction to the subject is the definitions provided by <a href=""http://www.winsornewton.com/na/discover/resources/composition-permanence"" rel=""nofollow"">Winsor &amp; Newton</a>. Some of the terminology is specific to them (the AA, A, B, C system of permanence rating), but it's informative regardless.</p>

<p>For materials meant to be used by children, for example markers or colored pencils, it can be very hard to find lightfastness or permanence ratings. If you want to use such materials, it can be worth your time to conduct your own lightfastness tests: draw some rectangles on a piece of paper, color them with the material you want to test (making sure to label the colors), get some opaque material such as mat board and cover half of each rectangle, and stick the thing in a sunny window<sup>2</sup>, and forget about it for a while -- several months, at least. When you remove the mat board, you'll see exactly how much each color faded. </p>

<p><sub><sup>1</sup> Well, to a point. The most common type of ink used in the middle ages is iron-gall ink, which by nature is highly acidic. Despite this, documents written with iron-gall ink over a millennium ago are still perfectly preserved and readable. Moral of the story, study the history of the materials you use, and try to use them in the ways that have already stood the tests of time.</sub></p>

"How to remove paint fallen on an existing watercolor painting with the least damage to the painting?","103","","<p>Last time it happened was 15 years back, and that time I was in a painting exam. 
That time I didn't dare to do anything for the fear of making it worse.</p>

<p>What would be the best course of action when I accidentally get some paint on an existing watercolor painting?</p>

<p>While answering, please consider the cases when the painting's paint is already 
dry, totally wet, and when is it somewhat wet.</p>
","<p>It's best to act quickly, and absorb the paint with either a cloth or (nearly) dry brush. You can remove most of the spilled paint that way.</p>

<p>Then, depending on what's still visible, you might want to wet the edges of the stain, to soften the colour transition. 
You might also want to repaint a part of the existing painting, or if you're really creative, give the stain a purpose in your painting. Like, when your painting is a still life with flowers, the unwanted drop of paint may become a bug or a hole in one of the leaves.</p>

"Is there anything wrong with mixing incompatible paints?","103","","<p>I randomly stumbled upon this video <a href=""https://youtu.be/TuEBKV6T5aU?t=31s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/TuEBKV6T5aU?t=31s</a></p>

<p>Where a user modded his Nintendo 64 and gave it a ""custom paint job.""</p>

<p>He mentions that he used 2 types of paint that were NOT compatible with each other in order to form this paint-job.  He said the paints themselves try to separate which causes the cracking effect.</p>

<p>Personally, I really like this, and would like to do something similar with a project I'm working on.</p>

<p>My questions are,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there anything wrong with mixing paints that are NOT compatible?  From what he mentions it's just that the paints don't mix and separate from each other, but is there any danger in doing this by mixing things that shouldn't be mixed?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there specific paints that would cause this effect, or would any 2 incompatible paints do this no matter the paint used?  I'm essentially interested in other cool effects that could come about by mixing paints like this, but don't want to encounter any dangers.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>note:  I'm not sure if this is the right place for this type of question, or if this is more suited for the Chemistry-Stack?</p>

<p>thanks</p>
","<p>So, from my experience...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Wrong? No. Basically, looking at the major art paint options I can't see any that, when combined, would result in a dangerous mix. Some, however, will mix a bit better together than others.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes and no. The key to the cracking effect is difference in drying times, some paints dry faster than others and when you apply a fast drying paint over a slower one, the result can be that the upper layer will crack. The ""no"" part of this comes from the ability of some mediums to adhere better or worse to each other. For example, acrylics use water and oils, well, oil. When you try to apply acrylics over oils, it will crack and split (your desired effect), but it will also tend to flake, which is less desirable. In any event, some mixes will probably work better than others, but there's likely to be some trial and error involved.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, my suggestion is that if you're going to give a go, do so on some items you don't care about, but that also has the same surface material and try a few combinations using some student-grade paints (much cheaper).</p>

"Should I consider lightfastness scale while choosing artist grade watercolor?","100","","<p>I just started to use watercolor and got a set of 6 Schmincke Horadam watercolors. I decided to get some more and looking at a color table I found out that colors have a lightfastness categorization.</p>

<p>I thought that all artist grade watercolor was at top of lightfastness grade.</p>

<p>However, it says ""The rating of lightfastness as a 5-star-system is based on blue wool scale. This allows a more precise differentiation especially in the more lightfast categories.""</p>

<p>Few colors have a 1/2 star on lightfastness scale and some new colors have ""Without evaluation of lightfastness.""</p>

<p>Should I consider the lightfastness star when choosing color or bottom line is more than enough? </p>

<p>What's the minimum star rating I should look for to make sure it has durability over time if kept indoor and not direct sunlight exposition?</p>

<p>Here is a link to the <a href=""https://www.schmincke.de/fileadmin/farbkarten/colour_chart__HORADAM_watercolours.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">color table</a> with lightfastness stars.</p>
","<p>Watercolor is especially susceptible to fading under light. This can be explained by the binder for watercolor and the way watercolor is used. The binder is usually a mixture that contains mostly gum arabic. Due to the usage of watercolor in thin layers the binder will not be able to coat the pigment properly leaving it exposed to light. Lightfastness should therefore definitly be considered when using watercolors. However, it depends on your aim for your drawing. </p>

<p>If you only want to practice to get better at watercolor you might want to look at inexpensive watercolor pigments that might therefore lack in lightfastness. Those works can still be durable if kept in a dark environment such as a folder. Displaying paintings with colors of low lightfastness will result in quick fading (a hint at how quick the fading will appear is given in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightfastness#Standards_and_measure_scales"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this table</a>). If you still want to hang a drawing in a well lit place you can use Aquarell-fixatives to improve lightfastness. Those Aquarell-fixatives or finishes come as a spray and allow to apply a UV protective layer that also protects from dust, moisture and other bad influences. Going one step further you can also frame your image behind UV-protective glass to ensure longevity of colors.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you plan to display or sell your drawing (from the beginning) you should opt for the (more expensive) lighfast pigments and take the above measure in addition.</p>

"Is it possible to buy 'ethical fur'?","96","","<p>I enjoy crafting leather armour. As part of an Orc design I am going for, I would like to buy some animal fur to complete the brutish/primal look. I have bought several faux furs off ebay, but they either look incredibly cheap, or they ""shed"" a lot of hair. So I turned to authentic animal furs, which definitely look much better. </p>

<p>I decided to google around and see whether some furs are the byproduct of keeping an animal for other purposes such as consumption- i.e. I am trying not to support any farms that hold animals just for pelts. A lot of the furs on ebay are rabbit fur. In some of the item descriptions, the sellers explain what the rabbits are kept for and it seems harmless to buy some.</p>

Asking around thrift stores or estate sale agents may give some leads; even if they would typically discard such items due to probable disinterest, letting them know you're interested means they could inform you next time an old coat is available.</p>

<p>If it's significantly damaged (moths, mold, just old age), all the better: it is unlikely to have any further use as a <em>coat</em>, but could readily be repurposed into <em>accents on a costume</em>. This is perhaps the most ethical use of all: you're not resulting in any new animals dying (even if humanely raised and slaughtered), but instead salvaging something that would otherwise end up in a landfill.</p>

<p>(But like anything ethical, it's sort of down to your personal perspective and comfort level. There's also an argument to be made that if it wasn't humane and ethical in the first place, it isn't now just because decades passed between the animal's demise and your use of its pelt.)</p>

<p>I think one of the better choices here would be epoxy resin. You could also call it a bar-top finish. They are essentially the same thing.

You see this in other crafts as well like <a href=""https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=penny%20table"" rel=""nofollow"">penny tables</a>. Epoxy resin is usually food safe once fully cured check your individual product information to be sure. . </p>

<p><strong>If you have never done this before this should not be your first large project with epoxy resin</strong></p>

<p>You need to work in an area that would be relatively free of dust and debris. Epoxies come as two liquids that need to be mixed together: a resin and a hardener. Most require a mix of 1:1.  Hard to say exactly how much you would need to cover your entire surface.</p>

<p>If you can remove the legs off your table I would do that and then use some small blocks or other objects to prop the table off the ground. Epoxy resin is self leveling so <em>it is imperative</em> that you ensure your table is level before application. Use a level or series of level to help ensure that. At the same time you need to put down something under the table so that the resin has something to drip onto. This is supposed to happen to ensure an even finish. </p>

<p>Mix/stir your epoxy resin and pour over the table. You can use a brush to help the resin get around the whole surface. You are not ""painting"" the surface but helping the resin get complete coverage. Again, it will drip over the edges and that is fine as it helps coat the edges. You have a few minutes so if you need to add more resin to your surface you have a small window to add more without harming it. </p>

<p>Bubbles are bound to happen so have a blow torch or heat gun handy to help pop them before the resin starts to cure. I even heard breathing (not blowing) on them helps them pop. This can especially be an issue for a mixed media table as there will be plenty of places for air to hide. Make sure that whatever you are using that you don't want near surface contact and stay in motion. You don't want to burn it or cause wrinkles if the epoxy is starting to cure. </p>

<p>You can sometimes thin your epoxy to give it a longer curing time which both allows it to seep better and gives you more time. Note this can affect its overall strength. </p>

<p>Once you have your surface coated and bubbles removed then you typically would leave it to cure over a couple of days to be sure. If you have the means to tent the table this will help keep dust off. Be sure whatever you do that there is no risk of the blankets or what not falling onto the table.</p>

<p>Epoxy resins can be a complex subject if you want them to be. There is a lot of scenarios that would be too hard to cover hear. Do you research and always pay attention to product labels. So, if you are curious about this I would recommend reading up on it more. If you wanted to explore this in more detail I would recommend asking specific questions about your particular quandary. </p>

"Is there a discernible difference between tube and pan watercolors?","95","","<p>I have some old watercolor tubes that I inherited (a lot of family gives me art supplies, since I ""like art""), and I have few sets of pan watercolors. My wife and I would like to try using them both.</p>

<p>How different do they actually appear once on watercolor paper or canvas?</p>

<p>For instance, could I use these two types together on the same medium without there being a discernible difference in what type of watercolor they are? A difference along the lines of how you can tell chalk pastels from oil pastels, in that they have a different finish and texture on paper.</p>

<p>Should we stick to one or the other for a given project, to have it look consistent?</p>

<hr>

<p>I just want to clarify that I'm not asking about the <a href=""http://somecallmebeth.com/watercolor-tubes-vs-pans-which-are-better"">general differences</a>, but they're actual end appearance.</p>
","<p>There can be more textural/quality difference between two different pigments of the same brand and type of watercolor than there is between, say, a tube of ultramarine blue vs. a pan of ultramarine blue from the same manufacturer.</p>

<p>The difference between the types of watercolors really comes down to technique: the way you use tube colors is quite different from the way you use pan colors. But you can use this to your advantage. For example, you can use the pan colors for light washes, and use the more concentrated tube colors for adding outlines and details. To someone who doesn't know what kind of paint you used, it'll just look like you used more water in some parts and less water in other parts (and if you come right down to it, that'll be exactly what you did).</p>

<p>If there is a huge disparity in quality between the types of paint - for example, if the pan colors are a dollar-store find meant for children, while the tubes are top-of-the-line artist's grade - that difference will probably be apparent in the finished product: the lower quality paints will look washed-out and chalky, and may be under-bound (so they come right off the paper when dry). But if both types are student-grade or better, then a competent artist will have no trouble creating a seamless piece of art using both types. It's just that most artists develop a preference for one over the other.</p>

"Is there a difference in stability between prestringing and placing a bead?","94","","<p>I am thinking about doing a knitted project with beads. I am wondering if there is a difference in stability between prestringing the beads and placing the beads. I would like for the beads to move as little as possible in the finished object. (If it matters, the finished object is likely to be a shawl.)</p>

<p>For the purposes of this question, please assume that the beads in question are large enough in relation to the yarn that both techniques are possible. My smallest crochet hook is a size 5/1.90mm. Purchasing a smaller one is not a problem.</p>

<ul>
<li>Prestringing = Placing all of the beads onto the yarn and then knitting with it.</li>
<li>Placing a bead = Adding the bead when you knit the stitch.</li>
</ul>
","<p>There are a lot of pros and cons to both methods of placing beads into your knitting, but when looking only at stability there is a difference between prestrung and placed beads. Having used both methods, I find the placed beads stay precisely where you put them whereas the prestrung beads can slip.</p>

<p>When you place a bead you put it on precisely the stitch required. It can't shift anywhere because the two yarns going through it split and go in different directions. When you knit a prestrung bead into your work, it can travel along the yarn. Generally this means if, for example, you place the bead on the vertical leg of a stitch, it could slip up or down to rest on the horizontal bar of the stitch. This sometimes means it slips to the back of the work. The looser the gauge, the more this problem will occur.</p>

"What do 'woolen spun' and 'worsted spun' mean?","94","","<p>Sometimes I see yarn described as 'woolen spun' or 'worsted spun', and it is clearly not about its composition or weight, but I would guess about spinning technique.</p>

<p>What are they? What do they mean for the yarn? What kind of projects are they good or bad for?</p>

<p>Are there any other such descriptions that I should know about?</p>
","<p>Woolen spun and worsted spun are references to the way the yarn is actually spun in the spinning process.  Worsted spun yarn includes individual fibers that are facing in many directions, whereas woolen spun has all of the fibers facing in the same direction before the yarn is spun and they remain much more parallel in the final spun singles. The process of spinning the two types of yarn is different as well, but less important to know if you are the end user of the yarn.</p>

<p>Woolen spun tends to incorporate more air between the individual fibers, so a woolen yarn will weigh less than a comparably thick yarn that is worsted spun.  The additional air also helps heat retention, so garments made from woolen spun yarn can be lighter weight and still warmer than those made from a comparably thick worsted yarn.</p>

<p>However, because the individual fibers don't overlap each other the way they do in a worsted yarn, woolen spun yarn doesn't hold up over time as well as a worsted spun yarn.  It is also more likely to pill.</p>

<p>As for when to use which one--well the opinions on that question are all over the place.  I suggest googling ""woolen vs. worsted yarn"" and you will read a hundred different opinions.  But, in general, I would avoid woolen spun yarns for projects that are going to get alot of rubbing, pulling, tons of wear.  Be cautious about using a woolen spun yarn for something you are going to put on a kid, for example.  But a shawl would be the perfect use for a woolen spun yarn, because you are looking for additional warmth with minimal weight when you make a shawl, AND it is less likely to be subject to the type of usage that will cause pilling.</p>

<p>One confusing element is that worsted in this context means the fashion in which the fibers are prepared (and spun), whereas worsted is also used in many parts of the world to indicate yarn of a specific thickness. These two definitions have absolutely nothing to do with each other--so you could spin a woolen yarn that is worsted weight, and confuse the heck out of everyone. You could also spin a non-wool fiber using the woolen spin technique (I think--better spinners than I feel free to disagree), and then have a cotton yarn, for example, that is woolen spun.  Super confusing.</p>

<p>Another important concept--singles vs. plied yarn.  When you first spin fiber into a strand of yarn, you have what is called a single.  The individual fibers are held together by adding twist into them--the amount of twist determines how strong the actual yarn is.  But think about what happens if a child sitting on a swing spins around a bunch of times and puts a twist in the ropes holding the swing.  They actually built up alot of energy in the ropes as they created that twist, and let go, the ropes release that energy by unspinning really quickly. </p>

<p>Singles yarn is called ""energized"" because it has a similar inherent energy in it.  When you work with singles yarn, your final product will be much less consistent, even and smooth, because even after it is worked, the singles yarn is continually trying to release some of that built-up energy.</p>

<p>When you ply yarn, you take a number of singles (I think three plies is the most common), and twist them together in the opposite direction from the twist you used to combine the fibers into a single strand. The aim when creating a plied yarn is to balance the residual energy from the singles without actually untwisting the yarn and having the individual fibers fall apart. When you ply yarn, you are specifically trying to create yarn that is balanced--you should be able to drop a strand of plied yarn and it will not try to untwist in either direction.  Working with plied yarn tends to create smoother, more even and more regular final products.  </p>

<p>The last issue I will mention is the directionality or type of twist in your yarn. Yarn can have an S twist or a Z twist.  This describes the direction the yarn was plied (and is compared to the direction of the center element in these two letters). If you hold up a piece of yarn and look closely, you will see that the individual threads (or singles) spin in a direction that either looks like an S (they start at the top left of the strand and move diagonally to the bottom right) or a Z (they start at the top right and move diagonally to the bottom left).  The technique that you use for knitting or crocheting can interact differently with the different twists--some techniques might twist the yarn in such a way that it comes partially untwisted as it is worked.  Because twist is what gives yarn its final strength, this can actually have an impact on the strength of your final piece.</p>

<p>This is a pretty complex issue, and I don't know enough about it to be able to explain all of the permutations here.  My suggestion is to try and determine what type of technique you use for knitting (are you a thrower or a picker? Continental vs. English?) and/or crocheting (I don't know the equivalent terminology for crocheting, but I know that as a kid I used to crochet in a way that twisted the yarn less than I do know as an adult).  Once you know what to call your technique, you can start searching for that technique in combination with ""S or Z twist"" and see what people say about which works better in which situation.     </p>

"Are there toxic concerns with using a heatgun/torch on plastic/acrylic?","93","","<p>I am looking to bend a piece of plastic/acrylic (not really sure what I'm getting yet), for a craft project I am working on.</p>

<p>I was thinking of using a hair-dryer, but I'm not sure if it would get hot enough, as well as doing this outside. </p>

<p>I was curious if this seems like a bad idea? I would assume with proper ventilation I should be fine? I also do think that the torch overheated the acrylic in the video, which would not be a problem with a hair-dryer.</p>
","<p>Yes, if you overheat it, most thermo-plastics will give off dangerous gases when heated above a certain temperature. For bending, you need somewhere between 100C - 170C (212&deg;F - 338&deg;F). Cast acrylic needs higher temperatures than extruded (due to the higher molecular weight), and thicker sheet need slightly higher temperature than thinner.</p>

<p><strong>But do not go above</strong> 170C (338&deg;F) for extruded acrylic or 190C (374&deg;F) for casted. Just start off low and heat it slowly until the material will bend as you need it. It's only the bubbling and scorching caused by <em>excessive</em> heating that gives off the nasty fumes when burnt. </p>

<p>From my post on <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/a/9975/80""><strong>Lifehacks &mdash; Working with acrilyc/plexiglass</strong></a>, electric strip heaters are generally recommended (depending on what you are trying to do), but any electric indirect infrared source can be improvised for occasional use.

","<p>Jigsaw is a poor choice of tool for this given the size of the finished product and that it is a roughing tool more designed for cutting sheet goods. </p>

<h1>Tools to consider</h1>

<p><strong>Bandsaw</strong></p>

<p>If the polyhedron was a little larger and your valued the tolerance of the finished product I would most certainly suggest the bandsaw as you can use a mitre slide and a custom sled with a proper angle to get all of the cuts accurately. However the tiny size hinders the success of that size you cannot clamp that small and that is too close for the fingers. </p>

<p><strong>Coping saw and/or sandpaper</strong></p>

<p>It might take a little practice but if you are up to using hand tools then I would suggest a coping saw and sandpaper. Use the saw to get the larger sides cut and then just sandpaper to get the triangle faces done. It is small enough to not take too much effort. </p>

<hr>

<h1>Notes on mass production</h1>

<p>As per the comments it looks like you are going to try and mass produce these. I still think sanding would be safer but I suppose you could use a disk sander to speed up the process. Just keep in mind that it is still a power tool that can hurt you so always be mindful of that. Don't sacrifice in an attempt to increase efficiency. </p>

<p>I would consider making a small ramp of jig that would give you a 60 degree angle. Looking at an edge view from the wiki that can help ensure the best angles when sanding. You can try and use a set of small squeeze clamps to help keep your fingers out of harms way. Those might become less useful as you form your cube since the sides will be made smaller and there will be less to grip. </p>

"How to determine the ""correct"" scale for your art project?","93","","<p>The very fist step in traditional art painting, drawing, sculpting, and such is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine the scale of the work!</li>
</ol>

<p>The painter must select their canvas, a drawing requires the right size sheet of paper, and a chisled statue requires the right size stone.</p>

<p>But how do you decide?
And does the scale affect the composition of the work being executed?</p>
","<p><strong>Deciding on the scale is part of the design process</strong><br>
When you decide to make a piece of art its size is part of the design process.<br>
There is a huge difference between a miniature and a way more than lifesize piece of art in the materials and tools needed and in the structure which may not be seen but is needed to build the item, but not in how you design the piece of art.</p>

<p>Often the size is decided by how much money the artist has to spend on the project or whether someone is sponsoring, has given a commission or guaranties the cost of the project.</p>

<p>Even huge artworks mostly have a smaller sample made, either as sketch or as miniature to show and get financing or as a way to work out technical difficulties. And most of those models can handle two or more out of those in one small version.</p>

<p>For the more modest items, where the 'smaller' scale will be about 50% of the 'larger' scale, it is still a case of money, preference and availability.
Many people get lessons as part of their art education, teachers usually set the size as well as the subject and medium.
Or at least talk it through with the student to get the best result for the project.</p>

<p>If you are self taught, you will have to experiment as much as your purse allows you.<br>
I find in almost all crafts and arts, I go for smaller once I know how to do the technical side.<br>
Others I have met or know about do go for bigger and huge. </p>

<p>Each person has to find his/her own way.</p>

<p><strong>About scale influencing the design</strong><br>
Basically the design should be independent of the scale. The smaller you work, the smaller the details should be. The bigger the scale, the more likely you will not put in small details but you will still be able to.</p>

<p>If you look at huge canvasses of old masters, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rembrandt van Rijn</a> for example, you will see that most of the work is wide strokes of the brush or whatever tool they used. There might be some details, but most of those will not stand out when you are at a distance to appreciate the whole of the canvas.</p>

<p>That goes even more when you go for more than lifesize sculpture.
Take as an example the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_of_the_North"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Angel of the North.</a><br>
The huge statue does not have more details than the man sized marquettes.</p>

<p>Of course you can decide to make a 4 by 3 meter painting with as much detail per cm as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Miniatures_NMW.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">miniature paintings</a>, but that is a design decision, not something that comes from the scale used.</p>

<p>Hold the yarn on your arms about elbow level, making sure that the winding off side is on the outside and the top, bring your hands together while keeping enough tension on the yarn to keep it in place.<br>
Now start winding, undoing one loop of the yarn at the time at most, to avoid tangles.</p>

<p>The method my grandmother would use: two chairbacks.<br>
Put the yarn around two chair backs where the chairs are back to back, move the chairs away from each other till there is just enough tension to keep the yarn in place. If the chairs glide easily over the floor you may need to put something between them on floor level and if they tip backwards put something heavy on the seats.
It will work easiest if you have an eye above the chairs to pull the yarn up from the chairs, but if needed you can work your winding above the seats.</p>

<p>Some extra twisting or a little untwisting is to be expected, (which depends on the lay of the twist in the yarn and the way you unwind) but in twisted yarn it will not be much and might be take up by how you wind your ball.</p>

"What's the difference between a pigment and a dye?","92","","<p>When it comes to art, I see both terms quite frequently, but nobody ever really stops to explain the difference. What, then, is the difference between a pigment and a dye? Is it source? Usage? Or something else?</p>
","<p>The simple difference is that a pigment is insoluble in water. So, when you mix it with water or another liquid, it becomes a suspension. Over time, a suspension will settle, and you'll have to mix it back up. Or, if the liquid were to evaporate, the pigment would remain.</p>

<p>A dye is generally soluble in water, or already a liquid. It doesn't settle, and if it evaporates, everything will go. Historically, dyes came from natural sources such as mashed berries, boiled plants, bugs and various vegetation.</p>

"When casting onto circular needles how can I make certain that the tightness is correct?","90","","<p>When casting on to circular needles is there a technique to not making it too tight or too loose? I realize the first row after casting is hard, but I've really struggled casting on partly because the loops on the needle part are super loose but the loops, when they end up on the cable part of the circular needle are very loose. (If this is too vague or confusing please let me know)</p>
","<p>Getting a circular cast-on up and running can indeed be tricky. Fortunately, there are several techniques that can help.</p>

<p><strong>Use a sturdy cast-on</strong> The long-tail cast-on is a good one for this as it basically includes the first row of knitting. Be careful if you need stretch, though.</p>

<p><strong>Add some weight to the cast-on</strong> This can be done by putting some stitch markers in the cast-on (helps get the number of stitches right, too!) or by knitting a short provisional section flat and then joining (you go back later, unravel the provisional section, and use that yarn to cast-off).</p>

<p><strong>Try DPNs</strong> If the cable part is what grieves you, you might try casting on with double-point needles, instead. They can have their own fussiness, but it works for some folks.</p>

<p><strong>Practice</strong> Yeah, nobody likes to hear this one, but it's so very true. Even after more than a decade of knitting, it still sometimes takes me a few tries to get a circular cast-on going well.</p>

"Large plexiglass cylinder?","89","","<p>I'm looking for where to buy a large plexiglass/acrylic cylinder. The exact dimensions don't matter so much but I would like it to fit abound 5 gallons of water (after I close the bottom of course). This is for an aquarium I'm building. I didn't think it would be very hard to find, but no luck.</p>

<p>I live in the US (California to be exact) but will order from anywhere that will ship it to me.</p>

<p>If there's nothing available in the required size I am willing to explore the option of casting it myself, but I have no experience with such things and don't really know how difficult it would be.</p>
","<p>At the risk of answering a nearly closed question and related to your willingness to consider creating your own, it would appear that casting is going to be the only practical solution available, unless you have a tremendous budget.</p>

<p>I did a quick search using The Google for the terms ""18 inch acrylic cylinder"" and found a number of suppliers. You'd have to do the math for length vs. volume vs. diameter to know the exact or approximate size. One of the vendors lists 0.250 inch wall, 20 inch diameter, US$583.98 per linear foot! </p>

<p>On the casting side, which does fall into the crafts aspect, you might consider to purchase a five gallon bucket and use that as the beginning of a mold. If you did not require exactly five gallons, you would pour the casting acrylic liquid into the bottom of the bucket. When the bottom inch has cured, construct an inner mold sleeve, sealing it well to the bottom and fill the outer ring with casting acrylic liquid.</p>

<p>If you go that route, use caution regarding the volume of acrylic you pour, as it can generate enough heat to melt the plastic bucket.</p>

<p>Alternatively and much more expensive is to create a silicone mold to then use to pour the acrylic. You can find silicone mold products which can handle temperatures high enough to cast metal, certainly capable of handing the heat from acrylic reactions.</p>

<p>This would be a project of some labor, some experimentation and possibly some undesirable results, typically called learning, but is probably going to be less expensive than buying six hundred dollars a foot plastic tube and still having to seal the ends!</p>

<p>I did a bit more research and discovered that a five gallon cylinder will be 12 inches tall and 11 inches inside diameter. Those numbers confuse me, as a five gallon Home Depot bucket is larger than a foot across and a foot tall. One gallon is 231 cubic inches. Five gallons is 1155 cubic inches. Again with The Google, the formula says 11 inches diameter by 12 inches tall is 1140 cubic inches. That's close enough. Maybe the five gallon buckets are more than five gallons or maybe I'm calling them that and they aren't.</p>

<p>At any rate, 12 inch inside diameter, quarter inch wall tubing from San Diego Plastics (the reference I used) is ""only"" $182.74, far less than the previous figure. Shipping might not be too bad for a foot-square box either.</p>

<p>Shucks, I preferred the casting method for the learning experience, but it isn't going to be cheaper than the retail purchase.</p>

"What is the purpose of an Underpainting?","89","","<p>As I got interested  painting in oil and acrylics (and other covering techniques) I came across underpainting, i.e. a painting under the actual painting that sometimes exhibits color and sometimes only the tonality of the image to be. </p>

<p>It seems that the underpainting is almost always completely covered once the Painting is finished. So what is the purpose of an Underpainting when you could also directly paint on the real image (supposing that I sketched out my design with graphite or charcoal)? </p>
","<p>I use under painting for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>Conventionally, it is useful for extremely faint variations in color, implied-texture or reflectivity.  In this respect, it is similar to adding a wash over a portion of the dominant color, as it subtly affects the final appearance without adding distinct brush strokes or delineations.   I find under painting to be slightly easier to control than washes because the pigments which I use for under painting are less dilute and therefore quicker drying than their wash equivalents.</p>

<p>A less conventional usage is to mark the center point of a zone or to layout a grid upon an area which will ultimately be invisible in the final product, but is useful for determining proportions prior to the addition of the outer obscuring layers.  For example, when laying down shadows which are being cast by multiple identical objects and at nearly identical angles to the light source, it is helpful to have an almost invisible grid (like graph paper) present.  It helps me be more consistent and to adjust the angles with uniform variation between each of a series of shadow-casting objects.</p>

<p>My final use for under painting is for low risk experimentation.  Laying out a rust pattern or a dirty spot on an otherwise pristine rendered subject is daunting.  You've finally got the thing looking exactly like you want and now you just need to scuff it up a bit to make it look more real.  But a little too much or even a little in the wrong spot will ruin your hard won rendering.  These are the moments that make brush hands quiver.</p>

<p>Which is why I design my rust and scuffing before hand, to get it right before I add all the pretty paint and shine.  Then, if I have to go back and strengthen the abused area after it has become too pretty, I have the still barely visible tone of the under painting ( or at least my memory of it ) to guide my hand.</p>

"Can I use salt water with watercolours?","88","","<p>I'm going to the seaside at the weekend, and I plan on using my watercolours while I'm there as a way to relax.

However, if the water runs out, I want to know if it's okay to refill them with water from the sea. That way, I don't have to worry about bringing extra water with me. I'd like to know if using the sea water would have an effect on the quality of both the paint and if it'll damage the brushes.</p>
","<p>Yes, you can use salt water with water colours. But remember, table salt (or salt water)is highly hydrophobic. Salt repels water. Anywhere salt is present on your paper it will repl water way from the area. The water colour pigments floating in your solution will concentrate around the salt particles. As the water is pushed away from the salt you will get concentrated areas of pigments in those areas where salt particles are present. So if you are looking to achieve a spotted texture on the surface of your water colour painting salt is a good choice.</p>

<p>As an experiment try sprinkling some table salt on the surface of your water colour painting, the sprinkled salt will create a more pronounced effect as the larger salt crystals in the table salt will repel a larger amount of water.</p>

<p>When done painting clean your brush with regular tap water. This will keep a layer of salt precipitating out on the hairs of your brush as the salt water drys.</p>

<p>By running through two stitches but not actually making the base of both of them, it tightens up the space and only shows a single stitch. It can actually be challenging to see where the decrease is after it's completed.</p>

<p>From the linked article (there are images included for both right and left-handed users to help if you visit the blog):</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Insert the hook into the front loop of the first stitch (2 loops on hook). DO NOT YARN OVER:</li>

<p>As a note, because this is specifically geared towards amigurumi figures, it expects that you're using single crochets. I'm not sure if there's an adjustment that allows this to work with other size stitches.</p>

<p>To compare, here are images that show the three options for decreases. </p>

"How do I prepare plaster casts for casting tin figurines?","87","","<p>I tried making some figurines from tin by casting them in hand-carved forms in plaster. The tin was bubbling and the surface came out extremely uneven, with bubbles covering it.</p>

<p>Someone off-handedly commented I failed to bake my casts, but I never got any info how to do it. What temperature, what time, what other preparations? I heard plaster becomes very brittle after thorough drying too; how to prevent that?</p>
","<p>Plaster comes in quality ranges.  The plaster sold for slip casting is a high quality and, no doubt the site or store will have an answer for the beginner.</p>

<p>That said, all moisture must be out or near the outer surface of the mold before pouring your metal.  Part of you problem may be that you have a one piece mold.  A two piece mold allows the surface area you wish to reproduce to release moisture and dry when opened to the air, whereas a one piece contains an atmosphere that is usually more populated with water molecules than the outer surface, so the path of least resistance will be the outer surface and water will try to find it and remain in the plaster.</p>

<p>Your oven should be adequate to the task.  Heat it to 350 or whatever the site or store recommends and expect to leave it there for hours, depending on the density and size.  Also, be sure the mold is stabilized with the opening facing up to permit quick venting.</p>

<p>When pouring your metal into your very dry mold, venting will again have a roll. Picture water shooting from a hose and then picture that hose shooting water into a glass pitcher.  Your molten metal will act like the water when it hits the bottom of the pitcher.  You want as little of that as possible!</p>

<p>To help prevent the turbulence vents are added. The vents are created by drilling a few small diameter holes directly through the image surface and into the region that will be filled with tin.  Gases, including water vapor, which also cause turbulence, have an escape path and will leave just before the hot metal does. The metal will find them and the escape of some metal will reduce the problem.  These vents need to be chased off, after the mold is removed.  Soft metals are easy to deal with and tin falls into that category.  Hack saw, files, or sand paper should help hide the blemishes created by the removal.  </p>

<p>The basics of the process come down to putting something in a painting tray, such as water or a foam (usually shaving cream), adding some paint, and then laying the paper on top to absorb the paint. </p>

<p>Clean up may involve removing excess materials, and generally allowing the paper to completely dry.</p>

<p>Generally, the paint is mixed with something to help keep it sitting on top of the water, where your paper will be. <a href=""http://www.rookiemag.com/2013/01/diy-paper-marbling/"">This Rookie Mag tutorial</a> suggests using a little turpentine. Then you can use some sticks to marble the paint together. The tutorial linked has a special device made, but most demonstrations show someone using a single spare piece of plastic or wood to get it done.</p>

<p>You can get some really neat effects due to the way the oil repels the water. Adding drops of plain water to an area of paint will create a circle of empty space. Add a drop of paint inside it and you'll make a ring. You can repeat this to get as many nested rings as you'd like.</p>

<p>There are an amazing number of tutorials already out there to cover this, and a lot of different methods. If this technique is suitable for you, then you should be able to find a step-by-step guide that walks you through getting this done.</p>

<p>But in the learning resources I've found, it's all frustratingly lacking in hard advice or practice pieces in the middle. </p>

<p><strong>What do I need to look for in a CP to judge its difficulty level?</strong>  I don't want to get so frustrated that I give up all together, but neither do I want it to be so trivial as to be boring. Is it just how dark the grey value of the printed CP is? :) Is there a good learning resource for bridging this middle ground to CP mastery?</p>
","<p>While there is no surefire way to know, some cues may indicate a simpler or a more complex model:</p>

<ul>
<li>If it's a box-pleating model or the CP is otherwise based around a grid, the size of the grid is usually correlated to the model's complexity. As a rule of thumb, something that uses a 16×16 grid will usually be simpler than something based around an 48×48 grid.</li>
<li>The complexity of line intersections in the CP may indicate how many layers of paper there are in different parts of the model which in turn may indicate the complexity to fold. So intersections where a larger number of creases meet may indicate a more complex model. There will, of course be exceptions, as a simple mountain fold over multiple layers may have the same CP (except for fold orientation) as a complex closed sink along the same line.</li>
<li>Look at the finished model. The amount of detail will often indicate the complexity. Bad surprises do happen, however.</li>
<li>Look around forums for people writing about the model — either the folders themselves or people commenting their work will often mention the model's complexity, especially if it is high. Don't be afraid to ask, either.</li>
<li>Get some experience by folding simple designs first. Even if you do not intend to fold tessellations in the future, they may be a good starting point into Crease Patterns since tessellations are often published in the form of CPs but at the same time the complexity of these CPs is usually much lower than that of animal model CPs. As you gain experience by folding simple Crease Patterns, you will become more proficient in judging the complexity of a CP.</li>

<p>Individual same-size blocks are constructed as ""sandwiches"" (fabric on top and bottom, with batting in between), and then sewn together. The raw edges are left facing out on one side of the quilt, and snipped to encourage fraying.</p>

<p>This works particularly well with flannel fabric, leaving a soft, fuzzy border around each block. I could picture it working with knit fabric like T-shirts, as well.</p>

"Is pigment necessary to obtain white milk paint?","84","","<p>I wanted to do some homemade <strong>white</strong> milk paint. I followed the instructions given by <a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Milk-Paint"" rel=""noreferrer"">this website</a>. I may have been very naive but I thought to myself that since I only needed a <em>""whitewash""</em> version of milk paint, then I did not need to add pigment to the recipe. Therefore I only used hydrated lime. The obtained ""paint"" definitely looks like in the tutorial (white version). </p>

<p>But when I applied it on the surface of some clean pine plywood, instead of successfully painting it white, the wood took some strange dark tone (see picture). Now, the thing is that the surface definitely looks like it was painted, not white though. So the idea seems to at least, well, work somehow... <strong>Is a pigment really necessary to obtain white milk paint?</strong> If so, which one would work?</p>

","<p>Yes, pigment is necessary. The milk solution creates the <strong><em>binder</em></strong> for the pigment, which is basically the mechanism to deliver the pigment to the support/surface, but it is then intended to mostly evaporate during the drying phase, leaving the pigment behind. What you're seeing now is, basically, an almost transparent darkening of the wood surface which is the remnants of the binder material.</p>

<p>You should be able to find dry pigment online. You're looking for, in this case, <em>titanium white</em> which is PW6 and it's generally available. I'm not going to give free advertising, but if you Google ""titanium white dry pigment"" then you'll find sources very quickly. :)</p>

Even though the finished product is done the ends stick out at various points even though they've been ""weaved in"". Is there a technique to getting ends hidden in a ""finished"" way? </p>
","<p>First it is important to leave a long enough tails so that you have enough to weave in. </p>

<p>I usually just use a plastic needle and work inside and out of stitches to try and wrap around yarn. In the places where I know part of the ends are to be seen you would try to force those on the bottom of the work or where people wont see (like the inside of a hat.) Working into where your row ends also works since it is usually visually different anyway.</p>

<p>I would not weave in one loop at a time but try to pull many stitches close together and try to work the tail into all of them at once. Once I am sure I have covered enough ground I would relax the work and that will pull the tail back into the piece. Then after you might just need to either tuck in that last tuft or cut it off it need be. </p>

<p>Assuming this is something that you want to wash and is made of washable material then you can put this through and it should stay together. Not forever obviously but it won't fall apart instantly if done right. </p>

","<p>The simple answer is Worsley is using all of the techniques, in combination, for all of the parts!</p>

<p>To be able to analyze a work like this you need to know how each of the mediums are used, ie. the various ways they are applied, how they behave when applied and how they interact with each other. </p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Crayon makes a variety of marks; broader than a pen-stroke; sensitive
to pressure; shows texture of paper.  </li>
<li>Pen uses ink and makes a hard edged stroke of different weights; ink is liquid so it will diffuse in wet areas, be sharp in others, can be brushed for washes, etc...</li>
<li>Gouache is opaque watercolor and is applied by brush; used to make areas of solid and blended colors as well and sharp details; will also diffuse in wet areas.</li>
</ul>

"Resin Casting - How large must the compressor be to quickly fill a 10 Liter/2.6 gallon pressure pot at 60 psi?","81","","<p>Doing some resin casting and bought a 10 liter (2.6 gallon) pressure pot - wondering how big the compressor chamber must be. Any other tips would be great too!</p>
","<p>Resin under pressure isn't something that I have tried yet, so @Lee-MeadowhawkDesigns (or anyone else) please correct me if I am wrong here...</p>

<p>Any size compressor chamber can get the pressure pot to the desired air pressure, as long as the compressor it is attached to can provide enough pressure to get the chamber to the required pre-equalized pressure.  I'm imagining a setup that looks like this...</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6VMzY.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6VMzY.png"" alt=""Pressure Pot Rig""></a></p>

<p>The compressor(A) pushes air into the chamber(B) which is attached to the pressure-pot(D) with an initially closed valve(C) in between the chamber and the pot.</p>

<p>With the valve closed, the compresser brings the pressure in the chamber up to a pressure which is just enough higher than the target pressure, that when the valve opens and equalizes the pressure between the chamber and the pot, the resulting shared pressure is the target pressure (60psi in this case).
The effect of using a chamber and a valve in this way is that the pressure in the pot instantly reaches the target pressure in the moment that the valve is opened.</p>

<p>The challenge is then to calculate the higher-than-target pressure which needs to be in the chamber prior to the opening of the valve.  The equation for figuring out that chamber pressure is...</p>

<p>((chamber-pressure times chamber-volume) + (pot-pressure times pot-volume)) divided by (chamber-volume plus pot-volume) equals (target-pressure)</p>

<p>Assuming that the pot-pressure will start at approximately 1 atmosphere (14psi) prior to equalization, the chamber pressures needed for each of the chamber volumes which @Lee-MeadowhawkDesigns suggested are...</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KlmYb.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KlmYb.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So 75 psi for the 8 gallon chamber and 66 psi for the 21 gallon chamber.</p>

<p>Does that seem about right?</p>

<p><strong><em>DANGER WARNING : Sudden pressure changes such as what would happen when the valve opens in the above setup can be very violent.  If your pressure pot is not properly closed and sealed tightly, the incoming air can evacuate your resin through any cracks at damaging speed.  Install enough hose between the valve(C) and the pot(D) that you are nowhere near the pot when the valve opens.</em></strong></p>

"How to interpret this gauge requirement?","78","","<p>For a scarf/wrap, I am following a pattern that says ""Gauge: 25 stitches = 4 inches"".</p>

<p>Does this mean I am measuring the width, i.e. the number of stitches cast on, and not the number of rows? I always thought you count the number of rows..</p>
","<p>Usually, the gauge is given in both stitches and rows, for example 
""Gauge: 10 sts/15 rows = 4 inches in stockinette (regular knit) stitch.""  </p>

<p>You rightfully care about gauge - and typically should always check it - to insure that your final product will have the correct dimensions. </p>

<p>The three elements of how to adjust your gauge are: 
(1) needle size
(2) yarn weight, and 
(3) tension.</p>

<p>You can adust any of the above to get the correct gauge.  Usually, the variable you will modify is needle size, since how you knit is just how you knit (the tension of your knitting is characteristic of how you knit).  </p>

<p>The weight of the yarn is not usually something you want to change since you have carefully picked out your yarn in advance (and are making your gauge swatch from it!).</p>

<p>Since your pattern does not stipulate the number of rows in the gauge, I recommend just checking the number of stitches in the row - the horizontal dimension, and adust to obtain the correct width. (note: As one commentator suggested, a scarf is one instance where the length may not matter as much as it would with a structured item like a sweater.)</p>

<p>Here is a more detailed, but simple, explanation and a good reference for checking gauge: follow:<a href=""http://sheepandstitch.com/what-is-knitting-gauge/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://sheepandstitch.com/what-is-knitting-gauge/</a></p>

"What fiber crafts can I do when I am allergic to wool?","78","","<p>I'm allergic to wool. Is it still possible for me to knit/crochet/spin/weave?</p>
","<p>Yes, while you may lose some techniques that depend on wool's specific properties (like felting), there are a variety of fibers still available to the wool-allergic:</p>

<p><strong>Other Animal Fibers</strong> Alpaca is the most common - but there are also other, more exotic ones - which may be tolerable.</p>

<p><strong>Plant Fibers</strong> Cotton, linen, hemp. Should be completely tolerable even to the most wool allergic.</p>

<p><strong>Synthetics</strong> Acrylic. Like plants, no crossover with wool, so should be safe. (This one may not apply to spinning, however, since synthetic yarns aren't made the same way as natural fiber ones.)</p>

"How important is hand/finger position in fiber crafts?","77","","<p>I've been learning to knit and crochet by looking at various tutorials online. In the pictures and/or videos, the fingers are often positioned with respect to the needles or yarn in ways that don't feel comfortable or natural to me.</p>

<p>Is the relative position of fingers, yarn, and needles very important to get stitches right, or is this more of a recommendation and I should find my own way to get the loops where they need to go?</p>
","<p>The finger positioning—actually the way the yarn loops around the fingers—controls the overall tension of the yarn. Think of it like the path the thread takes on a sewing machine—all those ups, downs and arounds between the thread spool and the needle to make a nice even stitch on the fabric. </p>

<p>Fortunately the yarn path around the fingers is much more forgiving than the thread path on a sewing machine—get that wrong and…yikes, thread ball and swear words! If you find a finger/yarn position that you're comfortable with while you're learnings knit or crochet, go for it!</p>

<p>When I was learning to knit and crochet the finger positions never made any sense to me either, I just kept getting all tangled up! My solution was to hold the yarn out of the way between my index and middle fingers until I learned to get all the loops in the right place. Not very elegant but it worked for me because I had some tension control as the yarn ran between two fingers. Eventually I naturally settled into the ""proper"" finger position as my stitch technique improved.</p>

","<p>You pretty much can't, unless it's specifically listed in the description of the piece.  The sheer variety of papers used worldwide, and the fact that some creators, like Michael LaFosse, <em>make their own paper</em> specifically for the model they're folding, means that your chances of accurately identifying the paper used is going to be very very tough, especially if you can't judge the thickness, sizing, or the fiber content by touch.</p>

<p>That said, the appearance of some papers is very characteristic, and if you have experience with kami, elephant hide, Canson watercolor paper, various craft papers, tissue foil, etc., some of those may be self-evident. Every origami folder tends to be intimately familiar with kami (so-called ""origami paper"") and can usually identify it on sight both from appearance and usage.</p>

<p>Characteristics of the paper that <em>might</em> lead to identification would be the surface texture being shiny or matte (surface <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sizing"" rel=""nofollow"">sizing</a>), fiber appearance/color, thickness/weight, and, of course, the size.</p>

"Papier maché with toilet paper","77","","<p>I have been looking at instructions for DIY hamster toys and equipment.  It's recommended not to use newspapers for hamster projects because one doesn't want the hamster to injest the ink.  (Hamsters are big chewers of everything within reach).  But all the other papier maché instructions I've seen are based on newspaper strips, dampened with a thin flour paste.</p>

<p>The hamster project instructions recommend using toilet paper strips instead of paper, and some instructions have you painting the strips with just water, not paste.  But some call for the usual thin paste even on the toilet paper.</p>

<p>The most common papier maché project for a hamster is to cover a balloon and then cut an opening.</p>

<p>Is there something special about toilet paper (or kleenex) that makes the layers stick to each other better than strips of paper do?
Are there any disadvantages, when using toilet paper, to using plain water?</p>
","<p>Toilet/tissue paper is processed in such a way as to be as absorbent as possible.  So, by soaking it in water the paper fibres expand and when they dry, they shrink back and stick well to each other. Other papers, like inkjet papers, are coated, or otherwise processed, in such a way as to reduce the absorption of ink. In your case this means that if you try to make papier-mâché with such paper and just water the fibres won’t be able to absorb enough water in order to expand and stick well together when dry.</p>

<p>So you can use toilet/tissue paper and just water to make papier-mâché but for less absorbent paper you may need some adhesive (e.g. starch from flour).</p>

The left blade is more stable than the right one, in my experience, but is also more difficult to find.</p>

<p>As you can see, the blades can be replaced. This should be done rather often. Especially for fine details you need a sharp blade.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.aliexpress.com/item/oxidation-color-mobile-phone-film-graver-sharpener-knife-knife-papercut-circuit-board-cutter/32219358201.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YSIRx.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>You need the sharper angle of the first picture to cut sharp turns.</p>

<p>I personally use a much smaller blade (though with the same angle), because I have found that the big blades bend too much under pressure and therefore break earlier. Also, with a smaller blade, your hand is more close to the paper, which I find comfortable.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qd1Bm.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qd1Bm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>It's a bit difficult to see because of the shadow, but it has a normal end (like the right one on the first picture). We don't need the extra stability on such a small blade.</p>

<p>My knife is the SDI0491. I got it as a present, so I don't know where it was bought, but if you search for the serial number you can find it. <a href=""http://www.parinenterprises.com/sdi/cutter-knives.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This website</a> seems to be the producer's page.</p>

<p>The knife I'm using (last picture) is sometimes called a D type cutter. You can find a product overview of some producer <a href=""http://www.lion-office.com/products/nt/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> (I haven't tried these knifes, but they look similar). It seems characteristic to D type to have a smaller blade.</p>

<h1>Haft</h1>

<p>You should have, like on the first and third pictures above, a haft with a rough surface around the place where you hold it, for better grip.</p>

<p>I prefer a plastic haft over a metal haft because I have the impression that with metal hafts your hand can get a bit sweaty.</p>

<p>If you need to know what kind of tree -- probably willow or apple.</p>
","<p>Plastic will melt and flow away from the iron leaving a hole.  Cardboard is really just paper with air gaps between the glued layers so there's just a little bit of material to burn.</p>

<p>A wooden stick is going to be solid wood.  It doesn't melt and move out of the way - if anything the burned area of wood actually gets harder (and more brittle) as it turns to charcoal.  You're not going to just burn a hole through it.</p>

<p>The right tool is, of course, a drill.  You may be able to use a sharply pointed knife for a smaller stick, but a drill really is going to be your best bet.  It will also work for the plastic and cardboard, and in my opinion, will be safer than using a burning hot iron.</p>

"Method for embedding rock mosaic in transparent material","75","","<p>I am looking for a way to do the following. 
1. Arrange a pattern of semi-precious stones.
2. Embed it in a transparent medium so that it can be hung up, say in front of a window.</p>

<p>Someone suggested I use ClearCast epoxy in a silicone mold. I sort of like this idea, but the problem is that if I just pour epoxy over the stones, the whole thing will have exposed stones on one side. I'd like to have it smooth on both sides. Another thing that occurred to me is to lay the stones on a sheet of glass, and then pour the epoxy over that, but I don't know how well that would work. How well would the epoxy bond to the glass? Also, what would be a good way of keeping a rectangular shape on the sides?</p>

<p>Another option would be to do two pours. After pouring onto the stones and letting it harden, I could turn it over and then pour a second layer. Any ideas on how well the second pour would bond to the first, and also would I expect a visible fault plane in the middle?</p>

<p>Any thoughts are greatly appreciated. Feel free to alter the tags.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This would be what I would have tried/suggested with epoxy resin. Make the first pour and let it harden. Do your best to try and remove bubbles during both pours obviously. You don't want to pour to fill half but slightly less then that so your object appear suspended in the middle of the finished piece. This will be harder to accomplish if your objects are of greatly different thicknesses. What works against you here is that most epoxies are self leveling.</p>

<p>Once the first pour has hardened you can start the next one. Depending on the contours of your rocks you will need to be wary of trapped air bubbles. You could either put the rocks in first and pour or place the rocks mid pour. The ladder should mitigate the epoxy moving your rocks around during the pour. </p>

<p>The two+ pours method is used frequently with painting to create the illusion of 3 dimensions. One example is this video showing the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSvWMUZCjRc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">artist filling the bottom of the box with resin and a painted goldfish</a>. </p>

<p>While looking for something else I found another <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxmq3Yh3GnU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">video showing how to make a rock embedded coaster with resin and a silicone mold</a>. Seems to line up with the suggestions given above. Only difference being the rocks were set before the first pour cured completely. If you want your rocks to be suspended it might be better if you wait until it has hardened.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, what would be a good way of keeping a rectangular shape on the sides?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using some sort of mold would be your best option. You see them commonly used in resin jewelry. Large rectangular molds do exist. <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/Square-Jewelry-Epoxy-Resin-Molds-Cast-Moulds-/360456065581"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A cursory search found a 7 inch square mold that was 3/4 inches deep</a>.  </p>

<p>I saw someone use a mini red solo cup as a mold and it worked perfectly. You would need to test your resin first to see how it reacts. Not all resin products are created equally. </p>

<p>I am not sure of other materials or home brew options for molds. It would have to be something non permeable. This could easily be another question. </p>

<p>Similarly, I have an old butterfly clutch badge which I do not use anymore. Would it be possible to take the clutch from this old badge and attach it to the new one?</p>
","<p>For removing the stick pin backing, you need to remove the parts that stick out and file it down to be smooth. To remove, I'd use one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Dremel tool with appropriate bit</li>
<li>if it looks like the badge was soldered, a soldering iron to un-solder it. (Make sure that the front of the badge won't be damaged by the heat, and follow safety precautions! If you guessed wrong and it was epoxied, heating it may release toxic fumes.)</li>
<li>a pair of wire cutters, depending on how substantial the pin back is. (This would work well on the butterfly clasp pin pictured, not so sure about the stick pin version.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Then to smooth the back, you could use a metal file or a Dremel tool with a grinding bit.</p>

<p>To attach the new pin, I would just buy a new butterfly clasp base at a craft store (<a href=""https://www.michaels.com/bead-landing-pin-with-clutch-back/M10443119.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example</a>). If you really wanted to re-use the clasp from the other badge, definitely use the Dremel tool, as you will need to cut a base for the pin and not just clip the straight pin off.</p>

<p>Then you just need to epoxy or solder it to the now-smooth badge back!</p>

"How can I quickly and easily pencil in guide and slant lines for lettering/calligraphy?","72","","<p>I'm really getting tired of repeatedly having to measure out and draw guide and slope lines for lettering or calligraphy with a ruler.

","<p>Make sure you're using a straight-edge table, and get yourself a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-square"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">T-Square</a>, and an Ames lettering guide.</p>

<p>The wheel on the Ames lettering guide rotates, so you can adjust the size between the lines, and the different hole sets account for different ascender/descender/height spacings for different styles of lettering.</p>

<p>Make sure your paper is taped down, and straight with regards to the T-square (in a pinch you can use a ruler), and then simply put your pencil in the appropriate holes, and slide the letter guide across the t-square's edge.  Sliding the T-square up and down along the desk edge lets you do different sets of lines quickly and easily.</p>

<p>The Ames also allows for drawing slant lines at 68º. For other angles, you can use drafting triangles, either fixed or adjustable.</p>

","<p>Pastels, that is chalk pastels, are easy and beautiful media for blending or creating translucent effects like smoke, as you know.   However, they are fragile and will blow away or fall off if not sealed.  Even then they will be sensitive to the environment, especially fingers.</p>

<p>That said, I'd bet you would be successful with a semi-permanent spray fixative.  You'll be able to go over it, if you must, but your smoke effect will gain longevity.</p>

"Decorate the inside of a tube?","71","","<p>We tend to save the cardboard tubes from toilet paper and paper towels for crafts, like play binoculars and telescopes.</p>

<p>The outsides are easy to decorate, the insides not so much. </p>

<p>Painting is maybe doable, but a brush would hit at the wrong angle. Instead, I've thought about decorating paper and rolling it up inside. I'm struggling with how to affix this paper. If I glue the back of it, it'd be tough to get inside without wrinkling. I'd rather not tape along the seam, as it's ugly!</p>

<p>Is there a better way to get the decorated paper inside the tube? </p>
","<p>Regardless of what you intend to decorate the inside of your tubes with, I think the solution is to apply the adhesive on the <em>inside first</em> and then decorate. </p>

<p>I was looking at a way to get paint brush bristles angled at 90 degrees either via a kludge, like an elastic, or a commercial product but I had issues searching for ""90 degree brush head"". What little I did find was either too large or unrealistic for this application. That's when it hit me! There is a simpler solution likely already in your possession or at least cheap to acquire for this. </p>

<p>A toothbrush already has the 90 degree angle that would make for easy adhesive application on the inside of a tube. You basic white glue would be fine here for this. Even though it is non toxic I am sure you would prefer to get a dedicated toothbrush as supposed to dual purposing your daily one. </p>

<p>Once you get a decent amount of glue inside I would roll up the paper, that you plan on placing inside, smaller than that of the toilet paper roll itself. Gently put it in the tube and once it is inside all the way you should be able to release it. It will open most of the way and a little massaging will help get it in place the rest of the way. This should help keep glue from getting on the paper where it will be seen. </p>

<p>Using paper that is longer than your tube would be useful as you can adjust it from both ends without having to put your hand in too far. Excess paper can easily be removed with scissors or knives after. </p>

<p>If you were to use something other than paper, like glitter for instance, it would just be a matter of sprinkling it inside the tube and letting it stick. </p>

"Aligning multi-color woodblock print?","70","","<p>I know how the registration of wood blocks works in the Japanese-style wood block printing method (put registration marks on the block to align the paper: see <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKSrgKjevPmNZxCAyTZP5cQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this YouTube channel</a>). Since the woodblock is wet with paste and pigments, the paper adheres to the block and the print can be rubbed off by hand with a barren. </p>

<p>How does registration work with European-style wood block printing, where a printing press is used instead of rubbing by hand with a barren? I imagine that, if you don't fix the paper on the block in some way, the paper might shift while you slide the block (and paper) through the press.</p>
","<p>My bachelor's degree was in Fine Arts, with a focus on wood block printing. </p>

<p>The technique I was taught involved marking the center line on the back of the leading edge of the paper. (The end that will feed into the press first.) On the press, lay out a registration paper that clearly marks the location of the block, a corresponding center line, and one or both leading corners. The block is inked and laid on the slab. Then, align the center lines and corner marks, with the other end held high. Slowly ""roll"" the paper flat onto the block while keeping the leading edge aligned. This minimizes inappropriate contact and ensures a flat lay on the block. The ink will loosely hold the paper in place.</p>

<p>Once the paper is laid, heavy felt blankets are usually laid over the entire thing. There is the chance for paper movement here, so again - a careful ""rolling"" action from the leading edge back is best. Make sure the weight of the blankets is centered over the block as you do this. These blankets then keep the paper in place while printing, as well as enhancing print quality and embossing.</p>

<p>Ensuring that your press is set to the appropriate height is very important too. Too much pressure will cause damage to the paper, or movement of the block and/or the paper. Once printed, the blankets and then paper are removed in a similar but opposite method.</p>

"Blacklight sensitive paper","70","","<p>I'm working on a college project which involves blacklight. I know about the blacklight sensitive paint which glows when exposed to the blacklight. I also know that some papers are sensitive as well. I want to know if there are any specific types of paper that are sensitive to blacklight. Or is it just based on the colors?</p>
","<p>Paper brighteners used in modern papers contain fluorescent materials that make the paper glow under a black light. Bright white paper will actually glow fairly well. </p>

<p>Any paper that's been treated with these types of brighteners will glow under a black light. Typically, you'll see that neon colors are going to be the ""brightest"", and so they will glow the best. </p>

<p>In this case, it's not anything to do with what the material is made from, but how it's colored/treated. The chemicals are called Optical Brightening Agents, and are used in a wide variety of products to add fluorescence.

"Finding fabric and thread thickness","69","","<p>I was at Joann fabric store recently and couldn't figure out the thickness of the fabric or thread I was looking at. The fabric was just wrapped around some cardboard that just had a name and material. None of them had a denier (or anything else that I could identify as a thickness). The spools of thread were the same way.</p>

<p>I've attached a photo of what the spools generally looked like.</p>

<p>How am I supposed to find the thickness of the products I'm looking at? It seems like there should be a precise way of doing so, but I don't know what it is.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y1Zhi.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y1Zhi.jpg"" alt=""spool of thread without denier""></a></p>
","<p>Textiles (in this case, thread and fabric), are highly engineered, complex structures around which entirely separate industries are built.  For example, very few fabric manufacturers also make their own thread (which is technically a yarn). There are manufacturing specifications for every stage of textile manufacturer, from fiber to yarn to fabric to dyeing and finishing.</p>

<p>This means that the textiles we buy in fabric stores possess a set of layered specifications.  For the average user, there may be one measurement at point of purchase, e.g., thread size or weight or fabric thickness, but that does not tell the whole story.  Other combinations of these same variables can result in the same final number.  </p>

<p>Thread size/weight can look pretty complex but it’s not as big of a mystery as it seems at first since fabric stores only carry a few sizes and weights and they are usually nicely labeled, e.g., all-purpose (or dual-duty or general use), quilting and embroidery, buttonhole, topstitching, etc. Granted, these are approximate weight classes, not exact specifications.</p>

<p>If you are a home sewer or crafter, select the fiber content you want, e.g., 100% cotton, 100% Polyester, core-wrapped (polyester wrapped in cotton), rayon, silk, etc.  If you are quilting you will use 100% cotton, if you are sewing polyester knits, wovens or fleece you’ll want to use 100% polyester.  As best you can, match the thread fiber content to the fabric fiber content, or use one of the dual-duty or general use threads.</p>

<p>One example of an explanation of thread weights and sizes:
<a href=""https://www.seasonedhomemaker.com/all-about-thread-weight/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.seasonedhomemaker.com/all-about-thread-weight/</a></p>

<p>Fabric weight and thickness also is composed of many variables.  Fiber content, yarn size, fabric construction, etc.  Every fabric has a different combination of these variables, but there are some fairly standard types.  Fabric stores try to make it easy and stock quilting cottons together, fleece together, lining fabric together, etc.  But, again, these will be approximate weight classes, not exact specifications.</p>

<p>One example of an explanation of fabric weights:
<a href=""http://blog.fabricuk.com/understanding-fabric-weight/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://blog.fabricuk.com/understanding-fabric-weight/</a></p>

<p>Unless you source your material (thread and fabric) directly from the manufacturer and obtain a spec sheet for each, you will still not be 100% sure of the thread or fabric specs. </p>

<p>If you are totally committed to knowing the manufacturing specs of your thread and fabric, you will need to contact the manufacturer of the thread or fabric, give them the UPC code on the end of the bolt (that’s that piece of cardboard you mentioned) or the thread label.  It will not be possible for the average person to do their own testing, special equipment and expertise is required to do this sort of “fabric forensics.”</p>

<p>An alternative (which will be expensive) is to have a certified lab do your spec testing for you, e.g., 
<a href=""http://www.gaston.edu/textile-technology-center/product-testing/physical-testing/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.gaston.edu/textile-technology-center/product-testing/physical-testing/</a></p>

<p>My practical recommendation is that you identify the exact thread (manufacturer, fiber content, use) and fabric (manufacturer, etc.) you want to use over time and build up an inventory.  In other words, buy multiple spools of the thread, and multiple yards of the fabric off of the same bolt.  At least this way you will know that your products are composed of the same weights and types.</p>

<p>Good luck with your projects, I applaud your interest in quality control.  But, as they say, “Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”  In this context, that may mean using the fabric stores’ descriptions of the thread categories and fabrics you use, or buy up a consistent inventory, but remember to have fun and enjoy the process.</p>

"What are possible sources of wood pieces from for making musical instruments?","69","","<p>I've always wanted to make electric guitars myself. However, it seems a bit hard to find the right supply of wood to do so, as musical instruments usually require naturally dried wood pieces for acoustic stability.</p>
","<p>The properties of the wood, especially its density will have a significant effect on the  tone of the instrument but there is quite a wide variety used as well as various laminates. </p>

<p>Of critical importance is the stability of the wood as even small amounts of warping can seriously affect play-ability, this is especially the case with the neck which needs to be able to resist the tension of the strings without bowing or twisting. Indeed the necks of most steel strung guitars are fitted with internal 'truss rods' which can be adjusted to balance the tension of the strings. </p>

<p>Similarly wood used for musical instruments needs to be very well seasoned this takes time and carefully controlled conditions. </p>

<p>One good option for a first project is that there are several companies selling guitar kits in various degrees of completion with a wide variety of body and necks styles and hardware available. If you want to design your own body shape you could either modify an existing style (the kits are usually clones of popular models/brands) of get one with a through neck so you at lest have the crucial mechanical parts done and the material for the rest of the body becomes less critical. Indeed there have been a few 'fantasy' guitars built around a through neck using foam and fibreglass to sculpt the body. </p>

<p>Another option is to look for salvaged wood. <a href=""http://www.groundguitar.com/brian-may-guitars-and-gear/"" rel=""nofollow"">Brian May famously built his own guitar, with his dad, using wood from a fireplace mantle shelf and other sources</a>. Hardwood tables and bar tops may also be good sources. These also have the advantage that you know that the wood is well seasoned. Chunky shelves and table tops are often made from mahogany which well suited to making a guitar. </p>

","<p>Genrally in amigurumi you don't crochet in rows, but in spiral. This way there is no visible seam at all, but you usually need a stitch marker to keep track of where rows begin and end.</p>

"What materials can be used to stiffen a leather bag?","67","","<p>I'm early in the process of making a leather doctor's bag (also known as a Gladstone bag), in this kind of shape:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/pEtzgPw.jpg"" alt=""Foster &amp; Sons Gladstone bag""></p>

<p>I've bought a side of ~2mm cowhide for the body, but I know from past experience that it's too flexible to stay in shape while standing on the floor without something to stiffen it.</p>

<p><strong>So, what materials can I use to stiffen the leather in the straight part of the bag's sides?</strong></p>

<p>I've considered the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Card (<a href=""https://my63leather.wordpress.com/2015/08/04/gladstone-bag-no-1/"" rel=""noreferrer"">as used here</a>) - this worries me because it will degrade very quickly when wet.</li>

<li>Interfacing - I've never seen this used for leather goods but it's a plausible material</li>
<li>Sheet plastic - this is lightweight and waterproof</li>
<li>Sheet metal (probably aluminium) - strong, but probably not flexible enough and heavy</li>
<li>Steel framing (rather than a full sheet) - this seems to be what hard briefcases use for strength but is almost certainly too stiff.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm looking for something that will enable the bag to stand upright without sagging, but I'm making a bag not a box, so it needs to retain some flexibility.</p>
","<p>One thing not on your list is steel wire.</p>

<p>This is a sort of steel framing I suppose. But it can do a lot while remaining light and flexible. I would think you want something in spring temper, so perhaps piano wire of sufficient gauge. I suppose whenever I've seen these it's been mild steel though, somewhere around .050-.100"" diameter.</p>

<p>""U""-shaped members on each side and each end might do the trick. They could be sewn into seams or otherwise concealed.</p>

<p>Interestingly, these members resist torsion (twisting) as well as bending. So, for example, if you wanted a bag that didn't flop down but was free to pull apart for access at the top (and pull together at the top to close), you could place a square wire frame at the bottom and a U or square frame on the sides only (not the ends). The frame would tend to make each side ""hinge"" in and out as one, roughly like the cover of a book, rather than having to pull each end separately to open.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>EDIT</em> : The clay I'd be using would be <em>'air-drying'</em> (not sure if it's called like that), reuseable (when put in water) clay. I hope that's specific enough. :)</p>
","<p>There are a few different options for sculpting materials that fall withing the broad definition of 'clay' </p>

<p><strong>Water based clays</strong></p>

<p>These are essentially the same stuff used for pottery and are widely used for 'fine art' type sculpture. The big advantage of water based clay is that its plasticity and hardness can be controlled according to how wet it is so you can use wet clay  to quickly rough out a form and then allow it to dry a bit to firm up to allow you to refine surface detail. </p>

<p>Their disadvantage is that they tend not to be very string when wet and usually need some sort of internal support armature to support their own weight. You can get clays filled with paper or nylon fibres which are a bit stronger when dry but, in my experience aren't that nice to work with as the fibres can interfere with the surface. </p>

<p><strong>Oil based Clays</strong> </p>

<p>Also known as 'Plasticine' common professional brands are <a href=""http://www.chavant.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Chavant</a> and <a href=""http://www.monstermakers.com/product/monster-clay-premium-grade-html"" rel=""nofollow"">Monster Clay</a> </p>

<p>These are available in a range of hardness and, unlike some cheaper brands can be used with RVT silicone to make moulds. </p>

<p>These tend to be a bit firmer than water based clay and as such lend themselves well to small, finely detailed models and is also a bit cleaner to work with. It has reasonable strength and tends to be less reliant on internal armatures. The downside of this is that it can be more time consuming to build up the bulk of the model and tends not to be so good for sweeping organic surfaces, although then can be softened a bit with heat and the professional brands can be melted and cast. </p>

<p>These give very good detail and can be smoothed very effectively. They also don't dry out and as such can be worked into and reused more or less indefinitely (although they will gradually decline in quality over time).</p>

<p><strong>Modelling Putty</strong> </p>

<p>This includes epoxy putties like <a href=""http://www.milliput.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">milliput</a> these are mixed from 2 parts to a firm putty and will dry hard after a few hours. This has the advantage that they are hard and string enough to be used as a finished piece and a such are frequently used for converting and modifying existing miniatures. </p>

<p>Obviously the downside of this is that you only have a few hours to sculpt it before it sets, although you can still drill, sand and carve it once it has set which can be useful in some situations. </p>

<p><strong>Wax</strong> </p>

<p>There are a variety of sculpting waxes available. Their big advantage is that their harness can be controlled easily by both heating and blending different wax grades. They can be both sculpted and carved depending on relative hardness. </p>

<p>Waxes especially harder ones tend to be good for getting very crisp detail. </p>

<p><strong>Tools</strong> </p>

<p>There are a few broad categories of sculpting tools </p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.whiterosetools.com/Am-Tech-R0330?gclid=CIbRqYnZ8M4CFUu6GwodfBQPxg"" rel=""nofollow"">Wax carving/dental  tools</a> : these tend to be stainless steel and are good for fine detail. I would say that a set of these is a good starting point. </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.bathpotters.co.uk/wooden-double-ended-ball-tool-set-of-3-wbts/p5974"" rel=""nofollow"">Ball stylus tools</a> : designed for creating consistent fillets but can also be useful for sculpting fine detail and undercuts. </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.bathpotters.co.uk/hardwood-modelling-tools/c113"" rel=""nofollow"">Hardwood clay tools</a> :  these tend to be geared more towards larger pieces in relatively soft media. </li>
<li><a href=""http://miniatures.about.com/od/toolsforminiatures/gr/clayshapers.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Silicone tipped shapers</a> : best suited to final smoothing and polishing, specifically in conjunction with solvents and/or lubricants. </li>
</ul>

<p>etc etc </p>

<p>Tool selection is really a case of what works for you but all of the above are likely to be potentially useful.</p>

<p><strong>Casting</strong> </p>

<p>Casting is a whole separate subject in itself....</p>

<p>Silicone rubber is probably the most versatile mould material and is reasonably easy to use. </p>

<p>For small scale casting you are really looking at catalysed or 2 part resins which include Polyester, Epoxy and Acrylic. In general PU resins are a good bet as they cast well, aren't too expensive, have good mechanical properties and are reasonably easy to use. </p>

<p>Figurine casting also tends to use resin with powder fillers added. Different fillers give different properties to the casting. </p>

<p>PVC and ABS need to be extruded or injection moulded and aren't really practical for small scale casting. </p>

<p><strong>General Advice</strong></p>

<p>I would suggest starting out with a relatively soft medium such as water based clay or the softest grades of oil clay. These are easy to work with and will let you 'sketch' figures reasonably quickly to get a feel for working in 3 dimensions. As you progress you may want to try harder grades to allow you to get a smoother finish and crisper detail. As your style evolves you will start to learn exactly what properties you need. </p>

"How to flat weave (n) strands","62","","<p>I'm trying to make flat weave scarves and blankets. It occurred to me that you should be able to flat weave any number of strands with about the same method.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain, or direct me to a tutorial on, how to flat weave large numbers of strands?</p>

<p>Here are some examples of flat weaves That are similar to what I'm going for. I'm going to be using plush chunky yarn not Paracord, but the material is irrelevant. It's the same idea as a standard 3 strand weave that all children know. But logic says the process should be able to scale up to number of strands.

I found several good pictures and some instruction videos and sites, as will you.</p>

<p>It is basically weaving with free ends, not limited in size but as free ends do tend to get out of hand mostly just done in small stips.<br>
Nothing stops you from adding more sets of strings, getting wider stips0</p>

<p>I would not start with many, I would start with the number in the instructions you use, then add a few more sets of strings, say halve the number again and when that works, start with double the number.<br>
You will notice that the top of the work is not at 90 degrees with the sides, so if you want to do a wider strip or even a blanket, you may need to do several stages of starting, making a sawtooth top.<br>
I even see it as likely your first big work being made up out of several or even many narrow strips, sawn together. Controlling many strings is not as easy as you might think.</p>

<p>Seeing the photos you added to your question, I would call that braiding, not 'flat weaving' and I wrote instructions for up to 6 strings flat a while ago and have them on <a href=""http://knopen.ismijnhobby.nl/tables/braid-text_table.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my (non commercial) website.</a><br>

You can also braid the other way round, but it looks so much the same, you can work it out for yourself.  </p>

<p>With most braiding you can just add more strings and keep working in the same kind of pattern. In above set of instructions you can use any odd number of strings, keeping braiding them in sets of two, going from the right for one move and from the left for the next, keeping them going over one, under one for the weave. If you have more than 3 strings you can also go over and under more than one, the more strands, the more patterns possible. But that is not beginners work. When you are ready for that, an internet search (-braiding patterns- -japanese braiding- -takadai- or -kumihimo-) will likely give good results.</p>

<p>One old method of working with many strings is to use bobbins and work on a pillow or a frame.

","<p>You get these outlines when the pigment collects on the edges of the water you have laid down. This happens when you use a lot of water, causing the pigment to float around in the ""puddle"" and gravitate towards the edges as it dries (if you're interested in the physics, there's even a name for it: the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_ring_effect"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">coffee ring effect</a>!).</p>

<p>To avoid these outlines, you need to use less water when you lay down the color. You should have enough water to wet the entire area, but not so much that it puddles on the paper. You may find that you need to dilute your pigment more - <em>before</em> the wash - to achieve the same color. (Note that diluting pigment is not the same as using lots of water to apply it!)</p>

<p>This will involve some amount of experimenting to get a ""feel"" for how much water is necessary. Also, consider using a smaller brush since you mention yours sometimes holds too much water. I would recommend trying different ratios on a scrap piece of paper to see what works best with your pigments.</p>

<p>In essence I'm just looking to know what the best way of creating a reusable bandage sleeve would be.</p>
","<p>A couple options appear for your objective. Substitute sewing with fabric glue and apply sparsely. Most bandages of the sort you have pictured are elastic and would not take well to sewing, as you've noted. By the same token, they would also not take well to heavy adhesive application.</p>

<p>One would apply dots of adhesive spaced along the edges where overlapped, allowing the stretchy part to stretch, while keeping the glued portions small and spaced closely enough to avoid gaps but not so close as to eat up the stretch required for a good fit.</p>

<p>One would desire to keep the stretch forces to a minimum while applying the bandages on a suitable model arm and secure the bandages as needed with tape or similar products while the glue cures.</p>

<p>Testing would be desirable to determine how much stretch the glue can handle before failing, then adjust spacing accordingly.</p>

<p>Another option would be to use a carrier sleeve and glove, perhaps slightly oversized if such a factor is not a problem. The sleeve would reduce or prevent the stretching while either stitching or adhesive would secure the bandages in the desired locations. A suitable model would accelerate the process, as noted above. I don't believe it would be a simple matter to machine stitch on a sleeve and hand-stitching would require patience and determination.</p>

"Hand painting with spray paint?","61","","<p>Is it possible to take spray paint, spray it in a cup, and use it to hand paint with? I have a bottle of it, but no other paint and I want this hue. Just wondering if I can use this temporarily.</p>
","<p>Spray paint, by design is in a pressurized container, to belabor the obvious. When used, the material is converted to an aerosol by the pressure, which then travels some distance at a good speed.</p>

<p>If you are attempting to spray it in a cup, a good portion of that force will result in back-spray, pushing the paint out of the cup. This is undesirable. </p>

<p>A couple methods can be used to mitigate this problem. One is to use a large container, not a cup, something bucket sized and hold the nozzle near the edge of the bucket. Spray in a direction to cause rotation of the pressure as well as angled slightly downward, to keep the spray in the bucket. A portion of the spray will be wasted by coating the side of the bucket, making this a less than optimum method.</p>

<p>Another option is to find a nozzle from a product using ""spray straws"" that direct the substance. Common sources are compressed air cans, also known as computer dusters, lubricants such as WD-40 and others. If the nozzle and straw come from such products, be sure to clean the material thoroughly to avoid paint contamination.</p>

<p>A suitable receptacle for this method might be a tall soft drink can or even a wide mouth tallish jar. Position the spray straw in a manner similar to the bucket method, pointing slightly downward and in a rotational manner. You will get some back spray, as the pressure has to go somewhere. You can reduce that problem by spraying under a rag or similar open-weave cloth or through a hole in the fabric.</p>

<p>Spray paint is also more volatile, and you will likely have shorter working time with the paint that collects before it dries or becomes too thick to use.</p>

<li>Don't try to run if you cannot walk yet. In other words: do some simple projects first. You obviously like the finished results of the more complex ones better. But by trying easier ones first, you gain experience on how to read the diagrams, and you're practising the techniques for precise folds. Plus: better a nicely finished 'easy' project and the feeling that you succeeded, than a complex ball of paper and you giving up completely, don't you think?</li>
<li>Larger paper makes things easier to see and to fold. I know dollar bills come in only one size, so you'll need to cut your own piece of paper. Make sure the proportions match.</li>
<li>If you insist on folding the complex item, try to figure out till which point you still understand the steps; you must absolutely be sure whether folds go up or down, or maybe between two parts of the paper. Your result may look similar, but if it's not completely the same, you'll find out sooner or later. So, check and double check and maybe ask someone else if they notice any differences.</li>
</ul>

<p>But, it has been mentioned there that they are for water colors. Since toothed paper is required for holding pencil colors, will these be suitable for pencil colors?</p>
","<p>A lot of color pencil artists use watercolor paper for their work because solvent blending is less likely to damage the paper from any moisture that may be added and the paper can take a lot of abuse since it is so sturdy. However, most of the ones I follow use hot press rather than cold press or rough. </p>

<p>It's true that you want tooth, but cold press or rough has a <strong><em>lot</em></strong> of tooth and it can be really tricky to get color into the valleys of the surface. This may lead to needing a lot more pressure to fill and wear harder on your pencils, requiring more frequent sharpening to maintain a sufficiently sharp point.</p>

<p>Still, not all papers are the same, so if you have some and want to try it, you may appreciate the look you get and prefer it. In the end, there is nothing that says you can't!</p>

"Topstitching the inside AND outside seam of pants","58","","<p>I have cotton cargo pants (from Old Navy, I think) where the outside seam has two topstitches and the inside seam only has one. Even the seam between the left/right halves has a topstitch.</p>

<p>How is that possible? What tool or technique was used to get a topstitch on every major seam?</p>

<p>The only thing I can imagine is a sewing machine where the needle sews parallel to a long, thin base, allowing each pant leg to be topstitched after being joined with a stitch when they were inside out.</p>

<p>Here are pictures of the stitches for a single leg of my pants. Note how one is double topstitched, and the other is single. The point is that all stitches on the pants are like this (with no breaks), so I don't see how they did it unless they have a special machine.</p>

<p>You can see how the arm is shaped in a way that would allow you to scrunch up the leg.</p>

<p>You could try topstitching like this on a typical home sewing machine, but success would depend on the thickness of the fabric and how skinny the legs are... either way, take it slow!!</p>

<p>Alternatively, a common finish on pants is to only topstitch one set of seams. You can easily do this on a typical home sewing machine! For example if you want topstitching on the outside, sew and topstitch the outer seams <em>before</em> doing the inside seams. This way you have plenty of room to maneuver. Then you can complete the inside seams.</p>

<p>Another option is to topstitch the inside seams, and then partially topstitch the outside seams, usually just past the pocket - again, easy enough to do on a typical machine.

"Acidity of hands when binding books","56","","<p>I was wondering if working bare hand when doing bookbinding could be detrimental for the paper, more specifically when binding a sketchbook or paper intended for watercolor painting or calligraphy. </p>

<p>Those papers are specifically acid free to preserve the pigments. I am wondering if touching, folding and or pressing it with bare hands will not make it more acidic or will leave some residue preventing the good adhesion of color to it? Has anyone experience with this?</p>
","<p>I used to do bookbinding for several years and never had any problems  with using bare hands. I only used latex gloves when repairing fragile books and/or paper. </p>

<p>If you are using new, clean and strong paper, I would not hesitate to recommend using bare hands in your bookbinding process. You should not experience any detrimental effects on the paper you use, I never did. I have better grip without gloves and thus more confidence in folding paper by hand. That said it would be prudent to keep your hands free of excessive perspiration and very clean, especially from dirt, ink and glue.  Wash your hands as often as required and make sure your hands are definitely dry before recommencing your bookbinding.</p>

<p>Small hint: Do not slide your hands over any ink because it could smear. If you need to make a very crisp fold, I would suggest using a sheet of clear plastic to slide your hands over inked areas. Slide your hands over the plastic and not the ink marked spots.</p>

"How to get a precise ""top"" of a cylinder?","56","","<p>I'm working on a rocket model made of resin. There are two parts I need to adjust and then glue together: one part is a cylinder and the other a cone. (Actually, I've got to do this four times to get four boosters.)</p>

<p>I'd like to be as precise as possible here and wonder how I can make sure the sides I'm sanding are leveled. Are there any tricks when sanding a cylinder to ensure the ""top"" isn't going to incline?</p>

<p>The problem is that these parts don't have smooth sides so I can't for example stick them into some tube.</p>

","<p>If you have access to a table saw, you can place the cylinder against the miter guide and carefully advance it into the blade.</p>

<p>For a non-power-tool related option, a hand saw miter box will provide similar, perhaps easier alignment. The typical hand saw will chew up the ends of the cylinder, but here's the good part. Use rubber cement to attach a sheet of sandpaper of desired grit to the side of the saw blade.</p>

<p>It may be necessary to shim the cylinder to place it higher than the saw blade teeth. As you press the cylinder against the front or back of the miter box, you'll also apply pressure toward the sandpaper coated blade. Rotate the cylinder as you sand to avoid irregularities caused by the fore and aft motion of the saw.</p>

<p>It helps if you have three hands and especially if you bolt or otherwise clamp the miter box to a solid surface.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/p5Zur.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/p5Zur.jpg"" alt=""miter box in use""></a></p>

<p>Depending on your skill set, you can construct your miter box, buy a kit or purchase from retail.</p>

<p>I have a hobbyist grade milling machine. I can clamp the cylinder in the vise, true it up to a few thousandths of an inch and mill the end true. That's overkill, and also a power tool option.</p>

<p>A good disk sander will have a miter guide and will be true to the disk plane, but again, expensive power tools may not be your best selection.</p>

<p>If you have the ability to drill a hole to match your cylinder squarely in a piece of wood, you can insert the cylinder and shave away the off-true portion with a plane, or use a sanding block. This last option is the least-tech, least-equipment method one can use, I believe.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Another glance at your images shows that the protrusions on the cylinders may cause some out-of-true results. If you have a continuous line on the side of the cylinder to use as contact point for the miter box, the chance of success is higher. For a miter box to work, you'd have to have two lines clear, ninety degrees apart.</p>

<p>For the hole-in-the-board method, you could get away with slicing into the edge of the hole clearance slots for the protrusions. The remainder of the hole's edges would provide the support and alignment needed for a good result.</p>

<p>So does anyone know of any chemicals that can be used to stain wood blue effectively? I would like to avoid using typical dyes or stains, as I find they can be very expensive and not always have good results, when ebonizing has worked wonders.</p>
","<p>I know there was discussion of indigo up in the comments, but that was based upon going through the entire process of growing the indigo, then fermenting it to use it as a dye.  Although there can be a lot pleasure in going through an entire process like that, there is no reason you would have to.  Indigo dye crystals (both natural and artificial) are inexpensive, readily available and easy to use (as opposed to many other natural dyes). </p>

<p>I have never used indigo on plywood, but it does a great job of dying basket reed, and is dark enough to make a blue color even though the reed is not white.

So if you hold that card up to your subject, the card will be illuminated under the same lighting conditions as your subject&hellip; so it will experience the same color shifts that your local lighting conditions produce.</p>

<p>So, for example, if the white in your subject looks a bit yellow under incandescent lights, the true-white (value 10) on the card will look a bit yellow, too.

","<p>""Water-based"" is not equivalent to ""water soluble after drying"". I have no idea what this particular (Pebeo brand) gilding size is made out of, but if it's like most others on the market, it's very similar to latex/acrylic paint (or white glue, or a number of other materials): it's water-based in that it can be thinned with water, and it can be cleaned up with plain soap and water while it's still wet. However, once it dries, it's basically insoluble: the only way to remove it is by physical means, i.e. scraping.</p>

<p>That said, unless a glue/paint explicitly says that it's water-resistant once dry, I wouldn't suggest using it in a wet area. It may not dissolve in water, but it may soften, or otherwise not react well. </p>

<p>Also, a bathroom ceiling is not where I'd personally recommend using imitation gold leaf: nevermind the glue, the leaf itself will tarnish pretty rapidly with that much moisture around. You'd need to use a sealer to prevent that, and I don't know of any that are meant to be used in damp areas on a plaster/drywall base. (Plus, how would you go about sealing the stars without getting sealer on the rest of the ceiling? Do you really want a shiny ceiling?)</p>

<p>If you really want to do this, I'd suggest looking into a gilding size and sealer meant to be used outdoors. That'll get you the water-resistance you need in a bathroom, but you'll hit other issues, like possibly discoloring (or worse) the rest of the ceiling, and having to use a respirator to avoid breathing noxious fumes.</p>

","<h2>PROFESSIONAL VERSION</h2>

<p>Put on a pair of clean white cotton gloves.</p>

<p>Mount the drawing on an acid-free sheet of museum board with archival mounting tape. Prepare a beveled matt with an interior size 1-2 cm smaller than your paper. Attach the matt to the museum board with one strip of archival tape along the top edge. Place a piece of 5 mm thick plexiglas on the matt and tape to the museum board along the sides. Place the entire object in a thick plastic bag, fold down the opening several times while pressing out the air and tape shut with plastic packaging tape.</p>

<p>Then place the packaged drawing into a wooden shipping box with custom cut styrofoam spacers so that it cannot move. Put a sachet of silica gel under the museum board in a small space you have carved out of the foam. Put a foam sheet on top of the matt and close the box with screws. Using indelible marker (or hand-cut stencil for the authenticity) write <strong>FRAGILE GLASSWARE. HANDLE WITH CARE.</strong> on every side of the box. Label with the contents, attach shipping label and place in the loading bay for the (insured) delivery company to pick up.</p>

<h2>DIY CHEAP VERSION</h2>

<p>In an emergency I would use waxed paper like the kind used for baking to cover the sheet of paper. Fold it over the top, tape with removable masking tape to the back of the drawing.

<p>Is there a trick to sharpening small, hollow, round, steel things like this?</p>
","<p>The approach is the same. You remove metal from the outside of the periphery of the punch end, at an angle roughly the same as it was originally.</p>

<p>The contour of the round punch adjacent to the cutting edge looks rounded in your picture. This makes the edge stronger, but makes it trickier to get the sharpening angle right when using a flat stone. The punch won't get sharper unless you remove material right up to the opening, producing a keen edge.</p>

<p>You'll have to pick your sharpening angle (I'd start with 45-degrees) and stick with it until your grinding marks meet the opening. With something like this it's sensible to mount the punch in a drill or drill press and use the stone against the edge while it's rotating. Best results come from holding a consistent angle, which is easier when the drill or other rotating device is fixed to a bench or whatever, not hand-held. I suppose you could try holding the stone fixed and run a hand drill guided by hand, but avoid holding both in hand.</p>

<p>If you're brave and have a steady hand, you could try using the hand-held drill approach against a a bench grinder or belt sander instead of a stone. Only problem there is when things go wrong the go wrong quickly. Might be something to work up to once you've gotten a feel of how it works against a stone.</p>

It's going to be lighter than PVC of human size, but that doesn't mean it will be light. As it is constructed of cardboard, it would be easily painted white with matching lettering. If you wanted to hide the joints, fabric could be glued at the knees, elbows, etc, but you're going to have a challenge finding a skinny enough human torso to fit inside the typically-available Sonotube diameters.</p>

<p>You could use some sort of cording that runs from the knee joint through the thigh bone up through the torso to a shoulder support to help manage the weight. If you're using a healthy firefighter for the inner-human, it would not be too heavy, I believe.</p>

<p>The torso could be a suitably sized plastic rubbish bin, also painted white. If you plan to encase the human's head as well, a portion of a smaller cylindrical rubbish bin would also work. It's starting to look a bit like a lego character in my alleged mind.</p>

<p>The exterior of your casting may have some lines from both the wire framework and any seams in the vinyl/paper mache.  It might also have bits of vinyl or paper mache stuck to it unless you washed the interior of the mold with lubricant before adding the clay.  Those problems should all be pretty easy to fix with a little sand paper.</p>

<p>You see things like bamboo poles for fencing. You could split those with a knife fairly easily to get the lengthwise strips that you would need for this. Buying an entire fence seems excessive though. However for where and what it is used for it should be more than sufficient for what your are doing. </p>

"What writing utensils would work for concrete walls?","46","","<p>My boyfriend has concrete walls surrounding his at home office. He has expressed interest in using the walls as ""story boarding"" space for future mobile applications. <strong>I'm curious as to what writing utensil would be the very best option for clarity of penmanship on a concrete wall.</strong> Being able to be washed off after a period of time would be a bonus too. </p>
","<p>When dealing with a concrete surface, the first consideration is the smoothness of the surface. If that is acceptable, and of reasonably decent flatness, your options expand nicely. If it's a coarse surface with lots of pits, cracks and other irregularities, chalk may be the only answer. It's messy and washable, though.</p>

Can I use a suitably thick fusible interfacing instead? Will it make a difference in the final product how the interfacing was attached?</p>

<p>and for the bag not to flop over, as they are wont to do, hair canvas would be much more effective than normal interfacing (whether sewn in or fusible).  I've seen hair canvas used in tailored jackets (not the modern ""deconstructed"" kind) to give body to the shoulders, collar and lapels.</p>

<p>Here's how <a href=""http://www.pellonprojects.com/products/hc110-sew-in-hair-canvas/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pellon</a> describes it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sew-in Hair Canvas Interfacing is an excellent tailoring product. It is a woven interfacing that is suitable for garment construction where crisp detail or firm control is desired. Use with medium to heavyweight fabric.</p>

<p>When I was googling hair canvas I came across a <a href=""http://www.joann.com/fusible-woven-hair-canvas-22in-x-25-yards-natural/1069574.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">fusible kind</a> which, if Pellon is selling it, should work similarly to the sew-in kind.</p>

<p>If the shop where you live doesn't sell hair canvas, you could ask them what they can recommend as a substitute, showing them the sketch and photograph of the bag.  Basically, you need something appropriate for creating a crisp, tailored look.</p>

<hr>

<p>I recommend making a full lining even if the pattern doesn't call for that.  It's much nicer to rummage for some small object that's floating in the bottom of the bag if there's a nice, full, smooth lining.  </p>

<p>I take back what I said about fusing to the lining.  For this kind of bag the lining should be soft and flexible.</p>

<p>By the way, I believe fusible interfacing can in principle be sewn in.</p>

","<p>If you burn your clay your oven is too hot. So turn down the heat a bit.<br>
You can also put your creation into a box made from aluminium foil pans. This will protect it from direct heat.</p>

<p>Is there something you studied during the time you weren't showing work that has influenced your current work? Don't dwell on it, but do mention it.

<p>But how should I proceed in order to get a snowflake pattern, for instance, or other specific design using the above similar frosting technique? Is this possible?</p>
","<h2>TL/DR</h2>

<p>Use a sponge and cut it to shape.</p>

<hr>

<p>Loved an excuse for a quick experiment. So, the patterns in the video are made from an Epson salt solution with the following ingredients per the linked video.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>1/2 cup of hot/boiling water</li>
  <li>1/3 cup of Epson salts</li>
  <li>Teaspoon of dishwashing liquid</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried a few different techniques to make specific patterns. The basic idea is to control the amount of liquid applied. Too much and it will bleed and drip down.</p>

<h2>Napkin snowflake</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AxS0g.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AxS0g.png"" alt=""Napking snowflake""></a></p>

<p><sup>Picture taken after solution was applied</sup></p>

<p>So I wanted to try something that would hold liquid and not tear easily after it was cut. Most common napkins are frail so I used a heavier duty one. Any absorbent cloth would work but napkins are easier to come by. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nSavY.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nSavY.png"" alt=""Napkin on window""></a></p>

<p><sup>Tried to keep my face and dirty kitchen out of the picture. You don't need more detail to know it looks awful</sup></p>

<p>This didn't turn out quite good at all. It was hard to get the right amount of liquid applied and keep the detail. Only my first attempt mind you. Read onto sponge for and improved version of what I was trying for here. </p>

<h2>Sponge</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VXUL3.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VXUL3.png"" alt=""Sponge""></a></p>

<p>This is where I think you will get the most out of this project. This sponge I used for testing is perforated as you can see. I wanted to test fine details with this application. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bMmI3.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bMmI3.png"" alt=""Sponge on window ""></a></p>

<p><sup>Look at the detail!</sup></p>

<p>The level of detail retained from this application was next to perfect. I would highly recommend sponges for your application. You can pick some up cheap and cut them to shape. This will make it very easy to get applied control and maintain shape. </p>

<h2>Napkin ball</h2>

<p>I know you are likely looking for more detail oriented designs but for completness sake I wanted to make larger items so I just balled up a napkin to make a heart design. This way my wife should not get made when she sees what I have done to the kitchen windows.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/845WM.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/845WM.png"" alt=""Napkin ball on window""></a></p>

<p><sup> I jumped the gun for the photo but it did eventually fill out nice</sup></p>

<p>This worked as well as I would have hoped. The shape I made is what appeared on the window. It did bleed from the bottom so perhaps too much liquid was used. Easy to clean after the fact though with some water.</p>

<h1>Fingers</h1>

<p>Much like in the video using fingers would be a useful tool as well. In the video it is shown drawing after the solution was applied to the window. The difference with me is I used my finger to apply the solution to the window surface. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pmgm5.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pmgm5.png"" alt=""Fingers on window""></a></p>

<p>Expected results here as well. Design showed well except where some bleeding occurred. I made a happy face which ended up looking more like a horseshoe. Other pictures are a star, the characters A&amp;C and an isometric box (that is not in the picture at all).</p>

<hr>

<p>I recommend the sponge for sure because it helps with easy controlled application. Once you get a feel for the amount of liquid you can easily get the design you want without the salt solution creeping. </p>

  <p>epoxy seems like a reasonable choice</p>

<p>Epoxies are really versatile and can give very strong results. It would have been the first thing I considered as well. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>since there are some gaps of around 1mm width</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Likely not an issue but most glues need perfectly mated surfaces for good adhesion. There are expanding glues, like Gorrila Glue, but most? epoxies are not meant to fill gaps. As long as there are sufficiently mated surface area this would be a non issue. If you do end up gluing it thick ahead of how the project will be sitting as it dries. Epoxies and take several hours to cure. If something shifts during that time you might be stuck with it (Ha I made a pun)</p>

<p>I am glad to see you already took some precautionary thought when it came to temperate and toxicity. I would have asked other wise if you had concerns about food safety. Some epoxies are food safe once cured and most have varying temperature tolerances. Read your product documentation carefully. </p>

<p>Put the mug to be painted upside down on stick it on a plastic cup. Use the biggest, softest synthetic brush you can find and quickly brush downward in an even stroke from tape to tape.

"How should I select elastic for a sewing project?","41","","<p>I want to adapt a pair of pants to add elastic to the waistband. I have a particular ""stretchiness"" in mind for this project, but don't know how that relates to a given thickness, width, material, or other characteristic of any particular elastic product.</p>

<p>Is there any standardized terminology for relative stretchiness that I could use when talking to a sales assistant? Are there better ways to choose what elastic to use for a project than standing in the store and pulling on samples to guess how well they would work?</p>

<p>I'm looking for general advice rather than ""here's what's best for your pants"" -- because this does come up in multiple projects :)</p>
","<p>This is commonly called the ""stretch percentage"" or ""stretch factor"". The name comes from how much percent of the original width/length the material can stretch. For example, if you can stretch a 4"" piece of elastic to 6"" long, the stretch percentage would be 50%.</p>

<p>Here's a simple visualization from <a href=""http://www.patternsforpirates.com/peg-leg-101/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Patterns for Pirates</a>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TBpfW.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TBpfW.jpg"" alt=""Stretch percentage diagram""></a></p>

<p>As a side note, some patterns come with a ""stretch gauge"", instead of telling you a stretch percentage. It's usually printed on the back of the envelope so you can easily measure your fabric against it:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C3Zt4.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C3Zt4.jpg"" alt=""Stretch gauge example""></a></p>

<p>What elastic to use really depends on your particular application! A thicker or wider elastic may be more sturdy but less comfortable, for instance. As a general rule, thicker elastics seem to be less stretchy - but it's a very general rule. If you know the measurements you want for the finished pants, you can come up with the required stretch percentage: <code>(fabric width / fitted width - 1)</code> and bring that gauge to the store to find which ones are suitably stretchy.</p>

"Sequins and pop rivets","41","","<p>I am a sequin naïf.<br>
Sewing sequins on one at a time is laborious.  I see that one can use glue but I am sure the sequins shed like mad.</p>

<p>Can one use a pop rivet gun to attach sequins?  Are there special tiny rivets?  </p>
","<p>Sequins are wonderful and magical, but do take a lot of time to attach by hand one-by-one.  </p>

<p><em>Gluing</em> is not a great option, but can be a good quick fix.  One problem with glue is unless you are surgical in your technique, the glue can get on the front of the sequin and make it cloudy.  </p>

<p>Another watch-out with glue is that the glue tends to be stronger than the sequin, and unlike using thread where the sequin can adjust to pressure, the glue holds the sequin firmly in place which means it can be easily crushed or broken.</p>

<p>It is possible to attach sequins with a <em>sewing machine</em> (see No. 10 method of attaching sequins in the link below), but that method also requires some precision and attention to detail, and it's debatable whether it is really faster than sewing by hand.</p>

<p>It is also possible to attach sequins with a very small <em>crochet hook</em> (Method 7).  Once you get the hang of this method it might be pretty fast, but I have never tried it.</p>

<p>The answer to your question about <em>rivets</em> is, ""probably no.""  Rivets would have one of the same problems as glue - a rivet will be stronger than the sequin, the rivet will hold, but the sequin will break.  The hand-sewing equivalent to a rivet is the bead.  Instead of bringing your needle up through the center of the sequin and down over the edge of the sequin, you wrap the thread over the edge of the bead and back down through the hole in the sequin.  </p>

<p>The <em>bead</em> technique (Method 5) has the benefits of not having the thread showing on the sequin, not holding the sequin so tight that it breaks, and a clear bead can add even more shine while a colored bead can add interesting color effects.</p>

<p>You don't say what you are attaching the sequins to.  If it's decorative art that will be looked at or displayed but not worn or handled too much, the glue might work as long as you apply the tiniest amount it takes to attach the sequin, and being sure not to get any glue on the front of the sequin. But even in this case, the glue will hold the sequin in place and can reduce some of the shimmer that comes from the sequin moving and sifting.  </p>

<p>For decorative art, a rivet might work, you might come up with some cool ""rivet"" ideas, e.g., maybe modifying a clear plastic ""bead and string"" gun like those used to attach price tags to clothing.</p>

<p>It is possible to buy ""strings"" of sequins (Method 9 in the link), but they don't look as nice as the individually-applied sequins do.  That might be an option though if time is your biggest concern.</p>

"What criteria should I consider for choosing paper for watercolor pencils","41","","<p>I have been researching about the types of paper that are well suited for watercolor pencils. But so far, I've come across hot, cold, and rough pressed paper. I'm not entirely sure if these are the only options and how they're different from each other.</p>

<p>What are some factors to consider when choosing paper? With some paper I've used  the paper wet and when I draw over it with a watercolor pencil it pills severely (or would that happen with any watercolor paper?). I would rather not have that quality in a paper. </p>

<p>Is there paper that provides tooth for detail, but that also accepts water and layers of color well enough to not pill. What are my options?</p>
","<p>One of the first things you’ll want to remember is that you should always be using archival quality <strong>acid-free</strong> paper. Also, the heavier the paper, the less the paper will wrinkle when wet. In fact, after about 2mm of thickness one will generally be speaking of board, not paper.</p>

<p>Hot pressed papers (and boards) are smoother than cold pressed, and although there are many pulp options, you should really consider 100% cotton rag. Don’t try and be a hero saving the environment - use virgin non-recycled materials.</p>

<p>Many artists attach their watercolor paper to a wooden board with masking tape along all the edges. This prevents the paper from curling too much, however I never liked the fact that the tape generally rips off the top surface of the paper. That’s why I spread acid-free bookbinder’s PVA glue across the back of 350g cold-pressed paper and bond to the smooth side of a sheet of Masonite (HDF) reinforced with a wooden struts, all of which is later used as a backing plate to attach the frame.</p>

<p>My advice specifically for your use case is to use the pencils only when the paper is dry - otherwise you really run the risk of damaging the surface. That and to start using a brush.</p>

<p>I've found they're working wonderfully for carving plaster. </p>

<p>Or, <em>were</em>. Now, the edges seem to be a but more blunt and taking too much pressure to remove material. I can't apply more pressure at this point, because my details are too small. </p>

<p>Is there an easy way, or any way, to sharpen these?</p>
","<p>This answer is not based on first-hand knowledge of sharpening wire loops, but is based on extrapolating what works for paint scrapers.  </p>

<p>Many years ago while performing one of those early-marriage projects that required the removal of paint from second-hand furniture, I decided that my scraper blade needed to be replaced.  Ran over to the local hardware store and the knowledgeable clerk informed me that I did not need a new blade - just sharpen it - doh, really? how?</p>

<p>He proceeded to demonstrate and after thirty seconds and two swipes of a file to the cutting edge I went home.  I still have the scraper and blade, though it's much reduced in size.</p>

<p>I would take the same approach with these flat wire loops and use a file to restore the edge.  A few firm swipes should produce a nice edge.  It might also be possible to treat the edges the same way you would sharpen a pocket knife with a whetstone or with a small hand-held stone. It might be a bit tricky on the curved parts, but I think any artisan could handle a file to create a curved edge.</p>

"When working in a visual medium, how do I avoid incorrect color?","38","","<p>Sometimes, when working on a drawing or painting at home, the final result will look incorrect when shown outside or in different light. How can I ensure color correctness when working on my art?</p>
","<p>As photographers know, the color of light is usually <strong><em>not</em></strong> white, and when working in your home, you're often working under tungsten bulbs (or similar) which have a warm tone to the light or with fluorescent which have a green cast. Because your brain is pretty good at making what you think should be white look like white, these lights can cause your eyes to see the colors differently and, as a result, change the way you mix or blend in your work.</p>

<p>As with photography, we can control the light we use and select for what our eyes naturally tend to, which is daylight. Where possible, you should light your work with dedicated lamps using daylight balanced light bulbs with a color temperature in and around 5500K. The packaging should specify the color temperature, which is more reliable than if it merely says daylight on the package, so avoid those that don't or that claim a temperature way off that number. </p>

<p>I really recommend getting some decent swing-arm desk lamps and LED bulbs. Not only are these lamps cheaper, but they're usually a lot brighter and much easier to position, especially with easels. LEDs are really efficient and they don't heat you up when working in close quarters, making for a more comfortable experience.</p>

"Appropriate tool for measuring longer warps","37","","<p>What's the <em>best</em> method for measuring out a three meter plus warp? I do make felt from my tail trimmings but I prefer to keep wool wastage to a minimum 
On this occasion I'm doing a single colour warp with 160 pieces of wool. Tabby weaving on a ridged heddle.</p>

<p>For roughly 2m or shorter  I just use the back stick and a peg. Some of my concerns for using that method over a longer length is keeping the tension the same across each strand and I will have to take my loom to an art space to have enough space. I've used a mill once for an 8 shaft but i didn't like how little number you can put on. Would a board with custom length pegs be my best option?</p>
","<p>Any time you dress your loom (put the warp threads on) via the indirect warping method (measure out your warp via a warping mill or board), you don't need to measure out all your warp threads together. If you are doing a project with 160 ends, you can use a warping mill or board to measure out two groups of 80 ends each, and put them on the loom one at a time. Here is a link to a YouTube video that shows a good way to store warp until you are ready to put it on your loom: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ1qNeSYBxs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ1qNeSYBxs</a> (You can also go to your favorite search engine and search for ""how to warp chain"" and find similar resources.)</p>

<p>A custom made warping board with extra long pegs sounds like it would be a great thing to have, but if you already have a mill or board, measuring out your warp in smaller groups is one way to make do.</p>

"What should I consider when making homemade steam distillation equipment?","37","","<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>I found myself on a wonderful Wikipedia ramble at work the other day, and stumbled across a method for extracting essential oils from plant matter called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_distillation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">steam distillation</a>.</p>

<p>As there is a lot of bog myrtle (among other things) around at the moment, and I love the smell, I was up for trying this method out. However the only store bought equipment I can find is over £150.</p>

<p>Now looking at the diagrams included in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_distillation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia link</a>, it doesn't look there's anywhere near £150 worth of equipment there. So, I am thinking about constructing my own, as it doesn't look too complicated.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<p>Is this harder than it looks to construct? Has anyone got any previous experience of this that could offer tips? 
Where would be the best place to source the parts for this?</p>
","<p>Steam distillation is used to convert catnip leaves to concentrated catnip oil. There is an <a href=""https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Kitty-Crack%253a--ultra-potent-catnip-extract/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Instructable</a> that I've followed in the past to make what they call kitty crack.</p>

<p>It's relatively simple, at least the distillation portion. The leaves are placed in a container on a heat source and water is added. The collection is boiled and the vapor containing water and oil condenses on an inverted lid over the container. Gravity pulls the condensate to the center where it drips into a smaller container on a stand in the middle of the concoction.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bysBQ.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bysBQ.jpg"" alt=""kitty crack distillation image""></a></p>

<p>It's using ordinary household materials, including loads of ice! I've forgotten how many times I had to refill the inverted lid due to the heat transfer.</p>

<p>The chemical aspects of the catnip process will be different from your selected herbs, I'm sure and I can't advise that portion, but I suspect you have a few leads for processing the condensate.</p>

<p>I processed about a pound of catnip leaves and recovered a couple grams of concentrated kitty crack, which seems tiny, but they were dry leaves. Your herbs will probably have more oil than dry catnip. Running the same batch of leaves about five times means each sequence will be more water, less oil, but ensures maximum recovery.</p>

<p>I dumped the leaf mush in the yard in view of the security cameras. There was enough catnip remaining in the mush to attract more than a few local felines for a stoner session.</p>

"Tungsten Carbide Ring Sizing","34","","<p>This probably isnt even the proper area of StackExchange to ask this, but I looked at some of the questions and seemed like it would at least be passable. If this is not the correct area, please refer me to a better one where this question could receive a proper answer.</p>

<p>I was at a jewelry store earlier today looking for engagement rings, and they sized me at a 7. However, they also told me that if I planned on buying a tungsten ring, which I am very interested in, that I would need to buy a size smaller, or at least a half a size smaller, <em>because tungsten rings don't fit the same as normal rings</em>. However, after looking online, I came to the realization that tungsten rings simply don't come that small. The smallest I found was a 7, but according to the jewelers who sized me, this would not actually fit.</p>

<p><strong>My question is, are the jewelers correct? If I'm a size 7 would I need to get a 6 or a 6.5 tungsten ring?</strong></p>
","<p>According to a site that specializes in Tungsten rings, they corroborate the jeweler's story and <a href=""https://www.tungstenaffinity.com/Tungsten-Ring-Buying-Guide-a/278.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">provide an explanation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The size you are given is the size you would wear in a traditional fit ring. A traditional fit ring is flat across the inside of the band. Both Tungsten and Ceramic bands have a comfort fit inner band. All Tungsten Affinity rings have the comfort fit feature. Comfort fit bands are domed on the inside with the tightest point being the center of the ring gradually expanding in size towards the edges. *IMPORTANT Comfort fit tungsten rings generally fit 1/2 size larger than traditional bands. We recommend you order a 1/2 size smaller than the size you were given at the jewelry store. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, yes, you will probably want to go with a half size smaller than your measured size. Though, I think you need to look a bit more. That same site that I found the explanation on seems to sell rings as small as a size 4. I'm not endorsing them as a company - they merely had the information I needed and, while there, I decided to see what their sizing looked like. They seem to be emphasizing that these rings are appropriate for both genders, not only men (who have been the traditional owners of these rings), so it makes sense that they would offer ""extended"" sizes as women's fingers <em>on average</em> are smaller in diameter. </p>

<p>Please note, as Tungsten can not be resized, you should be sure to find a seller with a liberal return policy in case the size you purchase is not good for you. Particularly if you're considering a wider band, you <em>may</em> need to go back up a half size to accommodate that. You haven't noted your gender so I'm not sure what sort of sizing ring they used. From that same page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The second part to sizing is the band width. Band widths are measured in millimeters (MM) and for tungsten bands generally range from 4mm to 10mm. The width of the band will effect the how a particular size fits. The wider the band the tighter the ring will fit, whereas the more narrow the band the looser the fit. When sized at the jewelery store women are sized for more narrow bands, so our standard women's width is 6mm. Men are sized at a slightly wider 8mm band width.</p>

<p>Congratulations and I hope you are able to find a ring that works for you.</p>

The area of the bottom is 8""x4"", and it has 4 legs. I will use circuit board standoffs(spacers) as the legs. The height of each leg will be between 30mm ~ 50mm. I need to add weight to the bottom of each leg separately to make the bottom heavier. I was thinking about using coins, but would like to know other alternatives that are better and look nicer,</p>

<p>My question:
How to add weight to the bottom of each leg so the bottom is heavier? (I don't want to add a second layer of an acrylic board to the bottom of the legs. )</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for sharing your ideas. :)</p>
","<p>For your purposes, one can expect that more weight, as low as possible, will accomplish your objective. With circuit board standoffs, you have a threaded hole at one end and a threaded stud at the other. This provides for easily attached weights in various forms.</p>

<p>You've considered coins, which if chosen successfully, can be attractive. Think various sizes of coins from countries around the world, with holes drilled to accept the bolt you'll use to attach to the standoff. </p>

<p>US coins are somewhat lightweight and poorly suited for such a project, in my opinion. Masses composed of lead will provide the best weight per volume but lead has its own complications. It's not dangerous to handle but there are some health considerations. I have a cupcake tin that I use to make lead ingots, about 80 mm in diameter and 30 mm thick, probably too large for your purpose. I then dipped them in a product called <a href=""https://plastidip.com/our-products/plasti-dip/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PlastiDip</a> which is also available in spray form. </p>

<p>If this is attractive to you, it's a matter of picking a suitable mold (silicone molds can work) and finding someone to pour. Fishermen will frequently create their own sinkers and avid weapons owners will cast their own rounds, providing at least two resources for you.</p>

<p>If lead doesn't cut it, steel would be the next available option. Steel washers, both stainless and galvanized forms are available at big box stores and mom-and-pop hardware stores as well. Pick a size for your taste and aim for either the hole size to match the thread size of the hole, or match the hole size to the outside diameter of your stand-off.</p>

<p>Even with the possibly-unsightly washer option, you can still apply PlastiDip spray to provide a colorful rubber coating for surface protection and cosmetic appeal.</p>

","<p>I do agree with needing a layer of something on the inside of the lens cap.<br>
But it needs to be rather firm, not squizy or easily distorted. Most foams would just not do the job.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can get hold of professional packaging foams that are smooth and rather sturdy on the surface and allow compression from the top (when the sheet lays flat on the table.) Those would do the job if you can get the edge to sit wider than the outside of the filter.</p>

<p>In my view easier is using sticky tape on the inside rim of the filter. You can add that one layer at a time and cut to the right dimensions, so not sticking out of the cap, when you have enough layers.<br>
Many kinds of sticky tape will do, I would go for the paper kind that people use when painting the house, which is crepe like in structure.
It gives a better hold than most of the plastic tapes and it is kinder, as in not scratching the outside of the filter.</p>

<p>Whatever tape you use, add one layer at a time and test between adding.
Make sure you take away any glue that may be pushed out from under or between the layers of tape.</p>

<p>If you find you need several layers and having added them one at a time made the thing untidy, take all out and apply the number of layers you ended up using. Specially overlap or gaps where the layer meets going round it likely to mesh up tidy fit.<br>
You might find it easier to stick a layer or a few layers of tape on the outer ring of the filter. </p>

<p>The easier option is to go to a camera shop and get a new lens cap from them, which has worked several times for me. For use of filters and for lost lenscaps.</p>

","<p>As I recall there are grades of microcrystalline wax available in different hardnesses and melting temperatures, so do try others.</p>

<p>I have always used a moldable base to support detailed work. Pitch mixed with Plaster of Paris is the old reliable method. This can be softened with a propane torch, the work pressed in, and upon cooling - you have firm support and if you slip, the pitch won't damage your tools. It's also black which provides strong visual contrast so you can see what you're cutting. If need be you can cut away the pitch in areas where it's in the way. Use chisels for this, a rotary burr will gum up unless you're using a coarse tooth at low speed.</p>

<p>Bees wax is used similarly either pure or mixed with stiffeners like plaster or diatomaceous earth. Plasticine works on some jobs, but vibrations from rotary tools tends to loosen the fit more than beeswax or pitch.</p>

"Can Rustoleum wood stain bleed through a mounted photograph?","11","","<p>On a piece of pine wood, I want to mount a photograph. I stained the wood with Rustoleum cherry stain. It’s dry now and I am ready to mount the photograph. Do I need to put a layer of paper or lacquer down before the photo? It just occurred to me that the stain may bleed through the picture.  I was just going to adhere the picture and lacquer over the whole thing.</p>

<p>Also, would it be better to use Mod Podge or a spray lacquer to protect the wood and picture? It is going to have a bottle opener attached.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>Depending on the type of paper (and more importantly the type of glue you use) the stain will probably attack the paper over a long period of time.</p>

<p>Isolating the stain is a good idea, and I can recommend the following approach. </p>

<ol>
<li>First give it a solvent-based coat of transparent varnish. This will protect the stain from the outside world and because of its similar composition will bond to it rather well. Let dry. </li>
<li>Now give it a water-based coat of transparent varnish, this will enable it to bond with the next two layers. Let dry.</li>
<li>Now use another coat of the water-based varnish and float the photo paper on it. Let dry</li>
<li>Use one last coat of water-based transparent varnish to encapsulate the photo.</li>
</ol>

<p>A couple words of warning: test the water-based varnish to make sure that it doesn’t damage your photo, watch out for bubbles and always ventilate! </p>
